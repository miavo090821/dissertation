    "text": "Before getting to my criticisms I'd like to preface what I'm about to say by saying that I really love a lot of the stuff you guys put out and I want to be as good faith as possible. That being said I vehemently disagree with your perspective on China. While it is true China represents a progressive force in many aspects, especially in how it challenges western economic hegemony, and has vastly improved the lives of hundreds of millions the CPC is not a force for socialism. One of the most obvious examples of this truth is labour relations. The removal of the right to strike from the constitution during the liberal economic reforms is symbolic of a wider trend of siding with domestic capitalists over workers. This isn't a conspiracy either ACFTU openly talks about opposing strikes on the basis that it would harm domestic capitalists, often justifying their actions by appealing to nationalism. Not only is there no recognition of non-CPC affiliated worker's organizations, state power is regularly utilized to crush wildcat strikes and independent worker movements. Their lack of commitment to socialism is also visible in hong kong where they actively support parties that are economically conservative by even western standards. Given that many MLs speak positively of similarly mangled top-down \"workers\" organizations like the AFL-CIO its possible that the origin of this disagreement goes all the way down to the fundamental differences between the Anarchist and ML perspectives and I stand no chance of convincing you. That being said I hope you get around to responding, and keep up the good work comrade!",

There definitely is SOME worker representation in China, but the unions act more as mediators rather than advocates. Much like US trade unions they facilitate some minimum level of representation, but ultimately stifle any more radical tactics.\n\nI find your description of the fall of communist Poland very strange. The collapse of Poland was caused by a failing economy and labor unrest that predates solidarity. The idea that Poland wouldn't of collapsed anyway if they had suppressed independent workers movements seems laughable to me. The fact that you think the party should suppress what was the will of the vast majority of workers is concerning.\n\nMLs in one breath will denounce the AFL-ICO, and then in the next advocate entryism.",

A lot of times isolated incidents of “worker suppression” are often blown up by Western media to promote a narrative about China. Labour regulations in China aren’t hegemonic, and vary by region. Statistically Chinese workers actually go on strike more than any other country, Google it! I would check out Michael Hudson’s recent work on a China if you want to know more about their economic plans. Xi Xingping and Deng have also written books with daily detailed plans for the country, and the goal remains to build “socialism with Chinese characteristics”. It sometimes seems like some leftists are rooting against China reaching this goal. We choose to remain critical, but in strong support of the goal of building socialism.",

Just that the nature of the state is that certain interest groups must be appeased in order for state power to be maintained, and if the working class doesn't continue to engage in class struggle the state will lose the pressure to balance the needs for workers. Because of this viewing the CPC as the revolutionary agent in China seems wrong to me. When analyzing internal conflicts within countries whose government calls itself socialist I find MLs quick to criticize popular movements. I've remember getting into similar arguments when MLs I knew who were turned on FSTMB, COB, and other popular Bolivian organizations  when the criticized MAS",
