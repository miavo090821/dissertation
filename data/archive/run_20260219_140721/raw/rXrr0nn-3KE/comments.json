And Leftist spaces without a Fanonian/ Marxist/anti-capitalist/Imperialist / womanist/black abolitionist feminist lens- then it’s not a left position at this point of later stage capitalism.\n\nThere is a lot of conservative type of gatekeeping of Blackness masquerading in Black Leftist intellectual spaces. How many working class black leftist do we see on Cornbreadtube? How many people are talking about working class issues of rent/housing crisis, redlining? Healthcare? We DO need education and engagement with political issues! We need more views that have ideological differences, political differences. That’s what the Panthers did- and we have the platforms to reach more people. \n\nWe need commentators to teach media literacy. To teach legal issues. And we need to reach out to our elders to see how they lived  through different eras- and learn from them. We need more intergenerational conversations surrounding Black Liberation practices and politics.",

I appreciate y’all for talking about this it’s a conversation that needs to be had by everyone in this space.

So when they/you show other sides, they lash out because now they feel like they aren't able to \"contribute\" in their normal fashion. \n\nAdditionally, nuance *is* harder to have when you're not in the trenches of doing something. For example, how do you know what a stranger on the internet should do re accountability if you haven't tried to go through the process with someone you want to have a relationship (any type) with irl? Shits HARD \n\n\nEither way, great episode and shout out to Foreign for directing me to this page!",

At this point in time being a journalist seems like a great idea because there is more of an opportunity to have your voice heard. However, not such a great time because we as creators have not come up with a way to monetize said voice.   Black people have always had to work outside of the established system to “thrive” no matter the industry and then as soon as we become successful, we end up being purchased by the established system and then we kinda go back to square one. It sucks that to be a thriving black person, you have to carry sooooo much on your shoulders. And i know that we have the ability to imagine something different and better but it seems we never have the necessary means to achieve it. So, bless you all and the work that you do.",

When yt switch to an AI algorithm program that was supposed to be more tailored to the user, all the black creators I subbed to were deleted from my favs. I had to go back and re-sub to all of my favs because the system unsuded me. \n\nOn a Demon Mama live stream the other night we watched a video about this, I think the creator was let it cook, but I mentioned this in my comments and there were so many other wt leftist who said the same thing happened to them. This is just a heads up. \n\nAlso conscious lee is one of the few creators that talks about disability and as a disabled person that means the world to me but there is definitely a void of disabled black creators in this space, or even people that talk about ableism. \n\nThis was a great discussion and I learned a lot. So thankful to you and the panel.",

That's the overall issue.\"//\n\nAs I watch two things occur;\n\n1) Black Folks DO respond to trauma with humor.  This was epitomized with Richard Pryor who was able to STILL show his anger while making people laugh.   \n2) On just the human side, we should not ignore John Stewart and Fox News using humor.  Humor is a secret weapon that both Roger Ailes and Stewart understand.  Information with a dopamine spike gets across better.  This is also part of why (that a$$hole) Trump won in 2020, humor ingratiates.  \n\nThe Black Channels that lead with slang (\"its ya Boy, its ya Girl\") ARE trying to ingratiate themselves at the risk of not being taken seriously, while cold hard journalism is resisted.  Reminds me of Chuck D and Flavor Flav and how Chuck understood (at the time) that part of Flavors' role was to draw people in SO they would get the message as much as possible.  \n\nDoes it work?  Sometimes...I'd much rather watch FD or Olay than someone who's only got jokes, but I'm not sure  the general public WANTS that...unfortunately.  Most hardcore, accurate and QUALITY News, even amongst White Folks (Democracy Now for example) isn't exactly popular either though...\n\nBlack Folks NEED real news more than anybody.  That's the overall issue.",

    "text": "I really appreciate the content you and your colleagues provide. These discussions are very important and I think provide context to how you all move in social media. One thing that stood out to me is that you all want black people to live on a spectrum, so I would love to see you all bring on a more conservative or liberal blacks. Not Candace Owens lol but more centrist, it doesn’t have to be a debate but just a discussion on prospectives and ideas just like this show. It may not be this platform since it’s more of a round table of like minded individuals, discussing general black ideas/issues, but I think there room for your channels to grow if you all reach out to people who don’t totally agree with you. Again thanks for the great content.",

Black content can cover all topics, but when I click on your video I do it to hear your take on whatever topic. I understand that there is incentive to having a big audience and spreading the messages. At the same time when most black people come to YouTube we are looking for the opinions of the ppl we are subscribed to not so much the subject matter. So by being authentic, well read , and open-minded your audience will grow in time. You may not see the number roll in from the start but you will have a more profound impact then other creators. The best way to achieve any goals is slow and steady. \n\nThank you for uploading content it is truly amazing to see and ingest.",

    "text": "I think the point that WASN'T discussed was the difference between \"black-OWNED\" media &    \"black TARGETED\" media.\n     These gossips sites are the latter,and after almost 2 hours of conversation NO ONE brought up Black Star Network which is BLACK OWNED.\n      I guess this is a conversation NOT for my age group (53) but what I see is that some of us as black people prefer to be entertained while relying on someone to tell us who/what's important.\n     You can can millions who can recite cĥapter & verse of the Katt Williams interview & STILL believe the government gave out crack pipes.\n      It's like we have a built in excuse for ignorance while also demanding excellence but when we get it we want it the way we want it.\n     I think the broader conversation needs to be had but again my issue is that you didn't bring up or talk to somebody has been doing the very thing you guys say is missing.",
