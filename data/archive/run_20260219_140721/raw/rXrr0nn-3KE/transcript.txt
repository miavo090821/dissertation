Char man should not be in the position where he has to be the poster child I don't want to be a black person pontificating on a hill about black people to a bunch of white people Candace Owens all them other black Talking Heads that the weather of the twins they don't have black audiences they have white audiences I don't think people actually expect to get news from black people like it has to be news with a laugh on the side a lot of us have become lost in the sauce with conflating being intellectual with being a contrarian with black people in media since the Inception of um mainstream media we have been limited and how our stories have been [Music] told okay you know what the shade room say about Haitians don't you what they say Rebeca ready to fight look what they say I'm a South Florida Haitian at that what's up what's what they say no that's that's honestly place to start the shade room is probably a good place to start because I think it's the start you feel me I think it got to be the start because they they they have figured out a way to make themselves seem always already cool and like they got good intentions but they really push some misinformation and we always know based off of how they write about political issues or how they start talking about gender and sexuality they be really like engagement for it absolutely shout hold let we gotta let forign start forign just dropped a video about them last week yes yeah just just last week I mean I touch on that and I disguised it as conservative propaganda and and you know you got a trojan horse your way in because the white people they click on black conservatives but the black people could cook on shade room so what I've what I've discovered about the I just tried to figure it out I'm just like what is it about us that when we congregate online it got to be like this why does it have to be package in this way why we have to come with this much amount of heat for the homophobia when it comes to anything pertaining to um anything outside of the cannon of what Society needs to look like Blackness for some reason is surrounding it in the in the taint in the gch of of the discourse like you're talking about where the sweat settles that's what they talking about like they they just circleing the of it and I realized that it it it's not only us like so first off right off the bat we got to acknowledge the fact that journalism in general is in the pits this is not the Walter kronite era and and the fact of the matter is that as journalism has taken a nose dive New York Times even the best of journalists BBC all of them taking a nose dive the black representation and black journalism will always get it worse as we do with any brunt of any type of social phenomena that's taken a downfall we will get it the worse because of the fact that we have historical oppression and subjugation on our side to make it worse so it's can take if Fox News is [ __ ] you can only imagine what the Black Fox News could look like and that's a yeah yeah and I guess that's I'm I'm trying to figure out why these things are so popular amongst us right because we we do have sometimes they get I feel like there's a rising conversation of people talking about the state of black media with it being that the shade rooms the Hollywood unlocks the spiritual word these being places that people are going rather than journalists or news outlets or like informed informed or political commentators they want to get their politics and serious and sociocultural information from these blog and sites that are literally and we and I'm wondering why why that is because we have the Essences we have places but when you look they're not being supported in finance in the same way they're not getting a fraction of of that kind of Engagement or money and so why there's a I think there shout out to fasir is it fasir I don't know how to say his name yeah that's how you say uh who who you know I had been hearing about afro pessimism a little bit just dabbling and you know being an intellectual but I had never really dived into it I still Ain dive into it a lot but he gave me like a good primer that really made sense of a lot of things I was trying to figure out with like our representation and specifically the way these social media sites are able to manipulate us so effectively and our lack of counter products um and uh there's a fan Cote that I just looked up because I I could remember where the [ __ ] it came from um where he's like the oppressed will always believe the worst about themselves yes and that I think is a key ingredient to how this all works because I just finished recording the video come out probably early next week for bsides where I'm talking about Joe Button interviewing Candace Owens and and I have to get into a little bit like I'm a little frustrated that like some people looked at a picture of Joe Button and Candace Owens that said black man always be chilling for the Republican party and it's like y'all he he next to cace Owens don't got isue in the moment she's right there but but it's it's indicative of like reflexively when we see Negroes acting a donkey that's like a natural like yeah that's what we do and when we see when we see our content not to put a too hop on a pedestal we get labeled as um intellectuals and anomalies and outliers we can't be representative of the same community and it's because these media companies and as a well it's because our PT post- traumatic slave syndrome whatever Buzz words you want to call it the way Blackness feels and thinks in this country and and worldwide is more ready to accept nonsense from the shade room than it would be if it was the uh exact opposite you know what I'm saying and that to me is what it comes down to is that consuming negative images of Blackness is natural in this country it is what we do it is who we are according to our history and the history of how media has depicted us and like that's hard to fight you know on the individual level but I think I think I think I think forign says something important though I feel like it's something to be unpackaged about how that trojan horse come in and how a lot of black media is really served to us under the guys of entertainment to me I think the presence of black media is a double-edged sword we can acknowledge that the reason why we got this [ __ ] is because the way that mainstream media used to depict black people was very you know what I'm saying insatiable factious bad anti-black parasitic and we can acknowledge that even the black mainstream Medias did their way of showing the black experience by usually just showing like the more upper class more famous more rich and I think that's the reason why a lot of the old school black Medias and fell off you feel me but I think the double Ed sword is because that we already exist outside of like the the normalized way of perception and how we usually being perceived I think we tend to fall for [ __ ] on how we perceive because we already are I feel like divorcing ourselves from like the the legitimization like the the way that mainstream media legitimize this particular narratives because we feel like the narrative is always anti- us so then when you mix that little FD I'm saying with pan said it's like yeah to me those black a lot of these black blog sites usually serve a way for us to believe the most [ __ ] up things about ourselves under the guise of entertainment so I you know I'm a journalist I have two degrees in journalism and um I know I graduated from the number one HBCU in the nation shouts out to FAMU um but I say that to say the way that we were taught journalism I went to a black University the way that I was taught journalism it's it's I'm interesting you say that conscious because even in the teaching right the way that I um in digital media I would have never been taught to do it the way that I do it now there's we have more of a a choice and what we want to cover how we want to cover it we will give you the facts of course and then we will have conversations about it uh we will talk about the truths as it as it pertains to black people having the conversation which is I love that that that's where we are now but there is so much with this misinformation that does come on these quick sites that the shade room people will go there to get news I'm not going to lie sometimes that's where I go get the that's why I'll see the headline but their headline be wrong too where I have to go online and actually read through the story and get my information like like that um people don't just read the headline and you see in the comments sections instantly which the shade room is a blog site but they like to act like they're the first place to get news that meanwhile it's just a it's just the comment section Twitter coming over to this comment section in in the shade room and they they'll just have all this misinformation nobody goes to do any research because the way that we're given this media and it sucks for black people it really does because the way that we're giving the the the any type of news they're going to be okay with just reading that going on and having these really where it should be really important conversations going on and giving you nothing literally not trying not trying to have a conversation not trying to push nothing the shade room will post a story and never follow up on it never come back and follow up on it this is not the way media is done so I say that to say as a journalist I love where we at now we're like in New Media we're in digital we can have these conversations we can have a feeling and an emotion we can still give the truths we can still give the facts we can still give the stats but we can still have a feeling as black people who are covering black news that may be real close to each and every one of us as black people so I like that that's where we are but I feel like the process we have gone so people are removing the like hey we still got a process here in how we should be giving the news we can't be just giving misinformation we should be using words like alleged we should be attributing where where we're getting this information from but now it's just out there like nobody's business they just people taking credit for Stuff um the misinformation is so bad that I will watch black people argue about something and be so strong and wrong it be your own family members at the kitchen table it's just that's where we're at with it now and that's the thing is I don't think it's misinformation it's a lie it's misinformation factually but I don't think it's Mis misinformation so much as it is a particular school of thought being pushed like we have this tendency to look at these black blogs or BL black companies and see them as like ignorant you know what I mean like these are or or like these are small like this is couple of black people that we know that have a couple of regressive views and don't realize blah blah blah but no these are black companies corporations and people who are pedling a specific thought a collective thought right like I think sometimes we look at it it's like it's like how around election time people that feel like they're losing messaging on the election stuff but it's no it's it's the fact that politics and news and entertainment are one one and the same in our current in our current world we living like across the board right which is why people like outrage Big disengagement B everybody is kind of pivoted to that and so it's like all year you see all of these these new news outlets or these blogs and whatever pushing like literal conservative thought it's not like a coincidence why those kind of politicians can do well with oh even black people that you see on like the shade room or whatever have you it's because they're all year being pushed that kind of thought like they're views on on the LGBT community their views on women their views on this all these different things so it's not that they're pushing misinformation or that like they don't have access or they don't know that there's another side they are col they are making actual determinations to push this kind of right-wing agenda I think from a lot of these corporations as far as individuals that are prominent in in Black media that might that might be you know some Nuance to that on a case- by case basis but I think like the shade rooms in them Hollywood un like the shade room I think a baller alert uh and all the other different places that people have the nerve to look to like no jum had to separate they had to have they had to create a separate channel for politics um and and it's called poly alert now I can't lie PA baller alert does a better job in following up on Stories the baller alert itself but they also push like you said there's an agenda there's a certain type of information that they're going to constantly put out and some of it can be very hurtful to Marg we're already a marginalized Community but that's thought that they think that all black people have about you know the lgbtqia plus Community about different people from different regions because black people are not a monolith but they try to make it that way but on their poly alert page you'll see them follow along with a lot of day-to-day in politics at the white house different things but even what they post there is uh you know they they choose different things as well there but I even there you will see all the people on PO alert they won't they won't go and have those those kind of conversations on poly alert it'll be like five comments sometimes and I'm just uh um you know playing around with the numbers but as opposed to the millions of comments that they'll put um on a picture of um what's that girl name um the one that keep going with the man that's in jail with the baby on the road I don't know but um yeah cran like like they won't they won't go and figure out what the hell is going to be going on today what Trump just said what who's being elected they won't go on poly alert but they'll be under um they'll wait for a a just a little bit of a headline that doesn't even really tell the story and they'll go have that conversation in the ball section yeah but I you know what I'll say is like y'all all do like content right I'm someone who's a viewer and so for me it's also remembering something that conscious Lee said which is like how it's a trojan horse because they didn't start off as a news Outlet right so the whole point of the infrastructure what they built was based on entertainment and now that they've built this captive audience people push like you have all these people how do you bring them into these other kinds of conversations so it really is the new stuff is like catchy commercials that's how I see it like shade room is not like it's not BNC right like shade room is about people that are non-black that act black Kardashians it's about it's about different CBS um like who's dating who the mess around like cran they are running all the content for Zeus Network the tubes and all that stuff right and then every once in a while to seem like we are being responsible with the audience that we created so we're going to drop in a little political grenade and as someone that does political work the way that shade room translates our work is for entertainment so it's it's they're not even pretending as if they are News Group like they're not they like want it to be like the white version of TMZ I mean the Black version of TMZ but it's not the same level but here's the problem with the state of black media TMZ don't get invited to the White House but baller alert the shade room and all of them are there exactly they have y yes pictured at the White House yeah sh has it but I want to really quickly like point on what you were saying you said that um that that they have a captive audience I would venture to say that their audien has captured them so the shade room and and the and the blogs alike are all symptom of this disease really of audience capture where as you said like they build a particular foundation and as another yamad said Churchill the buildings that you build begin to shape you you know what I saying and then after a while you build this building and the people coming for a particular thing you got to give them what they came for so after a while the shade room has perpetuated a particular Viewpoint as a was saying where it's this conservative dogma and this isn't this this isn't necessarily A Griff but this is just like their their mode of speak which is which is not very um unorthodox inside the black community it's not our fault it's not our Dogma but it's not uncommon to see rather traditional um social views being put forth and the next thing I want to go and put on is um what y was saying particularly about like how we the content creators especially the ones gathered here are considered to be the smart the smart [ __ ] you know the B smart [ __ ] and and that's it we The Talented we The Talented tent [ __ ] right so I mean like you get it and and we and and let's not be let's not be mistaken here we're doing the same thing as the shade room as the same way like in the same sense that we are trying to pontificate particular political viewers that that they doing they just doing it a particular way a very Sensational way but you can't tell me my ass say't inflammatory as hell with every thumbnail with every like couple we make our entertaining we do because we have we economy forign with with the doag and the glasses yeah I trying to look like I trying to look like that Meme you know that that motion mem yeah it's all and it's all for that same thing but the thing is and this is what I I think that o got some bar for all all really it's just like we want to find a way to bridge the gap between these communities because the most I Malcolm X said it I put this inside the video Malcolm X said it the most dangerous [ __ ] that you could find is the politically activated um [ __ ] inside in the cities or the politically active gangster or the [ __ ] that's that's in jail that is the most political that's the most dangerous um danger to to the white um establishment and we you know all of us learned [ __ ] with degrees and thing we have unintentionally and I got a lot of flock for this inside the video because I just don't know how to pass it well but I had to go and tell the way it is but we we just don't know we we begin to alienate with our verbiage with the things we say and we and the shade room is able to do it they're able to get those [ __ ] talking get them active get them at the family table and Shake you know tables and fist into all that other [ __ ] but we getting white people inside our comments politically active about black people business and then we can complain talk you all in our business and you know and and I think to your point what you were saying about audience capture right is the the same thing kind H kind of happens to us because what I'll see very often which what first started making me think about this conversation about black media is everybody up in arms every time charlot man speaks right charlot mind you a lot of what charlam man has been saying on this particular election run is a lot of what all of the leftists the leftists that they like have been saying like the same [ __ ] that Biden is not popular right now he's not a good candidate he doesn't have the ability you know doesn't have that and everybody haot right and I see a lot of like black people that I follow or in my world on Twitter like well now they mad at them over that the big bat comment with reent I'm gonna tie that I'm gonna talk about that I'm gonna tie that in let me let me get to that because they everybody is hot and they're like why the [ __ ] is Charlamagne the person that they go into about black Media or black politics or this is not the black community this pop Char man should be speaking on I saw a lot of that energy a lot of real gatekeeping talented death ass [ __ ] energy about who could speak on something I'm like how the [ __ ] you want to tell someone with one of the biggest black platforms that they can't [ __ ] speak you know what I mean they can't like you think that they don't have a black community they speak to like who are who are you to just say that they obviously charlott man is a a large black audience it's not like this is somebody talking exactly I'm not but that's the problem we need more Char man should not be in the position where he has to be the poster child for [ __ ] Uncle be in the position where he got to be the ambassador for [ __ ] the thing that I wanted to what what I was thinking about with the audience capture is we have these kind of audiences that feel like it can only be spoken about in this issue like I'll see them curse mark lamon hell out for talking about some pop culture or whatever like you supposed to talk about the smart stuff and they supposed to be talking about that and I'm like now you don't understand why we're in a losing battle on messaging because the we are we are drowned out in terms of of reach and numbers and stuff by the [ __ ] that y'all only want over there right and like a Charlamagne character is that a really dis at a Advantage because he's trying to do like okay he created charam man calls it the niggga right charam man created came up on the niggga created a whole huge audience he's a huge figure and he's he's tried to change throughout the years change how how his platform is what he does what he speaks to and tried to become more like responsible and informed and political and here's the issue what I realized there will be people our side like his original audience his that audience capture is constantly saying that his he's done or he's ruined now because he's being too politically he's being too politically correct he's not being in other words he's not he's not giving them the shade room [ __ ] they used to love and then you have our side of the aisle being like you shouldn't be the one speaking on anything and blah blah blah and I'm like we will literally you have these audiences that that literally are forcing you into harm because if you pick one or the other even if you pick their their idea that you should only be having the intellectual discussions in the intellectual way to the intellectuals how many people do you reach you know and then if you do if you do the other side um like a Charlamagne like the the big back comment about re I'm like you know what's funny we're all up in arms and everybody is and rightfully so for all of the reasons why that is some stupid [ __ ] but meanwhile I'm like that's probably if comments like that don't get made here and there his entire original audience or whatever or the ones who actually tuned Into The Breakfast Club are the ones who will tune out if they don't get that because trust and believe that's the [ __ ] that they're saying and want to hear so it's like I'm trying to figure out two masters he he's trying to serve two masters and that's the thing that is difficult because people want people want a perfect perfect version of the game they want like a strike I'm about to make a sports analogy baseball who who with me watch baseball my boy they want computerized um strike zones where there's like there's no judgment involved where it's a ball in a strike every time and don't get me wrong I ain't with the bit I I didn't the reca thing I I like there there'll be no FD uh content around that um but the Big B thing is out of pocket and the Big B thing is only happening because that's reflexive to him it's like I gota I gotta make the edgy black Howard Stern comedy because that pays the bills and then maybe in in between time I can be critical of the Biden Administration on the largest black platform in America and as awful of a of a dichotomy that is to require us to accept it's the game we're playing in right now and there is uh shout out to Mack and Murphy who I don't know if he's American or British he's has like the most weird I was born in America but I live in England for most of my life accents I'll be forgetting if he's like where he votes but it was like one thing that leftists do like leftists attain status by implicating other leftists to be less left than they are and that's such a bad habit we have that we have like very minimal um resistance toward it like that [ __ ] goes off every time like Contra points dropped a video yesterday and I'm like I I give it about uh 72 hours before somebody says something negative about her video being about Twilight in the middle of you know uh what's going on the palace du like like it's it's like or maybe she was like look I've been working on this for for 18 months and this is what I do um but it's cuz it's it's an impossible game to play and because we're so often focused on playing the game of the gamification of it we're losing the actual game yes we're losing the actual ability to educate and spread these ideas to the masses which is one of the reasons why my content has gotten less overtly political you know what I'm saying and like I I've spread and try to amplify the really political people in my in my community especially some of these babies that ain't got that ain't worried about bills ain't worried about being on no list like yeah go on ahead get in there me this next video about wrestling no but you gotta have that mix you gotta have that right you got to have that mix though and um especially because I feel like like you said with black people in media since the Inception of um mainstream media we have been limited and how our stories have been told and all those things and let me tell you something in actual media even um um mainstream local news they'll do it like that too they'll start off in the morning with um they'll make it softer cuter like you know light they'll end you when you're watching your 6 p.m news that's where all the crimes are coming in or whatever the case may be as a journalist you should be able to do all of it you should be able to talk about all those things we should be able to have these conversations we should be able to smile laugh not only hear about the negative things and we should be able to have political conversations bring on experts on our shows we should be able to do all the things but here it is we will sit here and have um shows like tyt I have my own show like it or not which you have tyt which does the same content right they start out doing the same kind of things white folks black folks all in between will go sit in their comment section let them literally steal black folks content in my opinion this is my opinion alone they'll go watch our content take our um um talking points go on there and they're like oh my God these people are such allies for black people this is why I love them this is what they meanwhile we be on our shows black for us by us talking about our issues and they be like man they just capping they don't know this stuff and what they have all these things to say right and then all these white people now they in black business and I don't know how I usually feel about that I love the audience mean it but then now they're in and this is what we're getting the this is my problem with the whole Charlamagne thing you have the audience you got your audience when you did the political thing people judged them people are like why why is why they put because at the end of the day Charlamagne is somebody in media he's been doing media for a long time he knows this better than people who just got grabbed the mic yesterday he knows how to play the game um and and he yeah he's working he's working for both sides of the the situation he chooses he knows when he's on um on the radio how he got to be he knows when he's doing this show how you got to be he knows he knows how to play the game my problem with that whole thing is everybody on the radio show saying the same thing big bad comments just hilarious is history same comments about marginalized groups and you're partnering with her on your on your show and you're partner this girl is already questionable she said things about um remember when she was on the airplane and was upset that well middle person was on there we already know that stereotype here in America with 911 and all those things and she made a big deal about that she said things to um the lgbtqia plus Community exactly um um misnaming folks doing all of those things and here she is you're just big backing and she's over there she mad she's you know there's an actual issue there but all three of y'all saying the same thing on not one of y'all can have a like a conversation not not one of y'all and that was my problem that was my problem I mean I mean I feel like a lot has to be said about how in within all of black media and in certain instances within all the black community a lot of us have become lost in the sauce with conflating being intellectual with being a contrarian so for me I think that when we watching shade room ballert all of it it's always contrarian and what it makes it seem like very edgy and make it seem like you being giv a dope ass hot take when really is just some unethical immoral [ __ ] that's coming at the expense of the fat bigb folks of the ugly dark skinned people of the disabled [ __ ] of the gay transgender non-conformance like it's very tropy pathological that everybody believes that okay these are the people that it's cool if you bored and you need a chuckle make you a fat phobic ableist heteronormative joke we all agree that if you need a little bit of entertainment or you need some clicks or some views that those are the groups or the communities that is okay for and if you try to advocate for those communities you are a problem you being an intellectual you being an elitist you being a educated academic you being a social Jo and to me I think that's the double-edged sword about to me the Triangular problem that we have here because to me the issue is that we we we we really are to me like getting at this elitist classes issue when it comes to talking about the academy or talking from a scholaris a Scholastic perspective and to know I'm saying the mainstream talking to the general public and to me that triangular problem is hey black media figures out a way to meet people on the more default cathartic responses of [ __ ] but we the problem but you know the problem too on top of that is the intellectuals or you know our Twitter folk and our think speakers and thinkers and commentators don't be honest with themselves because this is supply and demand like we engage it too like it's not like people if you on Twitter all the intellectuals are doing is pontificating and arguing mad about what the other about the same content that they claim shouldn't be there and why is this there CU you're watching it you know what I mean like it's like that there it it it can't be we can't Glide over the fact that the majority of folk including us are watching still going to these places still consuming this way like we're in an we're in an outrage engagement like where people prefer to be outraged if you make content that doesn't up you know it doesn't slam somebody or criticize something or Cal down hard or something you do if you don't I have a a harder time on the internet when I actually don't be inflammatory than when I am I or when I'm more strongly one-sided on something like if I in any way start you know thinking about everybody all sides or you know blah blah or you you aren't that you you don't no one bites nobody bites you know so they'll it'll you'll end up being a rewarded in a room full of five people you know what I mean trying to do the right thing or what you think is the you know the moral thing or the intellectual thing or that no one's gonna watch it you'll be in a room full of 12 people that say you know oh yeah yeah yeah yeah you really are it but full of 12 people from my speaking engagement first you're saying something right o I think also where we're we're all getting at too is it's harder for us so when we try to do all of these um we try to do the we try to be ourselves then we try to give y'all you know the journalist you know the straight ahead on news 20 at5 then try to like be then we try to have bring in people have a key key because this is our this is our personalities I'm 10 people in one I should be able to do this on on online but here's the the algorithm does not work in our favor as well so we already have it we're with we're already black we're doing we're talking about black content especially stuff that they don't want to talk about they G demonetize exactly and then so so but it's not demonetized when white folks do it I just don't understand I don't get it I don't understand it but for some reason when we do it it's always you know flagged but um conversations that we're having will will we they the algorithm doesn't want there to be more than one of us so it has to be like you said Somebody's GNA have to be the poster child for all of these things do we want it to be Charlamagne no do we want it to be these other no we don't want it to be but the algorithm doesn't work in our favor when it comes to that so you know what does work in Black for black content creators if we get out here like you said like you guys you're saying when we're angry angry black people and the comment and they be saying all these things terrible things about us in the comment section yet it's going to it's going to give us a lot more views people will start I guess have fighting in the comment section and I hate that energy I don't want to bring that energy but that's the one that we got to bring and then we got to have the people mad in the comment sections and we have to just that's that's the only way that they'll push us into the space for us to get views or whatever the case may be but when I want to talk about the good the goodness of black folks what black people are doing that are good good news about them baby just expect five views just expect they don't want to push those type of things they don't want they don't want to allow us not to be a monolith because we're not they want us to just focus on terrible stories terrible talking points um content that is made up about uh uh people going on dates and and Cheesecake Factories those are actual things that that make it bigger than anything else yeah man we live in Outrage culture though I feel like we live in Outrage culture and the sucky part about being a content creator is that you always have to negotiate how much you want people to be outraged by this content and how much you want people to be provoked into critical thinking and recognize that sometimes them things be them things be hella hella beefing with each other you feel me or be in ttention with each other and to me I think that's the Triangular problem I was talking about is as a content creator we are trying to I'm I'm trying to educate and trying to get to the people that never had access to my the classrooms I was in I acknowledge though that them people gonna be more entertained by fat big black comments you see what I'm saying big back comments you see what I'm saying or they're going to be more entertained by talking about should your wife sit in the back seat or sit in the front seat you feel me so was literally where you get caught up in doing like Charlamagne damn there where you have to really pick and choose when you want to engage in this slapstick type content or when you got to pick and choose when you want to be you feel me some some some some when you want to have some substance the last thing I say in this right here is that I hate quoting Winston Churchill because he was a goddamn colonizer y' in the quoting business today oh yeah hey hey hey but what he say but his [ __ ] about the buildings though I think it's something to really think about in this virtual reality that we live in because the virtual reality that we live in there's a building that was built that none of us had to say on it we get to tr that that building gets to position how we you feel me consume windows and doors godamn but we didn't choose how that building of the algorithm was built but it does dictate our thought process it dictates you feel me what we see and what we thinking about and it dictates how but it's just like it's the it's it's the it's the [ __ ] up part about doing what we doing it just takes our whole expression like one of the things um me and a foreign about in the last joint I I was on is like and it's something I've told anybody that's asked me about making content um like YouTube does not like it when you diversify yeah YouTube wants you to hit that same that same lick every video and you and they want you to hit them same numbers with each video and if you don't do that it will penalize it will penalize you and it will depress you or content going forward you have people in your comment section like I didn't know you did a new video like I done three videos what are you talking about um and so like that is a big thing that I mean obviously we know this but the the question is the solutions to it is that we don't really control our own narratives and media outlets and even on YouTube where we can create independent platforms it's still housed upon YouTube's and Google's recommendation system so I've had conversations with um uh Mark Lamont Hill about like him building his own like you know system and his own platform um on YouTube and let them know like look you can put this this and this here but if you put you know you can put a b and c but as soon as you get the X you might have to start another Channel or you going to be compromising ab and C because if you've built a audience around ab and C the ex people are not going to be here for that and YouTube's going to penalize you for it but on top of that though one comment I did in my video coming up I was like so we just I Williams was just on Joe Rogan and doing his thing from what I heard I ain't watched it but I you know the was like oh [ __ ] yeah you know I knew I knew it was coming like I you know you know Cat Williams been in plenty of barber shops you know but that's another conversation and I'm like you never gonna see Mark lar Hill on Joe ROK you're never gonna see Mark Lamar Hill on Club sh Shay you know what I'm saying not to take anything away from the the level of entertainment that Cat Williams provides but that doesn't make him a person to interview about politics yes and that's the problem you and you can't until we can in either through some you think right right where's J like where's if we can do a such a shift in like culture that we can claim more spots or rearrange the way people view who gets to speak on what we're going to constantly be in that proxy Battle of whose voices should or should not be heard I think that last point I think there's an this goes back to something that forign said earlier I don't think people expect to get actual journalism or the way that we're what we're experiencing I don't think people actually expect to get news from black people like it has to be news with uh you know with a laugh on the side I think this concept that you know like you know we use humor to like get over really bad things and so what Rebecca was saying earlier like uh we're so used to the news caratz us that the house that we're in what is translated to us is caricatures and so if y'all as content creators are not filling this idea of caricatures right then people are dissatisfied right and yeah yeah know that that's the exactly what I what I keep thinking about right is like this this is this fight between what should be and what is right it's like that shouldn't be that way but it is that way and it's like just being stubborn about it to me I'm like am I just kicking myself and the community in ass because ultimately what I don't want to be a black person pontificating on a hill about black people to a bunch of white people like I don't want to do that that like and I recognize unfortunately because of how this has been it's like somehow you get Class A Smarty [ __ ] and you're for the whes you know what I mean like that's who's in your audience that's who you talking to and then because and then what happens is the same way you have to have an audience capture you have an audience in order to have audience you in some way have to serve them then you end up serving white people and having to serve them in way that black people find alienating and then ultimately and ultimately what you really want to do because you're in the black community you watch Source the same things as other black people you're trying to counteract a bad kind of messaging that you're outnumbered by with the shade rooms and all of this and you can't do it because they're not listening to you you know um so then I feel like it brings me to what form was talking about in his last video how do we not be that like we how do we reexamine that like maybe we are not communicating in a way because in my mind I had this conversation with AJ and AJ was like he was like he made two points to me one that we we alienate that they feel immediately feel like they're not smart enough for the room like they're not smart enough um to be there and so that's the first thing and then the second thing which I've been thinking about a lot and I want y'all's thoughts because I don't know if I agree but he basically I agree with this part he basically is like the black community has a lot of uh the reason why it's easy for the black people to flock to these like kind of rightwing a lot of these right-wing figures and I think also to fg's earlier point when you said the Joe uh the Joe Biden picture in the Canada soone like why are people saying oh black men always chilling for the Republican party and stuff it's because what I've realized is there is an a really uh severe underrepresentation of black men intellectual especially intellectual black men in any of these media spaces independent or mainstream so who they really see are a bunch of streamers and content creators and people who are on right-wing Outlets spreading right-wing stuff bringing foolishness you know what I mean indirectly and like you say the politics and the entertainment are intertwined so they see one they think this is consistent with every other of these like hip-hop platforms and black people and black people and streamers that are spreading right-wing stuff so even though Candace Owens is there there's people barely see her as a black woman at this point you know what you know we like she's divorced from her Blackness and black women as a general there's a lot of us not speaking like that so I think that's what happens um there but was my original Point how I how I died um Lord so essentially like how are we how are we going to get into a situation where we're not beholden to a particular audience and we could actually find some middle ground and I wanted to speak to that real quick like so first off like we've been talking a lot about the algorithm and I mean un know about this CU there some nebula speak but essentially like the algorithm is the audience I mean like essentially that a like like we we really yeah exactly switch our war with audience because essentially it will help us elucidate the issue so you're right in the sense especially that these mechanics are only a reflection or an extension of the biases that already exists in society so it isn't that the algorithm is an ex self biased it's it's a machine but the people that built it are and the fact of the matter is the people that using it also are and I found this out the hard way cuz I used to like look through my comment section I say damn where the [ __ ] are cuz I just I just be scrolling in my comment section and be like it's just white white white you know LGB T queer TR and and just white I'm like I a see no I a see no [ __ ] like where [ __ ] I a see no black pfps no nothing and um I found out because I was trying to figure out okay how can I reach a more darker audience um and literally we we yeah like we did the research [ __ ] Ain't on YouTube at least watching the type of things that we're making they're not even there so like what I was looking for was not even there the way that we were going to have to go about it is finding a way to meet them in the middle and that means that we got to be on Facebook that means we got to be on Tik Tok and that means that we have to go and package ourselves in a particular way because that's where they at they on Tik Tok they on they on Twitter and they on all these other things they a on YouTube like and then the problem becomes the fact that you have audiences that look at you being there as a problem like when I remember like I when I had my Breakfast Club interview I had people in my audience being like oh you didn't align me oay was up there and didn't check Charlamagne with all their whatever grievances they you know and and like I think we we fail to recognize sometimes that like our side is has their extreme foolishness in a different way like they constantly want us to be out with the pitchforks condemning people on a you know what I mean that's what they want us to do we become like like Messengers for condemn this person that's not left is enough this one say up enough they did this it becomes this accountabil accountability culture of just like attack everybody there's no sense of like bridge building you can't Coalition which is like kind of defeats the purpose of what we wanted to do at least what I wanted to do I want more people to think like this and you can't do it in the way that your audience tries to like fight you to say to say you have to do it or they um question your credibility which reminds me my second point of what AJ was telling me AJ was basically saying that you know the right has has a lot of the same views on on the LGBT community religion women all the bigoted [ __ ] right that the black community often has an association with religion and that he feels like the the a lot of these the people on the left are not sensitive enough to that like we don't we we aren't um thoughtful enough about how we engage that or it's too dismissive or whatever have you but I think that's only theoretically right in real life and application like you are not rewarded by any side for being middle of the road oh I think what everybody and blah blah it's just not true you know like people is the right is incredibly inflammatory they don't get they don't win over their side by being thoughtful to what we talking about or us or whatever and the left doesn't reward us for that either so there's not a whole lot of like lgbtq people consuming right-wing Politics on some like well you know they're kind of right about us like like like it's it's not really an option for them you know and and and like most of their black Talking Heads have wider audiences than we do let's keep it a buck Candace Owens all them other black Talking Heads that the weather of twins they don't have black audiences they have white audiences um their audiences are wider than ours uh oh man some something I wanted to respond to that I thought was useful thank you I'm glad it's not only me who's old thank you that second point be by the time you finish that first point that second okay boom boom boom I got you so here's one thing uh in response to like one of AJ's points that it doesn't this doesn't um make the point any less valid but it's just something to think about uh class is impenetrable across racial lines right people with education and money they don't even think they don't even they don't even want to touch they uneducated white peers them [ __ ] could die like if if Co only like the fact that Co was mostly affecting like poor white people the the white liberals and leftists were like good all on Twitter you know what I'm saying like so so that's a thing to think about and the other thing which which is something I do that I've done maybe to my d minut at times um that I think all of us should be thinking about is sharing our platform with folks who are not as polished not as up on all the Talking Points not as a a credential whatever because the truth is I can never speak to an audience of I I'm never going to be able to capture the audience that we were just talking about it with shout out to wav and the red flag folks like I I feel good about the level of black viewers I have now because I've worked really relatively hard to like every time like I'mma grab a couple more I'm grab a couple more I'm put these little things in here I'm make you a whole video put baracan on the cover yeah come through right so so I do that but I also understand that my my bills are still greatly paid especially when you talk about patreon uh by white folks um but like I just saw a cam the hell cam name some brother out here and he just looked he just like as soon as I saw him I was like oh yeah this is a dude I need to make sure uh cam J is it cam James shout out to cam James um shout out to John got go you got a gag [ __ ] you know that me shout out to John Lewis shout out to uh B Lil Bill like you know what I'm saying like folks that they speak I hope this doesn't come off wrong but they speak shade room they speak Hood because they they're more connected to it and it's more natural to their presentation and how they get to their their politics and their ideology and that resonates more than I ever could and so really what we're talk what we should we shouldn't be talking about how do we capture this audience what if we're really about the movement we should be talking about how can we find people within that audience within those communities to platform and Empower to minister to their own folks you know what I'm saying and that's the reason why I like short content so much I feel like I do kind of speak [ __ ] you know what I mean like when I feel like I'm very you know the Beaman in me very much so like I especially if you follow me on Twitter I curse people out I do a lot of the and foolishness you know and what happen and you know what's crazy it's not even the white people who give me grief it's not that I have a a black like we all have a black audience but I don't consider my audience black right my the black people who are in my audience are very often it's not that they themselves are are talented tense petite bisi ass [ __ ] it's that they have that sense of you like they think you're supposed to be that because like they've classified you as smart a smarty [ __ ] and they want you to move in a particular way and so it's them who are on your neck like on my head constantly trying to force me into a box that would make me un unsuccessful incredibly unsuccessful but they're always like that's who I get it a lot from like they'll be oh don't curse oh why are your nails oh this hair color why you this side oh your bre every time every that I go out and I post a picture going out I get old black women telling me this is not what they follow me for they're un following me blah blah blah every weekend like because it's a scarcity thing right like they feel like there's not that many of us and because you've hit this level they want to keep you in this role and so you got to play that caricature role right and so this goes back to the thing that forign was saying is like we actually just need way more people to be able for the the the kind of diversification that people want us to be able to consume but we don't have it so then everyone kind of forces us into these roles that fit certain things and then I would say the other thing about like the community and the as you say is like I think part of the thing is that has been really difficult for me as someone who's not in content creation but in politics is this idea like if I see the world this way and it makes sense I don't understand if you're living in the same world as me how you're not having the same kinds of conversations that I'm having and the truth is like they are having similar conversations in certain ways we might not be able to identify it and then I think part of the reason why some of this inflammatory [ __ ] is so popular is because in the in their everyday life because we are in the metaverse like we're in this like virtual world yeah literally right now in the in the regular World they don't they can't talk like that all the time so they get so excited when people are on platforms spewing this [ __ ] hatred kind of [ __ ] that they know they will be WR written up for at work so to me on the internet is this playground where people get to be this avatar version of themselves that they not showing up in in in their world and they're not being held accountable in the same way that's why like they're not going to run up on you ol yeah on you on the internet yeah one thing that's go ahead Rebecca I I want to be clear though we all are Professionals in what we do right like working in law working in politics being content creators journalism whatever it else we're all we are Professionals in that so there's a way that we should be carrying ourselves but we We Are People Too again when I'm doing my work I I have conversations with oay on the phone all the time about this she sees me in all of of me like right and we talking about [ __ ] we'll talk about jobs we'll talk about this we'll talk so there are ways that we because we know what the sh we know who the people in the shade root com comments are we have been the people in the shade Roo we have those kind of conversations ourselves but we are professionals too so there's words that we know how to we know how to carry ourselves but also on olay's personal page right she's not going to post the same thing as she posted on that she post on her YouTube page um but on her personal page she can post herself with her titties out having a drink with whatever who however she want to people are going to go on her personal page from coming from her YouTube or all those um from a a repost that a news um station or a page has posted her they'll go on her personal page and because they saw a picture of her they can't see her in her personal they they they'll expect the expectations that they'll have of her because you know why societally the logic is on you know um the the societal logic is that with black women with black people if they already view you like this if you're on U Mark Lamont Hill if you're on uh you know if you're you're working on um with the hill if you're working with NBC if you're you can't as a black person um show yourself like that into the world no me I'm going to throw my ass in a circle on my page you'll see me grinding on somebody's son you know when I'm at you see me at the church and um singing uh uh because I know how to sing so you me singing somebody's Christian song or whatever the case may be and then you'll see me back on my show having very nuanced conversations surrounding politics and I still will have pick up some of the shave room stuff I can do that yet we can package it and still be professional we've done that but they don't want us they don't want us to be those people that can be like all of those things in once we know how to be on each and every one of these things they don't want to see but in real life but in real life they don't let black people do that either I don't yeah are it's like both things are real I'm not saying that's right but follows the same kind of like theory of like how people operate and I think that's the thing where we're like this I'm really interested in this thing that we're talking about in this virtual world that we're all operating in it's as it it's like we can change certain rules but some of those rules feel more sticky than others and what does it look like for us to actually challenge that foundation in a different way and do we even still have the time to do that yeah I think that I think there something to add in real fast is that what what differs from my platform and and y'all's is that on YouTube is really like my my my my my less successful platform I'm more successful on Facebook I'm more successful on Tik Tok I'm more successful on Instagram what I recognize is that the multifacetedness is what y'all getting at right now is that even when you put Blood Sweat and Tears in and making sure you cultivate certain narratives for [ __ ] that still in the hood eating sleep for dinner and you cultivate narratives for [ __ ] that's still trying to get phds or Masters you still get for having that multifacetedness if I went to my Instagram Channel right now and showed y'all my follows and unfollows in the last 90 days I usually don't do it but I did it in the past couple days ago right and what I found is that I've had 30,000 people unfollow me Co at the same time I've had 50,000 so I gained 20,000 people right but my point is that if I G if I make a dope ass analysis about white supremacy and antiblackness [ __ ] going to eat that [ __ ] up if I back do that [ __ ] we're talking about how trans women is women hey them 10,000 [ __ ] just follow me for making this dope ass white supremist narrative they unfollowing my ass see what I'm saying I think that it's something to be said about how that that triangle of problem with is and when you talking about charlot man serving multiple partners is that I know that when I get on Twitter I'm I'm very intentional about making sure I'm not just a serious [ __ ] always talking about oppression yeah I like to dance and be goofy sometimes I recognize that just like what o getting is like hey some people will be mad like hey consciously we came to you to hear about oppression [ __ ] how dare you be happy right now talking about ass [ __ ] I came to you to be an attack dog how dare you be cheeking up with [ __ ] you ain't attacking nobody like that you say somebody told me this weekend I I tweeted about love is blind and somebody really commented telling me who cares there's a there's a holocaust happening let's focus our tweets see [ __ ] like that like I got I got over 6,000 videos on the internet on every single one of my find something this issue but you are but they don't do that though what happens is Rebecca even though you have a thousand videos right now you're talking about something that I think is pado non gr that should be deprioritized how can I feelings in this I swear to God though so it's like for me it's just like I think that if I'm being if I'm giving the black media the Ben f it out it's it's it's one of the ways they have not been able to I'm still trying to figure it out I think it's one of the ways that you're trying to figure out what FD said like what Char man doing you really serving multiple Masters you feel me I'm serving multiple Masters I'm not I'm I don't just make content for folks in the hood I don't just make content for people that's educated I don't make the content for Working Class People I make content for all that and I acknowledge that when I when I prioritize a particular social economic background the other social economic backgrounds get pissed off or when I prioritize ableism heteronormativity misogyny that's the that to me that's the right-wing pipeline the right-wing pipeline says that hey man racism is bad but we got to keep these [ __ ] in the closet can we agree on that okay uh [ __ ] up children is bad but if a conservative doing it's okay you know what I'm saying you know what I'm saying so so to me I'm I'm seeing that these is these lines that if you to me seem like if you go against the the the the the the the Loyalty of heteronormativity or the Loyalty of ableism then you really get part put on put put put on the put on the things I feel like charlot man tries to in in shade room tries to do the Dosey Do of being like here go these people y'all don't give a damn about attack them but also here go issue y'all might like and the last thing I'll say is people like the Shay room gave us three updates on the brick lady they gave us three updates on row they gave us three four updates on row those same platforms don't give us updates when they uh misquote and say that Biden gave all this funds to this and they really didn't they people in the comment section saying they didn't but then they delete that story shout out to my boy JJ Williams JJ Williams showed me the receipts and got in their ass and showing like hey not only are y'all a part of the right-wing pipeline y'all receive right-wing money and that's the reason why y have such a conflict of interest in many different instances and play back in this it's not an accident and it's connected it's not just the post it's not just the post that are expressly about a political cada or political issue it's everything else around it to make those posts take off you know what I mean those posts can only work if you primed your audience to that belief set you see what I'm saying I mean but it's a product right it's a product strategy it's the it's the marketing around it um and how how how do we make it profitable and keep it because part of it is keeping the audience so you can get them to do the thing that you want them to do later but selling it to us as it's something that it's like a com it's like something that we're we're being nice and giving to you as opposed to the poison that we're giving you instead right like giving you a spoonful of sugar hey as we talk right now the shade room thing right here CDC is no longer recommending Americans to stay home after testing positive for covid a major shifting policy that comes after the country has moved is like posting [ __ ] to cause outrage and disarray that literally comes to the detriment of Public Health why is you bastardizing talking about uh uh uh the CDC it's like the caption let me know everything I to know one one thing I also think to point out that uh Cassandra just alluded to and I'm trying to find this is the dark money behind some of this [ __ ] um that there are literal millionaire uh conservative think tanks funding yes paying for space paying for ads giving grant money there's a dude one of my one of my viewers pointed out to me um on some and not even on a you know because sometimes they want you to be their attack dog talk about this [ __ ] drag him you know it wasn't even one of those he was like y this guy is good he should you should look at his stuff whatever I go look at him and it's some like you know it's it's I hate to bring her up it's on some kidology [ __ ] where it's like plausible deniability conservative nonsense and I'm like okay uh you don't want to know it's a long story um and [ __ ] like I go I go and I look at his background and I'm like oh this dude is like a a fellow at the Washington Group you know what I'm saying you know them like conservative College stink tanks where they literally breed these figures to come into the world and he's funded and like distributed and supported by those entities and that is that's a thing that's missing we really need George Soros like they say we do we got them like we need we need our we need our leftist billionaire dark money we not getting funded like that to do those same that same work and and the thing is though it's like we we have believe it or not I feel like I met the social justice Illuminati that's what I call a nonprofit industrial complex of this kind of world yes I know him it exists it is in fact real like that's what I'm saying like when I say oh these are conservative talking points that have been handed to people I'm not being like this is not hyp like hypothesis factually there are people who create the same way we create messaging there's a specific way that I talk about bail reform I talk about abolition I talk about this I have a script if you've heard one of my spe speeches you'll figure it out you know what I mean there's a messaging in a way that you go about talking about something and the same is true of the right and they have their and the thing about the right Playbook is the right Playbook book is old and and the right play is a long game like people tend the left tends to look at everything like the right just won cuz last night they decided to be outraged they got on top of it no [ __ ] way like the left will be tired in six months three months be talking about fatigue and yada yada y the [ __ ] right will be on some [ __ ] 50 100 years like they are still down they don't change recipes they recycle the same things and they will try the same [ __ ] again like they will TR because they recognize that it's not about what's the smartest or what's the strongest about what people haar the most and what you can indoctrinate people into like the right is still using the if I I'm I'm getting ready my next video is going to be a Greg Abbot documentary like on what I did on Eric Adams and in there I I put Garrick Abbott's statement next to what the Texas letter of secession is same compact Theory they use the same compact Theory there they use it in Brown versus Board they use it in cases not it's the same [ __ ] they have the same Playbook so we be we we're really at this in incredible disadvantage but and cuz left is not United in that same way right it's not that there isn't money there but not to our to to our credit it's not our fault right the right is very United around specific things white supremacy right like like if you white supremacy and what Falls underneath that that's all it is if if white supremacy and capitalism is what what your goal is it's about getting to the bag everybody could get on one Accord because there's no need that your genuine feelings are not in it right-wing pundants and commentators preach a bunch of [ __ ] they don't believe in they do not agree in you'll know them in real life I know them I started out people know I'm you know people know me from rising originally you know these people say things that they don't believe they don't live their life in accordance with the left is not the same right you talk to all us we believe the [ __ ] that we say in real life we have that argument that's why we feel this we've gone out our way to try to pontificate and message despite not having the backing or not being able to make that money so you can't get us all you can't just all buy us all to be like hey I'll do your messaging if we're like nah I think that messaging is bad I think that [ __ ] with that like that I you know so it's not that there isn't money there so we can't get organized in the same way because there's a bunch of people who genuinely feel different about this versus the right is like get to this bag and make sure we we maintain the status quo in the world order that we believe in which is white is right but no white is right on the left too I'm G be that's also very true um like I know I've worked with people who are so left the first people that that I um started working with was a white group of people who hired me because of how I look they were like we need a black face on here I had just got out of um graduate school um for New Media now I went to school for broadcast did that got that degree and now we're in a new world where digital media was so I went and got that degree these people were like hey we want you for politics really I'm like I don't really do I you know what I'm saying I like President Obama or whatnot but that's where I was in life right over 10 years ago and then so um then you know they were like no but we need somebody like you you know your nails your hair and they they were basically telling me now they let black people come on like this they let black people get in the meting that's what they were telling me they literally sat me down and said your nails your hair is perfect and then you graduated from a black University oh this is gonna be great and that's when Donald Trump had just won he was serving his first few year first you know term whatever his term his only term but they sat me down in there and they on they only wanted me that's where I met Benjamin P Dixon shout out to Ben um they only wanted me to focus on Donald Trump content right and I'm like they wanted me to be angry and they would sit me down there like aren't you mad about what he said about black people aren't you mad about what he what he said about Haiti just get angry and show that on camera and in the beginning I would be there like I would just be in full news mode like straight ahead we have and they're like no you can you can loosen up and you can and then so then I started to loosen up have you ever seen scandal then they would tell me to start using because they would hear me talk to Ben and they're like yeah use that voice yeah they want you to be a particular thing because theying they want there's a way that white people want their their their Blackness sold to them they want they want us to demonstrate Blackness they want to feel this like a comment that stood out to me when we put out the first Olean friends and it's a good comment from our audience remember they me it positively but it says a lot they were like they feel like there they like they love Olay and friends because they feel like they're sitting in on a black conversation they're not supposed to be in the room for like a Barber Shop you know and and that's what they want to they want us to to they want to commodify our Blackness and package it to them and but here's the problem the thing because of they don't recognize how we're despite the fact that they think they're packaging us they want us package in our blackest form of the version of that for Their audience that's they don't realize how we're being perceived by our or like the black community itself and how we've been characterized there and so they see this as the antithesis of this and then it makes us have this large disconnect right because yeah like I remember when I started I think my first media appearances when was on a black outlet that wasn't even here that isn't even here anymore and that was when before um when I had a black weave like side part or whatever and those black Outlets that are not successful that don't do well and numb would prefer me there you know what I mean and not want me in this form meanwhile White media will embrace me like this to come be you know what I mean and you're so it's like you're authentic and real now uhhuh uhhuh when you have your they and then they all come up with things and and I realized that like I remember when I was on Rising and I didn't have my locks done at the time because locks cost money and I was trying to save money to move and get between DC in New York I was broke as a joke right so I can to get my hair done so I had weave right I had a wig and I remember there was a bunch of like black people who watch by the way again black people who watch Rising so this again we're in a we're in a specific microcosm of black people like not and they're like oh I feel like um the network made you change you know they made you change your hair to this and whatever they were so upset this isn't the real me all my locks my locks is some hair I buy from the store too this is not real but they've created this real you know what I mean black image around me and how and they create a lore and like everything becomes everything about you becomes politicized and consumed and broken apart as a character right like it's one quick joke is there's no it's not a coincidence that me conscious Odie um The Smiling brother I don't know his name um uh uh t1j like every [ __ ] with Sense on the Internet is chocolate brown skin with long locks like 90% of us and that's not by accident oh no I've been peep you just peep for for PE for all you gotta do is grow them out get a little tan you got to reduce some of the red B I'm already I'm already Caribbean like them [ __ ] can go and call me God so there's a reason why the ladies are going to over to foreign page and then they get there my P the girl poring is the girls them sugar yeah there's a there's a he said he know what he's selling and then he get when they get over there that's the reason why you see me um allying like the brick like I don't like calling the brick lady but the brick lady and Megan Stallion and when you see them numbers go up I found it out after I made that nigell video I was just like yeah the the black women and fam they here I hear for you all y this a safe space for you all the cocoa butter all the shea butter you can have it right there right don't worry s pillowcase right there make yourself at home but I got pull my wife out every third video to remind people I'm not with a white woman that's the next part mik y nice and dark too oh they hate me the divest oh Lord theyers be so mad the the be mad when they find out say oh [ __ ] his do is do I'm unambiguously block I say Jesus Christ it' be so frustrating cuz the vess I got so much heat but I don't be wanting to giving them no attention cuz they're such a small group but they're like to get y'all don't got no good arguments at all yeah I've made the video about my wife being biracial 10 times you it don't matter it don't matter so for me I recognize that like hey if if in my mind when it comes to thinking about just like black media if individuals want to discredit you they'll make up some [ __ ] to discredit be clear don't be a black woman with a white man they will on you my o is fake right now they started saying no they started saying that to foreign and then they started saying that to me I had to expl I said it to forign fors like oh that's a thing they doing I'm like you know we really from that island is my realax they they'll comment on your they'll comment on your video and be like stop playing up your accent it's when you with with foreign that it's cringe I you mean when I'm speaking to another bamian and bamian dialect feel me hey hey hey [ __ ] tell me hey consciously don't talk about no more black issues you swirling with a Mexican it's like oh Jesus no they make they will make up these things about you like the the the place that I told you guys I was working at they hired me because I was black they fired me because they didn't show up for a while me and Ben we created our black show like it or not they fired us for doing black content they pulled me into a room and told they pulled me into the room and told me the head of the organization or whatever they were putting together the show they said that they watched me on mute and they said that it gave bet because my hair yeah oh I swear I was in the room you could get them that sounds pretty macro yeah and all of the video stuff that we created for them I didn't even know about monetization at the time right all the stuff they had my likeliness they had we have view we have um I had episodes with 10 million like 10 million views all that I was bringing that that to these people and didn't know about monetization they were making so much money off of us I found out that I was making the least um with these white leftists these are white leftist by the way and you know the left aesthetic does numbers by the way there was a big problem there but at the same time the comment section they they like oh look what these people are saying about you is that not angering you and I'm like At first I used to get so mad and Ben is like do not even don't go into that cuz I used to be in there like you guys don't even just go away and I had to stop they were telling me I'm a mut they would leave voicemails and say go back to your country they I I did not feel protected by the people that were supposed to be you know I'm working for them I didn't ful protected with with them at all there were so much terrible things from black and white folks racist and people who are just hating on me one guy um was saying you know my my sister my my sister you shouldn't be wearing your nails like that if you just my my my sister and I'm like listen Hots I don't give a damn right I'm here to give the news and I'm I'm here to go that this is where I'm at but it's just like you can't be yourself you can't do that and they also didn't want me they couldn't believe that I was black and I was professional they couldn't believe that sometimes while being really professional and very newsy I will go into my South Florida accent I might say something in Creo they didn't like that about me and they would be like uh she's she's doing too much she's like she need she's not a real journalist she's not meanwhile I'm the realest journalist in the panel but unfortunately our audience like the black community P like like mirrors a lot of the same sentiments because they that's the thing it's like they say the same [ __ ] they say in fact very often they don't even give you the opportunity you know what I mean for the to the same [ __ ] like I've heard those kinds of conversations like there was um someone recommended me for for like a job opportunity in an outlet um that was pretty black once and they and they said they they I wasn't I didn't have the right black woman aesthetic I didn't have like the you know and again it was the locks it was the this the blah blah blah they want you to do again and so that there are lots of these competing interest and a lot of Disconnect between what you should do and it depends it's it's hard to know honestly y'all it's hard to know that's why I brought yall well one of the things go ahead bringing it back everything we saying that we go through we giving the benefit of the doubt it appli to shade room baller alert spiritual World it apply to all them like everything we saying right now the tension that we identifying about what people want from us people don't want from us is literally that tension we recognize that when these blog sites post capital P political content it's folks in the comment section saying what a what a [ __ ] [ __ ] at that's not what I'm here I don't give a [ __ ] about no b no Obama no no no Palestine don't give a [ __ ] about no Ukraine I came here to seey who ukra what whoan [ __ ] right now what what is they saying about the mega sty and it's just like recognizing Mill gay but you feel me like that's that is that's that's that's the conversation right now though so it's like we don't care about the sexual assault PDD we care about because those Outlets are huge and they get perceived as like black outlets right they they get they're able to manufacture a lot of consent as this is the black opinion and then the next thing you know your platform and all the things that you are doing in the interest of black people really trying to educate them they damn they calling you against the black community like you are white a white liberal operative you know what I mean spreading this [ __ ] is that's how they deal with you and so then it becomes this feeling a feeling like you in tension with your own Community like you you bending over you being you know police and perceived and consumed by white people and then you're angering you feel like you're angering the majority of you know the the the black internet community that are speaking to you and then it what do you do one I think one of the things that's interesting that we haven't brought up here around the state of black media is that we've talked about like the shade rooms and the baller alerts and the neighborhood talks and the Hollywood unlocks and then there's a set of black media that's not even run by black people right just selling stay tuned for that I got that and then also that amplifies and is acts as a force multiplier that [ __ ] over black people doing content right because you're you're not just getting it from the black blogs you're getting it from white own blogs that sell Blackness Blackness right like all of them no jumper V making the pressure so even the diversification is still pushing the same kind of content right which makes it even more difficult and dangerous for folks like you who are trying to offer a different perspective what you saying are you saying you tired of booy talking to Vlad is that what you trying to say so you trying to so you trying to stop booy money from getting that Vlad check huh you so you being a Hating Ass [ __ ] Cassandra huh Vlad check can't be but like one third of a of a 100K I didn't even think you think pays them for those interviews heyyy has claimed I don't know if he I don't know if he booy ly now be lying sometimes but booy has claimed that he's made a million dollarars from doing interviews with has also claim he wants his child to be raped by a whole woman right so one thing I wanted to throw out there though that uh I can a couple of y'all alluded to is we're in a ballot for attrition and it's good that we have these vent sessions but we also need not neglect that we are doing important things even if it's a matter of one mind at a time cuz just like the shade room has people in their comments talking about uh who create create Sean [ __ ] there's people in our comments or that aren't commenting uh saying oh crean is a whole different rapper cre he's white creation yeah that's a whole different that's a whole different and blue faace uh but like there's people in our comments that we're we're accessing people that are catching catching what we're putting down every once in a while and the way I the way I see it is there's the the fact that we're all here with viable Platforms in 2024 that didn't exist in 2020 that means something that's that that is a that is progress and maybe by 2030 God willing I'm out the game I'm out the hood we we a foring out the hood um but maybe by 204 Maybe by 2030 there's other people like this doesn't look as unique and and you know a niche you know because of because of the fact that we're making this happen because my my most successful video used to be this B burum video which is definitely all white folks and now pretty soon it's G to be my black conservatives video and that comment section is dark as night and I love it so much it's mostly [ __ ] mad at me right right Lauren Hill video got a mail off it you know what I'm saying um so like they're out there and it's happening on time and as soon as YouTube figures out how to get more [ __ ] we in there in the meantime YouTube is hard Tik Tok catch me on Tik Tok you feel me as a matter of fact I say this for my producers don't be mad man I got a podcast that I'm doing called black history for real with Amazon and wondery you know what I'm saying now usually you feel me we always going to give space to talk [ __ ] about big Tech you know what I'm saying and they know rocking with cont Lee I'mma always any opportunity talk some [ __ ] about folks [ __ ] up the world I'mma do that but shout out to them for giving me the opportunity come on here you know what I'm saying and give me an opportunity to proliferate some of this black ass perspective you know what I mean it's a reation project we were claiming some real [ __ ] you know like um what's the dude that made um sorry to bother you I always forget his name um boots Ry yeah he outright communist open and clear with it and all his work says that and he getting distributed through Amazon like look we got to play with the pie that's true we got to play the game we got to play the game too we got to be able to know how to do it it's funny because I I have I have a show now like it or not and um but I I used to just post it because when the when that them white people took all of my stuff my likeliness all of my I did not I never used any of my personal Pages because again I didn't know about monetization I didn't know that you know I wasn't privy to that so lost lot on a lot of stuff never used my YouTube page and then and then when as we um we just put the show on Ben's page Ben has um 100,000 followers over 100,000 followers on his YouTube so that's where we would just distribute the show what's funny is um everybody would be on there I work with these I do I work with um some great white men um on the show that Olay actually put me in on um and it's called the leest the leftist mafia um and so I work with them but what's funny is we just get on my show um it's very structured um right now we're a bit loose but I usually real structured that's the journalist in me I'll be like okay we G to start with this and we gon to end with this it's what we're going to do in between it's the breaks whatever on that show we could just have a conversation like we're having right now just be fine but the views that they all got and again and I I'm not saying like it's not an issue I love the guys it's not them but I feel like sometimes even they feel the audience feel so comfortable in these spaces and giving to to to to white people more for some reason it's like they treat my show like it or not as a good woman show I'm like oh no this is a we working too we're content creators we're he but they will be like oh this is great I love being here okay join the patreon but when I'm on that show when I'm on that show the audience feels more compelled to give it's almost like we're going to give to the black girl show we're going to point out we're going to do that but on mine it's like oh this is good this is good content this is quality we love it we love it but then don't want to give and I I I don't I don't understand yeah know that's interesting that's interesting because like live stream like money like like me and un been on that game and I know like you like came out of it because it was easier just for you to post whole ass videos to the bsides than to cut it up because they wasn't they wasn't making it rain so it's interesting I wonder if more white equals more money on live stream that's an interesting thing I think it does it it does and you know what's crazy this makes me think of again remember I talking about this a way you talk about things in mediums because remember that chick got ate that black girl that ate the [ __ ] up on Tik Tok um a couple months ago or something because she said the black audience don't pay you need a white remember that about the weave that got and everybody was [ __ ] jumping her and I was like it's crazy is a way you deliver things is a way you talk about things because because you can smell the antiblackness in her though was she was guilty no she was guilty a quick she revealed a lot of guil and the antiblackness I'm saying it was you could smell it you could pass that smell you couldn't get back I couldn't get P the first video I saw when she was talking about the damn weave I'm like sis that's because you've always been going to struggle weave people now you want to act baby daddy baby daddy was like a white guy with a Confederate flag on the wall come on wi soft Life Energy on top of that I would say that I would say that like my the consciously platform uniquely was built by [ __ ] I think I think that my platform was uniquely built by [ __ ] and I think that I would not be consciously platform without how black people black gay black straight black TRS black disabled like rock with me I think they I've been nominated for NAACP image Awards I've been I I deal with black media all the time so I feel like [ __ ] it's a it's a it's a it's a I think that's why you can't get on on YouTube though CA was just about to say because cause you because I don't I think no foren just said it YouTube just does not have a audience of politically inclined black folks like Instagram Tik Tok and Facebook does because for one I think like I would I would venture to say that half of my black audience and I think I have a pretty like at this point I don't know because I've been I've been wandering away from [ __ ] a little bit in the last like six months like handful of videos but I feel like I'm maybe like 50/50 but I feel like a disproportionate amount of my black audience is very young cuz I think Young politically old ass [ __ ] inside I got some old I got old heads cuz they different for me they be saying listen here a young buck and I'd be like you have to come from FD part and then he say I came from from FD conscious and FD have very black man content very black man you know very black man come here this is the G must be over by my side yeah yeah no my experience is is with with with black media is they will know me and they will talk to me and they will ask me for off heads or things or opinions or blah blah but they don't bring me on to the spaces like or at least not until 15 white people l in at first and then I would love to work I work alongside they mention me whatever the case may be and it's funny because I'm like I want to be in that space But I'm not begging to be in the space cuz I've been here rocking that's why you want me on here that's why you want me on your show cuz you had to see my stuff somewhere so you know we want to work together but what what they do is they make these people feel like there can only be one there can only be one strong person in this there can only be one and it's like that's that's the part that isn't fair while um I want my audience to be black I love black men I love black women I'm thinking about shift I mean I'm I'm going towards shifting towards just doing Positive Black news what I do know is that's going to be a struggle in itself just um using my um platform that I just started on my own is definitely hard mind you I got mad people that rock with me but moving into my own they're just like I don't know the support I got 2,000 people what over 2,000 now because I just started Ed my page or started utilizing my page where I'm like okay you know what Rebecca you got to get your own money you got to step up your game um but I'm like I got over 2,000 that over 2,000 is is is good to me it's enough for me if I can like um re T was saying if I can just touch one person enough for me baby I'm I'mma keep rocking I want to build my audience even if it's Brick by Brick even I want to build my audience to be black I don't care what kind of conversations if you're here just hate watching whatever I do want a black audience I love the white folks that come in and you know allies and they're being taught something but I do but yeah yeah I want my black folks to be okay and comfortable to be like I'm ra rock with Rebecca I'mma support her I'm I want that too I don't want to be looked like at oh I love her that black girl doing her thing as a Goodwill show because I'm a content creator too okay but that's too is like perception becomes reality right like even like with the AL whether it be the algorithm or whatever have you people gravitate towards content creators they think other people watch and do well too after a while and they think you're successful at it if they perceive you as not being successful they stop going to you you know what I mean even the people who are going to you for what they for what it is that they liked right so it becomes like a like there there becomes like a limit I've and I've had this struggle with myself because F was telling me this from a long time when I first got on YouTube like oh YouTube don't care for diversifying and this is the next thing and I'm resistant and I but it does become eventually where you have to be aware that you have an audience or something that that expect something from you or they want something from you because at the end of the day if they don't want it from you they're not going to take it from you it's like you know I hate to be out there pulling stuff from 50 Cent but I uh we know you we did Church said I can be in a [ __ ] net so I write like in 50 Cent book 50 Cent talked about why he is so successful by compared to other rappers and he's like I could smell when The Jig Is up when [ __ ] didn't no longer want it from me I think he's like I think it was a crack a bottle or I can't remember which song he said it was but he was like I performed it abroad and it was they loved it was [ __ ] with it was going crazy there was crickets you know what I mean in the states he couldn't get nobody and he's like I realized like how the perception of his or rap or what the game is after a certain point they don't want that from me this a young man's G and I needed to figure out how he's like that's why I switched to water I did like Vitamin Water he's like because I don't drink I don't do this let me do this and me blah blah blah I figur it out I think eventually you have to you have to have some kind of awareness like it's great we we're we're able to create a platform and and make and have an audience in a world would say just in general if you were if none of us had platforms and we were asking the mainstream World they would say none of us could or we wouldn't be able to Garner opt like audiences they wouldn't believe that but once you have and you do it to you do eventually have to become aware of like who [ __ ] with you how you're perceived and who will gravitate towards there and serve them because if you don't then nobody you serve nobody you eventually you just fall off one one thing uh conscious and uh uh Rebecca alluded to is the gender nature of how you're perceived for the politics we tend to dabble in and there's you know obviously there's male privilege y yada but specifically with black men being politically inclined is one of the more slept on ways that black men have been able to healthily sometimes like claim masculinity you know what I'm saying there's this Legacy of the black male leader and um when I look at my comments you know when I the black male you know viewers I collect in between whenever I dare to be nice to black women or gay people um they're all like yeah we need more of this we more strong Brothers D and then the black women say the same thing until I talk about trash people or share something from uh from Soul bunny or another Creator that's lgbtq and some of them same folks it it's this is one of the reason why I say patriarchy is genderist although obviously is more indulged in by a lot of black men um because they'll come to me and conscious and to to a lesser extent foreign foreign you too good-looking they intimidated by you on so many levels listen yes yes my pretty beh brother you got to be medium ugly Medi medium ugly when you put on the aprons have you seen your comment section I don't want to hear that [ __ ] from you conscious I'm medium ugly draws I'm medium ugly man listen I put por on the episode and my girlfriends was like I'm not going to lie to you I ain't seen nothing but the [ __ ] in the Red Square hey like saying for I don't even know what he said I like looking at him yes I had from my desirability video I had me forign and Noah who was love Noah oh [ __ ] love no like you think THS get love Noah's white spicy white uh I think Noah's like half Samoan or quarter some type of East Asian whatever what and then do numbers and in the middle like Dad B and so I got I got I got a couple of gay dudes they was like Hey Hey FD we still with you bro so I'm like okay cool we hit and then they get monetize that [ __ ] I have to change the thumbnail oh god oh [ __ ] I was say something important before I got to that [ __ ] gender you were on on gender and the way that we're perceived and how so get back to I think I'm more important thing is that there is something about black women's um audience cuz like I feel like I can still play into patriarchal Norms just enough to snag people for a little bit whereas I feel like black women's and and it's also about who's online right and so feel free to correct me on this but I feel like black women political content online is much more splintered and so you end up having to like dabble in different audiences and I feel like some of y'all might not want to touch on CU I ain't no shade to Kim Foster but Kim Foster got a lot of destor you know what I'm saying she know and she know she she's antagonistic to them but she also knows they're there and because she she she gives them what they want you know what I'm saying and then like Kad un package that un package package that destor what you mean by that oh you don't know about the let you do it for you do know you do know you know how rill [ __ ] right hate women ha we have the diesters are a smaller community of black women who [ __ ] hate black men divest from the Black black men behind yes and the key is they're not a lot of them but they're more online I would say than red pill [ __ ] and the hate is crazy yeah it's they say Bard us they're they're part of a like a lot of them I bet you are also like barbs like I guarantee you there cons best of bars I guarantee you the barbs watching his barbs that was FD signifier me the barbs don't like me ain't no barbs watching this be be I don't want that smoke i n that smoke listen it's it's a lot of communities I ain't scared of but the barbs I don't want no smoke from them listen I have Cat Williams I I have a a a a a funny looking white- skinned wife I talk fast I'm a country [ __ ] um I got some some some lightskinned babies you know what I'm saying yeah y y'all can come at me y'all got it like I y'all got it whatever you need I got you got it spot you yall can talk about it and I will not I will not engage back and forth with y'all yeah no there it's it's it's funny it's funny trying to appeal to the different audiences and recognizing how different people in different groups online representation is right because like a lot of I feel like black women dominate a lot of the the think tank our intellectual kind of spaces but they but the overlap between them and me as a as a lawyer who's an abolitionist and stuff there's a lot of carceral feminism that comes out of that side and that automatically and so despite that they're so the carceral feminism is so wild on that side that even though I am very much so uh like I'm for the women I have a lot of from sergeant and this they will act like you are I'm an enemy of them like you cuddle black men and then meanwhile there are a lot of black men on the internet because of the representation of of the the [ __ ] who would allow this online who the minute they see a woman they're like she hate men they any kind of critique they don't hear no Nuance they would be you hating and and so you just be damned if you do damned if you don't like I remember I put up a video it's one of my favorite videos on my channel and it's one of my it's not one of my best video like my best performing videos but it's about John Morant and explaining like the misogyny had play it there and the different racism and why like that wasn't fair and I did get I got no love either way there were black women that were like you just cuddling the black man and then there would it was crazy because there would be black men that critique women like me on the internet like assume we're against the black man but when I've noticed that they be the main ones that when a black man finds himself in a situation that's unfair based on the grounds of of of of of racism or masculine or anything like that they be the main ones kicking that black man's back in they weren't trying to hear it I'm telling you to comment just on my I was like I I I don't know who who is the audience for this support content I will argue o that for us the advocates for different individuals that we going to always be calling a crossfire when the person we advocating from advocating for is not seen as a perfect victim I think that in every instance when I'm talking about sexy um [ __ ] talking about you know what I'm saying Shana sukiana it's like to me and not only and not only black women you feel me even even the black men that say or do certain [ __ ] you know what I'm saying it's like hey it's like they've done things that I disagree with but in this instance I think they're being wronged what I find is that there is no Nuance if you did some [ __ ] up [ __ ] on Monday [ __ ] it's Sunday it's Saturday we' going to hold you to the [ __ ] up [ __ ] you did on Monday no matter how grotesque brutalizing you going through and I think that that's that to me that that's the part that just put it will be in a hard rock and a hard spot like damn so what you're saying is that if if if if if John Morant is married to a white woman I can't make any analysis about how JN Morant is being done in media because now I'm just uh uh uh Superman and caping for black men okay damn that's CRA okay now sexy red is being done wrong because y'all see as being a ratchet [ __ ] I'm from the hood my sisters identify as ratchet [ __ ] I'm not you know what I'm saying being real but I recognize that there are certain people that feel like hey you're wasting your intellect you wasting your talent you wasting your breath giving it to and advocating for somebody that don't deserve advocating for and I think that usually it's easier when it comes to like the the the mo ratchet Hood like black women but I find that that's really you know what I'm saying across across the board like even even the scariest worst part I think you know what's the worst part what I realized consistently the black people that pushed the most that have this idea of who is the deserving black representative and and respectability politics be the main [ __ ] who don't meet those requirements like and that's the thing right why and then and then you end up in this Silo where they feel like you always talking to the bisi or the other smart or whatever blah blah blah but it's like it's interesting because it's the educated [ __ ] and the [ __ ] who can get into these rooms and who do meet the standards for the respectability politics who be trying to explain like okay this is hurting you and it be the [ __ ] in the shade room comments who they would who can't even be 15 miles within the room or at the table insisting that these people should be cut off and click on the people who be there like blowing down about who is the right kind of black person and what's that click on them and look at their profiles the [ __ ] is crazy being real with you though this beef with the to me this I beef with all the black media I said simple this our beef I beef with black media is you create standards of legitimacy and credibility that you can't even meet on your best day and that's the reason why [ __ ] got beef with you because you create sentiments and climates that are literally anti- [ __ ] that literally facilitates black death and black incarceration and you do it in a way where you can't even meet those standards that you've create for yourself and that's the reason why this [ __ ] go become so aggressive they get to hide behind the cloak of entertainment because then when they to explain what the problem is the larger context the why it's dangerous they're just like oh my God y want to think piece everything just entertainment this for like this like this disclaimer shade room does not standby bullying it's likefucker you just called this you just called them a maggot you said it with the f word like how you saying want to post on Sunday cuz you play on black folks being religious you want to post a Christian comment or you want to post whatever the casid you want to post only TD Jake and his daughter and you know this is what you want to do but then after that you go into posting violence misinformation he talking about get swallowed they a post that [ __ ] though you notice that H he was talking about being swallowed the sh itself was on was on Twitter and I will never forget this um they were on Twitter the that owns that made the shade room who doesn't even have an Instagram page loged in their page to go argue with cardi B who put the shade room on blast for how they were posting her mind you the shade room always posts any they never posted that they never posted the issue that was um big on Twitter between cardi cussing the woman out the woman logged into her account just so she can start cursing cardi out and going and just this whole thing it never made it to the shade room so that they can see the quality of who's actually running it yet this person doesn't even have um an actual social media page that she was like I'm on vacation and I T I I I just logged in just to to clarify some things with cardi because it was like a legal argument and card's like I'm gonna sue the brakes off your ass and and then literally their own drama they didn't post their own drama on their page we never don't they a post TD J either like we I feel like once JJ Williams the great JJ Williams is on Tik Tock and on in stagram you feel me young young young Jamaican boy come with the listen if I was still a debate coach at at the University I would give this young man a full ride scholarship and give me two or three national championships my point though to him is that he laid out the receipts for Shay room so miraculously that the same person that did that right there logged into their personal page and started commenting in in JJ Williams comment section talking [ __ ] to him what they did was they went JJ post went viral viral on Instagram Twitter and Tik Tok they went and deleted the post where they sending misinformation about Joe Biden they didn't give any any any any any updates but they kept on basically I feel like trying to uh a virtual signal and get people to go [ __ ] on JJ Williams and to me it's just like this this did like two years ago they was when I I pointed out I made a viral video about um when they were calling the pre-trial Fairness Act for Bale reform in Chicago they were calling it The Purge law they were spreading all this [ __ ] like literal fake propaganda from the right from police saying they can't the pre-draw Fairness Act hadn't even been passed was was 6 months away from implementation at the at the earliest they were say they were already the shade ra on they saying because of the purge law um the officers are not able to arrest people for crime and d d and I put out a video like look at these lying ass [ __ ] like and that goes viral and that's my and and that's my thing though too even back to how how we do stuff is like even then to go viral or to speak in their words or inform people like if I had just been teaching people about the pre-trial Fairness Act independently of being able to attack the shade room for having called it The Purge law and whatever it wouldn't have gone viral they wouldn't have they wouldn't have you just G if you just gave it to them as the information they wouldn't take it you know on it yeah also shows how cooked we are when that that even like I remember being the high school teacher when every city in the country was planning a purge like every six months yes and that would go viral on Instagram and it's like oh we cooked these media Outlets got us they they got us dead to rights at every level every race cuz cuz let's not forget as cooked as black media is these crackers ran in the Capitol building two years ago or or four years ago now it's more outrage about Target though it's more outrage about [ __ ] burning down Target or running into a [ __ ] ass you know what I'm saying retail store and and uh stealing you know what I'm saying cheap items they Capital they paid money and rent your your lead leaders your representatives were literally funding and buses to get to the capital Y this is but they worried about they worried about the wrong things they will literally make us focus on the fact that Nicki Minaj say she didn't trust uh the covid-19 shot or whatever the f like whatever it was her C of them had a big testicle from it I don't remember what it was but they'll make you focus on that they say even rapper Nicki Minaj is saying that like the drug is has gone too far right meanwhile Joe Rogan is co denial Central like to millions of subscribers and view the number one podcast in in the world for the past 10 years damn near is like you got Aaron Rogers MFL Hall of Fame quarterback talk about I was immunized because he went to a dark room and took some herbs and spices and meditated and so now he can't get Co I'm actually curious though I wonder if we would go back can look at the archive what were the black blogs posting specifically January 6 in my mind it wasn't a lot it was black Twitter jokes it was the I remember it was just the jokes from black Twitter making remember it going viral like the white people falling off the wall and you know black be getting their [ __ ] off [ __ ] was funny but like to our point though like it's GNA be good that extremely political thing was only turned into entertainment and was not like we didn't unpackage we didn't talk about the political implications to be fair we did but those things did not catch the algorithmic or the audience exactly attention said Blog Talk Radio I mean yeah I mean I said talk radio but I mean BL talk radio I mean ball alert spiritual World sh rooms like people but the reason why they it didn't catch you know why like you said it's the algorithm it's what sells it's what what they can make money off of and that's going to be us getting our jokes off even though we're having this all of us have had on our shows or with other people the actual conversations what was real what was happening what we're afraid of what they're con wondering are they going to get any like like any reprimand for what they did because wonder why the police ain't started shooting yet Poli we had all of these actual questions but you like you said it's it's it's algorithm based and also like any conversations that we have around that they don't want us to they want to you know and you know a great example of this Donald Trump recently how he's talking to black groups while he's campaigning what they think of us right they think that we like we like the sneakers right and they think that we like criminal records this is all that we can relate to I got five indictments your cousin got five indictments both of you yeah so that's it so he's though right now they think so little of us and the bar is so low they're like oh yeah these black folks are thinking it's funny let's go ahead and start um switching you know writing up these legislations let's start [ __ ] up things and the next thing you know we wake up the next morning more rights for our reproductive system are gone like it's just like it's all these things and and I this is what I don't like this is what I don't like but what goes viral is the key keying about it or all of that stuff Meanwhile we're actually having these conversations they just won't put them they just I think larger so here's the thing I think larger platforms and stuff have the ability to you have the ability to shape your audience and like teach feed people different things and show them things and content that they otherwise wouldn't have gravitated towards or whatever have you right like that's why they go and put the academics on the rumble so they could turn people right you know by exposing them to this kind of Outlet or whatever and the same can be done the other way so I for me the problem is not necessarily that like Charlamagne or especially not them or whatever I don't think they're the worst offenders people give Charlamagne a lot of grief they need to go give to to the rest of these Outlets um but I think and my problem is not with charlam man and these people being in the room and having these conversations right because the reality is they have a larger black audience than we have so I don't and like very often I don't think like I said in this particular run bringing us back to the beginning I don't think what charlam man and them has been saying during this election cycle is much different than what the the intellectuals have been having the more nuanced conversations about or whatever from the left we you just don't hear from that and we have this attitude of like you say the perfect messenger the perfectness people decide what you are you've done this thing so they don't want to hear from you on anything and so I wonder what becomes the responsibility do the black media Outlets or the black people that do have access and stuff have an obligation to to try to increase the number of black people that are there to try and bring to bring them on because often what they do is they don't they have these so much of people people are turning into the Joe butons they're turning to the Charlamagne they listening to Killer Mike they doing all these things and those people bring on right-wing propaganda forces they bring on right-wing candidates they you know you got Joe Buon talking to Candace Owens you got them bringing up a rightwing um a candidate on The Breakfast Club every other day um whether those people have any chances of ever winning doing anything being influential but that's who they bring so I'm wondering how much is the obligation of these people to start changing who they bring or what they do and how what is our role and how we change how we package information like are we too are we being too academic too in the clouds and alienating people I don't think so I I don't think we're being so academic yeah um we do need to like I said earlier Elevate voices within our political realm that sound closer to the Joe Buttons of the world so that so that they see themselves represented but more than anything I just really feel like apart from massive upheaval in these systems we're playing a slow game right we're playing a slow game where we have to build viable platforms with a whole different aesthetic and rhetoric and we we all of us need to get on Instagram with with consciously like every single like I'm only on YouTube I be I be trying to like I I just I can't fck too much for me I'm sorry I'm on there I'm on all I'm on but but I'm on my way I'm on my way with to Instagram soon with some with some show we can all dominate in each and we need a consciously on on Tik Tok we need you guys to be on YouTube we need some people who are are on in their Instagram space the reason why we need to be on Instagram is because here's the thing even I I I can I think about my my audience in the aggregate like adding all of the numbers from all my different platforms but the audience is there are different my audience on Instagram is very black you know what I mean it's very black because that's where the black people are So eventually if you talking on Twitter you talking on YouTube you you gonna be talking to a bunch of white people you know what I mean like if you want to capture black people you kind of have that responsibity you go where they are yeah you have to go they are yeah okay so that that point if you if you want your audience to be black go where the black people are but also I think that have to be in all these spaces right uh not not all at once though I'm going tell you for me in my house I'm not about to be doing six jobs playing double dud trying to be on everybody's whatever and I don't want to keep reposting stuff on all this stuff because sometimes I just want my ass to be out on Instagram I don't want to be you know whatever I want my Instagram to page to be like that and then I want my YouTube page to be this so but at the same time we do need like a representation in each one of these spaces too there doesn't only have to be one but if where you are dominating it's good we need consciously on the Tik Tok space people love him and and what he does there um you know and for for all you the rest of y'all I know YouTube is where where you thrive do you know where Olay thrives Twitter is her is her world it's her playground she tried to leave but it's always calling her back that's where she live at that's what that's just what it is so you know I think that but we have to be in all these spaces and if we want to but you are right about that Olay if we want our audiences to be black to go into those spaces to proom promote where we we are most popular at and you know they can come in and be there or whatever the case may be but on Instagram the another reason why maybe Instagram would be that be that place is because the the the influx of misinformation Twitter like nobody's business the influx of misinformation from these black sites that are are thriving on um on Instagram I think that we should I I would love I don't want to make these people um the poster children or the PO the face of Blackness but on Instagram for some reason spiritual world who started out posting out Bible verses okay start now they posting Out All the gossip and all that stuff still under the name spiritual world that's wild but you know that page you know to I wish that they would tap into uh the professionalist like the professionals that we are and have us in those platforms that would be a smart move not just having one journalist but having people like us in their platforms to interview to have these conversations and then to lead and educate the people who are miseducated in the comment section that's only right and you know what's crazy is like even if you try to be the funny thing I just thought about is like even if you you played an inflammatory game as um a black person right like a content creator trying to do it not only do you run into the issue of um you know feeling like you compromise your own values or messaging or selling your soul a little bit to what you originally wanted to do but eventually you could your extremity that will make you successful in terms of Engagement will be also the reason why they gatekeep you because that's the reason Umar brings numbers to everybody's platform but they won't give him his own show you know what I mean Umar been running been running people's engagement up for for to dumb milons exact but they will not give him his own platform he will not get one because there's a limit to how much they will take of outrageousness from us in a particular direction you know what I mean so that's a point though that's a point though that is a point though think about it there are a lot of that's true that's true yeah that's true thank you thank you thank you that feels like a good like we we can wrap that up on a good point we up we can WRA it up show wouldn't appreciate you talking about like that either I me he should be the next guest on o and friends coming next Dr Umar Johnson talking about first of all I would talk to Umar and I would too swear to God I Dr you probably get along I think so my black sister I don't hate a lot like I try to there's something TS M was having this conversation with me and she was saying that the reason why someone like her could con like she connects or resonates with every versus different voices is because she she's like I'm GNA talk to everybody in a real I'mma meet them where they at you know what I mean I could be the [ __ ] on the Block I could be the [ __ ] outside she feels like she said that she thinks that we are too um we are we have to be prepared to recognize that it's a process like growing you know um with people right like it's like if you're trying to educate people and you're recognizing that they're they're not starting where you're starting you have to be willing to not be trying to throw them evict them from the community when they say things or they do things that are not where you're at or as Progressive and I think that's a big problem we have on our side and I don't even mean and I don't even mean me as an individual because I don't feel I'm a defense attorney I don't I don't feel a very throw people away evict people manner about problematic [ __ ] that's why I I kind of frequent I you know I could run around and know some people on the [ __ ] net and stuff it's the audience that you serve that wants you to be that way that can be and they will be I cannot express to you how much times I get the pitchforks because I don't feel the need to [ __ ] violently condemn somebody it don't be it yeah yeah like I don't feel the way they feel about the Charlamagne and the breakfast clubs that's like kind of dismiss you named your favorite comedian and had the whole world C Chris is my favorite comedian it was one of the times like I feel like I don't feel sorry for my fellow content creators a lot but I can think of two unique times that I like uniquely felt sorry for Olay I was like I'm about to call Sis man cuz damn they doing a bad talk about Twitter had them times to you not too long ago they will rip true they would do that they'll cancel you somebody I'm not even a big like my 2 F somebody wrote me cuz I had on aara dress I didn't know what Zara what they supported I put on a Zara I love the way it was fitting my body and somebody are we are are we supporting is that what we're doing are we supporting Zara now is Tear Me Apart like it's Puma like I mean like [ __ ] just act like this is a whole Puma Nazi regalia that I wearing right now when there there there's the thing shout out to another uh person n grada in the space Hassan he had a really good piece of analysis with this where he was like we we as as much as people call themselves leftists a lot of us has very liberal sensibilities toward the politics being based the politics being a way to present like a personal brand of goodness that's what versus actually the political you know goals of the left Theory yeah and so one thing he pointed out is that like that's why there's so much um scrutiny over what you consume and who you talk to and things like that because the argument is where you're uh validating and promoting their rhetoric and their presence in the media which like critically speaking Les I I get how that works in in some cases but overall it's more about policing who is a good person to consume and not and if you manage to be a good person the only way to be a good person to consume is to not have any glaring areas where you can be critiqued to not be leftist enough for my consumption and that creates this whole other kind of ridiculous world of Standards where it's like listen I I like barbecue yeah I cook animals they are delicious you want me you want me to give you a long standing cultural turn they innately take you out of and that kind of if you do that it innately removes you from the black community because I'm like we don't start off the act like we said especially for for know where we from Beeman are conservative like like Beeman a believe the [ __ ] that you know we are not representative of a Beman view set you know um like for example like like with the Chris Rock thing where where I got attacked cuz I like cuz I said and this is what I said I said Chris Rock is my favorite standup comedian so I'm so excited for this new standup you don't know the amount of black women that I don't know from a [ __ ] hole in the wall that came out talking about they always knew I was a a misogynist and I like they just could tell something about me they could feel it they could blah blah blah blah blah just because Chris Rock is a sucker if you like suckers you're a sucker too they get you know what get to my nerves I feel like everybody like the left has this tendency to want to act like like they don't know how to be good defense attorneys like they think that to be able to to be able to defend Will Smith from a from obvious anti-blackness and police and racism and how he was being perceived and policing him they feel like they have to vilify Chris Rock right and it's like you can't just critique Chris Rock for the joke or or that you can point out times in his in his um history where he's had views that you can see where there's misogyny in that with good hair blah blah blah it has to be it can't be this one this critique in there where someone has an area to improve on it has to be now this person has never done anything valuable they are overall anti-black and they're not for the black community and I'm like where the [ __ ] are you getting it from I've been watching ch Ruck standing my entire life this one of the most like very race conscious observed this da d d da but like it becomes that you know and and that's a dangerous game to play because who will meet those standards what black Creator thinker who in the black community is going to meet that you know and then how do we how do we maintain our own Community audience if everybody in the black community we are expected to take the task like and condemn outright and give no room for growth because a lot of people they will there are a lot of people and figures that have done problematic things and have like come out apologized explained on their own voluntarily how they've changed they've learned in ch and they will just all nonstop hold over their head forever yeah Martin Mal Martin and Malcolm in this environment Martin wouldn't make it you want to talk about it's not just Martin and Malcolm you want to talk about every aspect you want to talk about Bill hooks was a landlord oh George George Jackson was a misogynist kwami Tay lowkey misogynist like uh you know what I'm saying like all these [ __ ] have serious problem uh [ __ ] WB de Boyce my favorite [ __ ] was Eugenics he was a sucker ass [ __ ] manwe the boys was a sucker I'm talking about you mean that now listen listen listen this new episodes I just did n down onig got some sucking [ __ ] I'm sorry we I know I know that [ __ ] was [ __ ] up they will blow down on those [ __ ] and then use them they will they will blow down on them and then in the next breath deify all the dead um leaders and thinkers so that they could vilify the present day ones cuz like sometimes you'll be saying something trying to explain like where there should be some space for especially with like creatives and artists and in this world where they want you to take a stance on everything and if and if the people online are mad about something you need to express that you're mad about it or take a stance or whatever else you did that was completely independent of this thing you're a bad guy and they'll like bring up they'll be like oh Nina Sone did this and Prince did this I be like n Sone was married to a [ __ ] cop like would tear her apart in present day you know what I mean need someone beat the brakes off a child y'all would tear her apart but you see what I'm saying my favorite is Prince is the most homorotic homophobe ever yes Prince was so homophobic insane time incredibly wearing all the all all the outfits he was but we but here's the thing black folks will get online I can't say it's only black folks but when I see white people do it they don't do we be the ones making a scene we have to cancel you can't do this you can't white people too they expect something for their that their beloved black content creator they expect things they expect you to be some kind of way and then black folks will be fighting and like saying say that we got to cancel people they will be um they also hold up pick a signs and be like no we can't f with this person meanwhile I know for me lebe I know if they go back to my two early 2000s tweets cancel me tonight because you know I grew over time I grew I understood I went through life experiences you know when I was like 19 1820 I didn't know what I was talking about I was T to things that were probably instilled with me into me from my family from the church or whatever the case may be I went through life my mind changed I got Jesus for myself I got [ __ ] for myself I got work for myself I got all these experiences have changed how I how I think I now I understand what bills are all and so but me back in the day people will tell me I have no there was why are we taking anything from Rebecca when when she was about this age this is what she said why we why are we listening to what she's saying so yeah it's it's ridiculous yeah child I yeah I I don't know how we do it I I don't because I feel like some there becomes a point where sometimes I realize people are not really listening they're not listening to us for what we they're hoping that we mirror what they already think and feel you know what I mean you're my chosen Avatar and you are supposed to tell me affirm what it is that I think and feel in my experience and having having to like trying to exist in a space where especially if you're considered like a leftist Creator a leftist thinker like we are exist in a space where your audience feels like you account there's all this accountability and you need to be hear this and blah blah blah so you're and everybody has this idea that you know it's arrogance if you don't listen to them and you don't take their feedback and their criticisms and it's constructive and they're calling you in but it's like [ __ ] I have hundreds of thousands of people on this here internet trying to tell me how to be all of you have a different Viewpoint and you feel adamant about it your matter it's like what the [ __ ] do you do you know like yeah yeah people don't understand and this is something people don't understand that this is such an unnatural medium to communicate through that's right and and and and we don't we still don't know like this [ __ ] is really new we're 10 years deep in this like you talking about Twitter like I'm happy I was late to Twitter cuz 2012 FD would not would not survive uh modern modern Twitter world I'm so happy I thought Twitter was lame at the time I didn't get on Twitter till I started making content and so like we don't know how any of this works and I'm hoping it's not going to be like this for long for a whole lot longer cuz this [ __ ] can't continue because it's impossible to communicate complex nuanced ideas when the mediums themselves shout out to CD c CJ X when the mediums themselves are really only Built for engagement and engagement is more about eliciting strong emotions the easiest one to do that is anger and then like maybe lust right yeah everything else after that is a whole lot of extra work so how can we translate this nuanced thoughtful take you had Olay into I hate black women or I hate black men so we're gonna fig we're gonna draw a line to that but but point out that that that's that that struggle is really for black content creators black media that's that struggles for us I can go on Tik Tok and watch a white woman literally stare into the camera and look at how many many views she will get and watch a black woman do the same thing and get NADA listen they for us thetic orig point about life in life we have to work and be six times you know we got do hard it's a conveyor Bel it's a product and unfortunately content creators are you're not just doing the Crea creating you are being created right and so I think part of the thing that's really hard is like when y'all are pushing back against that which y'all should it's it's part of the conversation where it's just like nothing about this meta world is different than the other world and it's like a conveyor belt and people want to consume blackness in a particular way and black people that are trying to get other black people to consume things are following those same rules and that's the [ __ ] that's really [ __ ] up because it's like we should do better but people want to get to the bag they want to build the audience you know what works can't beat them join them like that's facts no you're right y'all right y'all all [Music] [Music] right
