what's up guys today we're talking season 7 episode 1 of Game of Thrones chances are if you come to this channel you don't come here for TV show reviews but I really like Game of Thrones I want to talk about Game of Thrones and if you're not a fan of the show or this isn't the kind of content that you want to watch then it's labeled very clearly and you guys can feel free to click off that being said going forward I am going to review Game of Thrones week to week and sometimes like today I'll do it alone and sometimes I'll bring in people to talk about the show all right now that we got all that [ __ ] out of the way let's get into the episode so at the beginning of the episode we see the army of the Dead marching towards the wall now if you've been watching since season 1 you know that they're moving very very slowly because they've been marching towards the wall since the end of season 1 however we did find out from Bene and Stark that there is Magic in the wall that actually prevents them from Crossing it so until those spells are broken they can't actually invade so the shot of the army of the Dead Walking is really more of a reminder for the audience that this is a looming threat and eventually they will get there but it's not likely that they'll get there soon speaking of approaching the wall Brendan Stark actually made it to the wall and he is now with the knight's watch Brendan Stark is like the only character aside from possibly Littlefinger that knows Jon Snow's real origin so him coming back from Beyond the Wall as the three-eyed Raven is potentially a big thing for the series one of the next big things that we see is Arya Stark after her assassination of Wal def fry she's actually posing as wall def fry and she invites all of his sons For A Feast of course Arya being the badass that she is poisons all of his sons and then she tells one of his daughters that winter has come and the north remembers now as epic as this event was in the show I do have to take it outside of the context of the series because this scene actually caused a lot of leftists on Twitter and in social media to dub Arya Stark the symbol of the resistance the problem with that of course is that this is the same left that talks about how Republicans have violent rhetoric how Trump is going to cause Violence by tweeting out memes of CNN but the symbol of the resistance to Trump is going to be a girl that assassinates political leaders seriously if you're on the left can you not ruin Arya Stark or Game of Thrones everybody that I know loves the series no matter where they fall in the political Spectrum everybody that I know loves Arya Stark as a character can you not make a political issue out of her thanks I'd appreciate now after that Arya decided to go south because she wants to assassinate xeri Lannister and she bumped into a guy along the way and it was an awkward Cameo that a lot of people pointed out I personally didn't notice this because I don't know a lot of singers or people in the music industry but a lot of people pointed out how awkward and clunky it was and on rewatch I definitely noticed that this dude's singing was like on a different audio track you know because he's a singer so he has to sing in the show but he has to sing really good in the show even though they're soldiers just fighting a war I'm not sure about this but I think that the reason why this guy got a cameo in Game of Thrones is because the actress that plays Arya Stark really really likes him and I know it bothered a lot of people people but I didn't really notice it and like if you're going to do a cameo make sure it's a minor character that I don't really notice and we're good anyway speaking of xeri and the Lannisters and King's Landing we actually get a shot of xeri on the world map talking about how they have enemies on all sides of them she mentions as a comeback in her little argument with Jamie Lannister that she's the queen of the Seven Kingdoms and Jamie points out that she's the queen of three maybe four at best since all their enemies are rallying against them and just a quick refresher the nor is under the rule of Jon Snow Daenerys is approaching from the sea you have the tyrells who are angry that xeri killed all the people in the Tyrell bloodline and you have the dornish who are against the Lannisters So Jamie points out the circumstances that the Lannisters find themselves in he tells xeri about the assassination of all the defas and he points out that they need allies in the worst way and that brings us to Uncle Greyjoy AKA Sabertooth from X-Men Origins Wolverine he comes to King's Landing seeking marriage from xeri you learn about the disdain that everybody has for the ironborn which which I believe was also touched on when Jamie Lannister met Theon in season 1 and basically Uncle Greyjoy promises xeri a gift that will prove his loyalty not sure what that is but we'll find out we also get an update on the hound and the brothers without banners they actually returned to the home where the hound and Arya stayed for a little while and then the Hound ended up robbing the guy and they find him and his kid dead in the home honestly I like the Hound he's an interesting character in everything but the brothers without Banners are super boring to me so that's pretty much it we also get an update on Sam studying to be a maer we see Ser Jor stick his arm out and it's all Stony and icky and basically he's been seeking treatment with the maesters I'm actually pretty sure that sir Jor is going to get cured I feel like he's going to get cured by the red woman I'm not sure if it's confirmed that this is how stannis's daughter got killed but Sis's daughter had the sickness on her face and sanis scoured the Earth for a cure for his daughter and he ended up marrying the red woman and I'm pretty sure the two are connected even if it wasn't explicitly stated if you remember from the finale of season 6 the red woman is is heading south so I think she is going to somehow wind up curing seror or maybe he'll die miserably and in pain who the [ __ ] knows anyway Sam sneaks into the secret part of the library finds out that Dragon Stone the Targaryen home is built on a mountain made of dragon Glass Dragon glass cures the white walkers Sam was sent to find a way to defeat the white walkers so this is obviously super important and then we have the most interesting stuff for me and that's the stuff with Jon Snow sitting at the table after he's been declared the King of the North he makes the decision that everybody will be trained in battle men or women boy or girl lady Mormont supports him there's a little dispute but that's not that big of a deal what's actually a big deal is Jon gets into his first little power struggle with Sansa you see there are Northern families that sided with the boltons the castarts and the ambers and sza wants them punished for siding with the boltons give the castles to the families of the men who died Fighting For You John disagrees he points out that the actual traitors died on the battlefield and it makes no sense to punish the family for the sins of of one member of the family sansa's argument is that JN should punish those who betray him and reward those families that are loyal to him John ends up looking at her like [ __ ] I was declared the King of the North you were not declared the queen of the north end of conversation but I will not punish a son for his father's sins and I will not take a family home away from a family it has belonged to for centuries that is my decision and my decision is final and we get the castar and the Amber kids swearing an oath of felty now the reason that this is a big deal is because Littlefinger is aligned with Sansa and if you remember way back to the beginning of the series Sansa didn't really care for John snow and Sansa was always the Stark the most interested in power she actually talks about how much she learned from xeri Lannister and xeri Lannister does not get undercut also this could be the first step of Jon Snow falling into the same exact trap that Rob Stark fell into if you remember the reason why the castars Betrayed the Starks is because Rob Stark executed the head of the castars for killing Lannister children so we know that the perception that you don't reward your allies and that you cater to your enemies has really negatively impacted the Starks in the past and it looks like Sans is aware of that but Jon is just acting like Ned Stark he's Noble which by the way now that I think of it it's not only what got Ned Stark killed and Rob Stark it's also what got Jon Snow killed when he was at Castle black so I'm not really sure how long the King of the North is going to be a thing that being said there was an important line in the episode where Jon Snow points out that Dragon glass is is more valuable than gold to the north right now which brings us to Daenerys Targaryen Daenerys actually lands at Dragonstone her ancestral Homeland and I believe this is the first time she's been there since she was a child if not ever the scene is super quiet in terms of dialogue just a building score to underscore how epic this moment is because we've been waiting since the very beginning for the Targaryen Invasion to happen or at least since the dragons were born so it's a really epic moment there's not a lot of dialogue until Daenerys goes into the war room and then she's ready to start making her strategy should we begin all in all I really enjoyed this episode it set up a lot of things that will pay off later which is what a first episode of a season is about to do but it also opened and closed with really epic moments ARA Stark assassinating the phrase and Daenerys landing at Dragon Stone now as for the preview of next week's episode I don't really want to get into previews too much but there was one moment that I do want to point out and that's the little misdirect that was thrown our way we get a moment where a member of the north is scre scaming how you can never trust a Targaryen and then it's a quick cut to Jon because as we know now Jon is half Targaryen and it's supposed to do one of two things number one if you're dumb you're supposed to think that in the next episode Jon finds out his true Origins number two is for the people that are actually paying attention basically in the next episode Jon Snow will probably find out two things number one that Daenerys has landed at Dragon Stone and number two that Dragon stone is basically a mountain of dragon glass so when that guy's yelling about never being able to trust the Targaryen he's probably yelling that at Jon in reference to Daenerys because Jon would most likely cut a deal for the dragon glass because it's that epic of course if you know the history of Game of Thrones you'll know that Ned Stark's father and Ned Stark's older brother were assassinated by the Mad King most of the world believes that rhaegar Targaryen kidnapped Leanne Stark Ned's sister raped her and killed her so the hatred for the targaryens in the north is definitely a powerful thing that being said it was stated way back when Rob Stark was declared the King of the North that the Northerners bow to the dragons that they don't bow to Southern Kings so the fact that Daenerys has dragons might change some opinions in the north but who knows anyway that's all I really have for you guys today it was a good episode very setup heavy it was bookended with two epic moments and I feel like Jon snow is starting to sew the seeds of his own destruction again if you like this video then please show me by leaving a like you can join the conversation by leaving a
