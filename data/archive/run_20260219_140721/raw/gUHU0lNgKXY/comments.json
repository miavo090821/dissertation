        "text": "@Carl-yz7ym The Balkans mostly.  They are ''relatively'' easy to get hold of in continental Europe compared to the UK. \n In the Netherlands leaving a grenade taped to the door of a business you want closed down (i.e. a rival or someone who's not paying protection money) is pretty common, as is shooting the windows out, always in the dead of night, it's about getting the authorities to close that business down, not hurting anyone although obviously it's dangerous. \nI lived in Netherlands 2009-2018.  In early 2018 a shisha shop on Jan Everstenstraat in Amsterdam,  near where Iived had that done to them, and was closed down for 3 months. A police spokesman appeared on AT5 nieuws and said that Serbian manufactured hand grenades could be purchased illegally for as little as 5 Euros.\n''Plofkraken'' or using explosive to blow up a cashpoint has been a thing there for over a decade now too, it's spread over the border into Germany.  20 years ago you wouldn't have heard of that in Europe, although it was already common in South Africa.\nSometime in the early 2010s small rocket launchers were fired at the offices of a newspaper (Het Parool, or maybe it was Panorama magazine, can't remember) and the court building on Parnassusweg in A'dam. \nFirearms like Skorpion SMGs and obviously AK variants are also used a fair bit.  Back in 2012 there was a robbery on Brinks in A'dam Zuidoost, the police chased but were stopped by heavy machine gun fire which I think even destroyed an engine block of a police car.\nI had to laugh when I saw a UK police report showing Victorian black powder guns which a gang in Birmingham had.  In the Netherlands you can just buy those in antique shops, no licence, but no  criminal is going to use one of those there when their competitors have military hardware.",

        "text": "@ Yes of course but they generally don't deploy members of 3 of the branches - Landmacht, Luchtmacht, Marine (including Korps Mariniers) against civilians.  However I've heard of Marines in the 70s and 80s deployed in Amsterdam, against squatters, to ''sweep'' hippies off Dam Square, and to sweep streets in the Red Light District free of junkies.  Also a famous train hijacking in the 70s was dealt with by the military including the Air Force, with at least one fighter jet involved but that was a distraction manoeuvre.\n\nNowadays it's the 4th branch of the military, the Royal Marechaussee, who can be deployed against civilians.  They are fully trained soldiers but after training are deployed as military police (policing the other 3 branches), as royal guards and close protection, as immigration in airports and on trains and roads - if you have entered Schiphol airport you'd have come across them  sitting in cabins checking passports, but most foreigners would just assume that they are police.  They also do patrols in and around the airport and all kinds of other places.  Finally the dreaded ME - mobile eenheiden (mobile units) are Marechaussee riot police.  Oh yes and they do a kind of ''US Marshals'' thing as well, if someone is being extradited to the Netherlands they will go to the country they have been arrested in, and bring that person back.\n\nWhen a grenade or something similar is found it's dealt with by EOD (explosieven opruimingsdienst) from the army, with normal police.  \n\nDespite what I said in my last comment, it isn't a warzone or anything like it in the Netherlands.",

The answer is no. The reason is very fundamental, think about this logically... beliefs and especially religious beliefs, have a direct effect on social behaviors, if beliefs direct people to be loving, forgiving, merciful, peaceable then that will be manifest in a society, however, if a belief system is the opposite of that, then you will see unrest, stagnation and evil manifested in those societies. It is a historical fact that ALL Western societies started with strong Christian beliefs, and it's no accident that those beliefs have been slowly destroyed over the past 125+ years and has brought us to the current disastrous situation that we are in today... but how do we fix this? Is it fixable?.\n\nGenetics do play a very important role in who we are, but, that will only take you so far, Western nations have lost their core founding beliefs, their core power, Christ.",

Since it wasn't true, and Trump had been tricked by the video, Swedes laughed at him for a full day.

They instead live in all Swedish neighborhoods and never encounter any problems that the immigration has caused. And they tell themselves how good of a person they are so they can sleep good at night. \n\nBut now they have suddenly woken up and wonder how we could have possibly ended up with so much shootings and bombings and gun violence. \n\nAnd now the money that generations of native Swedish have paid in taxes are close to gone. People can’t be sick anymore. People die waiting for healthcare. The schools are horrible. The Police can do nothing. \n\nAll because they have given free money to all immigrants they have taken in.

The only invention emanating from any islamic culture is the minaret. All else (science, medicine design etc) comes from pre-islamic cultures (eg. Persia), islam now claims its own. Cultures under islam have never generated a renaissance in thought, science or art, they are forbidden. \n\nThe modern wave of islamic migration to western countries worldwide is a repeat exercise, enabled by leftists (as you say), the EU and a web of global economists, for power. Not wise, as all their plots will buckle under the islamic surge. Sweden obeyed all EU directives without question and is our first profound example of the end game, islamists now form their own \"political parties\" (eg. UK, Germany) demanding law changes and power. \n\nPresident Erdogan (Turkey) said in 2022: there is no such thing as moderate islam, there is only islam.",

The only party that I can remember having raised the issue of immigration has been the Sweden Democrats, who want to limit it. Very often the other parties have, when given the chance, criticised them for being racists. Often the reason for the criticism has been simple: the only legitimate reason the critic can see to limit immigration is racism. Thus the Sweden Democrats must be racists.\n\nAnd things got really bizarre during the pandemic: if a Swedish citizen arrived at the Swedish border and wanted to go home (eg after holidays abroad), the person would have been turned back. But any non-Swedish citizen who arrived at the same border and claimed to seek asylum would have been let in...\n\nAnd FWIW: I am a Swedish citizen, living in Sweden.",

They instead live in all Swedish neighborhoods and never encounter any problems that the immigration has caused. And they tell themselves how good of a person they are so they can sleep good at night. \n\nBut now they have suddenly woken up and wonder how we could have possibly ended up with so much shootings and bombings and gun violence. \n\nAnd now the money that generations of native Swedish have paid in taxes are close to gone. People can’t be sick anymore. People die waiting for healthcare. The schools are horrible. The Police can do nothing. \n\nAll because they have given free money to all immigrants they have taken in. With sums that are equal to ordinary Swedish salary. \n\nYe mass immigration is great guys!",

I told my parents, and friends what will happen to Sweden if we dont stop it. And here we are, i was right. Funny how a little kid like i was back then had a better understanding of all of this, than the politicians have. This has happened because the Social democrats had power for over 16+ years or something,.  and its all happening because these type of people have a diffrent culture than us. They dont fit in well to our society. And alot of them DO NOT even want to be like us. I meet people that been living here for 14 years , that havent even bothered with learning our language, and yet they expect to get welfare and stuff like us that pay taxes.",

Secondly because they propose social spending cuts in the country with the highest tax income on earth.",

        "text": "@P-K-P I do understand your statement. Let me clarify something for you. When a baby sees a person with a different skin color for the first time, they might react with fear or confusion. This is not because the baby has any prejudice, it’s simply an instinctual fear of the unknown. That’s called xenophobia, a natural reaction to unfamiliar situations or people. You wouldn’t label a baby as racist, right?\n\nRacism, however, is something entirely different. It is a learned behavior, shaped by societal influences and past experiences with certain groups of people.\n\nI do understand your statement, and I think you are right. But I just have to clarify that there is a difference between these two. So, to summarize it: xenophobia is a natural instinct, while racism is learned through experiences with other groups of people",

Mass immigration from non-Western countries is used as a tool to weaken  the social cohesion and that will lead to weakening of national identities. This is what is happening. \nWe Europeans should hold on to our indigenous cultures and languages, work in unison, not argue with each other. Try to do something about the situation. Something non-violent. Something democratic. Grass-roots activity. And politics of course too, because at some point the politicians must start listening to their constituencies... In Denmark this seems to be happening already:  they have strongly restricted immigration and the politicians have explicitly stated that immigration from muslim countries is not beneficial for Denmark.  Poland and Hungary seem to have been outside of it from the beginning, and that is why they get scolded by the EU all the time. - Bravo Poland and Hungary, you still remember the Ottomans...! - Yes I think muslims and islamization is an issue in itself, in addition the mass immigration in general...",

The immigrants vote for the politicians who speak for them and who want to make immigration easier for their friends and families. This is understandable, and I don´t blame the immigrants for voting the parties who have their interest in mind! But there is another side to this too. The non-Western immigrants and refugees are usually from countries where there is no democracy, often even totalitarian regimes. They come from countries where women have no rights. Where \"child \"marriages\" are allowed (Iraq just legalized adult men marrying 9-year old girls) etc. The immigrants bring their cultures with them. And from the point of view of the global elite who have corrupted the Western governments, the people who have grown up without the concept of democracy are much easier to rule than we, the citizens of the free world.

    "text": "Hi Swede here, What they are saying in the video is very true but sadly doesn't cover the whole picture. Sadly the \"Right\" in Sweden are too cowardly to do anything about this simply because they seek the approval of the left in Sweden. and because they do that Nothing will truly change for a simple reason they don't have the spine to do it. They might do small countermeasures like this but not anything that will result in real change. I say this as someone who voted for the \"Right\" and I am quite disappointed in how they have handled the situation. Now sure they have inherited allot of problems from the left government that has ruled Sweden since the 2000s. Yes, I know the Moderates and the rightwing coalition ruled for 8 years but they were very much a part of helping this problem grow and now they are back in power again.\n\nThe Swedish right is divided between to factions the old right which are the Moderate (M) and Kristiandemocrats (KD) and the new right which are the nationalists in the Swedish Democrats on SD for short. On the left, we have the Left party (Communists) The Greens, The Liberal ( used to be part of the right), The Centrists ( Green but with liberal market ideas so WFF bs), and finally the Social Democrats. Now the left colation wants to basically keep this order and not really fix it because they don't see any of this as a real problem until it affects them and it would be to late to change anything at that point because the old right M and KD want to play \"nice\" with the left they have basically hamstrung them self into inefficiency. Only the Nationalists want to actually solve the problem but they stigam around them even if they are proven more and more correct by each passing day. They are still hated by the mainstream and demonized to a degree.\n\nFor Sweden to fix itself would require a political will that currently doesn't exist because some people don't want to ruffle any feathers, and because of that, we are tied to suffering. My only question is how long will the Swedish people accept this my fear is that one day the people will say enough is enough and take the law into their own hands and if that day comes ( I hope not because it will be bloody and unnecessary ) Our ruling class will face a difficult decision. I pray that the will is found sooner rather than later and that instead of being afraid of ruffling some feathers the political will is found ( along with a spine ) in the old \"right\" to support the nationalists 100% in their ideas and plans to clean up the country and restore law and order. Some independent news media in Sweden are calling for a Nayib Bukele to clean the streets and honestly, at this point, I am all for it. I don't care about the criminals anymore.\n\nI know it is a long post, but I hope it made some logical sense, and feel free to comment if you want clarification on anything. Best Regards a Swede who is seeing his home being ruined.",

But I would that would be the old guard's queue to either cave or slowly die.\n\nThere is also the fact that since the KD got a woman leading them they have slowly become more and more krstian and conservative in their policies so change is happening just slowly to slow in my opnion.",

    "text": "I’m from Sweden as well, and I must say, you hit the nail on the head with your observations. The current political climate is quite troubling, and if significant changes aren’t implemented within the next years, we may witness an alarming increase in violence and unrest. This potential bloodshed could affect not only the migrant communities but also politicians themselves, as tensions escalate between different groups. There’s a growing sense of frustration among the Swedish people regarding the handling of immigration and integration policies. Many feel that the government has failed to address the concerns of its citizens, leading to a widening divide in society. \nIf these issues are not addressed promptly and effectively, the situation could deteriorate further, resulting in people taking action.  Moreover, there are troubling allegations of corruption within the political system. Some critics suggest that certain politicians have intentionally brought in migrants not just for humanitarian reasons, but as a means to secure votes for themselves. This manipulation undermines the integrity of our democratic process and raises serious ethical questions about the motivations behind immigration policies. If the public perceives that their leaders are prioritizing their own interests over the well-being of the nation, it could lead to a significant backlash and worse",
