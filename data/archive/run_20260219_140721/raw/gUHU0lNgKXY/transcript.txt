so Sweden has more or less become a war zone and I couldn't believe some of the things I was reading when I was researching this like I was actually speechless which um considering I've been doing this for quite some time now takes a lot and uh I didn't realize just how bad it was and I think the best epitomization of this is this headline here more than one explosion a day in Sweden as gang violence spirals out of control and the by line is Sweden is facing an unprecedented wave of gang related bombings with 32 explosions in 28 days prompting the government to consider considering lowering the criminal age to 14 as violence escalates and criminals increasingly use Financial extortion and digital recruitment to expand their operations so basically loads of foreign criminal gangs have moved into Sweden uh you know no bonus marks for guessing uh their background because I think we all know uh it is The Usual Suspects who likes doing this sort of thing well we I think we know don't we so it's also the fact that they're using young teenagers basically as part of it which is why Sweden's going after them and they're hiring people from abroad in a sort of marketplace of online criminality and there are like sort of set rates if you want to kill someone um apparently um it varies depending on which city in Sweden you're in um it's 50,000 for one 80,000 for another um but they've they've sort of got a menu for Crime uh because criminality has got so extensive and of course Sweden used to be one of the safest countries on planet Earth and so this U-turn is not that the native swedes have just decided you know what you know we're sick of peace and quiet we want crime uh no it is a not the natives of course and um Stockholm alone has witnessed 21 explosions in the past month which is insane to me that a major European city can experience that level of what amounts to basically Gangland terrorism this is a situation of emergency there was yesterday a post that listed the bombings that have taken place in January in in Sweden and it literally reads like a band's tour schedule literally it's just insane literally every single day just every yeah it's 30 bombings and it's the 31st of January I know yeah very tenacious aren't they so um the Swedish prime minister has called the bombing crisis um domestic terrorism which I think is reasonable I think if someone's bombing you know every day over you know twice a day sometimes then I think that's fair to say and um police have arrested 50 individuals in 25 different cases including bomb makers the perpetrators themselves planting the bombs and the gang leaders operating from abroad of course and apparently the nature of these bombings has changed so originally it was about territorial disputes between various ethnic gangs and now they're they're more being used as a retaliative measure to Target businesses that refuse to be extorted so it's deliberately Mafia yeah exactly and it seems to be that they're saying you know it's like extorting protection money isn't it really like all mafias do in Sweden of all places like you said used to be one of the most homogeneous peaceful places in the world mhm I remember terrible terrible it's a tragedy isn't it that this has been imposed upon the Swedish people because they don't deserve this obviously yeah and um you can look at things like this as well hand grenade attacks have more than doubled in 2024 and they already quite High they're already insanely High yeah exactly like what other country suffers from Spates of grenade attacks apparently by mid October there had been 22 recorded grenade attacks up from 9 in 20123 which is nine too many and certainly 22 too many and even in you know Britain which is quite Multicultural these days we're not getting this level of of things going on are We of course Sweden's a little bit further along than we are but even so this is just I I couldn't believe the actual scale of it it's worth mentioning mentioning as well that Sweden's got a population of 10 and a half million officially at least and so um these numbers might not seem high to you if you're American um and you live in a very big country but in Europe in a small European country you know this is a similar population to that of the city of London and so it it would be unprecedented if say the city of London had seen a bombing every day the question is why has this happened MH why has because I'm not aware of any kind of vote of the Swedish to just open up the borders and just voluntarily put up with crime and and mafias of the sort no exactly so it's also worth mentioning three out of four murderers in Sweden are committed by migrants so there's a hint at the picture of who's doing what here um and I mean I don't know whether that remaining one quarter um is people who've been there for multiple Generations I didn't necessarily look into um well I mean specifics of it the the issue again is the per capita how CRI distributed to gun murders per capita in Stockholm are 30 times that of London and it goes on in London quite frequently doesn't it Bo um sorry I'm asking you not because you're a gun criminal but because you you're familiar with the city of London compared to me yeah I mean Sweden on the map geographically is reasonably big but a lot of it is sort of um how to say not Tundra exactly but a lot of it isn't it's not urbanized so they've got a few cities right a few few big very weighted towards the South and a few towns so um basically they've been flooded with unbelievably violent criminals from some of the worst criminals in Europe by the looks of it and by the sounds of it I wonder why Sweden of all places cuz it's like they're not I don't think these things happen in as badly anyway in Norway or Denmark or Finland or Estonia but but SW specifically Sweden I wonder why exactly well I I I have some data to reveal that but sorry St no no before you say this data I want to say that if uh anyone told me about this about a month ago I I would say no this doesn't happen in Sweden but maybe there are so many other stuff that we haven't yet heard about SC scavia and other all other countries it could be it could be the it's possible yeah although um some of the other countries like the Danes pretty good on mass migration in that they don't have much of it and they collect comprehensive data I'm willing to make a guess and say that it has to do a lot with welfarism I think the swedes are very generous in what they offer to foreigners and also the the kinds of people that have migrated to Sweden uh let me give you a bit of a clue uh um a man who burned the Quran was shot dead in his flat in Sweden recently he was actually going through court because of what he did and I think he was originally um well I imagine he still considered one an Iraqi so um it's interesting that a presumably a former Muslim um is there burning a Quran and he doesn't even get through his court trial for doing so which is also ridiculous um Let It Be said um before someone kills him in his own flat yeah shot dead overnight um apparently unbelievable but yeah this was this was just yesterday I didn't have to look far um all of these things have happened in the past month so it's just going to show how extensive it is um and yeah it's talking about wasn't Sweden supposed to be socialist Paradise apparently so apparently socialists just really like grenade attacks for some reason and and killing people well that's true um so also the person may be linked to a foreign power uh Reuters is saying for some reason so let's have a look at some of the data shall we here is Peter Sweden aptly named as he is Swedish um 62,000 people were um are now involved in criminal gangs in Sweden remember the population 10.5 million we have almost 60 noo zones there were 149 bombings last year we have one of the highest um sexual assault rates in the world and he's saying that socialist policies destroyed Sweden basically his home country and I can't disagree with that really it seems pretty fair that both the the combination of open borders and Welfare is just a recipe for disaster here and we we're seeing the consequences here you pay people to not work and uh also not assimilate exactly and uh here I am rather immodestly showing one of my own tweets but it illustrates an important point if if you look at gun crime deaths as as a per capita rate Sweden is lodged between Albania and Bosnia and what is significant about Albania and Bosnia well they are the two Muslim majority countries in Europe and so the fact that Sweden's in between them is a little bit prophetic it tells you something about the kind of people that might have migrated there and in fact we know that a lot of these people are from Islamic countries and uh if we go to some other dat uh here we are um we can see relative if you these are the blue line is those of a Swedish background as the the data labels it and the sort of pink isy color it's difficult to tell because the screen glare here is the first generation immigrant and then the green is the second generation and as we can see deadly violence and robbery um relative to the natives massively over represented um but also the second Generations Lead the Way by a pretty decent margin um you know crimes against life and health um the first generation and crimes against Liberty and peace I don't know even know what that means uh sexual crimes the first Generations are over represented which sort these sorts of things mirror the nature of crime all across Europe really we can see certain crimes where the first generation are more likely to commit it uh than the second generation but also some of the worst ones like deadly violence for example it's the second generation of immigrant that's doing it and so the problem isn't simply just the people who are born abroad and moved here it's also their children and even more so in some cases their children think about say the Southport killer he was second generation and look what he did um and so it's very obvious to me that the problem is say much just oh it's a similation because now actually the more time people spend there the worse they get not better relative to the native population and it's something that the native population shouldn't have to put up with and um here is um some more stuff here um this is some Swedish data um so this is I think the backgrounds so North African and African other um are massively overrepresented Ed Central Asia um and West Asia so some of the more Muslim countries pakistanis perhaps um and then we can see here like US Canada Australia and New Zealand is basically on parity with those of Swedish background um nordics except Sweden um only slightly over represented but not by the same degree as countries outside of Europe um the countries outside of Europe uh are just massively overrepresented except for maybe South Asia and um you know East Asia as well is actually under represented which mirrors entirely what we've been saying for years Chinese or Koreans or Japanese exactly what's interesting is that the swedes themselves are not very criminal no they're native swedes mhm as we know from the era before they opened their borders exactly very very peaceful country they it's not that the swedes themselves have changed it's nature of who is Swedish an entirely imported crime wave M yeah it was enti of crime yeah it is the worst types of crime and it's something that's entirely preventable and was politically imposed upon them much the same as lots of other European countries if we go back to the to the addition and and the conjunction between open borders and wellerism you see how this all is ARR for disaster because it's it says essentially let let the their borders be open and let us just give too much money as social provisions and let just increase spending for social provisions and this actually has a hidden layer of evil behind it because it literally lends to The Narrative of all this is an issue of insufficient money given to people who perpetrate this uh such crime because if you have a welfarist background a very leftist welfarist mindset and you say that all crime comes from lack of economic prospects then the only the only way to react to this is by saying well let us just flatten out economic inequalities let us tax the Swedish more in order to give more money to these people so crime diminishes and of course that will make the problem worse won't it and we can look at things like uh Danish data and the Danes keep very good records of the nationality of origin uh and conviction rates here and you can see that lots of countries like Kuwait Somalia Lebanon Tunisia Jordan Uganda Iraq Morocco Algeria Ethiopia Syria Afghanistan Egypt Iran turkey Kenya Ghana um all over represented for some reason myanmar's up there I didn't realize they' get many people from there um but Pakistan Tanzania so basically it is um Africa and the Islamic world that are massively over represented and then you start getting to European countries down here in the light blue and and there's such a clear distinction between the two here aren't there that you know you're not getting yeah you'd say that also for for Europe den den the Danish are a bit rambunctious um it's funny I've seen this stuff before and I'm always surpris it's surprising to me that Kuwait cuz Kuwait's number one there mhm Kuwait's tiny but that's because of the per capita aspect of it isn't it like you you would you could have one one crazy Kuwaiti gang and that would bump it right up all right uh and then of course there's lots of data here from Austria Belgium Finland France Greece Ireland Italy and Sweden uh that the migrants are a net fiscal drain um so I think Sweden is this last one here uh so you can see you it was saying yes so we've got the natives here in dark blue that contribute the most and take the least then intra EU uh slightly less so and then extra EU you can see that the the amount that they actually contribute to the economy doesn't outweigh the amount they take from it uh in later life so they're not net contributors at all actually and you can see that very clearly here that this part of the the graph under the line is much more significant than the part over it it's not even close in fact it's almost 2 to one uh just from eyeballing it and it may well be that they take twice as much as they provide and so yes Sweden has imported foreign criminals um who basically tyrannize and terrorize the native population and they're paying for it in the same way that many other European countries are as well and here is precisely what is going to happen if you add DE and equality of opportunity in all these things again it's going to lead towards a narrative that says let us give even more material well what would happen would be all of the Peaks would lower yeah and everyone would be worse off wouldn't they that's that's how it would work so I'm going to quickly fire through what is actually being done and I'm just going to say what's happening ever so quickly and then summarize what needs to be done further so in September of 23 um they introduced new rules for labor migrants um basically work permits will only be made available to those labor migrants in Sweden who earn a salary of at least 80% of the Swedish median salary that was to mitigate some of the financial damage that it's doing and then in October of 23 they made it harder for non-european migrants to claim benefits and then in August of 24 um they were discussing paying uh Swedish passport holders that are foreign born a thousand the equivalent of ,000 to leave Sweden um basic basally paying a sort of D geld to get rid of the the foreign gangs but of course if you've got an illegal they can just keep on coming back and rincing you of that that grand each time although um I I still think it' be better than doing nothing even though I think the idea of paying foreign people that are extorting you money to leave is weak and you shouldn't have to resort to that got be the B solution imprison them yeah you just round up everyone involved known to be involved and you put them in a Maximum Security Prison for a long long long time well if they're not netive get rid of them or yeah and or Deport them mhm yeah at the end either before or at the end of their sentence they're deported just not not allowed in the general population anymore well they're obviously not safe it's not allowed among normal civilized humans mhm God's sake and uh here's another one this was from August of 24 as well uh basically they introduced a law which would public sector workers to report undocumented migrants basically and uh of course this is the guard Guardian saying it's utterly inhumane to report people illegally in your country if you're a public official which is obviously ridiculous do they have any article now saying how inhumane the bombings are no funny enough they don't are the humanity of those victims that doesn't matter yeah so some people are more human than others so here in October um they were having tougher rules they they actually talked about introducing DNA testing to see if someone was part of a family before reunifying them I I personally think that who cares if you've come to the country if anything you should be removed if you want to join your family you can all go back home you don't all have to move here do you it's you don't have a right to another person's country to bring your whole family across that's never ever been something that has existed until recently which is ridiculous as well of course and uh they are actually getting a bit more serious about addressing these problems because they're pretty obvious now aren't they and uh there was this story which um people leaving Sweden will exceed immigrants in 2024 but it wasn't quite true um here's another one this was European conservative reporting the same thing it went around but actually if you read a Swedish language um thing which is translated here it was just that the tax agency had a backlog of things it was processing and then process loads of them at once which made it look like there was net immigration so it was just a an Administration thing rather than a net immigration and uh there is this though as of the 30th of January yesterday um a record number of foreigners are leaving Sweden to move to Germany and what does that say about the foreigners well what it says is that they're going to a country with more lucrative welfare it's that it's not so much that um Sweden stop being appealing to them it's just that they can get a better gig elsewhere which suggests to my mind that they're only there to rinse the native swedes off their money and then they're going to leave which is obvious they are transigent exactly yeah yeah whatever's the best deal for them actual physically where you live doesn't re matter that much mhm they've got no roots to the the land well of course they don't cuz they're from abroad and um this is one of the measures that um is being taken to potentially address the concerns because they they've got full prisons and they don't know what to do with all of the people that they need to send to prison and they're actually looking at sending inmates abroad as their prisons are full in this crime wave and um another thing that they were looking at doing was um FASTT tracking a new law to tackle these bombings by allowing um the police basically to wiretap people under the age of 15 um because previously obviously there are ethical concerns but because these foreign criminal gangs are using teenagers and young people it gives them a certain level of protection within the law and so you have to change the law to actually tackle these people because they're using the fact that they're young to get around the law and not get punished so these within quotation marks Humane policies have led to the state contemplating W tapping teenagers yes so just an extra layer of scumbag behavior is that they're used children loads for this CU that was what you led with right at the top which I wasn't aware of about the the extremely young age of the people involved so yeah just an extra layer of Filth that these people are engaged in like this is one of those things that I think is just undeniably uh a completely negative picture of immigration the swedes have gained nothing but negatives from this this so-called deal and I mean you look at other statistics as well like um was it four or five Italian women get raped every day by a foreigner um you know the rates of crime in France it's clearly a Scourge on Europe we were much better off before Mass migration and it's entirely obvious to anyone that has a rudimentary look at the data about what's going on about how it's impacting the native population and um at least Sweden's trying to do stuff to uh fix it and I think they're going to be one of the countries because they're so badly affected by it that's going to be leading the way in pushing back against this and hopefully um they're going to get to a point where they actually address the real solution to this which is mass deportations I I don't see any other scenario um working better than that surely in in Sweden's case remigration is inevitable oh yes I know that's one of the it's reim migration or be conquered yeah that those are the options and I know which one I would pick as a swed I know some people say when I say things like this various people in the dis didn't write say things like this I wrote an article didn't I saying remigration is inevitable um I'm not the first one in the world to have said it but um um some people say uh that that's just cope that's never going to happen you're a far right fantasist or whatever people actually don't want that but it's obviously what needs to be done but it's but it actually I honestly think that is true it must be inevitable it's not even like a rhetorical device it's just it if if our country is to continue existing you know I say that for All European countries if our nations in Europe are to continue existing we need to send people home because we can't coexist because Sweden is simply a bit further down the road is all mhm yeah exactly that's all it is like there's a very smaller petri dish so it's more obvious more quickly you can even sort of put countries on a hierarchy so Japan just started getting Mass migration right and you can see them going through exactly the same motions that all the European countries have almost you know note for note so there's almost like a textbook A playbook a pattern a pattern exactly that it operates under but yes if you live in Sweden I I honestly um hope you stay safe and um I hope your government can actually do something and if they do um you're going to be helping Europe because you're going to be setting a president um to to show that actually you can get these things under control and I really hope that it does work if you would like to watch the full uncut version that is also uncensored head on over to lotus.com to find out more [Music]
