Human beings frequently shift from left to right throughout their lives, some even go from one extreme to another and then end up being moderates by the end of their lives. As someone from the UK I get sick of being labelled 'from a Conservative culture', we can be Conservative on many issues yes but we're a damn sight more progressive in many ways than a lot of countries. Individuals are Conservative or Progressive, not countries or cultures. It wasn't that long ago people were talking about France as a 'progressive country' now they are on the verge of electing Fascists, whereas here in the UK we are on the verge of kicking out most of our right-wing politicians and replacing them by and large with centrists, but nobody is going to say 'the UK is a predominantly centrist nation', no you're all going to be pointing to our colonialist past and the fact we are the home to the Queen TERF, and actual leftists like me are going to be erased as non-existent once again and told I don't exist. I mean the US likes to think of itself as progressive but most of the world views it as one of the most Conservative countries on the planet. Now of course its the same thing, varies very much from State to State, and some States flip. Florida went from being on the verge of flipping to Democrat to electing a Fascist as governor. It really isn't as simple as so many try to make it out to be.",
