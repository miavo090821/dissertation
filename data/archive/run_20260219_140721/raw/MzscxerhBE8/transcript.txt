what's up guys sean here and today we're going to talk about tyt's reaction to jesse smaller's charges being dropped because this reaction is amazing if you were to ask the young turks to tell you what their brand is they'd say it's all about justice they fight for the powerless against the powerful the powerful that use their privilege and positions of power in order to influence the systems that are america to get outcomes that those of us who do not have those privileges could never possibly get so when i found out that justice smallett through political connections with the district attorney was able to get his charges dropped and his record sealed i knew that the place to go for coverage on this for honest hard-hitting coverage on this corrupt turn of events was the young turks i mean honestly on paper this story has everything that tyt fights against but of course jankuger decided to have the worst take humanly possible on this story jessie smallette is no longer facing any charges in a case that has received nationwide attention he is the actor from empire who alleged that he was attacked by two trump supporting individuals who had also uh yelled racial epithets at him as they were attacking him now prosecutors dropped all charges against empire actor jesse smallett just weeks after he was indicted on 16 felony counts for allegedly filing a false police report so i want to read you a statement from the cook county state attorney's office these are the prosecutors who had initially pursued smallett on these 16 felony charges they said quote we did not exonerate smallett the charges were dropped in return for smallett's agreement to do community service and forfeit his ten thousand dollar bond to the city of chicago so while his lawyers are trying to spin this as if he was wronged and he definitely did not stage this uh just understand what the prosecutors in the case are saying they're not saying that he was found to be innocent they're saying we just decided to drop it and in return he's gonna do community service and he's gonna leave that ten thousand dollar bond to the city of chicago so they start off with a decent summary of the recent developments in the story i do want to point out that some things were a little misstated and some things were left out for instance jesse smallett is not doing any community service what they did say was that he did community service in the past like his normal charity work or whatever he did in chicago prior to this incident and they're going to give him credit for that and the other major thing that was left out is that the case against smallit all the evidence has been sealed which is very unusual for a case not involving a juvenile and the final thing that's not mentioned in the summary of events is that it was discovered via freedom of information act request that a former michelle obama staffer and members of the smallit family were in contact with the district attorney and the district attorney should have actually recused herself due to the fact that the nature of this contact was meant to help jesse small it and that gives the appearance of corruption especially when you cut a sweetheart deal for him look we're going to go to rahm emanuel's statement in just a minute but understand that i fully acknowledge that what smallett allegedly did was wrong and i was very upset and angry about it but after hearing rahm emanuel speak it makes me want to support smolette yeah this has so many twists and turns guys i got a couple of twists for you after we listen to the mayor let's watch a grand jury indicted this individual based on a only a piece of the evidence that the police had uh collected in that period of time so a grand jury actually brought the charges on financial costs this 10 000 doesn't even come close to what the city spent in resources second now they go into this weird attack against rahm emanuel and this isn't unusual for the young turks they are not fans of rahm emanuel they see him as a more establishment figure in the democratic party that made obama not progressive enough while he was the president also as mayor he didn't release statements on other issues that had nowhere near the level of national coverage as this did look everything that he's saying is right he's not saying anything wrong the thing that really turned me off to rahm emanuel is that he usually doesn't say anything when is rahm emanuel making public statements about anything and all of a sudden this is what he's decided no i am going to make a public appearance i'm going to do a press conference and i'm going to use very strong language against jesse smallette look again what he's saying isn't wrong there are moral ethical issues here but out of all the things to be outraged about i just find it strange that this is the thing that rahm emanuel felt the need to come out and make a strong public statement well to me this is petty criticism that doesn't really belong in this video the idea that rahm emanuel wouldn't make a statement on this giant news story that happened in this city when the state's attorney basically undercut the chicago pd and the city of chicago and is allowing jesse smallett to get off scot-free like that's a ridiculous notion of course he's going to make a statement about that he's doing two things one is i'm with the cops i i'm protecting the cops okay uh and number two is he's protecting his own reputation because it was a city that said smallet did it now prosecutors are apparently at least not sure i like how jank is just throwing buzzwords out to his audience rahm emanuel is just trying to signal that he's with the cops well why wouldn't he be in this case the police are being undercut this is jank insulting the intelligence of his audience by just throwing out a cop's bad line in the middle of this story even though it really has nothing to do with this story at all there's no allegations of official misconduct on behalf of the police but cops bad rahm emanuel with the cops so rum emmanuel bad even though rahm emanuel is exactly right in this case somebody that i almost never agree with is 100 right in this case so the check that he gave them the 3 500 check that he gave to the uh osandario brothers that actually did this um people were like well i mean he paid him to do this attack it's obvious there's a note in the check that clearly states uh that it is for uh you know remember one of them was there was his trainer was for the training uh and that's now a lot of money for training so now they're getting into the evidence and to be honest the check is circumstantial evidence so i think this is like the one piece of evidence that wouldn't stand up to scrutiny if it only existed on its own jesse according to the police has hired these guys as personal trainers before so it makes sense that that check could have actually been for personal training that being said jesse writing in the note portion of the check that it's for personal training proves absolutely nothing he's not gonna write in the note portion of the check that it's for you guys to stage a hate crime against me and i will point out that this check is one of those pieces of evidence that the removal of contacts the case being sealed so we can't look at the other evidence really hurts the way that we can interpret it because for all we know jesse smallett had a different rate that he paid these guys for personal training before so it might not just be the nigerian saying that the check was actually for them to stage the hate crime it might be in the context of other personal training sessions that this check is for much more money than those were previously but we don't know that because the case was sealed because of the corrupt nonsense that went around this case but brace yourself this is where jank starts to descend into la la land which leads me to an unprecedented conclusion on the young turks i have no idea what's going on for them to drop all the charges that means at a bare minimum they would have had enormous difficulty getting a conviction at a bare minimum okay right so that's just a fact so at least i said that was their interpretation of the case they had them dropping the charges saying we had a super weak case in isolation a plea bargain that favors the defendant usually indicates a weak case on the prosecution but considering even jesse's lawyers acknowledge that it was two nigerians and not two white people we know for a fact that jesse was lying to the police if i had said it was a muslim or a mexican or someone black i feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more a lot more and that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now we also have two witnesses the nigerians who say that jesse orchestrated the whole thing not to mention the chicago pd say that they have a lot more evidence to support their claims and the shady nature of this deal but jen just overlooks that and he's like oh they must have had a weak case why would two nigerian brothers one of whom is allegedly his trainer attack him and yell racial epithets at him i have to give credit where credit is due anna is coming off as the voice of reason in this segment i really think that she had no idea that jank was gonna go off into this crazy town direction and she's like um but why would the nigerians that knew him attack him and yell racial and homophobic epithets at him and then say it was mega country why would two nigerian brothers one of whom is allegedly his trainer attack him and yell racial epithets at him i have no idea were they running a scam i don't know and this is the peak moment of stupid that made me want to make this video according to jenk it is possible that the nigerians were running a scam on jesse smallett by staging the hate crime against him i have no idea were they running a scam i don't know let's workshop this scenario for a second so according to jank it is possible that these two nigerian brothers decided on their own to dress up like trump supporters intercept jesse smallett on his way to subway at 2 am in the middle of a polar vortex when jesse just flew back into chicago from new york on their own with no coordination with smallit they decided to purchase rope and bleach and just wait on the off chance that jesse would go to get a subway sandwich and then when near impossible odds happened and they actually spotted jesse smallit on his way to subway they decided to attack him yell racial and homophobic slurs at him throw bleach on him tie a rope around his neck and say this is maggot country before taking off now they pulled off this elaborate scheme that required knowledge that they could not have possibly had without the aid of smallit or somebody on the inside in the smallet camp as a means to scam jesse smallit by making him a sympathetic figure so that they then could be arrested for the crime just so they could tarnish his reputation oh my god it makes perfect sense why would two nigerian brothers one of whom is allegedly his trainer attack him and yell racial epithets at him i have no idea were they running a scam i don't know honestly now that i say it all out loud it doesn't sound completely ridiculous at all i mean sure it would have required these nigerians to have a level of foresight that is like impossible to have and this scam has no payoff for the nigerians without smallit knowing in advance i mean if it was just these nigerians trying to scam small it then where was the scam part where was the part where they were gonna benefit from this if they weren't coordinating with smallit but honestly don't worry about all that because jank doesn't know and this actually sounds like a reasonable idea to him but i will tell you this though the right wing has been wonderfully consistent on this they are outraged they're all over social media right now yelling about fake news how could they have uh convicted justice smaller in the court of public opinion without giving him a fair chance oh right they're not saying that they don't care about him at all they never cared about the truth it's just that when uh they thought smollett was making it up they were like oh the media got it wrong they blamed trump people and they're the worst fake news oh the media got it wrong they blamed trump people and they're the worst fake news now i don't see any of the right wing caring about fake news and if the media got it wrong in blaming jesse smollett where are you guys nowhere to be found so now we've just completely lost the plot just like jank throwing the random jab at cops in the middle of the story he tries to close it out by saying right wing bad because they didn't believe smallits ridiculous story initially oh the media got it wrong they blame trump people and they're the worst fake news they're bad for criticizing the media for reporting this story without any skepticism and the right wing is now bad again because they won't accept that jesse small it's innocent based on this shady backroom deal that seals the evidence when even the state's attorney who cut this shady backroom deal with jesse small it says that this is not something that should be seen as an exoneration of smallit oh the media got it wrong they blame trump people and they're the worst fake news jank you're the one trying to fit this story into your narrative even anna who's sitting right next to you is like yeah jesse clearly was not telling the truth about certain aspects of his story it doesn't make sense and this is not an exoneration of small it but if you are going to take this as an exoneration jank then you should be calling for the arrest of the two nigerians because if small is telling the truth and it's possible that these nigerians were scamming smallit by attacking him in a way that would help his career then the nigerians attack smallit and they should be arrested and charged with that attack now if the nigerians aren't the people who attack smallet then you should be calling for the case to remain open because there are obviously two white trump supporters who must have worn some kind of material that made them invisible to the many cameras that were around that are behind this crime but nobody including the smallit legal team are calling for the arrest of the nigerians or for the case to remain open they all just kind of want to move away from this case as if it's resolved but again if smallet told the truth and he's innocent and he's been smeared by the chicago pd and the evil right-wing media then why aren't they calling for more arrests it's because anyway you slice this small it lied and you can throw out your ridiculous conspiracy theories about nigerians who can see into the future scamming smallit in a way that can help them you can say that the real point that nobody's hitting on is right wing dad all you want but unless there are more arrests or the case remains open then what are you even talking about because what i see is a shady deal and a case coming to a close if jesse's innocent then who is guilty why is this case being closed i don't see the district attorney that cut this deal the cops or anybody asking that question anyway that's all i really have
