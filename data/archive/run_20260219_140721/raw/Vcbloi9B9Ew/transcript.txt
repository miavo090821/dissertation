welcome welcome everyone my name is sha and today I want to talk about this situation out of Columbus Mississippi where an on duty in uniform police officer decided to walk into a dict sporting goods and steal $140 worth of sneakers one pair of shoes from this place and she actually ended up getting detained by a lost prevention specialist a store security guard until a bunch of people in high ranking positions in the Columbus Mississippi Department had to come down and embarrassingly arrest this officer who is now fired now we're going to get into this we're going to talk about police officer shoplifting because I found quite a few instances of this crime occurring but before we do I want to thank everybody who signed up over an actual justice.com jooin I give me the money give you give me the money okay and thank you to the podcast listeners Spotify apple and Google's podcasting platform police officer has been arrested accused of stealing a pair of shoes while on duty Robin Connor was arrested after officers were called to Dick Sporting GS about 12:30 this afternoon she's charged with misdemeanor shoplifting Police Chief Joseph doy says Conor was wearing her uniform and was on duty when she was taken into custody yeah so this is obviously pretty bad you have a uniform police officer going into a store like I said in the open stealing a pair of sneakers valued at $140 and to make matters worse this Columbus Police Officer actually ends up making per year about 50 to $59,000 so she's actually not doing that bad off especially for Mississippi but she decided to do this with her patrol car and of course it is a rather embarrassing situation for the entire department and for police officers as a whole now I have actually discovered quite a few instances of police officer shoplifting but in my opinion none are bolder than this woman right here and by the way even though she is a police officer in terms of job title she definitely takes a mug shot like a criminal she looks absolutely horrible there let's be honest it looks like she hasn't slept in about 15 days Connor was on her second stent with the Department she returned about two years ago now she's on administrative leave and this investigation is continuing now even though the local news says that she was on administrative leave what you guys need to understand out there in the audience is that police officers are in a police Union so in a situation like this the first step is to put them on administrative leave even if they're CAU on video stealing shoes from a department store like Dick Sporting Goods however the update to the story is that there was a special Council called meeting by the city council and they ended up voting unanimously to fire Robin Connor so she is not an officer anymore but yeah this is highly embarrassing and ridiculous and absurd and it's about to get even more absurd as we go through the story but let's hear from the police chief because he he pretty much explains how everybody's feeling about this whole situation we have a job to do we we're held to a higher standard and the community is just starting to trust us and to take this gut punch really hurts uh that's why we fulfilled Our obligation not only uh to the store but to this community so yeah this is obviously embarrassing and it's more embarrassing than you can possibly imagine when you go into the details of this particular case so let's shift from the local news to this New York Post article because I find it quite quite fascinating all of the different steps that they had to do because when you get a call into 911 that you have detained somebody for shoplifting and they're an in uniform police officer protocols kind of spin out of control really quickly again a store employee ended up catching Connor trying to steal the shoes detained her which is kind of impressive that he was able to detain her before calling 911 they actually said over the 911 call cannot wait for the audio of this that we actually have an on duty in uniform police officer detained Under Suspicion of shoplifting and the patrol car is out in front can you send somebody now because of this unique situation they decided to call in the captain of her Precinct they called in the chief and the assistant chief of police coming in in order to investigate this particular situation now when they came in apparently they ended up looking at the surveillance video there was enough compelling evidence to have probable cause for an arrest and Connor was arrested at the scene but to make matters even more humiliating because they needed to get her patrol car out of there they decided to load her into the back of her own patrol car as they took her to jail now just imagine being in this much of an embarrassing situation imagine being this officer for a second you pull up to a store Dick Sporting Goods in your own patrol car in uniform you decide to walk through the aisles and you're like you know what I'm going to steal a pair of sneakers and then then by the end of this whole ordeal you are on your way to jail not making an arrest but in the back of your own patrol car where many a perpetrator have been throughout your time as an officer kind of fitting it's kind of like a bookend to this whole situation which makes me laugh and I don't know if they did this intentionally or it was due to the practicalities of the situation but if I'm being perfectly honest it is quite beautiful the way that this was resolved the fact that she started started out as a law- abiding officer and ended up as a criminal now of course there are other instances of shoplifting that I want to get into however I do want to point out for those of you out there in the audience that because this is a black female officer who by the way was arrested for stealing sneakers that there are some people out there AKA rayad Richie and by the way thank you to Nate the lawyer for pointing this out to me so I can go dig up the clip who decided to label this situation a potential in of evil white racism quote an employee observed them and detained the officer and called 911 we're putting her in jail it's embarrassing for the department but we're going to treat her like we would anybody else put up a picture again you know if she would have just shot an unarmed black person she would still at least be suspended with pay so sad radie is legitimately one of the worst people on the internet .c you guys saw the police chief he is a black person this is a pretty much open and shut case of shoplifting but rayad cannot help himself and say that you know who the real victim is in this situation not Dick Sporting Goods the people who actually had stuff stolen from them not the people who had to make the difficult decision on attempting to detain a police officer not the department that is embarrassed by one of their own not the community who has been supporting a police officer that probably did this multiple different times but unarmed innocent Angel black people that are fictitious in this particular scenario and the victim of evil white racism even though again this situation happens to involve all black people you saw the police chief you saw the officer I even think that maybe even the people working at Dick Sporting Goods were likely to be black but for some reason we got to say that really what you need to be thinking about is innocent Angel unarmed criminals that were being killed by these RAC is police officers all of whom are actually black police officers you know if she would have just shot an unarmed black person she would still at least be of spined with pain every everybody in this situation is black but gosh aren't white people racist now let's go on a little bit further in this before I jump to some other stories so you guys can see how these situations tend to normally break down because this one is unique in one way now like I said Connor they ended up having a special session in order to fire her but in that moment she she was arrested she was charged with misdemeanor shoplifting the reason why she was charged with misdemeanor shoplifting is because she stole under $1,000 worth of merchandise she had a bail set for her but honestly the details of that are not all that interesting what I do find interesting though is it appears that everybody is on the same page in this situation in that they want to throw the book at her in order to make an example of her because there is a belief that police officers should be held to a higher standard and I actually think this is 100% true because back in the past in the United States of America one of the biggest types of corruption that we had with police officers happened to be economic corruption taking bribes and all that and this is largely why police officers are much better paid and have much better benefits now than they did in the past the idea is if you have officers that are not even making the middle class and yet they're confronted with all these criminal organizations with tons of money then they're going to take advantage they might steal from people they arrest and abuse their law enforcement capacity in order to economically enrich themselves so we had a major cultural change in our country and departments Across the Nation where we would hold officers accountable for said economic corruption this is something that I'm happy to say is still embedded in our law enforcement so they're going to go after her and they definitely should however this case is again very bold in the fact that she did this while she was on duty while she was on uniform and while she had her patrol car she was totally acting in her capacity as a police officer she believed that she would not get caught and again credit to the store employee for detaining her but in my opinion it is clear and obvious that this is not the first time that she did this and by the way the reason I say that's atypical is because the other instances of officers stealing stuff shoplifting were Off Duty Officers who were only later discovered to be officers like this case out of Al Albuquerque two Albuquerque police officers recognizing one of their own on surveillance footage captured inside a Target store so what do you have tell us what's going on so she I caught her um T switching through like just reviewing and everything ticket switching when someone takes the price tag off a cheaper item and puts it on the more expensive one they're buying the officers are speaking with loss prevention specialist Tai hunt who says he frequently reviews surveillance footage to keep an eye on Poss shoplifting at the Target on Kors Boulevard in Northwest Albuquerque basically she just tiet whiches like personal care of stuff Hunt's typically tipped off he tells the two when someone buys plastic cups which cost just 50 cents the first time Vanessa santianes did that hunt shows them April 17th an incident report reveals she saved herself more in terms of valuables but the way that she was doing it was at least attempting to be stealth it was at least attempting to act in the same way that other people tend to act when they do retail theft she ended up swapping out barcodes swapping out price tags going to the self checkout and the way that she got away with stealing was the fact that she was paying for certain items however she wasn't paying the actual price in that situation also I know a lot of people are going to point out that this is a female officer but I did find one instance of a male officer doing this and this is both more similar to Connor's case but significantly less similar due to the fact that he stole something that clearly and obviously was nowhere near the level of value and was much more concealable it was last Friday just after 10: in the morning a 25th district police officer in full uniform is seen walking into the 7-Eleven store in the 1100 block of East Lazar surveillance video obtained by action news shows him walking up to a cooler he looks through the items and then grabs what a police report says is a 12 O Celsius kiwi guava energy drink that sells for 249 plus tax but the video shows that instead of going to the cashier to pay for it he simply walked out the door that shocked the clerk who alerted the owner's wife who was also at the counter she did not want her face show hey this guy officer H the pay for his stuff I'm like what I said maybe now I want to point out a few things with this particular instance and they're going to add a little bit of nuance to the situation but also I'm going to condemn the local news for blurring out this officer's face if he is accused of retail theft if he is a suspect in that crime why are you hiding his identity and now by the way this happens to be in Philadelphia but the reason I want to say there's a bit more Nuance in this particular situation is because I've actually seen similar things in my life at 7-Eleven in particular and this is officers but with permission essentially getting free items from those stores now to be clear this is actually considered economic corruption if you're a police officer out there and you're being off offered free coffee free drinks whatever you should never accept it because that can set you up for a situation where this person is expecting favors from you and it can lead to charges of economic corruption down the line that end up having a large negative impact on your professional career trust me pay for your own coffee when you're on duty when people try to insist on giving you stuff for free you don't want to do that I actually studied under the DI for discipline for the NYPD when I was in college all those years ago and he explained to me how many cases that he had where he would bust people specifically at 7-Eleven for getting free things like coffee and or donuts and or whatever and the reason he was able to get to that position was because he as an officer was smart enough throughout the course of his career when he was coming up to never accept those free perks even though they are minimal and by the way there's all kinds of tricks to do that so I give that nuance for you guys out there in the audience because this is something that I have seen but it has permission even though it's a different problem that I think needs to be addressed typically however in this particular situation the clerk was obviously in shock of the fact that this guy just stole this drink the owner appears to be in shock of this person stealing this drink that's why they went to the local news that's why they're presenting this as a problem so obviously the Philadelphia Police Department does not have an arrangement or an agreement or an understanding with that particular 7-Eleven that the police officers that I would see at the 7-Eleven that was near me tended to have albeit that Arrangement is not legitimate now of course obviously one of the reasons why this is more Brazen is because you can see the video but I just want you to imagine not a 7-Eleven not a situation that many people have seen throughout their lives but ad dict sporting goods and somebody in uniform trying to tuck a sneak er box under the shirt or whatever way that this woman ended up trying to do that so it is both more Brazen in that you can see it but if we saw the surveillance video related to that other case it might look less Brazen than an officer trying to steal a shoe box so he keep walking she and her husband went outside the store to let him know he had to pay for the item they tried to flag him down but he ignor us too and he just took off the owner says he was even more shocked because he is a big supporter of the Philadelphia police and immediately contacted one of a number of police officers he befriended over the years to show him the video he was shocked he approached his officer his supervisor right away and they want me to make the official report for that now in this particular scenario that officer was out of there incredibly quickly he took off ran away and again this just goes to show you the level of entitlement that some people have in uniform and for me all of these cases have one thing in common including cases that I did not show because I'm not trying to spend all this time going to every instance of documented shoplifting of police officers and that is the response needs to be the same each and every time hold the officer accountable hold them to that higher standard and by the way we should have consequences for regular people doing shoplifting but we definitely need that for police officers because this is shameful Behavior again just imagine if that officer decided rather than surrendering to the person at Dick Sporting Goods and being detained and waiting for those people to be there that she was is going to fight back and then your regular ordinary Store employee that's going to get into a potentially deadly encounter with the police officer who is trying to steal sneakers imagine what happens if you're an officer responding to that scene you see one of your female officers in uniform fighting with some random person who works at Dick Sporting Goods you're going to assume you're going to think that the employee at the store is in the wrong and that could lead to Serious negative consequences for that person who is attacking an officer you put people in increased danger when you act in this way in uniform it's embarrassing to the uniform and there definitely needs to be some consequences so I'm glad that they fired her I know the union protected her and she was originally put on administrative leave but that is a part of the process but the fact that the city council got together and said no way and dismissed this person for this theft is definitely something that we should all be proud of it's definitely the right thing to do in that situation because you have to respond and make it clear to every officer no matter the rank that this cannot be tolerated on top of that very embarrassing for this woman to be arrested not only by her own Captain not only by the police chief but also the assistant police chief because they took this situation that seriously I like that energy I want people to do this you need to show people that no one is above the wall and this is how you do it but hey I want to know what you guys think down in the comments below if you like
