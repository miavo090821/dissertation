i think it can be really fruitful to go back and look at the republican debates from the 2016 primary and look at the things trump was saying because essentially in that primary trump was the anti-establishment candidate on the right he was the anti-establishment republican that the establishment republicans and most the elites even in the media didn't want winning and then bernie sanders was that for the left obviously bernie sanders is much more dangerous to the establishment than trump because trump's still a businessman and a capitalist and also a bumbling idiot whereas bernie actually had a plan for redistributing wealth and other things like that but trump was able to win and and bernie wasn't able to win so it's interesting to go back and look at the things trump said um and despite what cnn and msnbc will tell you trump's entire voting base was not um a bunch of racist kkk members right he was getting the support of the kkk his racist rhetoric was attracting a lot of people but he also had a lot of anti-war and and populist rhetoric that really won people over he didn't follow through on any of it but he was saying it and and that got him the win in 2016 and of course then he didn't win in 2020. um so we can talk about uh maybe people saw through it after four years of governance under trump they didn't feel any any substantial change which could be why he lost but let's watch this um this clip here where trump is calling out jeb bush's brother george bush on stage for the iraq war and how the audience reacts to it and how the media reacts to it on monday george w bush will campaign in south carolina for his brother as you said tonight and you've often said the iraq war and your opposition to it was a sign of your good judgment in 2008 in an interview with wolf blitzer talking about president george w bush's conduct of the war you said you were surprised that democratic leader nancy pelosi didn't try to impeach him you said quote which personally i think would have been a wonderful thing a close quote when you were asked what you meant by that you said for the war for the war he lied he got us into the war with lies do you still believe president bush should be impeached should have been people i have to say as a businessman i get along with everybody i have business all over the world i know so many of the people in the audience and by the way i'm a self-funder i don't have i have my wife and i have my son that's all i have i don't have this so let me just tell you i get along with everybody which is my obligation to my company to myself etc obviously the war in iraq was a big fat mistake all right now you can take it anywhere you want and it took j it took jeb bush if you remember at the beginning of his announcement when he announced for president took him five days he went back it was a mistake it wasn't a mistake it took him five days before his people told him what to say and he ultimately said it was a mistake the war in iraq we spent two trillion dollars thousands of lives we don't even have it iran is taking over iraq with the second largest oil reserves in the world obviously it was a mistake so george bush made a mistake we can make mistakes but that one was a beauty we should have never been in iraq we have destabilized the middle east but so you so i mean so you still think he should be impacted it's my turn you do whatever you want you call it whatever you want i want to tell you they lied okay they said there were weapons of mass destruction there were none and they knew there were none there were no weapons of mess okay all right when a member on the stage's brother gets attacked i got about five or six i get to do it five or six times or just once responding that the clips of trump running through the establishment republicans um in the 2016 primaries are crazy to me there's another clip that i'll play another time where people are cheering for jeb bush or they're booing trump and trump goes those people right there who are booing me those are his donors but people at home they like what i'm saying right now and obviously he was right he won i mean he dominated the republican primary with his anti-establishment rhetoric and i think that's something that we can learn from of course you know yeah if you don't want to learn from the guy who was able to be an anti-establishment candidate and win i mean you're crazy of course we should learn from that you know um yeah so he just didn't care that people were booing him right you hear people boo him when he calls the iraq war a mistake they booed him when he said there were never wmds that's just a fact it's a fact that bush lied about the wmds and the audience there and you know tickets for these things are like over a thousand dollars so it's only wealthy politically connected people who are there the iraq war has something like a 30 approval rating now maybe even less you know and some the vast majority of the country thinks our troops should come home which is what trump was pitching for there which has probably gained him a lot of support in the actual election um but the establishments there are booing him you know and and what did bernie do every time he faced uh the full brunt of the establishment you know uh the example i think of is when he and when joe rogan endorsed him and bernie was like look joe rogan endorsed us and the media just came after him look at what joe rogan said in his past who cares if it's the largest podcast in america endorsing you and he's joe rogan speaks clearly for tons and tons of americans and he's endorsing you saying he wants you to be the president of the united states and then bernie uh um i can't remember exactly what he did he said i i no longer accept the endorsement that's what it was he didn't accept the endorsement because the the fake woke establishment who are murdering people overseas on a daily basis and allowing millions of people to die of starvation and live in the streets said joe rogan was too mean and said too many things in his past for bernie to accept his endorsement completely ridiculous and you see what trump does there he doesn't care what the political establishment says he speaks to what he knows his base is now he was lying to them we're still in the iraq war he didn't do anything he said but if we you know we as socialists have an actual plan for ending the wars and making people's lives better so we need to understand that the democratic party is not our friend and it might be time to work you know around the democratic party rather than within it and understand these democratic party elites function the same as the republican party elites when you say stuff like the iraq war was a mistake and they lied us into it by torturing people at abu ghraib they'll go boo you're so offensive for saying that but people at home go that's true and people at home people like you and me know folks who have been sent to syria and iraq in the middle east and who have come back with ptsd and haven't been taken care of by our government so we want you know a president who's saying they're gonna end these senseless needless wars you know which is part of the reason trump won and establishment media like cnn and msnbc will do everything they can to convince you that every single one of trump's supporters is this horrible racist but in 2016 there were a lot of people who voted for him because he said he was going to end the horrific trade deals implemented by bill clinton and bring people's jobs back and he said he was going to bring all the troops back and end the wars he lied he didn't do any of it because he's a slimy capitalist but his campaign techniques are something to learn from right quit genuflecting to the establishment speak to the masses and the establishment was so offended by trump they just gave him free air time non-stop every time he said something offensive cnn would be like oh look at what trump said now when will it end and then he got so much free air time from that he won i want to see a democrat do that i want to see bernie sanders message with the balls of trump right i think that was a tweet that went on during the bernie campaign and i agree with it and um yeah i mean you got to reach the masses is that not what every single work of theory says whether it's lenin or mao or ingles or marx or whoever whoever you're reading they say you have to reach the masses the people who work and that is kind of what trump did in a way fifty percent of the country doesn't vote right so you need to reach those people too as well as when the working people voted for trump and i'm not saying would you know appeal to the actually racist part of trump's base right the q anon people or um anti-semitic people or members of the ku klux klan we don't want them right we want them out of society but but we do want his base of industrial workers who voted for him or john deere employees right those are the kind of people we want to win to socialism because we have a legitimate plan to make their lives better we have a legitimate plan to nationalize the military industrial complex companies and fossil fuel industry who have been pushing for foreign interventions and bring all the troops home and reinvest all that money in american jobs because that is what would be best for american working people so that's what we have to sell we have to get to the masses and say that and when the the establishment tells us we're being racist for talking about class which is literally something i've seen them say when you talk about poverty and and the working class that's being racist because you're ignoring people of color people of color are in the working class dang it you're racist if you think it's um if you think uh people of color aren't in the working class the only way to advance um the plight of people of color is to advance the plight of the working class right that's what intersectionality is but they're gonna call you racist they're going to call you a piece of crap for accepting joe rogan's endorsement and all we got to do is just keep keep leading with tolerance but but reaching the masses too you know nope these are lies i support um i support trans people i support the entire lgbtq plus community i support women's rights i support people of color ending the the racist prison industrial complex but i also support class struggle i also support worker ownership workers should own industry workers should own the banks um and workers should own the major sectors of economic power because um right now we have a few private capitalists who control all the major sectors of economic power and they are destroying the planet leaving us in these endless wars and trump came to power saying he was going to do something about it and then he continued all of it and now we have another establishment goon joe biden but it's time to reach the masses with something new with socialism all right everyone thanks for listening to my rant hope you're having a great day [Music] solidarity
