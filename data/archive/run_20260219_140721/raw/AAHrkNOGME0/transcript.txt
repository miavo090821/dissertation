hi everyone and welcome back to the probably cancelled podcast in Coalition with the midwestern marks Institute my name is Bridget and I'm your host and today I am here with my guest the wonderful Katherine Le Leu right Katherine Le is that correct who is a professor of film and media studies at UC Irvine she's also the author of virtue hoarders the case against the professional managerial class that came out in 2021 if I recall correctly and she's been making quite a few waves since then uh critiquing the left from a position that I really appreciate and I know a lot of my listeners would really appreciate and so when I discovered your work I just knew I had to immediately reach out to you and have you on so welcome to the podcast Katherine I'm super happy to you than you for having me great great to be here thank you yeah so just to start off I always like to ask people about their personal political journey and how you've come to um where you are today politically do you mind sharing that with our audience real quick uh no not at all I you know when I was growing up um I'm much older than you guys it was the 1970s and it was a time when there was still a lot more workingclass power in America just cultural political and every level and I like i' like to um remind people of this because people of my generation experienced this but I think people of your generation lived with austerity and just thought that these were the way things were but um my public school was in a not very wealthy suburb of New York City Mount Veron right outside of the Bronx and we had free music lessons we had the entire upstairs of the public school which was built during the worker um progress administration in Neo Gothic form it was an art studio and there was all this material painting um um rope making um paper mâché just dedicated art studio dedicated music and um our classic rooms were beautiful they were small and they were well provisioned and now I live in I raised my son in one of the wealthiest suburbs in California maybe the world and all of these things like art and music are add-ons that the PTA has to raise money for and all this comes out of the California tax revolt and Reagan Era austerity so public goods have been undermined within my lifetime in such a profound way like even the simplest Social Democratic redistribution of wealth just through the public schools has been stopped um dead in its tracks um so I saw that transformation but the other thing that was happening in my family which is very peculiar was that my father worked at the United Nations and we would go back to China every two years because the UN was set up like a colonial British institution which is that you have home leave every two years because it's viewed as a hardship for you to be away from the Home Country which was London at that time and but in the UN it was for all the employees they had a fully pay trip every two years to China and there were very very difficult times in China we began by going in the early 70s um I continued to travel there with my family to the mid 80s and until I went by myself but um and my father was part of like a serious group of um Marxist leftist New York dissidents who were Chinese and I was like really interested in their discussions he was but you know he all he his ideological commitments were not that you know deep but I became like really interested in um a Marxist understanding of history and I sort of like the little ears like L over hearing what the adults were talking about and the idea of um work our dignity worker autonomy like basic issues about capitalism the class struggle and um anti-imperialism were sort of in the air in the 70s to and then in my family in a very concentrated way not that anyone else in my family cared about these things but I just had it in the air and then um I went to Yale as an undergraduate and I was on like four different kinds of scholarship and I didn't really I I was hustling and I just thought I had to keep up with these rich kids and it was really scary but I did have a couple of um one in particular when I look back at on him now Marxist Professor named Richard helprin and he really you know we read Marx together in class and it really opened up my eyes to like these things that people were talking about when I was younger but like seeing them in the text form and I was um also just very very um suspicious of like the cold war version of liberal ideology because the um Cold War official lines on China were that you know these are um it's a gray and uniform Society with persecuted people and everyone is like a robot going into work you have no choice and there you know it's very oppressive and it's totalitarian and everyone hates the Communist party and I go to China and it wasn't it certainly was very different from America it was very very poor but um because my father's family were mainly peasants like they had material improvements in their lives and they weren't like coached to speak to us in certain ways in family time but they'd be like oh yes you know we we we're doing this Collective farming and my husband has joined the army and I take care of his family it was like a very strange combination very traditional Confucian ways of looking at things but also a very like optimistic and Collective life that my family had because we were they were poor peasants and things were getting better through the especially after you know dung xaing comes to power in 76 and things um there's a little more freedom in terms of like farming your own land and things like that and you could see that there was a lot of struggle for what the right way was to go in China and there were some really like um beautiful things about a life like experiencing a life in a kind of pre- capitalist world you know cuz it's gone now in China like with my family and um you know my aunts and cousins and everything there was no TV there was no entertainment after um in the evenings except for storytelling and singing and um a lot of the stuff culture was cultural revolution stuff you know peasant songs things like that and then I'd come back to the States and I'd be in my you know High School history class or social studies class theyd be like China and the USSR great lands of totalitarianism where the people are oppressed and ready to overthrow their rulers but they have no power and I'd be like this is just a lot I actually got into really big trouble with my history teacher in like 10th or 11th grade because I raised my hand and I was like Miss s this is not right this is not I've been to China this is not and she and you know I was like um you know probably a mouthy 15-year-old and she said she literally said this to me I will never forget this she goes Kathy you open your mouth again about this and I'm going to put my size hu in in it I don't want to hear from you right now because I I was just like I object I object and um and I was like wow we live in a democracy right we have we're supposed to have all this freedom but I'm actually not allowed to express a um dissenting View and um the end of the story is not so happy I actually walked out of class I was like you threatened me like this is before girl boss hash whatever in um feminist circles like girls have to stand up themselves I was just like I'm not going to be threatened physically and I was like being abused at home too so but I had this like very strong sense of myself because I was such a nerd and just a good reader and the counselor and the teacher had to come in and my teacher and my mother met and my mother took the teacher's side but I was like I'm not going back to class until someone apologizes to me and I um I took a stand and I realized that you know I wasn't going to win this war but I was going to be suspicious of propaganda of American propaganda and I was not going to take anything that they said about International like the government or the schools or anything they said about international relations other countries at face value like that was a really important formative moment for me and that I also understood like if you stand up for what you believe in you will be in trouble like you you were literally I literally got in trouble and I was like a straight A student and everything so um my convictions my leftist convictions were always very very deep but when I went to college the big thing was feminism and everyone's like oh I'm a feminis I didn't realize it was second wave feminism that was actually trying to um demolish old school socialist working class feminism I was just like oh yeah feminism that makes sense like women have been excluded from government and all these other things um but I was really uneasy with a lot of the methodological and intellectual um underpinnings I'm sorry is this going on for way too long no please say as much as you would like no I love I love this this is this is you asked me about my political past and then I just I decided to tell the story never quite in this way so I'm really glad for the opportunity but so I'm like and then deconstruction was really cool and so it's like feminism deconstruction psychoanalysis but I had this core core formation of like reading marks by myself reading the Frankfurt School that I discovered by myself because I was really interested in the Enlightenment and rationality and reason and nobody was reading these things because it was the end of the Cold War was cultural studies and the feminists could say the second way feminists could say oh Marxist they're so um sexist and yeah their P it's the patriarchy and um the cultural studies people were like oh we can't criticize popular culture because that's what the people like and um the strains of Marxism that I did come into contact with later were like Jameson Frederick Jameson who passed away Rip but it was very culturally based right there was no sense of class as a dynamic that was a driving force in history and I had actually seen like there was a lot of lip service to the working class in China which were because there was no industrial working class before the Revolution they divide us workers peasants soldiers right these were people who they um the government wanted to promote in terms of their interests a against a kind of urban litera you know Elite and so there was a lot of um government communist sponsored you know um um definitions of cultural of of the class struggle right from top down but I also saw from the 70s and 80s onward that the American working class was being undermined from the top down um on every single level and you know one of the things I was wondering is about myself is like why I feel so close to the American working class I mean partially my my one of my aunts is a member of of unite here now she's a hotel worker she's a unionized hotel worker who has not retired who works at the Four Seasons who loves her Union who does not really speak English and her Union is this like educational um um institution it's an integrative institution it like has won her so many rights she loves it ask any other professor in America if they have a non-college educated Union member and their family and I don't think you're going to find that many so I I mean maybe like 1% you know but um I I I often feel like she's a a sort of moral compass for me when these Dems come up with some new identitarian thing I'm like H I wonder what my ant would think about that you know and that's like a really good for me like a really good um moral standard because rather than being like Oh yeah PR SS great you know be like huh I wonder what um s would say if she had to introduce herself with pronouns like every doing before every meeting like after a long day of being on her feet doing room service at the Four Seasons and if if she wasn't organized you know what if all of these like college educated people came in to her workplace we tried to organize her luckily Unite Here Now is a really strong union so they are unionized already but can you imagine like trying to unionize workers with this like pronoun first kind of thing that you know people were doing after 2016 because everyone went crazy because of the first Trump thing right and the other thing was that I think that when I was growing up in New York um there was a much more organically um integrated racial and class classroom there was busing but there was also like a really powerful connection with like old workingclass New York neighborhoods because this suburb that I lived in was right outside of the Bronx and a lot of like white workingclass italian-americans Irish Americans African-Americans Jamaican Americans this was like the first step to respectability but we were like so close to like the workingclass neighborhoods of the Bronx of Brooklyn satin Island where they had come from so that culture is really precious to me like I don't see working class men and go oh my God there's such sexist oh my God they don't know anything they're like oppressing me I just don't see that at all I I you know I have to like put on my Ken glasses or something you know to see them as the enemy I I just don't I just and I don't see workingclass women as like some kind of like male identified reactionaries or something I I just see them like um as people who are whose struggles are like my struggles I don't know it's just so so um that's a lot of background I had to hide my um real commitment to leftism until I finished my dissertation and then I was revising it to become a book and still I was disguising it because it was really unpopular it's like the 90s like it's go- go you know uh econom it's the uh new economy it's all this it's like Del and guari it's just all this like um weird like anti- like veiled anti-marxism anti-materialism that's happening at the very elite levels of literary Theory cultural studies everything like that and um so so you know I had a kid and I had to go along to get along and I was just like okay I have to you know get he health insurance keep my mouth shut um I guess I could have become a union organizer or stayed in New York I just I went to Minnesota and that was where I had my first job and um I really wanted to like pursue the life of the mind but it was kind of like hiding there and then you know everyone's like um postmodernism this postmodernism that I was like okay I never used that term in any of my work and then finally like things came turned my way in 2008 in the financial crisis after the financial crisis graduate students and students became much more seriously interested in left point in marks and today you know I feel like I have a place there but still there are people in my University who are Marxist and I'm not included in their Marxist um worlds because I'm not like always talking about the labor theory of value or trying to have the perfect right reading of Marx or saying you know you have to read postone I really you think of markx and historical materialism as a great way of understanding the present political situation and a great way of understanding culture industry and and work and Leisure and the entire problem of history is something that is made so exciting to me by trying to understand class struggle and kind of universal trajectory towards emancipation and whether or not technology and um capitalism can serve that purpose of liberating the greatest number of people from exploitation as possible because if you know your history you know that Marx too understood like the capitalist revolutions um the Bourgeois Revolutions of the 18th and 19th centur early 19th century as revolutionary and you're not just like using class as a kind of moral um category you can you can understand the world and it's and the way that it is as a formation of this kind of universal struggle and you don't go around going oh my God I'm decolonizing the curriculum do you know what decolonizing the curriculum has not helped any Colonial people um it's a narcissistic academic exercise that we perform to diversify like a range of authors Etc but people right now I I think you're probably aware of this too have young people have so little understanding of history that even teaching history to make it important to make it seem important I think can only be done through a historical materialist lens because otherwise it becomes hagiography or empiricism or um um left virtue posturing like oh there were so sexist and patriarchal in the 18th century oh that was a colonial thing and um we are we are at an inflection point in our culture where we are going to lose all repositories of knowledge of the past and that's what capitalism wants actually it wants amnesiac um subjects who don't even know how to begin to question in the status quo and one way in which I began to understand like the importance of socialism and social this Revolution was that under um socialism ideally there would be enough Surplus value and surplus time that anyone could be an intellectual or an artist if they wanted to be and they wouldn't be like all part of the you know 24-hour 7day a week grind in the hustle culture that your generation has to be involved in just to survive economically and in that kind of world you have no time you have no time to think you have no time to um um have an to be aut autonomous or dignified subjects within even liberalism I mean everyone's like talking about the collapse in educational standards Etc a liberal democracy really depends upon citizens capable of reason and um ironically you know I think that the um we've never had higher educational attainment in the United States but we've also never had like more um um I don't know General ignorance about the stakes of just democracy itself so um um we can talk about Trump later but I do think and I do think that the rejection of liberalism by the the electorate the Democratic party liberalism is a kind of desperate popular expression of a need for something radically different and that radically different thing is Trump right now and it's pretty horrific but we can see it in a positive dialectical way as the like popular demand for something not not not the liberal authorit that is not the liberal authorit of Obama Biden Paris right something other than the status quo and uh man what an interesting I mean what an amazing upbringing and you being able to see the truth behind the lies that you were being taught in school and having you know conversations and all these interactions with your family who are peasants in China and then compare to your life in the University which is really I mean in the 80s and 90s was the burgeoning of the gender studies soup of postmodernism so you really got to see everything firsthand I feel like I know I personally believe I this not really a Marxist belief but I believe in destiny and I I do think that you are probably destined to be in the position that you're in uh to share your insights of what You' what you've literally seen for yourself so um I guess from there do you want to just talk a little bit more about your work and spe specifically your work and how I'm sure your life has informed uh the work that you do um maybe I'll talk a little bit about this book that I've been working on for so long which is called traumatized and um we're in edits and I hope we'll be in production and it should be out next year 2025 maybe the end of the year through Verso um it was um I was really um at the for some I was one of the w Witnesses of the beginning of trauma studies is this too academic for people no no this is perfect uh for this venue okay so um trauma studies if you all don't know if you haven't been exposed to it through um liberal arts education is um a way of Reading literature as testimony and confession to trauma and it really began at Yale when um I was in these seminars with these you know um um the prim genitors of the um discipline um Kathy kth and josana Felman who are psychically Orient psychoanalytically oriented deconstructionists and um um I found it very compelling at the time because I was a very traumatized person at the time and um I I I felt like um maybe this was speaking to me and now when when I look back upon the history of trauma studies and the and the um um emergence of trauma culture in the 70s and 80s I really see it as a um epif phenomenon or symptom of the rise of second W feminism and the personal is the political um Pol um Imagination around political Awakening so one of the deep root roots of identity politics is this particular formation because what it is based on is the fact that in the public sphere or in the academic world or in the professional World um patriarchal culture has not recognized certain specific experiences to women has not recognized our traumas and has mistreated you know rape victims etc etc um because of these sexist bad psychiatrists policemen Etc and so it um it emerged trauma studies also converged with the emergence of um um a kind of psychiatric pract a feminist psychiatric practice that was going to take the symptoms of um post-traumatic stress that they said was post trumatic stress that were part of Vic um victims of sexual assault um women mostly and they were saying these are symptoms and this is a disease this a disorder that is like PTSD for Vietnam Vets because initially PTSD was introduced into the DSM the diagnostic statistic manual by anti-war Pro Vietnam vet um psychiatrists and social workers and when Judith Herman came up in the 80s and early 90s she was like we need to have recognize that women who've been sexually assaulted um dis many of the symptoms that should be included in the DSM and therefore they can get treatment you know insurance companies could then you know pay for treatment it had a lot of policy um effects and there was a kind of advocacy Judi Herman did for um um proper treatment of women uh who had been victims of sexual assault this is all good however there's a tendency in sort of the rap group consciousness raising second wve feminism politics of turning the political into the personal and the personal into the political that of them became highly individualized and it fed right into the culture of recovery and self-help that became very very instrumental for women especially who were you know materially stressed by the decline of the male way of the family wage for male Partners the sexual Revolution economic insecurity for workingclass men and and the reconfiguration of the working-class family and um de-industrialization and the kind of um hyper um hyper accumulation of um Prestige and capital for professional managerial class women who are emerging as a Vanguard of the feminist like who were able to say like my success is my political um activism or whatever it was like I think Hillary Clinton is a really good example of that kind of feminist um and they were able to and I'm going to the details in the book I don't want to go to too deeply but they were able to take trauma and make it the focus of um trauma studies and feminism time was able to take trauma as a kind of personal Affliction for which there could be a cure that was a kind a new understanding very theoretical understanding of human suffering that was afflict that could afflict anyone in any class this I think is really important here and I call it the gentrification of suffering and it was it was R the 70s and 80s as the social movements and the unrest of the 60s lost steam um Elites configure child sexual abuse um female female victimization as as points of advocacy so that we could move away from class and actually demonize men workingclass men as the true enemies and have the professional woman be the savior of this is part of the PMC argument that I make of vulnerable and weak victims children and women and the and the thing that um it allowed women to do is I identify with the subject position that received a lot of recognition From Within These rap groups and everything but it also was the imagination of a kind of History a kind of um political Awakening that um all these second W feminists were talking about like it's the aha moment when you realize aha I I realize it's all because I'm a woman that I'm oppressed or it was because of my trauma that I'm acting out this way and doing drugs sleeping with inappropriate men you have this aha moment and then you find like-minded people and you create political change so there's no like real organization or education necessary it's just we all we all raise our Consciousness together it is so crazy and countercultural but what I think is really amazing is it's still the Paradigm of intersubjective relations on the left like we'll just raise the consciousness of one person at a time literally they thought this they Hipp stus in the age of Aquarius and then like the whole Paradigm will shift and we'll be in the age of Aquarius right we were in the Age of Capricorn now we're going to shift into the Age of Enlightenment and um it's very much I think a way of um deflecting and suppressing the kinds of solidarity that were necessary to create real political change in the forms of revolutions or and and Powerful worker action and this was a time when um workers were being you and unions were being attacked by Reagan and Thatcher in um England and so we have this imaginary political change that will take place that'll be transformative um one individual at a time with regard to a kind of new way of looking at things that the stupid people who haven't had their consciousness raised don't understand oh man I'm so excited for when that book comes out that's actually like right up my alley as far as this podcast is concerned and I mean it started out as kind of like a a Marxist feminist radical radical feminist tinge podcast and over time I realized how the Battle of the Sexes yeah well it it used to be yeah and then over time I really realized uh how the Battle of the Sexes is really weaponized against us and how feminism has has been leverage leveraged specifically by uh entities such as the CIA to push down workers movements and class Consciousness and also to keep women in a Perpetual victim cycle which I I see I see all around me all the time and I find that to be really psychologically damaging and also just like the crazy I would just hear the craziest rhetoric I mean I've done multiple episodes on this uh at this point to kind of like process this Moe of thought through um but then when you attach it to the therapy world and big Pharma and those interests that's like a whole other realm of yeah scary stuff so I'm really glad that you're working on that and uncovering all of that because somebody's got to do it I'm telling the story and I have done like the research to make these arguments but I want to make this research have and the thesis like have some kind of usefulness for those for confronting on contemporary moments um in my work I never felt like the goal well I never wanted the goal to be like Oh I'm the smartest person in the room and you know showing off about that but so often in our in my profession there is this kind of like um display of audition that seems very empty to me I I really believe in good research I really believe in a you know well researched typ thesis but I always think like the end is about um ideology critique like if we can get to undermining the ideological illusions that keep us separate and keep us down that's what all good research should lead to but um I should say like it's second W feminism that really does this and you know Gloria steum has been found to be a CIA plant you know this and she sued the authors of the book that had exposed her um association with the CIA so that they would they it could never come out but it but it's a great um example of just like understanding the history of PM's professional managerial class second w feminism so we're not duped by it because we keep the Democratic party keeps wanting to be like we're the party of women women don't even like them like most women are working class most human beings are working-class on the planet most people in America are working class and like to Swan around and talk about breaking glass ceilings instead of increasing wages and the minimum wage is not popular it's just not popular I even the abortion thing was driving me crazy like at the DN see they had they paraded all these women who were testifying to like their painful abortions or their inability to get abortion I was like this is the image of women this is what you think women care about I'm sorry women this is falling so flat women are trying to feed their families they're trying to pay their rent they're trying to like have good relationships if you really cared about women you would have on the top of your platform Universal single pay healthare like abortion would be part of that but Universal single Health Care liberates women from shitty jobs and shitty relationships and that is like too socialist feminism for them or maternity leave like why do I hear no one even mentioning maternity leave something as basic leave for a year you you know how much of a diff I had six weeks six freaking weeks and crazy maternity but the only way I survived it was I had a fellowship I was always like I had a fellowship so I could like you know insert the fellowship into the six weeks and then like um get a teaching schedule where I could have a babysitter twice a week because I had no money and then so I was home three days a week had the babysitter two days a week it was just total hustle hustle culture in a putatively progressive state of Minnesota I think separating babies from their mothers at 6 weeks is child abuse and that's like and it's maternal abuse but we we can't but we are not even talking about those things so there was there's a really strong and powerful tradition of women leftists from Emma Goldman Rosa Luxembourg they were always fighting the workers fights right the fights for the working class and in America there was a long tradition of socialist feminism which um was attacked by McCarthyism and the anti-communist Cold War mode but these women were so important to their unions a lot of them in the service Workers Union like unite here now in seu they worked for UAW but they their um visibility was not only um damaged and in their lives as well by McCarthyism and the anti-communist um craze and moral panics of the 1950s but they actually fought for visibility and legitimacy with second W feminists and a second W feminist one and they thought you know you're just old old school old left types it was a little bit like you know madin Albright and Gloria sanum calling young women who were into Bernie Bernie Bros they just want to meet um men you know when I was coming up in the world the um feminists would say like oh you can't do that that's so male identified so there was it's about kind of Purity politics I can't believe that young women in your generation you still have to go through this [ __ ] but it's like they can't invent anything new so it's all about control it's all about political um suppression of class and mind control in the way that they say they offer you a carrot if you believe if you are a mouthpiece for this ideology then you get you get real rewards you get grants you get you know positions you get in University you get you know um to be um um Sanctified by the PMC um hold on you know non-governmental organizations and stuff like like if you're like oh yeah I'm really to microloans for men in Sri Lanka it's really interesting and you're you're like basically a tool of capital saying you're helping these ve impoverished women in Sri Lanka and you get to have your little NGO job you get to come back to DC go to law school and you get to be uplifted into some governmental position eventually become Samantha power Hillary Clinton um the other thing that they do is they let you um work in a charity like the Children's Fund for a while like I just help the children that's where Hillary Clinton first worked in the law from Bush went into corporate law a aocc went to Africa spreading um like different forms of birth control there so people would stop having babies that was her like feminist work that she did before she ran for office yeah so it's just it's this kind of like peace core NGO feminism that doesn't upset the apple cart doesn't say anything about redistribution doesn't attack the class relations and you're rewarded for that as a y as a woman as a young woman and you know I feel like we as women need to speak out against this because these the Knuckleheads in charge of the democratic party are like we need a feminist Joe Rogan oh my God the Tinder Gap is so great it's like you tell men they're toxic and any woman who actually has controversial views like Joe Rogan you just ride her out of town on rail like Angela Nagel they did that to her they did this to Amber a Le Frost when she got these are popular left-wing women on social media who didn't obey the Orthodoxy and they were just I mean they're fine they're fine but they're not a voice that these Libs can handle because they're like the dirt bag left or they they they took a position on one issue that the Dem Elites don't like we have to line up on everything like immigration crime gender um abortion like everyone has to like line up on that on those issues and if you don't line up on any of those issues even if you have more in common with the Dems then with the conservatives they will they will [ __ ] excommunicate you from the liberal world and I you know don't think this is freedom I don't think this is good democracy and I don't think this is good for workingclass women it's really good there was um a study done and by um a bunch of social scientists I have the citation somewhere where they said like um bread and butter um advocacy for raising the minimum wage for everyone Universal Health Care for everyone those programs help women the majority of women workingclass women much more than anti-bias training or um diversity efforts in the boardroom and the Sea suite and the breaking of the glass ceiling policies that people are putting into place at Morgan Stanley at the top law firms in you know in the top Finance um departments in the art world you know where we have to have more women in the um Museum yes women artists are really really um underrepresented but those kinds of cure rated Elite gender equality initiatives just don't touch the lives of the majority of women in America and so the Dems keep losing but their donor base is all like in the boardroom so they just want to give money to these initiatives that leave um that leave the EC economic structure intact but feminism has now been held hostage by people like Cheryl sanberg and Hillary Clinton and KL Harris and we need to like find some other way of um articulating women's causes as working class causes so I I'm like so mad right now about feminism I could say I also think that the Democratic party and liberals and within acad IA and within the sort of PMC um Elite com context they were not content with um victories about like um um female representation or female visibility or gay marriage they had to keep pushing more Vanguard um gender Theory type gender Theory things onto the political agenda because this is sounds somewhat conspiratorial once the working class accept something culturally the PMC has to like up the ante and make something more bizarre happen so that they can always leave the working class behind once the working class accepted women's equality the working class has accepted G um gay marriage in this like really amazing way like in my lifetime the transformation of views about gay marriage and you know gay people has been such a victory right but they're not but you're not like able to celebrate this as a cross-class thing for workingclass gay people they move they moved on to some to um you can't do um gay studies it has to be queer theory that you have to queer things now sudden like women can in heterosexual relationships can say that they're queer and then you have to like deal with the Trans issues they're vanishingly small numbers of people who have gender dysphoria but we have to highlight this as a civil rights issue because the PMC always has to lead on identitarianism and once you have a civil rights victory that the majority of Americans accept like women's equality and gay marriage they have to constantly be finding other cultural um vanguardist positions and celebrate them because it's hatched in a graduate seminar a lot of the working a lot of working trans people I know from workingclass back grounds resent being used by the Democratic party in this way to create this kind of Vanguard identity many of them don't want to be have that kind of attention they feel more afflicted by capitalism there are trans leftists who don't dare criticize this kind of trans politics because you know um I did like four years ago and I was told on Twitter DM constantly to kill myself take Xanax take you're you're such a transphobe you know know just go kill yourself like this [ __ ] just happened like to anyone who was like maybe this isn't the way we lead in our political messaging well it's really backfiring on them now yeah you should yeah you should you don't deserve to breathe anymore if you have any kind of differing opinion about Zer Sho self Neo like what what is this what what is any of this and you that a a eliminated her pronouns last week and you had that on list of things to discuss and I think it's really fascinating because she's like politically very Savvy and she was testing this stuff right and then she backed down from it but do you remember like two or three years ago she and Nancy Pelosi posted on Instagram happy birthing person day on Happy Mother's Day on Mother's Day people don't forget this [ __ ] you know and she's like our great Progressive hope now but these these types of politicians and these types of women they don't have deep political convictions like if they see something not happening like it's not popular anymore they'll back off from it and it's just pure opportunism and people like across the board when they were interviewed after the election were saying like we just so tired of this kind of like fakeness we're just so tired of these staged um positions we and this kind of being talked down to yeah Trump is an [ __ ] he's horrible he's probably a dictator but we feel like he's like um authentic like he's saying what he thinks and everyone's like oh my God this is so horrible but it's a but you don't have Trump without the corruption of liberal political rhetoric that we've seen in the past 15 years I mean I will that image of happy birthing person day is seared into my brain but like extra painful I mean it's just and I see this in and I gave birth last year but I would see this type of language in all the duas and midwives that I was searching for when I when I got pregnant and I needed to find somebody to help me give birth all of these midwives are suddenly like gender neutral language you can't say the word breastfeeding you can't say mother you can't say like there's just all all of their websites are now there and a lot of them they don't want to do this but people will take the time to like message them on the Internet and say hey just so you know your language on your website is not inclusive and that makes me really uncomfortable and you need to change that immediately and then to save their career they'll change it or else someone will make a campaign against a midwife somewhere so like all these people are just forced to eliminate I mean I guess the woman word woman is a it's a bad word now so well no like we can say we can say it again and I A A girlfriend of mine who gave birth a couple of years ago two years ago was telling me this and I was like this is insane like if you look at the longitudinal studies of transgender people and gender dysphoria they say like the most accurate percentage of people with gender dysphoria is 0.75% of the human population most serious gender dysphoria um in 0.075% let's say half of them are trans let's say of the trans so we're at 0.35% but let's say of that 0 35% like 1% or 5% of them H actually have children like we're talking a vanishingly small group of people but and we we don't want to exclude them so we can't actually use gendered pronouns it's like I don't think those people want to be used in that way um but some of that I think the majority of that vanishingly small group of people don't want to be used that way maybe some of them allow themselves to be used that way by liberals but it is a total um disrespect of women's biology and of like human tradition human it's difficult enough to the human biology and like the spe the survival of the species you just gave birth it's difficult enough to give birth to survive with your child as it is the medical care and the kinds of care that we get in America is bad enough as it is like um I had 48 hours in the hospital covered by insurance I don't know how many how much you had do you know in China you have a month you there's like the sacred time of life for women after they've given birth where you know maybe some of us would say like I want to stay in a hospital for a month but there's like maternity words where your family brings you food and you can be with your child and someone can take care of your child so you can sleep like that we don't have any [ __ ] like that but we can't use gendered pronouns like I would say like we can go through all these Vanguard positions if we gave people basic Provisions like Dems go crazy but give us Universal Health Care give us a years um maternity leave give us a month in a special you know um maternity care Ward for women and children if they want to stay there give us the social supports that we need to have children before you get through get into these Arcane um identitarian um flourishes and you know what I'm even scared to say this because I've had such attacks on me and the university is a place where all of this a lot of these politics play out but I've really decided like before I came on today too I was like you know what it's time for us us to talk about this stuff and it's time for us to represent other points of view because when I was being attacked like this a lot of trans friends and trans people were dming me being like it's really horrible what they're doing to you I would hate to have this happen to me I hate you having my identity being used like this but we were all so scared we're all [ __ ] scared out of our minds um because of the viciousness of the attacks and because of probably cancellation at that time time was like a very real thing that was happening and then um I you know I just I am someone who believes that all the liberal institutions right now have are so low in trust including science including the government including the university how do we create greater trust it's not by telling people how to use language in these Arcane ways I'll tell you that much it's about actually having serious objective em empathetic debates with people and all of this is really it's really backfiring and I I feel like we've reached the peak of the madness and now we're starting to like see kind of just the tip of the other side where hopefully things will hopefully things will die down with this uh hyper postmodernist academic I don't know yeah I think people are seeing it for what it is yeah but I mean it's cost them a lot of Elections not just the presidential election but also local elections for example so like what I am I'm curious to get your take on the election this is the first episode I've recorded since uh Trump won so I'd love to get your personal analysis of the uh campaigns that that both candidates ran and then the results and the Fallout from that what do you think I think we're still sorting through it now and um one of the things that I'm most struck by there are two things I'm most I'm really struck by like and it's taking a little bit of time to go through all the numbers and everything but number one kamla burned through a billion dollars in a 100 days and she's and her campaign is in debt there are people who haven't been paid like $20 million in debt so the Miss got paid yeah Beyonce got paid Oprah got paid like the way that she got all those celebrity endorsements that were actually buy offs was is really appalling and I was reading about um how much she paid for data analytics and I thought we had learned the lesson that you can't groom a campaign through analyzing data and analyzing focus groups because that was the big mistake that Hillary Clinton made was that she was so groomed through the um through data and they did it again they did it again I I also think that um all of these things that I was talking about with regard to the professional man of JAL class the second W feminists and their ambition and pure power hungriness and how they fit right into the status quo is that the women of my generation because kamla and I are about the same age the women of my generation who succeeded were all good girls and I'm not saying like I didn't succeed but I'm like succeeded in the liberal institutions they were like oh were little Mis perfect but what they lacked was any kind of spontaneity or authenticity because they had been groomed from the very beginning to present themselves as like um um non-controversial non- dissenting um figures with regard to power so there are many many talented female politicians and lawyers of Our Generation but the ones that have risen to the top are these classic good girls they and I'm using that in a very very specific way like they're they're not going to question power they're very identified with feminism as a mode of gaining more power and um with regard to cist um Harris's um previous campaigns she was a really bad campaigner she lost California during the first primary she and she's from California and so her lack of popularity um was part of her weakness as a figure but she was selected by Biden because he made this promise that he was going to have a African American woman be his the vice president and So within the pool of really a accomplished African-American women he picked this woman who was going to not rock the boat in some way but she was also because she was so um ambitious and unable to really be spontaneous she was totally unequipped to actually be a political campaigner there's something we love in America about the show we love conman we love Showmanship we love the circus PT Barnum was the um the primogeniture of u s of salesmanship and the spectacle and she couldn't do it she couldn't perform Hillary couldn't perform either why do we pick such lame women to actually be candidates to represent the party I don't know like she should have gone on Rogan and she couldn't do it she didn't want to do it it was like going to be a three-hour interview she needed to be scripted at every moment and that script was being derived from some kind of data analytics and I think the way that um The Campaign spent money was really about Chuck Schumer's idea that we were just that the Democratic party not we oh my God no um was the Democratic party was going to try to peel off Centrist Republican votes in the suburbs that's all they cared about we and he said that 2016 like we can lose the working class but we need to move the Republican Centrist Suburban voter to um um the Dem side and when you see that kind of campaign happening what actually happened was it depressed Democratic turnout because no one was excited about her candidacy like Trump won with 71 million votes he won the popular vote because Democratic turnout was low low so I thought that was fascinating I ALS and I think that her inability to connect with ordinary Americans was what a huge handicap that um people papered over because she was better at performing than Hillary um but she was still unable to like formulate a thought that hadn't been scripted by aund handlers and there's something crazy about Trump but he would say the craziest [ __ ] and then the um New York Times would say oh he's losing his mind he's cognitively impaired but he was unscripted and the friends I knew who went to his rallies would say you know out of interest out of cultural interest but also because they're like manual labor workingclass guys um they say like there was just so much love for the guy like they' be people they'd be talking on people would be giving out um swag and he'd ask them like so why are you voting for him like don't you think he's a little crazy and people be like yeah I know he's crazy but I just really like him yeah I mean and there's also the aspect that the Democrats now are basically neocons with pronouns in their bio it's really interesting to see the the shift that's happened just in my lifetime alone how they don't I mean they're really proar I mean they they love what's going on in Ukraine there's no real push back yeah it's really interesting how um and I mean there have been polls that show that I mean Democratic support for the CIA and FBI has skyrocketed since 2016 in comparison with the Republicans it's just a complete nose dive and people are saying like we should abolish these institutions and abolish the fed and I there's just been a complete like flip-flop almost of the old like the old ways how the parties used to be when I was a kid that's been really interesting to see yeah that's been really interesting yeah and um I'm you know the other thing I was going to say was that that um the Democratic party just took for granted that minorities would vote for them no matter what they did and they and the shift to the right in every minority demographic was also really interesting too and I think that that you know people are saying it was the in it was inflation everyone like hated the incumbent um Administration that had overseen inflation and inflation as a function of how difficult was for people to um make a living live with dignity put food on the table pay the rent that those kinds of material issues the Dem the Dems would address as but the economy is doing really well unemployment is really low it was just this kind of denial of the reality of everyday struggle right and people within the working class within the non- colge educated voter um demographic moved right in this really really powerful way the other thing that people would say me you know when they would criticize my argument about how the Democrats have become the party of the professional manag classes up until up until this election um people at the lowest income level were still voting Democratic so people below $50,000 a year salary were mostly blue this election had changed those people voted Republican broke majority Republican and people who made over $200,000 a year broke Democrat so you have these two shifts on the income level but you know what there are more poor people in America than there are rich people like I don't know how I don't know how to get this message into their heads like I I don't want to be talking to the de a lot of leftists have been like you know we need to tell them to do this this and this I had a week of that where I was like God you know someone should make me write a orig tutal for the guardian someone in the Wall Street Journal wrote an article headlined it's it's class not identity and I was like I could have written that article but now I feel like I'm tired of like being like look let me tell you what to do I feel like what I should be doing my mission is to talk to people like like-minded people like you younger people like you and to and to give um support for dissenting leftist views [ __ ] I could probably like you know I could probably make a lot more money I guess if I like Got a New York Times outed but [ __ ] them you know I'll just keep going on and just I I need to we need to expand the conversation and not be like Oh I'm Rah Emanuel James Carville like can I just tell you it's totally ridiculous these people are so corrupt they're so entrenched in the ideological machine and so um the the break this the break with the Democratic party on the part of um non-college educated low-income people of all Races that is a great lesson we need to take from no no one wants to hear your [ __ ] when you can't put food on a table no one wants to hear that [ __ ] and we don't want Wars we don't want Wars we want we don't wanty yeah we don't want Netanyahu coming over and demanding more money from us like we no very few people want that Biden just authorized the use of American weapons in Ukraine um to fight Russia so there's been like a low simmering um uh war with Russia that the Dems want the Dems want that and um I'm not saying like Trump doesn't want it but it really is like if there is no choice if there's no difference between these two warmongering parties then um people are like let's try our luck with another party because we've had four years of this and it's been really sucky and it's really sucks yeah so um this is where we are now and it's very hard for me to tell because you know I have a lot of Li friends I just I like you know go along to get along because I can't have this argument with them because they will they literally like they're you can see them like C be like I can't talk about that now you know because I'll be criticizing the Democratic party or har be like I just can't hear that now and so I'm like they shave their heads yet not yet but you know BEC if they thought he was a fascist like why aren't they in the streets right now because like where are they at yeah January I'm so glad that the [ __ ] hats though are not around I [ __ ] hated that [ __ ] but um but yeah I'm I'm I can't I I try not to talk about it just with my lip friends because they're like having cognitive breakdowns but um I think that we I need and we need to you know talk to each other more and remain cool and objective and analytic and strengthen each other's positions and that's that's that's more and more what I'm seeing is my positions say Relentless critique of liberalism from for the left from the left that's awesome and I mean that's yeah that's all I ever really want to do and you know when you do it when you have the courage to do it and you you say what you want to say other people start doing the same or you get DMS from people being like thank you so much for saying that I'm so glad somebody finally said that and eventually they'll start talking about it too to people around them and it just it's it is we're
