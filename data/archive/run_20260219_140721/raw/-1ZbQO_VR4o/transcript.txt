welcome to the ghost of plum run hour only on midwestern marks i'm tim russo the author of the star wars series for leftist ghosts of plum run joining us today for part two of our discussion of the charge of the first minnesota which is what the ghost of plum run is about is uh history professor timothy orr from old dominion welcome back tim glad to be back also joining us as always is our cadre from the shop floor mast line jonathan shearson hey tim and tim in his lego yeah kobe bryant tonight celebrating kobe bryant and also that lebron james is still the best ever um that's right tim uh you're a 90s music guy you like oasis i also happen to know you like the dandy warhols i do i do you know not as strongly as uh as oasis but they're they're they're in my wheelhouse they're in the wheelhouse so uh are you you you are aware of what the song is gonna be that opens the film of the charge itself is that not correct correct uh the lead-off song for their album uh their first album right i think it's supposed to be okay but uh uh bn right the end yes so so for the heads out there ten years from now when we're on the oscar stage me and tim holding up statuettes uh bn is gonna be the the opening of the movie and if you can find this video for proof that that is gonna was always gonna be the opening of the movie you can also email courtney courtney uh taylor the lead singer of the andy warhols who given us permission so well great great uh so um so the reason i bring that up as the midwestern marks masterline music minute to start this this part is because we're trying to get into the minds of the men in those two hours where they're sitting there waiting uh for the inevitable and let's question let's start with that two hours is that how long they sat there yeah about um i mean they arrived at gettysburg on the in the center of the union line you know sometime like mid-morning maybe even earlier than that so they're actually there for hours but they they they get their orders to deploy uh next to this artillery battery you know probably around um i don't know five four p.m maybe uh so they're spending all day in reserve right on the eastern slope of cemetery ridge yeah so then they come up to the top of the ridge and that is just around the time that the attack against sickles core is starting so they have a beautiful panorama of that scene and it had to have been i don't know a spine tingling and also very frightening moment for everyone in the ranks because they were watching the battle slowly ebb towards them and i read enough accounts from civil war soldiers to know that the waiting for the danger to come at you was the most agonizing moment of a battle and they had them what i just described in the film screenplay is the most agonizing weight and and the question i always had is did they see sickles move to his position yeah they probably did uh probably not right when he his core redeployed at 2pm but once they came to the top of the ridge they would certainly have seen a raid out in front of them if you stand on that he was moving out well you know when you're on the east slope of cemetery bridge which is where they are in reserve it's a little bit lower in elevation so it's much harder to see so certainly they would have heard that the union left was redeployed but they weren't going to see it clearly until they got to the top of the ridge and all of a sudden the cannon was booming and to give you just a uh what i would see is proof of that is that even the army commander george mead didn't know that sickles had redeployed until hours afterwards when it was too late to recall him now there is evidence that hancock saw it happen right yep and so for our audience yeah winfield scott hancock is a west point trained major general of volunteers he commands the second core which is the core to which the first minnesota belongs and during the second day of the battle he is the acting left-wing commander so eventually sickles is wounded during the fight and mead the army commander deputizes hancock to command all the troops on the left side of the field and earlier in the day when sickles moves forward hancock is a little bit farther left and a little bit higher up on the ridge because he's adjacent to john curtis caldwell's division that's the division that goes to the wheat field and gets trounced when sickles calls for eight and so hancock had a better position than anyone else to watch that redeployment and hancock kind of his pants when he saw it happen didn't he yeah he has purported to have turned to an aide when he sees this and he says you will soon see those men come tumbling right back so he had the clairvoyance to know that this was a mistake and it wasn't going to end well and he was exactly right and maybe or maybe not did the first minnesota know that at the time yeah and if if we're trying to put this all sequentially i would say the first minnesota probably did not see that that moment happening because they were on the reverse slope of the ridge on the east side of it and you had to be on the crest of the west side of it to watch it but as soon as they came up to the crest almost certainly they could see it happening they could see the the movement of sickles troops positioning cell themselves out on the emmitsburg road so at that point they had to have known if they were smart enough as hancock was it was going to be a bad day so this gap opens up uh who orders the first minnesota to fill to the battery uh that was on the west side of the ridge to wade through right so that decision falls to the divisional commander john gibbon who's another west pointer and he will become acting core commander when hancock is elevated to acting wing commander and the reason for the redeployment is that again there's this area where there are no troops right the cur john curtis caldwell's division has been taken and sent to the left to reinforce sickles but then right on the crest of the ridge this kind of open spot there's a battery of six guns committed by a lieutenant named thomas and six guns kind of by themselves need to have infantry support so gibbons sends an order to one of his brigade commanders general harrow harrow selects the first minnesota to watch over the guns so the first minnesota is detached from its parent unit and that parent unit is eventually sent to the front to fight along sickles troops and then the first minnesota is kind of forgotten about just sitting beside these guns yeah men actually say it felt like we were forgotten yeah and that's exactly it because um you know if you were there on the top of the ridge you're looking to your left and your right and you can see the the other artillery battery but beyond that no other troops probably for another 800 yards or so right you could see the battle going on in front at the emmitsburg road a half mile away but then left and right there's nothing around so you're in this big gap they get to the battery and they and how do they deploy they're on the ground yeah most likely they were just kind of uh laying down or perhaps even sitting for those two hours that they're waiting you know you i imagine the colonel william colville would not have wanted his men to be standing all that time and usually there's a formation that infantry can take when they are laying down or they'll be sort of kind of packed like sardines one rank up front and then one rank behind them with the heads of those men kind of right up against the feet of the guys in front so they're probably watching from they're propping themselves on their arms just kind of trying to get in a snapshot of the battle and you know as the the sun goes down over the horizon perhaps many of them even think that they might not even be engaged at all because of course once it becomes dark it's impossible to exercise command and control so they may even be thinking well we may make it out of this without firing shot but they're generally deployed what's called line of battle which is men shoulder to shoulder so your closest buddies are touching elbows with you and then the second rank when it's standing is about a forearm's length behind you and company a is stationed to the right directly of the colors right right so there are eight there are eight companies deployed in line of battle the the first minnesota has 11 companies the company is normally about a thousand men but in 1863 the first minnesota was rocking only about 30 men per company so the other three are deployed elsewhere um and then the eight that are still on the line of battle four on one side of the the what's called the color guard which protects the battle flag four on the other so uh jonathan you're gonna like this part peter marks was a corporal in company a where would a corporal and company a be positioned in in that line with respect to the to the colors uh right in the front rank so corporals uh they're the um one of the lowest-ranking non-commissioned officers so one step above private but what corporals were used for in the civil war when you're in line of battle is to mark the break in the squads and the platoons so normally you'd have eight corporals uh and usually six were in the front rank two were in the rear rank but probably at this point in the war you only had maybe like five or six corporals per company and they would all have been in the front rank and the reason for that is so the company commander can look and say where do my squads break because i can see the corporal stripes on their arm and so that's why they are placed where they are this means that being a corporal is one of the most dangerous things you can do because you are automatically in the front rank no matter what which means you're going to get the first round of lead which is why peter marks is our 48er and the ghost of plum run uh so uh peter marks gets company a next the callers they they either sit down or lay down on the ground what is the corporal doing for those two hours well at that point he's probably has very little to do other than to simply reassure the man right if they're they're called on the battle line he doesn't have any major duties to do other than be an infantryman normally corporals have a lot of duties when the regiment is on the march they have to form what are called corporals guards which can do foraging expeditions or scouting expeditions but at this point he is really just in charge of his squad right so there is there's a sergeant who is over him per squad and then again normal circumstances two corporals per squad and a squad is is a fourth of a company and so he would probably have a few privates that he would be looking after reassuring them bucking them up you know getting them ready for the fight you know because i think at this point everyone kind of knew that they were going to be involved in something the question was how and under what circumstances all right so so let's get back to that realization so they're on the ridge they're at ba they're they're sitting next to the battery and and and what are they seeing in the wheat field in the beach orchard well they probably can't see much of the wheat field because it is separated by a grove of trees called the trosa woods but they can clearly see the peach orchard and that area has got to be enveloped in smoke right because sickles put the bulk of his artillery out there and it was shelling the attacking confederates that were coming from the seminary ridge area which was a mile away ahead of the first minnesota so all of that line would have been crackling with gunfire it would have been reverberating with the thunder of the cannon and then there would have been just giant clouds of thick white smoke covering the area so everyone knew that sickles troops were embattled they could probably see some of the reinforcements going out to the emmitsburg road there are several regiments taken from the second core and sent to the third including uh two from their own brigade so they would have just seen just a flurry of activity horsemen riding hither and yawn wounded men coming back from the front and again that's the the the awful moment where your your stomach just sinks right because you're you kind of see this happening you know that there's a lot of pain and misery out there and you're wondering whether it's gonna drift your way and so you think the light bulb went on we're gonna die when the third quarter broke and started running back correct so the the the weakest point of sickle's position is the center of it at a place called the peach orchard which is where the emmitsburg road which is this road that runs kind of midway between the two armies has an intersection with another road called the miller's town road and the confederates break through there around six six thirty and they just tear a huge wide hole in sickle's line and at that point it's all over the no amount of reinforcements is gonna save that structure and the lines just starts to peel back up the emmitsburg road and uh imagine anyone in the first minnesota would have seen that happen as the the union line off the emittsburg road is basically kind of rolled up and the men that were there come running back pell now to their rich which is where they are they are about you know anywhere between a half mile and a quarter mile away how many guys do you think ran through the first minnesota's line on the way out that that is not uh i'm not certain uh i don't think it's going to be all that many but sickles as i said he had about 10 000 men in his core and then half of it was up on gametesburg road so that would mean about five thousand men are coming rushing back and again some of those have fallen back steadily some of them have been wounded and simply been transported all out the field but when the final break occurs and they come like a tidal wave they are probably running on all sides like a giant mass of humanity hopefully hopefully none of them just tried to barge through the ranks because that would have been dangerous but they certainly would have seen these men coming back in clumps you know panicked frightened powder encrusted uh and that's a very demoralizing sight to see a fellow soldier just have the fight sucked out of him so jonathan any questions so far sure you you mentioned the smoke and the envelopment and everything and i've heard that there were reports of from the first minnesota soldiers of seeing you know giants in the sky fighting through the smoke uh how can you describe those reports how many do you have of that because it's interesting yeah uh i mean i can't speak to the the individual sources themselves but i guess what i would say is that there's probably two ways to look at this uh one from sort of an optical illusion point of view you know i've when this is all happening it's very late in the evening so it's between seven and eight pm right so i know from having worked at gettysburg national military park because that is when the shadows become very long right so there's a giant mountain range off to the west the rays of light become diffused and it's just uh just a golden aura is cast over the area and then if you have these giant clouds i guess it must be the projection of these long shadows on the clouds that would have the appearance of just you know giant uh shadow puppets right and the other thing about it is you know i sort of know from studying other wars that when weird things happen in combat people take notice of them right and this is a commonality of just how the human mind works under stress there's a battle in the pacific war in 1942 where uh there's a japanese sailor in and his ship is being bombed and a bomb goes off right close to the side of the ship and it sends up a huge 30-foot water spout this japanese sailor looked into the water spout he was fixed on it and he said he thought he saw his mother's face in it and his mother had been long dead and you know it's one of those weird things where people just see some sort of hard to describe object like you know there's more than one report of the giants in the sky okay okay more than one of these guys says at a certain point it looked like they were watching giants fighting and it sounds like it's this optical illusion thing that you're talking about where the sun is going down smoke it's coming through smoke and it was humid that day right oh yeah very much so yeah especially towards evening yeah so yeah so the giants in the sky thing you know when you're writing a film you can't miss that you know you want to have the giants in the sky picture uh so let's assume for the sake of of argument they did see the giants in the sky so uh they're watching the giants in the sky third core soldiers are coming through covered in blood carrying some carrying their own limbs now hancock and his aide who you know very well are at this moment attempting to fix this problem right that's right so hancock is the one who gets the first minnesota moving and so he has been trying to patch up this line this kind of imperiled section of the union line on cemetery ridge all afternoon and he has just dropped off a brigade of new york troops a little bit farther south at the exact point where they need to be and so hancock having completed that mission is riding north towards the first minnesota's position he's farther out in front of them with his guy yeah so he's got a you know generals usually have a staff of about 20 people with them and hancock has frittered all of his away during this he's got one guy left uh plus his guidon bearer uh and so he turns to this this captain and what is what is his name wdw miller captain miller he turns to w miller captain miller and says well uh so he there he's a little bit in front of the first minnesota's position he's coming up what's called the plum run valley a little dry creek bed and what he sees is the confederate troops that have broken through sickle's line this is cadmus wilcox's alabama brigade and hancock wrongly assumes these are union troops these are sickles men right and so he's hoping to rally them so he tells miller to go go stop these men and form them here along the creek bed and as miller gallops out towards them he finds out that they are in fact the confederates so the confederates volley into him miller is wounded twice and then hancock realizes he's gotta get out of there or else he's gonna be killed or captured as well so he starts heading east towards the crest of the ridge which is right where the first minnesota is and and so he rides a little bit where does he go before he gets to the first minnesota where he is beforehand yeah so he leaves the plum run creek miller's is wounded and he's riding where is he riding to and then how does he get to the first minnesota well i guess i'm not sure it was a read my mind question here like he's to mean thomas's battery first so where does he go where he's he's on his horse and cock's on his horse he rides doesn't he ride over the ridge to go find the reinforcements to come and fill the hole uh no i think the first thing he comes to is the first minnesota right so he leaves miller's wounding goes to the back right right right to the yeah and he's right to the register and he has a quote where he says my god are these all we have here correct all right so yeah that is the surprising thing to him because when he comes to the first minnesota this is the only regiment that he sees right and that is exactly what he says my god these all the troops we have right because he yeah he is expecting that there should be some sort of reinforcement coming to this area but there is not and as it turned out there would be none at that point all the reinforcements had been committed so it was up to this one regiment to do the impossible which was to stop a brigade that was coming through the hole so what does he say to colville well the first thing he does is he shouts who commands the reg he's looking for the colonel so colville is apparently dismounted at this point so he kind of comes forward through the line and colville says i do i command this as the first minnesota and hancock was a very uh brusque person he didn't really stand on ceremony a whole lot so according to just about every major account of this encounter hancock just gives him the order to go and he says colonel advance and take those colors so he points at wilcox's brigade and with that hancock rides off so there's very little to do and colville orders his men to their feet if they weren't on their feet already they level their bayonets and then they charge and who leads that charge is colville at the front or the back well my presumption is he's got to be you know on the front at least leading them out uh normally a colonel would be mounted but behind the men uh but i think coalville was was on foot in front uh that's by most accounts that's where he is so by the time that they actually make contact with the confederates i'm sure that colville and the other field officers went behind the line so the infantryman could do their thing but on the way out he's on foot in front with his sword in one of the most dangerous places you could be and when did wilcox wilcox's brigade notice that the first minnesota was coming at them probably almost when they were on top of them so wilcox's brigade had a very hard afternoon they had been fighting basically since noon they have a spirited fire fight a place called pitzer's woods where they suffer 50 casualties and then they attack sickles front and sickle's front is no easy nut to crack they they lose a lot of men there and then as soon as they come over the ridge and they're kind of moving towards the plum run valley they're attacked by two other regiments the 19th massachusetts and the 42nd new york and these regiments they put up a very uh thin defense before they pull out and then finally they see this third line coming at them coming off the ridge so wilcox's men to simply fire whatever ammunition they have left to try to stop them hold on so they step off now there are reports that men got hit before they even took the first step off the charge in the first minnesota is that do you think that's accurate yeah i mean they would have been hit by like stray fire right so as soon as they stood up they're they're they're in a line of fire oh yeah for sure because if you go to that position you'll see that cemetery ridge where the first minnesota is is roughly at the same height as the emmitsburg road ridge which is in front of them and then there's this very low valley called the plum run valley between them so any stray shots that were aimed at sickles men could easily fall in amongst the first minnesota well first you're saying the first minnesota benefited from the smoke of the battlefield they could have been running through the smoke of the battlefield and not seen by cadmus wilcox's brigade uh before they uh made contact yeah um i mean the first minnesota certainly took casualties approach uh there's a bunch of accounts that say as they're moving towards their target men are falling out of the ranks at every step but the thing about it most of wilcox's men have been just simply fighting constantly trying to get to cemetery rich and you know just to make it very clear wilcox's men are in very a very foul mood because they expected that as soon as they broke sickles front they thought their day was over right because that's where they thought the union line was and then to see that there was a real line farther away that was a half mile to the rear they're like we didn't sign on for this right so so the fact that they're they're continuing to face union reinforcements is of great annoyance to them they're wasting ammunition on it and so when the first minnesota comes taranap and that is the last thing that they want to see so they weren't even expecting there to be anybody there no no there's a great account from confederate artillery commander named porter alexander who wrote after the war about that exact moment when they confederates breached the peach orchard line and they're up on the emmitsburg road and they're looking down the plumron valley they can see another union line atop cemetery originally like what the hell man this is not what we expected we thought that rolling up the union left was going to be enough but now they have to fight a second position so it's the perfect situation for somebody to punch you in the face exactly so and exactly they got punched in the face and and and now there's there's a debate about whether or not the first minnesota halted or any part of the line halted in mid charge to fire do you know anything about that you know my my presumption is that the first minnesota reaches the creek bed right that's that's as far as they get because they several accounts point out that they had to fight their way through the the bushes and shrubs along the dry creek bed and that's when they they pause the fire so so i think that's that's where they they come to a stop and at that point they're like well all we have left is our weapons let's shoot and try to fire enough that we can do enough damage to wilcox's brigade so it it pulls back so i think that is where the bulk of the regiment's casualties occur you know some of them are are shot and getting to them to that point but once they stop and they're engaged in this face-to-face firefight with wilcox that's where the regimental casualties pile up and they pile up on the right-hand side of the regiment because they're being enveloped right yeah i imagine on both sides to be honest because it's probably yeah it might be i mean it's probably both right because you're you're talking about a brigade at least started the day with 1500 men that wilcox probably didn't have that many at that point but at least a thousand of them i'm guessing about a thousand maybe you're saying a thousand i'm saying 1200 maybe 1100 yeah here's the thing though you know civil war battles you know when when a guy is hit and you have a wounded man there is no combat medic to get him off the field the only way you can transport a wounded man to the rear is if four of his friends pick him up so for every wounded man four more are going to the rear so you're thinking plus seven i'm thinking only about a thousand at most at that point and but nevertheless a thousand men uh facing 270 that line well overlapping all right let's get to that now 262 is the number on the monument right okay and that that number uh comes from a single source william lockrin's account he's this this lieutenant who was very much important in reunion organ uh commemoration after the war and his account uh said that there were 262 men involved in the attack by my by my humble calculations i think it is 271 and this confirms with what colville himself said he said in a letter after the war 269 right so colville and i are quibbling over two to two men but i think 262 might be a little bit too small but again it's only it's only nine men so it's it's definitely lochran's in the ballpark he's just not he's not precise so i'm thinking 271 is my my my official count so so that number has been debated and will continue to be debated forever but yeah jonathan has a question about the monument we have about nine minutes left so we're going to get to the monument jonathan yeah um hold on a second i got a picture of it thanks to tim's book let me find a chapter beginning yeah yeah the monument that's there now is not the monument that they proposed that is the monument that was proposed is a soldier stabbing a serpent the monument that's there now is is is a soldier running at double quick correct yeah and and and jonathan go ahead um i feel strongly that the uh monument with the soldier bayonetting the serpent was the better choice than the double quick one um i think that because the double quick i mean it could be said of any battle in the civil war you know these there's innumerable charges of the union lines within the war effort and the soldiers you know is it what was the process of them coming up with this was there a vote on it or did like did the regiment decide hey this is the one we want to go with out of the options they had because it was an option they had to choose from right right right so you know monuments that kind of spring up in the post-civil war era they spring up in multiple ways you know sometimes they're funded by state government taxes like this happens in pennsylvania where every pennsylvania veterans group has additional money but a great many of these monuments are privately funded so this is the regimental veterans you know collecting their own cash they're harder in cash together to create a monument that they think best expresses their um what their regiment did but then once you have the design together you know you've contacted some sort of sculptor and you fashioned together what you want your monument to look like then you had to have it approved and there was a private organization that did that it was called the gettysburg battlefield memorial association and it was it was run by a vet a civil war veteran named john badger batshelton he was arguably the first professional historian of the battle and the thing about it was that batshelter had rules that every monument had to follow and that they had to have a certain kind of information on the monument and certain things that got represented and for whatever reason batchelder and his sort of executive group for the gbma didn't like the first minnesota's initial design yeah it has to be redesigned i mean i mean do we know who was on that committee who made that decision that's a good question uh for that particular uh regiment i do not know but um you know batchelder had several people and i imagine he himself was the most you know vocal about what monuments should look like and it is not the only monument design he vetoed by the way there's many other regiments that different ideas for what their their emblems should be but were any uh badass as as bain-heading a serpent uh i don't think i've ever seen anything that is quite so violent looking and uh this is probably the great um disturbing thing about it is we know that one of the most violent looking monuments on the field today is the mississippi monument that has a confederate soldier swinging his his uh they get to be the badasses every time yes and and the union guys oh we're just going to run a double quick you know we're just going to be right but of course the difference is that the mississippi monument is established in uh the 1960s right during the civil rights era right so it's a very different process uh there's only one other union unit that's comes close the 72nd pennsylvania has a guy swinging his his musket like a bayonet but again you don't see the person that's getting hit right so you know my my take on this whole monument kerfuffle is that it's kind of up to the viewer to decide what they think is the message you want to send and i think jonathan is right that the the exterminator position with the guy stabbing the snake that one that one best represents what the veterans wanted you to see right they wanted you to remember that they they defeated the snake of the rebellion right that is what they did but you know the other thing the the double quick guy what that forces you to think about is not the destruction of the confederacy but the sacrifice of the men that they went on this suicide mission and they died doing it right and that's that's just a judgment call right if you think that the story of the first minnesota is about defeating the confederacy and you should feel disappointed that the serpent stabbing one didn't happen but if you think the true story is the men who gave their lives to go on that charge that hancock ordered then you should be happy with the one that presently exists so uh the the the monument itself that that that was uh there were three drafts right there were three drafts of that monument one of which was that's there now one of which was the serpent getting stabbed and then there was a third one right yeah and i i believe that's the one that it marks their position on the third day right no there was a third proposal for the charge monument i guess i haven't seen that one then um so you'd be more the expert on than i was that's daryl sannis's department at the twin cities civil war round table who we hope to have on the show at some point shortly uh daryl this is for you we're talking about your pet issue because daryl sanders apparently looked for this all right good well then he can he can uh fill in the uh the parts that i was unable to fill in tonight that'll be good so we're we're down about three minutes left before zoom cuts us off uh any do you have any uh questions for us tim since we've been we've had you on the witness stand yeah i mean i i guess uh you know since i've known you tim that you have this uh incredible fascination for the first minnesota and i guess i would always love to know what is it that um about their story that inspired you well it's the why i didn't hear about it um you know when you started asking the question why didn't you hear about first minnesota growing up but you heard about the pickets charge that went across the same ground the next day you start to ask all the questions that and you went and you end up in this leftist uh universe where you you start it starts to make sense why you wouldn't hear about it why you would hear about the pickets charge the next day that went through their blood the blood of the first minnesota i mean they literally walked across the blood of the charge that saved the country the next day and that's the one we're talking about that's the one everybody knows about is pickett's charge do you ever run into people at the bat when you were working at the at the park did you ever run into people who were upset about this at all or oh about the the sort of pro-confederate slanted yeah and you know there's always the big difference between the people who work there and then kind of the story of the monuments tell right because when when i worked there we did our utmost to ensure that the the the theme the high water mark of the confederacy was not the main thing right so so our interpretive approach was always to emphasize the sacrifice made by the union army and then the result of the civil war in terms of emancipation so our our main theme was the new birth of freedom right but the the problem was that long before i got there long before many of my colleagues got there the united states went through this period of time when it was obsessed with the lost cause and that was the fault of historians of the early 20th century and there were a great many of them uh douglas southall freeman uh ulrich bonnell phillips um and um uh who's the william dunning with the reconstruction school ken we're we're going to end on because we're going to get cut off here but yeah yeah and even ken burns even ken burns who who brought in shelby foot of all people one of the strongest lost cause historians and yeah and and that's the thing was it just um historians didn't do enough in the 20th century to approach the civil war even-handedly and great many confederate units and confederate figures got lofted above uh figures in the united states army uh and it's a shame that that the first minnesota story has kind of receded into the shadows not anymore thanks to midwestern marx we appreciate you joining us tim this has been a blast we hope you join us again will you join us again sometime absolutely oh my pleasure all right well maybe we'll get you and daryl on the same call at some point sure thing whatever you want this has been
