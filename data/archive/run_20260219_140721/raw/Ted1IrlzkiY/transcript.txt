hello friends of midwestern marks welcome to chapter eight of our breakdown of vladimir lenin's imperialism the highest stage of capitalism uh today we're going to be covering the chapter the parasitism and decay of capitalism so this is a highly relevant chapter for people living in the west such as myself i live in america lenin's going to talk about the effect imperialism has on the home country um on the proletariat of the country that's doing the imperialism the effect that that has on the proletariat the effect that that has on the overall economy uh and he's going to say that manufacturing is going to be pushed into the colonies um and these countries are going to become rent here states uh where the the wealth of the capitalists in the imperialist country are funded by debt debt in the colonies as well as debt amongst the working class in the home country so extremely relevant for interp for understanding america's economy as we've been an empire for a long long time and the world's most dominant empire since the end of world war ii so lenin starts out by saying that late stage capitalists monopoly capitalists both stagnate and decay so this leads to a couple things and one of those things it leads to is the possibility of deliberately stopping progress um so the economic possibility of deliberately stopping progress so what does that mean um this is called what's called planned obsolescence so when a monopoly has an entire or has such domination of a market they will design their products to break so that people who buy their products will use it for a while it'll break and then they'll have to go buy another one because the monopolies have no competition nobody who can build a better product and challenge them they own that market so much they'll just design their other things to break um apple was caught doing this when people updated their iphones it was slowing them down and causing them to crash since then they've done a huge pr campaign to say it didn't happen but it did and then also you have the dongles you know when you plug into your iphone they don't have the headphone jack anymore it's just adding a little piece that makes the product more inconvenient to use right takes away use value makes it less useful to us but gives you another little piece of plastic that you're going to lose and have to go give 15 more bucks to apple because they have such a monopoly on that market and in china it's much different for apple there's uh is it huawei the chinese phone company have basically just copied apple's phone and and got rid of all the planned obsolescence and now people are buying huawei in china you also see this with dryers and appliances they're not made the same way they're used to they're made to break i don't know how often you guys have had to break or fix your laundry machine or your dryer but for me it's been a lot in the last time my parents had a repair person come over to fix the dryer he said yeah they just don't make dryers like this anymore the dryer was 40 years old that had broken down once or twice in 40 years and the guy's like yeah they just are made with cheap parts now so they can break and you have to go buy new parts this is what happens when you have monopolies with complete and total control of their market they can set whatever price they want and they can design their products to break because they know the buyer only has one person to go to if they want that product replaced which is the monopoly so lennon's going to talk about that and he gives the example of a bottle making machine which produced bottles better than the german bottle making companies which were very powerful and wealthy at the time so the german bottle com bottle companies bought the patent from owen um the person who invented it and then um they uh just never used the patent they bought the patent so nobody could build the and produce the improved uh bottle making machine and then they just never built the machine and kept making bottles and kept making a ton of money so once you have monopoly monopolies which dominate the market it actually stifles innovation um which is what the capitalist ideologues and the ruling class ideologues tell you is what's so great about capitalism the competition and the innovation but in late stage monopoly capitalism there's very little innovation other than innovation to see to get consumers to spend more to eat um to manufacture new wants in the consumers um so these techniques um although they're effective these techniques like planned obsolescence they still won't stop monopolies from decaying so lenin says that renters and bondholders those who give no labor but acquire incredible amounts of money capital must maintain their vast profits by exploiting all the labor of their own country and the labor abroad so he's going to talk about um hobson um here this kind of not communist economist who has a pretty scientific view of imperialism we talked about him in the last chapter he has some good books on economics and and the economics of british imperialism but he's not a communist so lenin's going to draw from him and then expand on what hobson says so hopson touches on how british capital abroad increased 2.5 times over 22 years in the late 1800s so he's saying britain is exporting their capital they're building all this infrastructure in their colonies but then lenin's going to say this doesn't take into account the profits of the individual shareholders of those companies right so lenin's gonna say in the uk um along with all that capital um hobson isn't accounting for 90 to 100 million pounds of income that's paid to executives and bondholders and investors with the british companies so this here highlights how truly disgusting american imperialism is right so we have these folks like jeff bezos with these vast amounts of wealth right incomprehensible amounts of wealth the average american worker would have to work 2.8 million years to have as much money as jeff bezos has right and in order to keep that wealth and in order to stop from decaying they need to keep expanding bezos needs to extract all the labor of the amazon workers in america and he needs to constantly expand abroad and that's not just to keep the company going right that's not just to keep amazon going that's in order to make payouts and profits to their stockholders so that means in america you have this tiny class of obscenely wealthy people who literally are taking not only from the labor of americans but the entire world which they are keeping and ruling with an iron fist in order to keep their own profits as high as possible to keep absurd amounts of personal wealth or what lenin calls money capital this whole system where you have folks like jeff bezos and elon musk works not only off the oppression of americans but of the brutal oppression and exploitation of the entire global south right it's not just to keep our businesses going it's to keep their profits at an insane level and like i said it shows how truly disgusting imperialism is um that these people are just living insane you know unimaginable lives for for a working-class person right just obscene amounts of wealth um and in order to maintain those obscene levels of wealth they have to exploit the entirety of the global south so i mean truly disgusting and it truly makes me even more inspired to overthrow these people so lenin argues um using contemporary financial statistics or contemporary financial statistics from his time now their past financial statistics that these countries are becoming user states so the imperialist countries are becoming countries who just loan debt and the interest paid back on the debt is also what helps keep the vast profits of these capitalists right as we said they need to keep their businesses expanding and they need to keep their own personal profits expanding so this is going to increase debt in the global south in the colonies we've seen this with the imf and the world bank and their infamous structural adjustment programs and their debt trapping techniques which keep countries in the global south constantly paying huge debts with inescapable interest rates to western banks and then you also have things like the student debt crisis right why has student debt you know not adjusted for inflation i'm just using you know it was like 700 bucks my grandpa told me for him to go to college and obviously 700 bucks was a lot more back then than it is now but still i'm leaving college with over a hundred thousand dollars in debt why the capitalists in this country need to keep their profits at this insane rate but there's not even enough money to do that anymore right no but you know i don't have any money to pay the capitalists so what do they do they say you have a hundred thousand dollars in debt and you're gonna pay interest on it so it keeps you know this whole section um of american college students constantly paying um essentially worthless money to to the the capitalist class so they can keep their profits at an insane level and this is why there's now more debt in circulation in the united states or maybe in the world than there is actual money i think maybe just in the u.s but yeah there's more debt than money how does that make sense it doesn't make sense capitalism doesn't make sense it's just something the capitalists have invented to make sure that their profits don't ever dip so lenin says the rent here state is a parasitic decaying capitalism which affects all socio-political conditions of the countries involved so just like i was talking about we have this parasitic decaying imperialist monopoly late-stage capitalism that preys on the global south and preys on people in this country in any way imaginable including through debt that's a perfect the student debt crisis and the structural adjustment loans put on countries in the global south perfect example of parasitism and how capitalism is decaying but they have to come up with these own these mechanisms in order to keep their profits as high as possible also you saw trillions of dollars dumped into the stock market during during the pandemic here also just to keep the keep the profits of those stockholders from ever dipping um so lenin says that there are two things that have weakened empires in the past right so as they become parasitic and they decay like the roman empire there's been stuff that's had forced them to decay in the past so the first one is economic parasitism um like we were talking about and two is the formation of armies in the subjugated areas so the this is what we've been talking about throughout this whole book these countries that get colonized have something to say about being colonized right and they one they want to get the us out of there as far as like just you know we want to be an independent nation you know we have a nationalist sentiment we want self-determination uh but then two we want economic self-determination right we want economic independence we want the western capitalists out of here and and when these independence movements start doing that is when you see the cia the us military the special forces nato start to intervene and start to try and over try and harm these independence movements but lenin's going to say that this is what causes empires to decay when the independence movements of the colonized nations get strong enough to overthrow the empire and are we getting close to seeing that in the world today maybe you know the u.s empire is not what it used to be so very interesting stuff to look at there and again of course very relevant stuff and then i just had written down a great example of you know colonized uh people fighting back against the u.s would be che and fidel in cuba right they they the u.s had foreign the military dictator ruling over cuba and the colonized people said we're done with this we're going to build our own economic system and we're going to have independence and then they fought a war and won and that's what they did usually the u.s has been successful in stamping out these independence movements um to some degree but you know more and more of them have been a lot of them have been successful and and they haven't gone away you know as long as there's capitalism there will always be socialism and as long as there's imperialism there's always there will always be independence movements so there we go so lenin says monopolist bribes also bring the corrupt forces in colonized countries allowing for imperialists to have colonized people fight amongst themselves so you know the us will go into the countries we're trying to overthrow they'll find the right wing forces and they'll back them and they'll arm them you have the contras in nicaragua they did this against i mean they've done this a million times the venezuelan opposition forces um right now um mutubo seseko in uh in the congo pinochet in chile and yeah i mean of course there's a million and of course the us in syria there weren't enough rebel forces to fight against assad who the u.s wanted to overthrow so they went and they got radical jihadist extremists from lebanon from the uae from all these other places from libya and they shipped them into syria and created the syrian rebels in order to destabilize the region so the empire will look um to the countries they're trying to colonize and they will fund the right-wing forces within there and you know and prey on the corruption of of countries and that they're trying to colonize so lenin quotes hobson who says that western parasitism in which a western financial aristocracy maintains upper classes with vast wealth obtained from asia and africa will outsource their own industry and their own people will be occupied with a different work so we've seen this in the us and the uk you know our manufacturing has been hollowed out in the u.s it was the rust belt we lost all these jobs as they were pushed to where um two colonies where we can have the have goods manufactured cheaply all the protectionist trade deals were destroyed so corporations can just have their products made wherever there's you know basically slave labor austerity no labor regulations and then just ship those products to the u.s sell them at a major profit so this causes manufacturing in the home company or home country the imperialist country to be pushed out and and the industrial proletariat becomes extremely weak which is bad for revolution and this happened in the uk too with thatcher hollowing out scotland's manufacturing industry and really the manufacturing industry of the entire uk sorry my partner carlos just called me right in the middle of filming my video i had to cut them off so of course the uk pushed all their manufacturing out um and that is another one of the things you'll always see with imperialism right the imperialist countries will always push their their manufacturing out so they can have commodities manufactured for cheap in the global south um and lenin's gonna argue that this also uh creates opportunism um among the proletariat of the home country right these people there's one there's a lot of service jobs that are made now because everybody still has to have a job you know people have to work to pay for food but you don't but you're pushing all your manufacturing and all your industrial proletariate out of the country so there are all these service jobs and of course there's a lot of tech jobs growing which with the increase in technology but the kind of jobs change and and it also creates an opportunity for opportunism among the proletariat so lenin's going to mention a social democrat who was saying we should use the milit who was expelled from lenin's party who was saying we should use the military to stop independence movements in asia and the middle east so we can keep them oppressed so that our country will be richer and then our workers will be richer right this is kind of what happened in the us in the 1900s and after the depression you had a labor aristocracy that was formed where it was pretty good to work in the u.s you know workers were making a lot more money than they are today um but that was all you know based off the exploitation of the global south you know the global south and not living good and in the us um uh people of color were left out of all the programs and stuff for workers and a lot of the unions didn't allow people of color so yeah um lower and poor productive workers kind of become separated from uh the upper stratums of the proletariat in under imperialist countries lenin's going to talk about this so you know you see that in the u.s right now there are all these productive workers who are sort of looked down upon you know the plumbers the carpenters the the people who make society run right who do the dirty work that nobody wants to do we consider that you know jobs for dumb people you're just not smart enough to work your way up the system if you have to do one of these essential jobs you know but it's like okay if you don't have any plumbers these people you work down on who you're going to call when your toilet breaks right you know so it's these are the most important jobs in society and they become jobs that are looked down on and everybody even in the proletariat wants to make it to that middle class right you just want to work a service job or maybe not a service job but a management position where you don't have to work so hard but you can be in the upper middle class of the proletariat and just kind of live your life you know and this is what lenin calls opportunism and this is this opportunism comes from imperialism right when you have this country where the proletariat is as long as you get one of these managerial positions you can live better than than the dirty productive jobs that are looked down upon in society which are also being outsourced all right so imperialism creates sort of a privileged set of workers lenin says a bourgeois proletariat and politically this leads to opportunism right you see in america there's a ton of social democrats right people who are just like let's continue exploiting the global south but let's do more for workers while we do it and lenin says this is poop um so ingalls says this produces politics of liberals and conservatives who argue while monopolies take everything in imperialist nations in imperialist nations this is what happens this is lenin quoting ingles so ingalls says the politics um in capitalist imperialist nations become liberals conservatives arguing over nothing while monopolies dominate what actually happens i mean angle said that in the 1800s have you ever heard a better description of the united states in your life i mean that's exactly what's happened in the primary imperialist nation we fight we argue our country is extremely polarized and they're legitimately fighting over nothing you know the democrats and the republicans are nothing ever changes they just scream and they yell and they yell and they yell and the monopolies continue to exploit the global south continue to exploit the american proletariat and we have people with um hundreds of billions of dollars in their own bank accounts and lenin's going to argue basically to stop imperialism the proletariat in the imperialist country it needs to reject imperialism i mean sorry reject opportunism and and stay true to scientific socialism and realize that the abolition of private property and the building of socialism in the imperialist nations is the only thing that's going to be able to stop imperialism um so yeah the the the key takeaways from this chapter i think is one don't look down on the industrial proletariat because they're going to be key to building socialism in the imperialist country these folks like jeff bezos in the american ruling class are living off the exploitation and the brutal oppression of the global south and the american proletariat just so they can have massive massive fortunes of their own and imperialism decays when independence movements and um economic independence movement socialist movements start popping up in the colonized nations and start challenging the power of the empire but also as people living in the american empire i want to remind you all we have a very very important position to keep fighting and looking to stop the imperial expansion of the the capitalist monopolies within our own country and we need to do this for our comrades and our friends in the global south and have solidarity with them in the fight against global imperialism and capitalist imperialism all right everyone i hope you like chapter eight i'll probably do chapter nine tomorrow so stay tuned for that and yeah thanks for sticking along hope you're reading the book or just put me on while you play fortnite or whatever either way it's all good alright peace you
