hello everyone welcome to midwestern marks our third podcast um talking about geopolitics talking about marx's theory i'm gonna talk a little bit about iran today um and we talk a lot about how as a western leftist we should interpret interpret existing socialist countries but we're going to touch on how do you interpret not socialist countries but countries who are defying the economic interest of the united states and going a different way than western capital how should a socialist interpret that um which iran will provide a pretty good example for that and we'll also touch on assad in syria so yeah how you doing today carlos i'm doing good i'm recovering from festivities that went on yesterday so yeah nice i'm i'm definitely going to be partaking in some festivities tonight i've been working for like four weeks straight and have had no weekends and now i got a saturday so if you guys see some some outrageous tick tocks being posted or or some over-the-top tweets about china and xi jinping uh you know it's me drunk all right so let's jump in here um big news story so obviously trump's going to be out of office soon um and there have been neo-cons and his administration pushing for aggression towards iran so you've seen the sanctions um sanctioning iran's economy in the middle of a pandemic obviously horrendous disgusting hurts the iranian people more than it does the iranian government and we've seen the assassination of solemani and the biggest escalation was pulling out of the iran deal so for those who don't know what the iran deal did was it made it so iran's nuclear weapons program is surveilled 24 7 by the international atomic energy agency and not once since entering the iran deal have the international atomic energy agency accused iran of proliferating nuclear weapons now the u.s pulls out of this deal that obama and biden got us into so the deal said that the us wouldn't put sanctions on iran that we would have to pay them back money that that we owed them from the 1979 revolution that i might talk about later um and and and as and iran had to have their nuclear program monitored so essentially gave the us everything we could want right it handicapped iran's military and then trump pulls out of it assassinates iran's second in command soleimani starts sanctioning in them and now pompeo is doing a press conference saying that iran is the state sponsor of al qaeda you know of course they've been pushing this rhetoric iran's the the main state sponsor of terrorism as the us is heavily funding saudi arabia um who was actually you know a state sponsor of terrorism in the middle east and israel so now as trump's almost out of office you have these neocons who have been pushing this hostile foreign policy with iran for the last four years trying to push trump to actually do a war to actually start an intervention um because they feel like biden will be softer on iran and and now's the time you know they have to have to do it now before trump's out of office so so pompeo did this press conference saying that al qaeda is literally hiding in in the center of iran which is not true al qaeda and iran have fundamentally different belief systems you know and solemnani was the main person on the ground leading the fight against jihadist extremists you know he was fighting the taliban he was fighting with isis he was fighting al-qaeda and that's the guy we killed and now we're accusing iran of uh um of sponsoring terrorism so i mean it's pure nonsense and pompeo and the status that you know in the u.s state department are just relying hope you know or they know that u.s citizen or the u.s public has no idea what's going on in the middle east so they can they don't even have to try they can just make up blatant lies about iran um and yeah and and we know the real reason is the vast majority of iran's economy in the hands of the state all their major industry um it's centrally planned so it's not socialist but it's not capitalist and it's not pro-western in any way um so yeah do you have anything to comment before i keep ranting yeah man it's interesting uh we're able to bank on um racist prejudice uh in the ideological sphere in order to excuse um things that that have an economic character to them um and it's not just with iran it's all over the place um the anti-china propaganda it's a lot easier to believe that she's a that she is a despot and and whatever else you want to put on him when you have this previous structure of prejudice and of orientalism and this previous perception of what people from that part of the world are like um and it's the same thing with with muslim states um you can put whatever characteristic you want on them and because they're from a certain part of the world and there's preconception people are inclined to believe it and the paradox is that of course when actual states do behave in those terroristic ways like saudi arabia when they're our allies we don't we don't um we don't treat them the same way so yeah exactly i mean it's so blatant if you know what's going on but at the same time you see western leftists falling for it because iran is a theocracy right they're uh um they're a middle easter either based on uh islamic principles and they say that capitalism is against the teachings of islam so then you have western leftists because or these liberals who because iran's a theocracy who are are doing regime change propaganda and imperialist propaganda saying yes iran is is this horrible country and of course there are critiques of the theocracy um if there's a party i support in iran it's the today party which today i don't know how it's pronounced but they're like a pro-soviet communist secular party yes i wish they were the ones who took power but after the us over through mosidek you know the secular leader in 1953 iranians got a lot more anti-us and you had a lot more people who were saying no let's let's create a theocracy you know a lot more um uh clergy and religious people who are coming to positions of power and and this is because the us has been so involved in iran like um after mosaddeq was the pro-western shah um you know it's like a monarchy before they had this islamic revolution and of course yes i wish it would have been a socialist revolution but i support iranian self-determination and then if you look at what's happening now um the right wing or the the more theocratic more nationalistic iranians are becoming more powerful because of the actions of the us so if you look at it from an iranian perspective you enter into this peace deal with the u.s saying they're not going to mess with you and then two years later the u.s gets a new president who pulls out kills your general and sanctions your people as there's a global pandemic so from an iranian perspective it's screw the u.s let's kick the international atomic energy agency out and let's make nukes to defend ourselves before they kill more of our people or before they do you know launch an invasion like they did in iraq um not to say iran's the same as iraq they're not you know the war would be the us would take a lot more damage from war with iran their military is much more um built up and sophisticated their whole economy is but um but yeah i mean you see the the the more i mean it's this trend we always see the as the us does imperialism against countries they're forced to become more authoritarian to defend themselves i mean it's essentially what you've seen in every single country in the world who has ever tried to go away from um western economic interests yeah and that's one of the things that in principle we would want people to oppose this based on um their a principled view of a nation's right to self-determination right but even if that's not why people are opposing it even if they want to take a more selfish stab at in the u.s which is sort of the pseudo anti-imperialist approach that like someone like tulsi was promoting just think about how in what position we put ourselves in like you said when we participate in these activities because they only make the iranian people um hate our government more and and do um perhaps consider actually building a nuclear weapon right so it only puts us in danger it only escalates uh reasons to send our brothers and sisters out to war in the middle east for no goddamn reason besides the economic benefit of those from our ruling class so if you want to think about it just from a purely selfish point of view if you don't care at all about iran and and and just want to be selfish about it just consider the fact that our brothers and sisters are going to be sent out to die for no reason whatsoever besides the expansion of the pockets of of a few and in our rooting class so um yeah there's no way there's no way to work around it where you can excuse the actions that are taking place um in iran where you can excuse a criminal blockade blockade does nothing to destabilize a government but it does everything to destabilize and harm the people it's it's i consider it economic terrorism and um it's just horrendous it's it's weak and yeah if and and it's and it's done to socialist countries all the time and not that i ran a socialist uh but like you said a lot of their industry is nationalized um a lot of their industry what that means is that their their resources are not at the disposal of private capital from the west um so this this is a threat to a system that's based on on expansion um but yeah i think you hit most of it most of it right in the head of the nail thanks yeah i just wanted to add too as you're saying like from the selfish point of view you know as we try and mobilize against this and and talk people out of it when you're talking to americans you know the left is really anti-troop and anti-military because of the atrocious things our military does but the the the troops themselves are victims these are 18 year old kids leaving high school with no future or who want to pay for college who go into the military because it's stable income and they'll take almost anyone and we don't take care of these people when they come back with ptsd so when you're talking to americans you know be like are we really going to start another war i mean that's what trump did trump was a republican uh who surrounded himself with neocons and military-industrial con put like six different weapons manufacturers in charge of the state department and guys like pompeo and bolton and elliot abrams were close to him but on the campaign trail he was saying i'm going to end the wars because people's kids are over there people's family are over there and when you're talking to americans you have to realize like a lot of these people are still brainwashed into thinking that you know the middle east is bad but you can get them on your side by taking the angle of these are american lives that were being sacrificed for nothing what did you gain from iraq you know what did you gain from the war or the intervention in libya is your life any different other than the fact that a lot more people have ptsd now um see i think that's a good a point of strategy there to to bring that up when you're talking to americans who maybe maybe don't have a full perspective of what's going on around the globe and that doesn't mean like abandoning that that other principled view that um that takes the empathetic perspective of the iranians right um it just means that tactically uh it's it's more probable that someone's gonna hear your argument out if you go at it through what their direct interest is and then from there you can expand and build on them to to the point where they actually care about what's going on in iran not just because we're sending soldiers over there but because it's not humane to do what we're doing over there that in the middle of a pandemic we're putting blockades that are preventing uh the country from getting the the things that it needs in order to protect its people great point yeah you're not abandoning your principles it's you know just being tactical it's like you have to think about what the direct interest of the person you're talking to is you know and and pitch that to them you know if it because the because the goal is the same regardless of how you're pitching the argument it's to avoid war with iran so that also helps the principle of you know not hurting iranians and yeah there's a lot of confusion i think like about strategy like you're seeing paleoleftism become a thing where it's like we'll be racist we'll have super right-wing social views and then left-wing economic views like that's not what the working class wants you know it's like that's just like teenagers looking at um the left's inability to organize workers and trump's ability to organize them and going oh i guess we just got to be racist no you just have to understand what they want you know and and what they want is to not see their kids set into meaningless conflicts or or to not see you know the people around them have have ptsd and people recognize these problems at this point there's 20 plus veteran suicides a day um so yeah there's ways to reach american workers where you're not abandoning your principles and it doesn't involve being racist um is i guess my point there yeah and the thing is that if as socialists we realize that the interest of our working class is itself an internationalist interest at the end of the day we can approach it both from the international lens which is probably not going to be that successful or we could approach it from their direct individualist lens which then again is able to um to expand into a proper international uh humanitarian uh vision and not humanitarian of course liberal bourgeois sense but um yeah not just tactically theoretically we do realize that the interest of the working class is internationalist um so but why then when we tactically approach people why don't we take this into consideration and see what angle someone is more likely to accept um and then from there expand yeah one of the funny things we found during the bernie campaign which like you know i i hold up the bernie sign but i've been super clear bernie's social democratic he doesn't like hold our principles but when we were pitching socialism to people it was easier to pitch straight up socialism than it was social democracy because social democracy you're arguing from the point of empathy right like don't you want to give people health care don't you want to give people education but if you just tell like a working class person like don't you hate your boss don't you wish the company was yours like that makes a lot more sense to a lot of them you know um so yeah just arguing to people's to people's individual interests i think is a good strategy but that's probably enough on iran i guess uh we've been talking about iran a lot lately trying to keep people um up to date on what's going on uh my journal article for for our print journal is going to have a big long section on iran um if you want to learn more especially on the 1953 coup in the 1979 revolution that will be released at the end of february um so yeah carlos you want to transition um as we always do or as we've been doing on these podcasts i'm going to talk about a geopolitical issue oftentimes contemporary and then carlos will talk about something philosophical or theoretical so what do you got for us today yeah today i have something that's perhaps one of the from the hardest books to read made in history it's from hegel's phenomenology of spirit um but i think that the pastors that i'm going to read and analyze is it holds quite a bit of pertinence and it helps us interpret um the geopolitical situation so it's it's it's going to bear some form of relation to the topic of iran into the topic of the versioning of social estates or what last century was called um actually existing socialism so um yeah so hegel is here talking about spirit but i will see that if we interpret it in a materialist sense which is what uh lennon when he reads hegel when we when we see lennon's readings of hegel in his philosophical notebooks he's constantly marking read this in a materialist sense a materialist sense meaning from a poor proletarian epistemic um so he says spirit is indeed never at rest but always engaged in moving forward but just as the first breath drawn by a child after its long quite nourishment breaks the gradualness of merely quantitative growth there is a qualitative leap and the child is born so likewise the spirit and its formation matures slowly and quietly into its new shape dissolving bit by bit the structures of its previous world whose tottering state is only hinted at by isolated symptoms the frivility and boredom which unsettled the established order the vague forbidding of something unknown there are the heralds of approaching change the gradual crumbling that left unaltered the face of the hole is cut short by a sunburst witch and one flash illuminates the features of the new world but this new world is no more complete actuality than is a newborn child it is essential to bear this in mind it comes on the scene for the first time in its immediacy or its notion just as little as a building is finished when its foundations has been laid so little has achieved the notion the notion on the whole on on the whole the hole itself when we wish to see an oak tree with its massive trunk and spreading branches and foliage we are not content to be shown an acorn instead um so there's a lot of the vagueness of of hegel and quite a bit of poeticness and and and romanticized prose here but i think there's two really important points the first one um and and and the points here are related to the basic law of quantity to quality the basic dialectical law of quantity it's equality the first thing is that when something is born it's not born it doesn't come out of a void it's born with uh what marx calls in his critique of the gotha program with the birthmarks of the previous society so hegel is talking about spirit and the development of spirit towards self-consciousness we're talking about socialism socialism uh when it arises it doesn't uh arise in a void it doesn't just come about from nowhere it always comes about from a previous society and that means that in its development it's still going to have lingering elements from their previous society and it's going to take a quantitative accumulation for it to develop into its own thing and to rid itself finally of all the elements that were holding it back to that previous society we have a socialism that what has existed in the last hundred and and twenty years is quite young that's what people don't understand capitalism took around 300 and some years in order for it to be analyzed systematically why is that well because it needed a quantitative process of accumulation it needed to develop industry and develop all of these things in order for the class relationships that are central to the system to be seen in its utmost clarity and it's the same thing with socialism socialism not only has has been still in its youthful developments but part of being in its youthful development has been to develop still within the womb of capitalism we still have a global capitalism that rules um economically and that rules ideologically it's it's hegemony is spread across the whole world and thus we have to keep this in mind when we think about social states and not be idealist and criticize social estates in comparison to the ideal that we hold but realize that it is like a child that has just been born and that it is developing and we can't criticize a child as if it was a man he imagined philosophers going up to a child and being like this thing here does not talk or reason therefore humans do not talk or reasons and humans are stupid and they're the same as every other animal that's absurd we don't do that we realize that the child needs to grow up in order to develop its essential characteristics and in order for us to say something about the man it we need to wait for him to become a man or a woman whatever we can't talk about the man while it's still a child we can talk about the criticisms of socialism socialism cross-socialism in reference to a socialism that is a child still in its earliest stages of development we can talk about specific mistakes that were done by by so-and-so socialist states and how we can improve on them but we can never talk about criticisms of socialism socialism in our early stage of socialism it's gonna take time for socialism to develop and then for us to be able to see once it polarizes and develops into its mature form what are the contradictions in it that would force another society to come about um there's a lot of idealism in the left today uh and and we see this in in the fact that people look at social estates and say oh they haven't abolished a commodity form or they still have this they have that and and they fail to understand the material conditions that are in play globally which is something that you do very well eddie establish what are the material dynamics in geopolitics and they fail to consider the natural dynamics in the internal process of development of socialism and that it takes time in order for things to be understood as how they are in essence yeah we said a lot of a lot of great stuff there and um i think this is this is one of the books we recommend to everyone socialism utopian and scientific because um you have to realize like we said they're like we were talking about before we got on the podcast mark's you know socialism existed before marx and angles or we've talked about this a lot but they put a scientific basis to it and like like you the quote you always use is the new system's gonna emerge with the birthmarks of the of the past system and there's this desire to look at socialism in a vacuum right to be like theoretically this is how i want it to work but you're not you know that's not realistic um and if you look at what happened at the with the socialist experiments at the end of the last century the soviet union fell and china stuck around um and cuba stuck around and the dprk stuck around and now all these these countries you know have these kind of private markets where they're where their people can partake in consumerism while the major banks and the industry and the agriculture are controlled by the state and controlled by a communist party and and that's what's been able to survive in a global capitalism where one the us is trying to kill you with sanctions and maybe military force but two there's a propaganda war you know fighting for the we don't realize the us is also waging propaganda wars in these other countries right telling their people capitalism so much better you we you need the consumerism don't you want nike sneakers your government won't let you have nike sneakers and um the soviet people fell into that you have that famous uh commercial of gorbachev with pizza hut you know they're like oh don't you want pizza hut bam the soviet union falls and you have 20 unemployment you know hunger shoots through the roof all these horrible things happen and now 75 percent of people wish they could go back to the soviet economic system and putin's nationalizing all these major industries so as socialists you know i get annoyed a little bit with like the really really hardcore maoists who are like this is how it needs to be you know you need to do what mao did like xi jinping and his book talks a ton about mao you know he's trying to bring him out of the 21st century because you have to realize the global context is changing um and i don't know yeah i was reading recently the libertarian manifesto because i'm preparing for a debate with this libertarian kid and their whole thing is like marxism's dead marxism has failed and it's like well the second most powerful country in the world is marxist so how are you going to say that and they just signed the largest trade deal in the history of the world and it doesn't involve the us so economic power is shifting to the east and all these countries who who you know still use marxist doctrine but are updating it for the 21st century um but if you're a socialist and and you're arguing with with that idea that marxism is dead and you think china is just a piece of crap how are you going to argue that marxism isn't dead you know you're going to be arguing you're going to sound utopian you're like oh none of the other none of the other countries have done it right you know we need to go back to what marx wrote in 1860 like no marx wouldn't want us to do that he would want us to adapt you know his method for nowadays and you can think what you want of china's private market right you can critique it for sure and and the consumerism that comes with that and and the the you know private capital is of course going to look to expand and the the private businesses within china are going to look to take you know power over the ccp and it's good to keep an eye on that but that but to just dismiss them you know as as um because they have those birth marks of the past system of the capitalist system and those things are ingrained into the heads of their people um partly due to u.s propaganda um i don't know just to write that off just seems ridiculous and arrogant to me especially from western leftists who live in the heart of the most imperialist capitalist rotten country in the world yeah in the in the 20th century um we had the the publication in in the 19 i think was 1932 of a text that marx does called the the economic and philosophical manuscripts of 1844 it's a series of three manuscripts that get published and it's marks before he discovers what is called historical materialism in 46 with the german ideology um and what happened was that like you said these idealist socialist elements from the west um used that early doctrine of mars to claim that that was the real marx that marxist humanist was the real marx and then they sort of juxtaposed that to the marxism of the soviet union and they criticized it for being economistic and and they said a bunch of things um and i think that the paradox is that as you said the soviet union and the peop the the people in that uh that belonged to the soviet union i think the polls are like at 70-something percent of people um either look favorably upon the soviet union or wish to return to those conditions if we think about east germany i think it's even higher so when you ask him there's a good uh channel i recommend you all to see i think it's called revolution report he has this one video where he's going around russia and asking older folks what they thought of the soviet union what was the thing that they liked the most and in this video all of the old people have the same answer and the answer is that there wasn't this element of of of competition that was sort of anti-human that everyone had this one spirit of collective everyone was really nice um everyone knew how to work together uh and and the society had this bond and this connectivity of everyone as human beings that wasn't experienced before and that it's definitely absent in prussian russia and definitely after right after in the 90s after the fall of the soviet union and these folks who use the early marks to criticize russia um don't see this element of progress in it they compare it like like we've been talking about to an ideal but they don't see the element of progress and one of the forms of alienation that marx talks about famously he talks about four religion but specifically he talks about alienation in the process of production in the product alienations from our species being an alienation from our fellow man and what is the the the responses that these people are saying if not the overcoming of alienation from our fellow men the ability to think of the community as collective to not have hatred to help each other um the soviet union was able to overcome that and a lot of the social states most of them were able to overcome that um that form of alienation that cutthroat mentality of looking at other people as stepping stones to climb up this one ladder to to be part of the ruling class um so it's ironic that these people who use the the early marks the younger marks um to to critique socialist states don't see this phenomenon of even with the standards of the early marks the progress that was made spiritually in these communities were tremendous i mean you read the um the the manuscripts and uh from from the soviet union and a lot of what they're emphasizing is the connection of creative mental powers and and physical powers so basically the undoing of the contradiction of the separation of mental and physical labor and that's central to the early marks and that's central also to the latter mark so in the highest stage of communism and the gotham program is talking about the the abolition of this contradiction itself so um yeah i i think still one of the biggest things we have to overcome philosophically or epistemologically and in the way that we see the world is this idealistic outlook that says that if it's not how my ideas say it is it is not real it is not good um we have to be more nuanced and realize that it's it's all process um it's all it it's all becoming um we're not gonna get socialism to be socialism called socialism how it exists in our head from one day to another it's gonna take time so yeah that's the thing is you know we're not done we're not saying look what china did aren't they perfect and china's not saying that either they keep setting these goals for themselves you know end poverty by 2025 i believe it was they hit that goal five years earlier than they were expecting to now it's build a prosperous socialist society by 2050. and then it's funny you know one of the critiques of existing socialism um that i've heard people make is that they didn't change the mode of production enough right it was too close to the siege socialism we talk about where it's similar to it's basically state capitalism you know they do these things for the workers but they're so focused on defending from private capital that they can't do everything they want and and really change the society but then you're saying in some ways they did though you know there was they did create a more collective mindset um because you took away you know the latter that we have in like you know the american dream where you're just trying to climb this corporate ladder to the top and it created a more collective mindset and you know of course this makes me think of venezuela because everything makes me think of venezuela but you know you want you hear that venezuela's in tatters and people are dying and you know people are dying and it's they're no not they're not just dropping dead left and right but they are suffering from the 155 us economic sanctions but maduro wins re-election every year the the guado and the opposition party won the national assembly election i think in 2015 but then you know they did nothing to help because all they are is just pro-western they have no actual ideas for how to develop venezuela and they got voted out and the u.s has been so unsuccessful in overthrowing uh the venezuelan government and that's because the people are loyal to the bolivarian revolution and you have i don't even know what it was it's more than 500 communes in venezuela because they're building this collective spirit and on and and they've turned it against imperialism right they uh they have their critiques of maduro in so fact you know when he goes towards neoliberalism when he abandons what they call the bolivarian revolution this combination of marxism with the independence and sort of nationalism of simone bolivar that uh hugo chavez synthesized um and now and then handed it off to maduro um they do have this collective spirit much unlike anything we've seen in the us um which is why it's funny when people tell me why don't you go move to venezuela i'm like i kind of want to some days you know i would like to go be a part of that bolivarian revolution you know and be you know we have this collective spirit and and of course we're not done right we want it to go more in that direction we want to be to be more collective and erase these crappy you know things this this competition in life where it's like i need to put you down in order for me to succeed we want mutual cooperation um and and we haven't achieved that to the level that marx talks about right the early marks where you know you always have that quote you can fish one day bake another you know it's kind of goofy but if you think about way in the future i mean that is the goal you know to to liberate people and allow humans to flourish as much as possible but we're in the early stages you know we're just um socialism it doesn't seem you know it seems like a long time since marx wrote capital but it hasn't been that long you know it was in the late 1800s mid to late 1800s where he was writing all his stuff um and and socialism is still still in its in its early phases compared to what we're going to see in the future um so yeah yeah and the people that talk about how there was no change in in the way things were produced because basically the bureaucratic class took the positions of managers and capitalists i mean i just find it so absurd because even if you if you look at the agricultural sector the sector that makes all of the food for society most of those sectors were not nationalized those sectors were cooperatized there was direct democracy going on in those sectors um and it there was not just one form of property it was in a plethora of different forms of collectively related properties going on it wasn't just nationalized property but even like the amount of power that the workers had in that nationalized property is unlike anything we've been close to seeing in the u.s just because of the amount of worker councils and unions and and and all sorts of stuff and just the fact that who who were the party people weren't just like bureaucrats most of them were were workers as well and part of the society so um yeah we have to rid ourselves of this idealistic um element uh in order to properly engage in an anti-imperialist discourse and i think that this idealism is is mostly prevalent in in our societies of comfort which paradoxically are the same societies that although they expect profession perfection from other existing social estates they are very happy to make concessions and be very strategic when it comes to the us and to support social democratic candidates who don't even do the slightest thing to pass uh the most basic things that a country could have so um there's a little bit of hypocrisy there too that has to be called out but yeah yeah it reminds me of a quote that that marx has of uh a four buck he says that um therefore buck when he's a good historian he's a bad materialist and he's a good materialist he's a bad historian um and and our our life seems to have a similar dynamic that when it comes to foreign policy they're idealists but when it comes to the national policy they try to be the most materialist and that's an interesting way to think about it that's really true it's like who cares if we're always in a hundred wars let's get free healthcare but then uh you look at china and it's like oh no they're all bad because uh winnie the pooh is banned which isn't even true by the way i looked into that winnie the pooh isn't banned in china that's western a western lie but yeah yeah that was really good support the chinese communist party as they actively put in their ballot to vote for joe biden and imperialism and support the democratic party sorry yeah for sure all right do you have anything else you want to hit on before we wrap it up here um i do not all right yeah check out our website um keep watching our youtube we're gonna try and get these on spotify and apple music at some point um definitely check out our website uh what was the last thing we released i don't even know um we released the la the last article we released was uh a piece that analyzed alienation in in censorship so it analyzed speech as a productive act and then censorship of speech as a form of alienation it's actually a quite interesting philosophical article but um yeah we have a print journal coming up that should be out either late february or early march um it's going to be a massive uh piece of work with a bunch of articles great artwork uh and we're gonna try to sell it nearly as cheap as possible but um it is going to be quality work so
