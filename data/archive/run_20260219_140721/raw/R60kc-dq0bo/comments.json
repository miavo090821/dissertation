And I work at a movie theater, and can confirm that the black ppl started showing up in large attendance until week 2.  Moreover, you are what we refer to as \"exceptions\". We know there are \"exceptions to every rule\". Just because you're like 1 out of 5 white ppl who saw Sinners multiple times, and enjoyed it doesn't discount the other white ones who got online to trash the film because they were butthurt about how the white folks were the villains. Or how they're trying to insinuate that the writers of Sinners plagiarized Dusk Until Dawn just because it shares some similarities. Like, check out the negative reviews on IMBD with the most upvotes trying to discredit, and mass downvotes any review that gave Sinners a stellar review/rating. \n\nAnd let me be clear, I'm not saying every single negative review were all from white folks, but they tend to have a bias towards a black-led films/shows, esp., when their white counterparts are the villains. Like, I saw numerous fragile ahh white folks complaining yt, reddit,  tiktok and so forth about how they're sick and tired of being vilified, and suggesting they should've left race out of it while disregarding the fact that the film is set in Jim Crow Era 😂",

No one in its debut phase HAS an opinion because no one has SEEN it yet. So over 50% of ANY film's profits are from CURIOSITY. Have you never paid for something out of CURIOSITY and then had buyer's REMORSE? It's a thing. With that being said, the film doesn't look bad but the general concept that high profit=good film is RIDICULOUS. The ONLY reason people mention its gross sales is because it's a black film and ppl dont think black films can sell. No one is saying that the profit means it's good. In fact, people are saying there wasn't enough profit. Please keep up.",

It's the black ownership that made the Penske Media (owners of Deadline, Variety, Rolling Stone) take notice, even setting rumors of the studio heads being fired for making the deal with Coogler as cause.  \n\nThe double standards are not lost on me, but I've lived long enough to see them.",

        "text": "@JCfromouterspace​​⁠why because people were holed up hiding from vampires? \n\nVampires dying in sunlight is a typical vampire trope. That’s not what makes the film original. All vampire movies would be the same if it simply came down to lore. Aside from some of the typical vampire lore there were aspects of Sinner’s vampires that were specific to the movie. \n\nI don’t see the dusk til dawn comparison aside from two brothers in a bar. The tone of dusk til dawn is very different. It’s like a horror comedy and it definitely doesn’t explore any complex themes. It’s an action movie turned gore fest and it doesn’t even take itself seriously. 30 days of night is only similar in the sense people are surviving vampires but for 30 days. Is 30 days of night a combination of storm of the century and salems lot? Marlow and Barlow, perhaps. \n\nThematically, tonally, cinematically all three are very different movies. 30 days of night and dusk til dawn are not similar either except they are vampire movies. Is it also like night of living dead? If you only watch the film on a superficial level as just another vampire movie you are missing out on all the underlying themes. \n\nI don’t feel like getting into all the of themes and how layered the film is because I know you don’t actually care. But based on overall consensus people do not agree with you. The people who are saying this are either looking for attention or not using their brains. Perhaps both.",

I tried a diverse hire, but it didn’t work out!”  And now they are “justified” in not hiring diversity. \n\nYou’d think this would be too much work and who has this much bad will in their hearts, but it serves the greater purpose of them “proving their point” so they never have to go through that again.

        "text": "it's not just bad writing i fear. i saw a video that focused on the topic of SW styling department (hair, costume etc) and at one point they compared the earlier remakes (Cinderella, Aurora) vs the recent ones. From that it was obvious that the first few remakes was \"Inspired\" while the recent were half-assed copy paste. Live action!Cinderella had her hair down and her dress looked a bit like (cartoon) Belle's, Live action!Aurora heavily focused on Maleficent and style wise she didn't look like cartoon!Aurora at all. Meanwhile Live Action!Ariel and Snow White were more like were basically the exact copies, Snow white especially with her dress colour palette, hers looked like something out of Party City and bob hairdo that didn't compliment her facial structure. So yeah at best they give crumbs to non yt princesses, at worst they purposely setting them up to fail just to make a \"see diversity's bad\" point",

LA!Mulan...all 4 white writers aside, the (also white) costume designer's research was basically a trip to some european museums that had chinese department and couple of weeks in china...it's vile that disney consciously made the decision to cast BW and WOC when the actresses took the brunt of the \"yt erasure\" hate, only to half assed everything. I'm glad they're rethinking LA!Tangled esp with the buzz about potentially casting a South Asian actress, no more taking advantage of WOC who's either a big fan of disney princess growing up or just very excited of getting a blockbuster to boost her career.",

At least when I googled \"Kevin Bacon Vampire Movie\", that was what came up, along with the movie synopsis stating: \"[...] Peter Taylor (Kevin Bacon), his wife Bronny and their two children return to Los Angeles after a fun-filled vacation to the Grand Canyon. Strange events soon start to plague the family, including young son Michael's increasingly erratic behavior. The Taylors learn that Michael brought back some mysterious rocks that he discovered inside a cave. Unfortunately, something followed them home as the clan now find themselves in a battle with a supernatural force that preys on their worst fears.[...]\" So the \"supernatural force\" mentioned COULD be vampires or vampiric-adjacent creatures... or not. However the film has a 4.5/10 rating, so I can't say I'm tempted to sit through the movie to check. \n\nBeyond that, to reiterate: Kevin Bacon was not in The Lost Boys (besides Kiefer - who is the only actor that bore a slight resemblance to Kevin Bacon in 1987, the movie also stars \"The Two Coreys\" - the late Corey Haim and Corey Feldman, Jason Patric, and Billy Wirth, as far as famous young white men from that era goes), nor was Kevin ever in any other vampire movie before \"The Darkness\".",

        "text": "@LisaBrown-s8cdegeneracy? I believe that was one of the underlying themes. We are all sinners. Duality. \n\nI thought the movie was great. It was complex and layered. Thought provoking and many aspects that could be discussed.\n\nI will say I had to look up if Mary had any black ancestry because if she did not I could see how it could be offensive. \n\nThe actress is 1/8th black and played a 1/8th black character. So they weren’t putting a white woman in our faces trying to convince us she was a black woman. She was obviously white passing based on the one drop rule she would be considered black during that time. Any whites who were aware of her have the slightest bit of black ancestry would treat her just like they did other black women. It seems the actress was meant to have grown up in the black community and that’s where she feels at home but she doesn’t fit in there either. So she doesn’t feel like she belongs in either community and that was part of her struggle with identity and belonging. She seems to feel more at home in the black community but her appearance and presence makes it unsafe for others. She couldn’t be with the man she loved because it could put them in danger. If she had been caught in the juke it would have endangered everyone. She was a very flawed character. She didn’t seem to care too much about the safety of the man she “loved” or her friends because she went right to the door of the juke which could endanger everyone. \n\nShe was the “tragic mulatto” which is a trope seen in other movies like “Imitation of life” or “Pinky” but I believe both those actresses had zero black ancestry. Her current lived experience wouldn’t be that of a black woman because she assimilated ans married a white man. But if she grew up in the black community then she would share some of the experiences of other black girls she grew up with but probably be somewhat protected by her proximity to whiteness. \n\nSome people try to deny mixed race people as black like Tracee Ellis Ross, Zendaya, Thandie Newton, etc. because they aren’t black enough. Colorism obviously exists as well which adds another layer to the conversation. But it doesn’t seem fair to mixed race women to be erased because their lived experience is that of a black woman. Similar to any other lighter skinned black woman. Erasing them doesn’t allow them to have a place in either community. Hailee is white passing so she can assimilate into the white community like she did in reali life and the movie but the same can’t be said for the women I mentioned above. Same goes for men but I was specifically speaking about women. Barack Obama was the first black president because that’s how the U.S. views mixed race people. No one was running around saying he was the first mixed race president because his lived experience is that of a black man.",

The higher ups had already decided what narrative they wanted to spin with Sinners. The actual box office numbers didn't mean anything. It could have made $100m in the opening weekend and there would have still been a caveat. For the record -- it was projected to open with $30m. So the debut was literally double what the movie execs thought it would be. But instead of focusing on that success and how off their projections were, they want to turn it into some profitability equation that is never done for any non-superhero movie. No one cares about marketing budgets, or the cost to breakeven outside of superhero blockbusters bc those movies are so expensive. At the Academy Awards its a bunch of films that would kill for a $60m opening weekend.",

The klan was racist but the vampires weren’t based on them inheriting remmick’s worldview, so I didnt feel like it anything too racial was being pushed. Often in vampire movies the villain is a white, racist vampire. But not this one, which made it even more original. Plot was great, all the music was great, every character was great, clothes were period-accurate. This is my favorite vampire movie",

        "text": "​​​​​​@taegotkashhi. Sorry. Didnt see the comments until now. I think i would love it any way but a valid question none the less. My main love for the film was the link between cultures and the use of music and community to over come racism and repression. The irish have a very messed up history in america. Being that they were driven there to escape the horrors inflicted by the brits at home. However, the shit they did to be accepted as white there...... Remmick represents this well. What should have been kin was fed upon to rise. When our cultures were of course, far more linked to the african american experience or the natives than it was any of the other white people there. The complexity of Remmicks inclusion opened up so many conversations on this. That was an aspect i loved and wasnt expecting. I didnt know much about the film when i went. Im not irish american. I fully irish. Born in ireland and have not forgotten our history nor the on going trauma's felt because of it. So i agree with this link between cultures and lived experience. Not to in any way lessen what is still on going in very real terms to this day for black americans. But due to those views. Im always drawn more towards offerings from african americans, native americans, mexican cinema etc and will always rave about and promote movies like sinners. As usual, truly innovative and unique and way more worth spending your money on seeing than yhe usual hollywood shite. Anyway. Im not always the best at articulating myself and thats the best i can do to answer that question. But its a fair question 🤷‍♀️ i cant deny i did love the inclusion but in such a fresh way that encourages a bit more of a look at why Ryan chose this direction. It was cool. Loved all the characters though. Not one badly thought out half baked one 👌 quick edit. I know the irish are white. I say to be seen as white because at the time when the irish were being forced to leave their homes. They werent seen as white in europe. Often depicted as monkeys etc. To lessen what the british were doing in ireland to the irish at the time. Thats where Remmicks ache when he found Sammie comes in. He saw the similarities in culture. The use of music to process the pain and loss of identity and culture. The similiarities in treatment. I understood it but i also saw the level of pain he caused with his insistance he be included, pandered to and ultimately took over the space. It was fucking brilliant!",

    "text": "as a black film student who's worked in the industry, i have a note: most big studio movies have to actually earn 2.5x their budget to be considered profitable because of insane marketing costs, meaning sinners would have to make $225 million to reach that. all major studio movies were held to this standard until the late 2010s + the rise of streaming. because of things like declining theatrical attendance, declining ancillary markets (i.e., DVD sales/rentals), and increased movie budgets across the board, an original R-rated blockbuster that's \"profitable\" in the traditional sense of the word almost never happens nowadays. all that said, no matter how sinners performs at the box office, it's already a hit. as of writing this, it's crossed $175 million globally, meaning traditional profitability--against a standard almost NO ONE lives up to now--is probably just around the corner barring an unexpected blowout from thunderbolts or mission impossible, neither of which have the buzz that sinners has right now. since WB, the distributor, is under a parent company that also owns a streaming service (max), sinners' streaming debut will also drive profit/subscriptions, and WB could probably even create a bidding war to license it to netflix or another streamer if they wanted to. i say all this to say that not only is sinners an incredible success by today's standards, it would've still been a massive success in the industry heyday of 10+ years ago. the trades and NYT's initial reporting on the film has been so disrespectful, and it's hilarious watching variety try to backtrack now. great video!",

When black people came up with the electric slide dance, whites made the EXACT same dance but named it the Achy Breaky Heart. They took credit for rock n roll when we came up with it. The baby carrier was created after seeing how the slaves wrapped their babies on their back to work in the fields. Our southern cuisine consists of sweet potato pie, theirs were pumpkin pie. Now, every white southern cook promotes their sweet potato pie recipe. For more recent examples: black lives matter...white lives matter. Woke...go woke, go broke. Every dance we dance, every slang word we use, It never ends. And it would be okay if we were given credit for anything other than the ills of the world. Not to mention as the creator stated we are often downplayed, underinvested, underproduced or removed from our own creations as whites don't just tend to replicate us, they rename it and claim it for themselves, all while screaming that we don't have anything because we're lazy and need to pull ourselves by the bootstraps. The mental gymnastics they put us through is never ending.",

It speaks nothing to the interpretations that one can gather from this movie. For example,  \"vampires\" can be seen as \"culture vultures\" that come into the black community and in black spaces after being \"invited\" in and completely suck the life out of it, transforming it into \"otherness\" under the guise of \"inclusiveness\". Another example, would be the \"playing both sides of the fence by the Asian couple, who were given the opportunity to set up shops in the black community and work \"with\" them, as opposed to setting up shops in the white community to \"service\" the white patrons. \nThese examples are subjective and what makes art ART! Just like I can say that despite its success and desirability, a Picasso is ugly af! \nThe \"disingenuousness\" that I find from people like you is that you won't admit the latter, but paint yourself out to be some sort of \"expert\" by giving long-winded explanations that can be poked full of holes by comparing similarities to other movies and critiques that you and others have done. This is why I DO NOT listen to someone like critical drinker or you for that matter.",

        "text": "@ not sure where you get “hour long” from. Nor do I really know what you mean by “surface level”….\n       There are different genres of film for a reason. There are various techniques in film making as well as writing that come with technical and objective standards. So there are simple preferences in entertainment and then there are those technical critiques that would be based in the technical and objective standards. Such that are taught in say film school? \n\n          The issue with the two examples you’ve given is that the FILM doesn’t present its story the way YOU are choosing to perceive it. Just because someone can look at and perceive a message doesn’t mean that message was intentional or present at all whatsoever. \n         When you claim the vampire to be “culture vultures” you didn’t explain HOW the FILM actually gives this message at all…. In fact you simply stated it and then moved to your next point. They are vampires yes. However they aren’t after “culture” . Remmic is LITERALLY after Sammie because of his spiritual gift that would allow remmic to see his people who were killed by the Christian invaders. About 1,000 years before. \n        You’re proving a point I’ve made several times, which is that this film is being propped up by audience perception and not the actual Merit of the script itself. \n             Also your second “example” isn’t an example as it blatantly disregards the film and what was shown to you. The father and daughter worked the store in the “black side” of town, while the wife and mother worked in a shop on the “white side”….. you and everyone else that paid attention saw this. The Asian couples loyalties or otherwise were never even brought up in film either. Realistically they could have easily been cut and nothing would have changed at all whatsoever. Their being Asian played absolutely zero role in the story outside of historical accuracy. They could have been black and their stories would have still played out the same. Their cultural heritage didn’t even play a single role except the few seconds their own ancestors were present during the “summoning. \n\n              The issue is people adding their own narratives and feelings to films. Filling in plot holes in a manner that suits their own preconceived notions instead of being honest and saying what it is. This film had everything going for it except for the script which was a mixed up mess of a story.",

One thing I appreciated about the film is that it didn’t beat us over the head with certain messages but the subtext was easily seen. There were many aspects of the vampire plot that pointed toward the culture vulture message without directly saying, these are culture vultures. Also, I don’t see the problem with movies (or music) crossing genres- this can be interesting rather than following the general formulas. I don’t see how the script was a mess. I think there are some valid critiques of the movie & I can understand why someone going primarily bc it is a vampire movie could be disappointed but to me that doesn’t lead to the conclusion that the whole script was a mess.",

Took two different concepts and couldn’t blend them well and it ended up ruining the film for most people. Same thing here. \n         The story of how blues was stolen by whites was ruined and over shadowed by the vampire storyline. In several ways that ultimately make no sense unless as I stated to the previous person, the audience goes in with their own vision and ignore the film. We’ll continue with the example of the vampires being “culture vultures”. How exactly was this demonstrated in anyway shape or form? Especially when historically it was white Jews that over took black music and they weren’t mentioned. \n      The vampire and supernatural music lore was ruined by the out of place social aspects. It was also ruined with interruptions of plot. As many have stated it took so long to get to the vampires and once there it feels like they rushed it. So there really isn’t any vampire lore to this film…. Even Sammie’s gift is immediately forgotten in accordance with the lore that Annie explains at the start. He never again conjured or lured spirits out???? Even though historically jazz and blues clubs in those days were rife with violence?\n         They just drop it and it’s never mentioned again.",

        "text": "@vikkidonn I didn’t listen to any interviews or see trailers before watching the movie so perhaps that plays a role into why I don’t see a messed up script (there are some things that I think could have been done better like show more people in the juke joint before the battle scene when it appears there are extra people). But then again many others did see both and it seems that it didn’t ruin the film for most people unlike your point for fantastic beasts. I didn’t see it as mostly being about white people stealing the blues but about how narratives are used regarding unity and inviting others in but unfortunately often the other people (often White) have ulterior motives that ultimately lead to the usurping of Black people’s resources, energy, & even life and about the importance of black autonomy. In terms of music, the vampires and the church both tried to take Sammie’s music/soul away but despite everything he went through, it was worth holding onto & he was able to hold on to it and prosper (don’t give up bc of enemies or respectability but hold onto authenticity). Just like Slim, he was able to use that pain to inform his music. It’s ok if it’s not convincing to you. I think I appreciate more as a movie with fantastical elements than if it were a historical piece- it distinguishes it from previous films that have dealt with White people destroying what Black people built (e.g., Rosewood). I can understand though if someone came mostly for a vampire film why they would be disappointed. Every movie isn’t for everyone.",

I really did like it save a few spots here and there that just didn’t need to be there….. \n      But from a technical standpoint and what Coogler claimed the film was about this is where I say it’s messed up. \n         I genuinely believe you can pull truth or perceive lessons from literally anything. The problem I’ve seen happen with this film however isn’t that. People who didn’t like that it “wasn’t” a black vampire movie (like blade is considered) have been shamed by other black people. People who disagree with many of the perceived messages, for example that Mary “stole” stacks freedom because he didn’t love her……. Like I said some things just aren’t in the film at all or people are ignoring the film itself. Stack says he loves her multiple times, and Mary changes him after forcibly being changed herself and believing it to be the thing that will free them from the broader racist America. She genuinely felt it was best. And he agreed at the end. But those who disagree with this take away have had their private lives ridiculed. One black creator who has a white Italian wife was slandered so bad he genuinely didn’t know how to respond. He’s never done movie reviews and just tried it and was slammed by long time fans and lost subscribers….. \n       I think I just dislike the mixing of people personal likes in movies and entertain with genuinely technical critiques of story telling and writing. \n     Many people can’t split them nor do they care and will go to the extremes over it. So maybe I’m just more annoyed by certain ideas on it? But I overall agree with you.",

People are trying to discredit its originality by claiming it’s a copy of Dusk til Dawn. The films are not similar in theme, tone, plot, cinematography, etc. The only similarity is two brothers , vampires and a bar. It a mindless and superficial comparison. \n\nIt circles back to one of subplots in the film which is the difficulty of black people to have any upward mobility, growth, or accomplishment without white people coming along to try and discredit and destroy it. \n\nWhen did the real monsters show up in the movie? I’d say it was at the end when Hogwood and his cronies showed up. They don’t even have to be let in. Vampires aren’t real but people like Hogwood and “klan” are and that is the scariest part.",

The Spanish and European sports media tear into him mercilessly. Among other things, the common argument is “well, *insert a black player’s name*  isn’t a target of racial abuse, so the racial abuse towards Vini isn’t because of race, it’s his attitude, he’s too cocky, arrogant etc.” .

Whatever that is arbitrarily defined as...\n\nYou alienate them, and then complain they don't understand you...\n\nYou make claims about free will and rights to ignore... Which is completely off topic, because no one is talking about the capability or legality to do so, but the morality. \n\nIf \"yt people\" held you to a similar standard, and constantly dismissed black opinions because they \"lacked the proper lenses\", you wouldn't be pulling the \"they've got a right!\" Argument, even if they did. You're only doing that because you think it strengthens your argument, which it doesn't because it's actually completely irrelevant to the discussion. But even if it was... It isn't specific to your argument and can be invoked universally, so why even bother mentioning it?\n\nWhy are you setting up houses of cards like this? Surely you see how horrible the foundations of these arguments are, and if ANYONE took them seriously, YOU would realistically be the biggest victims of the damage done. (Unless the universe magically favored you and gave you divine right to this can of worms and only you can handle it correctly.)\n\nIronic that you seem to try to wish others a blessed day while dropping a blighted take like this at the same time.",

(For extra points, Vox used to be a white newscaster and Alastor is a creole radio host, so in some ways what Vox is doing is literally what news people are doing to Sinners.  For even more points, people sent to the Pride Ring in Hazbin Hotel are Sinners.)\n\nNot saying the comparison is apt because of Season 2 stuff, but for once, Hazbin Hotel provides a very enlightening comparison.",

Seeing this character wanting to be different than how her whole world saw her? It was the start of my journey of understanding myself. No one reveres Ariel more than I do, and when I first heard the casting, my reaction was simply \"If even just one 8 year old Black Trans Girl has her own journey start from the remake, then that's worth more to me than any profit the movie could generate. The Little Mermaid changed my life for the better, and I hope the new version helped more kids like me see they weren't wrong for wanting to be themselves.\n\nsorry for the long comment, love ya, Olay!",

    "text": "It's Hollywood's worst nightmare because it threatens Hollywood's tendency to sell slop and mediocracy. Think about it, every reboot, remake, and sequel to get that dough. Original ideas have an opportunity cost to studios for every remake, reboot, and sequel they could make and this threatens that. Hollywood only wants to feed us what we're familiar with and Sinners threatens that hegemony. For example, Forrest Gump was held in development hell for so long and other original films get held in development hell because Hollywood doesn't want the big, grand, original ideas that encourage real thinking or entertainment. They want to feed us more of what we're familiar with, so we don't think differently. When people think the same in an industry, it just keeps the feeding the beast. All it takes is a film like this to threaten and that and honestly, it's necessary. We need it. Film is art. Or it should be art, it's been monotonized, chewed up, spit out, taken advantage and people's focus are the most famous stars, most successful stars, profitable franchises, and the latest Marvel film or sports or music celebrity endorsed in film like Space Jam 1 and 2 because music isn't as profitable. You can call me a conspiracy theorist, but there's enough reliable evidence out there to show this is the truth. Just like at how often sequels were made in the Golden Age, 70s, 80s, some of the 90s, vs. the number of sequels now. I can't cross a theatre anymore without seeing a remake, sequel, or continuation on some previous work. It's impossible.",

That's not a criticism, btw.  As Sinners distinguishes itself by digging into the cultural roots of the setting and its characters.  Both narratively and with the visual language of its cinematography.  But it is noteworthy that while From Dusk Till Dawn is lauded, Sinners gets eyed with suspicion.",

Especially the music. Especially the scene with the I Lied To You song which some people are calling unnecessary. Complaining about an extended music scene in a movie about black music makes you sound plain stupid. I also see people saying the movie shouldn’t expect you to know black history to understand it (nevermind that the plot of Sinners is layered but the sequence of events is pretty easy to understand without having deep prior historical knowledge). I’ve never heard this about other period films. I’ve never heard anyone slam Oppenheimer for expecting you to know bomb history to understand it.",

    "text": "Wonderful video, Olay! There currently isn't a release date for Sinners where I live, so I've been careful about which videos I've watched about on the topic, but I'm glad I chose yours.\n\nYour analysis is so spot on. Black people are only allowed success when we humble ourselves. And even then only a few chosen voices. And even then only so long as they're useful. And even then only as long as it doesn't cause too much of a stir in the broader community. Pushback will always be punished and no loyalty will ever be given. \n\nAs someone who loves having serious discussions about film and television, I just keep my opinions to myself if the topic even remotely concerns Black people. There's no such thing as good faith discourse. There are always voices only looking for ways to tear Black people down.",
