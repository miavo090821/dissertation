on twitter and then after okay we're live sweet all right i hope people show up i think they will this is my first live stream in a while on youtube so you can just wait for people yeah i gave it a shout out on the instagram you can't hear me [ __ ] it's my audio in there oh it's just me [Music] wait is that better can you hear can i hear you wait can you speak quickly hey all right sweet okay i fixed it again i'm very proud of myself um if this doesn't work i'm just gonna go on the um terrible [ __ ] um dash cam audio uh video until until further notice okay regardless so we're here we're live i'm happy to have you on it pulled i pulled no punches as as the um as the chat can clearly see i think we have a splendid splendid guest for my first uh video so why don't you tell me a little bit about yourself and tell people a little bit about yourself uh i don't know how you got into how you got into left-wing politics and stuff like that because that's always interesting all right yeah um so i my name is eddie um eddie liger smith on kick cocktail and i have a website called midwestern marks about marx's theory and and look at history through the lens of dialectical materialism stuff like that talk about imperialism and i got into politics uh when i was in high school a little bit my dad was a teacher and a wrestling coach and i wrestled for him and in wisconsin our governor um scott walker this republican guy famously well-connected oak brothers and other right-wing oligarchs got rid of the teachers union so got rid of cut to bargaining gave them a big pay cut had all the regular republican rhetoric to go along with it you know do this to fix the debt blah blah blah um and then gave a 4.1 billion dollar subsidy to foxconn and now wisconsin's debt is something like you know it's in the billions of dollars so even as a kid i was like hmm this seems wrong it's just like the the government just kind of helps out the [ __ ] and cuts the salaries of people like peter um so that was like it was like right in front of my face after everything was and then i just went to college and started studying things um the intention of making the world a better place which brings you to marxism at least so yeah sweet okay glad here and then our next person here uh our last person i promise it's not a revolving door i don't know why i said next uh we have we have mj uh what's up everybody can y'all hear me the much the much targeted mj much international [Laughter] [Applause] i did get banned from twitch um yeah that was i don't know they didn't want to tell me but yeah um i guess it happened it happened it's whatever um if you couldn't tell my room is a bit of a mess because i really have just not cared recently like i just i've kind of given up for a bit um and so i'm just wearing whatever uh i also haven't really taken care of my hair in a while but yeah it's just you're chilling it's whatever i'm gonna make a youtube i'll find ways around it there you go and i think people are helping raise back the money that twitch um extracted from you not not cause i said so i not even the strength of the people i forgot that i made a bed with somebody right and they had my cash up and they were like i'll release it or you release it your choice right i was like okay i might as well be the one to release it like if that's the case that's pretty epic though yeah but thank you to everybody i was able to donate to the innocence project for that actually and hopefully if we can set up um hopefully if i can set up like a youtube or if i can get my twitch back i can get it back in time for the [ __ ] mcgovern stream that i was going to do if not it's whatever i don't really care i don't know i guess we'll see any discussions you want to have on like specific political issues yeah i had a couple topics but i can we can take it any direction that you've wanted i mean i kind of wanted to ask just general questions for people at the start so we can get bearings you know where does everyone stand uncertain and we can keep it uh on the positive end i mean in terms of what what stuff are you seeing right now and this is something that's never talked about on the left because it's so pessimistic as a community i don't blame people but what are you seeing right now that's like positive that really like excites you in the world nothing like that you're oh come on there's got to be something that you see and you're like this is good there's there's some things there's some things there's some things um specifically leftist or social demo like because again i view things through two lenses and i try my best to do so i have both a pragmatic lens and idealistic lens like if we're talking about like a social democrat lens right like through social democracy like some of the works that's being done in like um countries such as like bolivia for example that's exciting but also anti-imperialism as well you know oh 100 such an important step yeah but then at the same time for every good thing that you see there's like 10 bad things like like as much as much as you want to say like wow this is great and then you remember china has the belt and road initiative and they're currently engaging in neo neo-economic imperialism in uh africa so yeah so like for every good thing that you think of like it's it's perfect it's like awesome it's great let's go right it's like yeah bolivia yeah latin america is getting better they're getting saved then you turn around just look a little bit more to the right turn your attention to africa and you see massive economic projects debt traps one of the biggest economic expansions in the century right and you see just africa's falling down that same trap again and we'll we'll be here 50 60 years from now our children will be here and they'll be talking the way that we talk about cia operations in latin america but they're going to just be talking about it in china right yeah yeah i mean i'm not a fan of the belt road initiative myself okay so what about what about you eddie positive stuff or negative i mean if we're going to take a look there's always the fact that you got to look at the fact that economic power in the world is shifting to the east well and especially with a country like china has an agenda of bringing people out of poverty and challenging the us neoliberal capitalism on a global scale whether you agree with every china is doing or not um i think there's a lot of a lot of hope to the boat initiative that um you know a lot of these countries these other ones did fall into the debt traps from the world bank and the imf and i'd much rather have them taking out uh developmental loans with china then i would um have them take out loans at the imf and the world bank we're gonna have strings attached um the communist party is um 100 million members in china that's not just xi jinping from the show you know that's a whole whole collective of comrades and i think it's important to keep them in mind we talk about them too that they're always pushing for form and um some of the most critical people in china some of the most strong critiques in china you'll find in this book if you read the strong critiques of their own economy um uh i think they're critical of so uh the soviet union and the policies of social imperialism and um they're committed to making those mistakes again and i just the fact that they're challenging u.s global hegemony um is good but eddie eddie i beg to differ though on the idea that xi jinping isn't the one running the show like he's he he has full control he's the only one in china right now who can do anything is what i would argue i don't think it's full control i mean do you think that it's it's how do you see that one man has control over a country of 1.4 billion people oh 100 percent deciding like there's a huge the cctv here's the thing here's the thing our definition of control is different right when i say control right i'm not saying like he can just sit there and like tell this one dude in like in in in beijing like oh uh this is this is good this is bad right like that's not what i'm talking about when i say control what i what i say when i'm saying control is i'm talking about this and this specifically his uh his c his like the way that he is on um the way that he has like grip on economic and major like national decisions on every level both on the judicial and executive and like a legislative level he has full control he has full control of the um what do they call them the five-year plan people the um the board the there's there's there's like a board of like people that meet every five years to decide the five-year plan for china right he has full control he has full control over appointments his full control over every single member and their voting decision this is why xi jinping has never had a a decision of his voted ratify i mean um vetoed uh went against or like denied in any way shape or form so yeah he has full control and it's like it's like it's like like i think me and eddie talk uh differ on this specifically h.r 6210 we uh when i was discussing about the weaker forced labor prevention act you made a video about conor's video which yeah which was interesting i saw i saw some critiques of it like article 4 specifically but like which is why like bills like that are necessary to be put in place here's the issue right we have two devils right now one is growing and one is kind of staying stagnant the age-old saying rings true i'll pick the devil i know over the devil i don't i think i think though i think though there is a lot to be said for i'm not like a huge fan of china but i think there is a lot to be said for the way that they are combating neoliberalism which i do think is that is a massive enemy of of people right now they are neoliberal themselves i don't see i don't see that i don't i think i think i think i would call them state capitalist absolutely oh stay capital yeah but i'm talking about this neoliberal privatized um economic system china is different than thatcherism and reaganism which we never as a good thing like if you're talking about pragmatic reform if we want to go that route i see that as a good thing because that is preferable to reagan and thatcher you know all the people who work for the chinese steel rocker i mean state-run steel industry and all these state-run industries that they have um that are part of their central plan yeah they have all that and the way they describe it is they say they have the invisible hand of the market that you hear about all the time in america and then they have the visible hand and the visible hand is supposed to guide people out of poverty i'm not saying china's perfect i'm not saying you should replicate what china's doing here in the us but i'm saying if you look hold on come on let me pitch if you look at every socialist country in the world they've either crushed or they've had to turn to utilitarianism in order to stop themselves from being massacred by the u.s or or you know had a coup down by the city or they've been trapped under an economic embargo and the old and the only country that's been able to combat that and bring all their people out of poverty and challenge neoliberalism on a global scale has been china so yeah you can make a lot of critiques what they've been doing um and i'm not saying that's the path the u.s should follow but you also have to look at the force that the us has been in the world post world war ii you know going in and mastering uh civilians and doing coups any country that tries to build socialism and you know done some um has some difficulties of getting around that one of them was opening their border to private cabinets you can critique that but they have brought people out obviously um and i had one more thing um sure that's based on uh i don't want to get too bogged down in this though i feel like we could go on for china and hours i want to actually shift the attention to something that somebody said which i think is perhaps most interesting for us um given that we're all living in the us right now we talk that china isn't the specific way that the us should go i think we all agree on that every country charge its own path to an extent and we should not be following direct um models but what what is the direction do you see a direction is there a direction for leftism in the united states eddie go can we get eddie go first here because um mj went first last time like what is the direction of leftism are we totally lost are we [ __ ] um well no but i think there's a lot of work that needs to be done in life we're talking about china here which is fun but ultimately that kind of conversation is mostly useless in the u.s because like you said we have to try our own path and it was either marx or engel said socialism is going to look different wherever it pops up and you know we're seeing that with bolivarian socialism in latin america and then you have like pan-africanists saw in nascar it's different everywhere it pops up and in the u.s we have to look at our material conditions and we have to you know try and create socialism that works here um and i think there's a lot of hope with uh you know before you asked us what what gives us hope and i said china just to kind of because mj said chimes and scared and i kind of like china so i wanted to say that but what really gives me hope is gen g america like millennials are very social democratic and we are like so much communist so um it's a lot i mean i talk to people and you know if i talk to somebody who's like 40 years old they ask what i believe i have a friend who does this he'll take me to like parties and i'll say like this is mark like he defends mao and it's like great like that's that's my introduction always always always always just like and and you don't get a great reaction from older people um from the united states between 30 and if someone's between 20 and 30 even you get like a reaction which is a lot of progress because they're not like socialism that's just nazism both are terrible i would never but i do agree with gen z i mean you talk to people about communism and other than like the staunch trumpies you see people say oh i don't know much about it i don't know how much i agree with it you get that maybe you'll get oh i sort of agree with it but i don't think it can be done you'll get that which is a lot better than previous sometimes i was talking to somebody today said yeah i don't really know much about it but i guess i'd support it and i asked them what they thought communism meant and they said wasn't that when there's like no more government and we can all just you know kind of do what we want because we have enough stuff to go around and i'm like well [ __ ] that's a lot better than if i asked like a 60 year old to define communism from america i mean that's like you're on the right track there so certainly i think that the tone around communism is softening like immensely in this country among a lot of people at least and um you still have your anti-communist reactionaries but that's always going to be a thing but they're shrinking bernie sanders for whatever you think about him called himself a democratic socialist as we called himself and he i think he probably would have won the nomination but we can we don't get into that if there wasn't some establishment put me he got a lot of support we'll just say a ton of support from a ton of people from all walks of life calling himself a socialist that's big and that makes me optimistic because the word isn't dead at least i think optimism for me um you just you caught me in a bad time for optimism right now i'm not gonna lie uh but if i had to be optimistic i guess like for leftism i do see like this sort of re this gen z rebirth of leftism and this shift of the overton window back towards the left right yeah yeah and we've we've seen a progressively right-leaning shift of like of like um politics right but now people can actually call themselves these beliefs they can call themselves hey i'm a communist and be open about it and have a platform uh so yeah like like you can say these things and still have a platform i mean kosher how many followers do you have now i have about 27 000 followers i have around 13k and eddie how many do you got um 155 i think jesus christ yeah yeah so you're talking between us three hundreds of thousands of people right that just listen to communists like actual com take your 60 years ago 60 not even 60 years ago take it back to the mccarthy era right all three of us would probably be sharing the same cell over in some cia black ops zone obviously my entire families in canada are so much of my family they're chilling in canada they had to sign a loyalty out to the united states or else they couldn't live here anymore and they were just like exactly it's like it's like it's like but but that's that's what we get i mean i mean like like that that's kind of just what we get that's what's happening but i guess that growth and acceptance of our beliefs is a stepping stone do i believe it's going to lead us towards our beliefs actually being implemented no uh but i am hopeful about social democracy more than anything else i do believe that that it's actually a viable path for now right at least to mitigate the issues of the workers as much as we can through social democratic means right and then these issues i i have a big issue with this and i think eddie will agree is is i think that social democratic policies are are good as a stepping stone i think they're helpful to people but what is really difficult for me and this is the distinction that i make between a lot of countries is who is enacting these things oh yeah we the united states and this is this is really this is really i mean rosa luxembourg talks about this we have it's a bourgeois state everything that we have they are not i don't even i mean they are wins for people i do look at them as wins if we got universal healthcare it's a win but it's also just a concession by the ruling elite it's a concession and the moment that that needs to be repealed it'll be repealed and if you live in a state that is controlled by that that's that's the concession it's you all right oh oh 100 i don't disagree with you on that point but like but i don't think that takes away from the fact of the genuine good that these concessions can do like oh [ __ ] i mean i mean they exist as concessions for a reason i mean you're forcing something out of the out of the hands of the bourgeois right and i think that's necessary that's pivotal now we need to get with we need to pick our battles we need to win the battles that we need to now and then worry about the big battles later like as as we move towards social democracy and shifting that over to window to the left we can then push for more pragmatic left-leaning solutions like very left-leaning so here's what i think though too is um i think i like what you both said and i think um social democracy is no replacement for like class struggling looking to change the mode of production but also like you're not even going to get the social democratic policies unless you get more organized labor like germany just got fought and gained like the 30-some hour work week you know no socialist is praising germany saying we need to be like germany but of course no one they're not doing better than the us they have the ig metal union which is like 2.2 million workers they're striking and fighting for different different gains for workers all the time and we've totally lost you know organized labor who you know most unions in the u.s vote for trump and it's like we don't have that that ability to to withhold you know that labor power um the capitalist and make demands from the state apparatus right now because you know our labor unions have been crushed right onwards you know um and that's that's one thing the west needs to do is get back i think industrial workers i think yeah and so i see two i see two issues so one is how do we keep people like motivated right to keep doing this because one of the things that is talked about a lot by a lot of marxist theorists is this idea of once these concessions or reforms whatever you want to call them are reached a lot of people do can become complacent when these things are one so the first thing is how to keep the pressure on and the second is maybe a broader question but it's thing i think about a lot the entire like idea of america in in terms of its rampant individualism i mean there's no other country like it in that individualism and i don't say that in a positive sense and it's an entire philosophical world outlook that causes people to like rip their own seat belts out of cars because of freedom and it's this insane obsession with freedom that's not you know it's not actual freedom they think it's freedom it's permissiveness that's all it is i guess my two questions are how do you think we keep the pedal to the metal with this stuff how to keep people motivated when concussions are reached like if bernie sanders won how do we how would we capitalize on that even sure let's discuss this but also attitude mentality yeah yeah yeah yeah that's because it's so common here yeah yeah well complacency will exist but at the same time and this is what will naturally combat it acceptance right ideas like social democracy when presented back in like mccarthy era would genuinely land somebody in a mental hospital right or land somebody in jail right nowadays social democracy is not only viable but can just like bernie sanders though he isn't really like i would i would argue bernie's a little closer to social democracy but candidates like bernie sanders as you said are openly open are open that openly support these policies are being enacted and i want to ask you this then when we told ourselves that social democracy is now the new normal right then what becomes the social democracy of now like think of it like this right the the normal currently is a moderate democrat like say biden right and the social democracy is like this revolutionary-esque message and then the extreme revolutionaries are leftists right that's what it's looking like on the left now as we shift our nor a new normal and we make our new normal to be social democracy leftism takes the place of what social democracy used to be right and the sort of acceptance of leftist beliefs is enough like that's all we need i mean i mean our beliefs our beliefs inherently resonate with the working class because they are for the working class if the working class sees that these these issues are fundamental to capitalism they can understand and see how this works yeah i think um you're talking about shifting the overton window i think um and like boots riley likes herself the you know communication and film director like uh when when the us was becoming basically a social democracy with a neighbor with a labor aristocracy under fdr there was something like a million card-carrying amines in the u.s so that's what they were demanding and there were politicians like long who were like no let's go to full socialism let's let's go to communism and they're like well we'll uh meet you in the middle of social democracy but then the other thing to keep in mind is one there was also a huge labor movement at the time the 40s after the war were the largest there were more strikes in the u.s in any other period of time they were wild that strikes um they were doing things that now are illegal because post reagan they made they crushed organized labor and then um two is you know you just got to keep in mind all those you know all the victories that fdr won those social democratic victories a lot of them have now been repealed uh after four years but but i want to talk about that this is this is i see two points here so firstly yeah how do we present prevent backslide because a lot of policies we did have but you know people like the koch brothers have been fighting tooth and nail against them since like the 30s because these are still concessions that some people aren't willing to make no matter what and the second thing too is we talk a lot about like accepting leftist beliefs and moving from socialism to communism i want to reiterate it's a big jump it's a really big jump in mindset because even in social democracy it's still an entirely you can still have an individualist mindset it's still an individualist philosophy oh 100 percent and the shift from an individualist mindset to a collective mindset is what needs to happen and we are about as far away from collectivism in the us as you can possibly get realistically and um social democracy is certainly better i don't think anyone's arguing against that but there's there's a massive shift that you need to make and not just accept because that's not going to be enough it needs to be a real conviction to keep the pedal to the metal and say you know medicare for all isn't enough um shorter working weeks aren't enough a lot of unions are not enough because the apparatus of the state is still controlled by people like um you know people billionaires essentially who look at look what the koch brothers have done i mean they've fought tooth and nail against these reforms which which which i agree with you but here's the thing right again like this is why social democracy inevitably leads towards the acceptance and not only the acceptance but the resurgence of leftism you talk a lot about how america is so individualistic well again go back to the overton window america's traditionally center right even our even even our most even like biden would be considered a center-right candidate if you were like in europe right for example right of course so we're incredibly individualistic but move us to more towards social democracy which is still individualistic but maintains more collectivist beliefs with regards to how to provide for the for the for the people the uh socialization of investment the regulation of financial markets like kind of trying to control class struggles right and control class issues and mitigate class issues that's not an individualistic belief medicare for all is not individualistic medicare for all is is is is is a resurgence of collectivism now it's a lot easier for me to tell somebody as to tell somebody from a position of mixed individualism and collectivism to tell him or her like collectivism might be a good idea let's like like it's a lot easier for us to easier for us to make that jump than it is for us to make that jump from like a biden to a marks it's a lot easier to make the jump from bernie to marx than it is to make the jump from biden to marx um yeah i think that's a good point but um i just wanted to respond to what kosher said like i was reading an article today it was comparing uh chavismo and venezuela to um the cultural revolution and both of the intention of doing what you were saying of building that um communal mindset so when chavez first got in there's something like 500 means in venezuela and the government supported them and would travel to them and visit them and the idea is you build a socialistic non-individualistic mindset through the communes and um you can compare now with what he was trying to do and it's like it is like how do you do that in the u.s that's so difficult like when it's there's like someone individualism but i don't know you gotta maybe focus on what brings people together that's kind of a good answer mj like get some stuff like mech and for all so people realize like there are things that we can fight for collectively is work to help all of us but that's not good enough you know that's not enough oh 100 100 percent [Music] i think that's a good point i'd like i'd like to add one thing it just came to mind right now um kosher you know how you were describing backsliding yeah yeah that's actually a way to show people that it isn't enough point them pointed to the fact that you have to continue to fight for these policies show them that like for example like like medicare for all for example be like look how much we have to fight for medicare for all look how much we have to fight to continue to have medicare for all i wonder why we'd have to fight maybe it's because class structures will continue to pervase themselves and that the bourgeois costs will continue to affect policy within with regards to the state with regards to state power structures right if you show them the fact that they continue if you show them that they have to continue to fight for basic needs you show them that this isn't enough that we need something more radical but that can only occur when you have backsliding occurring which means you need to implement the policies first yeah that's for sure i mean so i have a related question i was thinking about then and i'll go eddie then mj you're elected president tomorrow you get woken up there's a delegation you're the president um what's the first thing that you do like you are now in office uh you're a communist you are as we like to say in america you're the most powerful man in the world um i know this is kind of like a flyer question but you know you'd have to you have to think about it on your first date too so pretend that happens what do you do i would uh appoint um almost exclusively labor leaders to all positions except um yeah and then i would immediately start pushing for nationalization of all major industry um especially fossil fuels that would be the first step and then and then the executive order legalizing pot you don't you wouldn't want to do the executive order legalizing pot first so you could spark up a joint right away and celebrate when you enacted all the nationalization nationalize it man as much as much as much as i don't as much as we clown on teddy i think teddy would be one of my first appointments towards like an economic position um he he showed me a couple of his policies with regards to homelessness and with regards to um to like fixing income inequality which were incredible and beyond this again i i follow eddie's paths where i would appoint like neo marxist and labor leaders actually similarly to what joe biden's doing if you look at his economic cabinet which is weird to say the least which was incredibly weird i think him trying to win that that working class base back from trump he appointed one you know he appointed a neo-marxist and then all like literally right after her appointment was released right i've read some of her works right after her poem was released all of her marxist papers were getting deleted like like his economic his economic cabinet is labor labor labor economies which he appointed like 27 leaders i believe which is great i mean i'm no biden thing obviously but that is you know that's good that's the beginning it's uh i was i was i've only been focused on his war cabinet where he literally um appointed someone who was a foreign star general then right away was on the board of raytheon and uh now is in line to be the head of the entire pentagon but of course it's not quite the job at raytheon yet because you know they haven't started so why would you have to leave your position on the board of raytheon there's no conflict of interest there i was oh i like these ideas i mean obviously obviously pushing for nationalization is a big thing so one of the okay so here's here's something i'm going to throw this out here totally unrelated but um one of the things that is really really you know is a big focus of mines is the climate and i do think that the united states could take a leading role in that you know if we're gonna throw our weight around in something globally it should be that um because we do have all these resources um so similar to the question i last asked because because i like those answers gotta nationalize it and legalize it um what so what do you how do we combat climate change obviously i think there's no doubt that a socialist society a communist society would be more climate friendly but you know that doesn't just happen organically i don't i don't think without also changes in mindset without also real policy so what what do we what do we do about the climate what does socialists do about the climate and um how do we address it with with with real stuff as opposed to just saying less consumerism good for the climate which is true by the way and that's and that's certainly a coherent point i'm not mocking it and you know as opposed to the neoliberalism neoliberalism we have now certainly would be way better for the environment so no one's denying that but beyond that what are some things that that we do for the climate um what are the moves that we make um i think the best book to read on it is facing the anthropocene by ian angus which basically laid out what is turning our what's destroying the climate um as far as over pollution over fishing and of course um climate change um and it's about the concept of metabolic risk so you know the the the nature has all these repeating processes i'm horrible at science i said i'm i've explained it only times and but it's tough um so like uh um photosynthesis right it's like a process and we're producing so much work growing off all of nature's uh natural process like usually nature regulates the amount of carbon in the air so it doesn't get too hot but we're putting so much co2 into the air and it's getting too hot and his plan he just lays out a plan in that book um facing the anthropocene and uh applying for ecosocialism which you know the main thing you have to do and this is why i said this would be my first thing as president is nationalize uh the energy industry the entire energy industry and then you have to transition to renewables as you smother the fossil fuel industry but you can't go out like that because that's so many people's jobs so you if you analyze the whole energy sector you can you know create a plan um for transitioning these blender renewables as we smother one of the things i was actually thinking about today i was taking a shower and somebody was talking about the ecp and i'm like here we go again the economic calculation problem and obviously you know paul coxshot's done some great videos on it and but one of the things it hit me when i was showering i was like wait a minute and i was like how is how how is this a win for the libertarians i just realized like their point is that nothing can match the unbridled efficiency and calculations of the market that just goes and goes and goes and never stops producing and as socialists i always try to answer that and now i'm like wait a minute like and so one of the things that actually took me to this i was reading book fights g-check i forget who it was um what it was they all look kind of the same but he was talking about like why he still believes in a level of state power like why everyone's like why are you a status why aren't you you know a lot of these like left liberals why are you why are you stalling us whatever the questions were and he basically said like he's talking about the fukushima nuclear reactor accident and he said basically in this libertarian free market society who the [ __ ] tells the people like to move like there is a nuclear move run get out like what is the apparatus and like that hit me i was like holy [ __ ] like because anarcho-capitalist societies aren't going to stop nuclear power of course not but where's the profit motive to not have a chernobyl i guess i guess there's slightly but not really i was like holy [ __ ] that is a good point but that ties into this idea of the free market and all this stuff and sure would be like oh the fossil fuel industry the free market would produce whatever but what you're saying is also wait a minute what is it producing we need to regulate what it's producing we need to regulate what it does because distributing in all these basically what are um just trying to give a cool science word to sound smart capillaries of of market action across an entire body what you actually do is lose control and of course that's what we have now you have no stop button industry just goes and goes and goes and goes that's not a good thing you know i don't know it's just something that crossed my mind wait a minute like that's one of the good things about socialism is that we do have pragmatic plans to actually address things as they come and before they come it's just winging it yeah i think i think i think though personally like if i'm talking purely a policy decision which again this is my forte um currently the us spends about 670 billion subsidizing fossil fuels if literally just letting the profit market like and i even know as much as i hate the profit but letting the profit motive just work on its own would do a lot to fix climate change but again what do you mean by that like getting as much as i hate to say this right getting government out of energy at least in the way of subsidization of oil right is a good way to fix it right now what i would go a little bit further than just the austrian who just sits here and tells you hey take out subsidies blah blah blah deregulate nuclear no i tell you take out subsidies put those subsidies onto renewable energies make renewable energies even cheaper and use the issues of capitalism to try to fix these solutions slightly right like like the fundamental problem that i have with capitalism is the is this idea of the profit motive everything has to have a profit for the matter if it doesn't if it doesn't make me a dollar i could literally give less than two shits right but unfortunately that also works in our benefit if we manipulate the system in order to push that profit motive to give socially favorable uh policies upon us upon us as a whole it can do a lot of good this is a good first step however beyond this i do support what eddie said about nationalization but i think this is a good way for us to move our energy sector more towards renewable before we nationalize interesting it's i mean i think it's like we would both support each other's positions it's just a matter of what we can get and it's like are you gonna get the state to go against the oil companies they haven't ever in our history um and and you know subsidized renewables rather companies and there's reasons for that you know there's deep ties 93 percent of the life divided by whoever raises the most money a lot of that money has come from fossil fuel oligarchs um so is that the best way or do you get or you know my solution is get you know the unions in that industry that you know strike and say nationalize the industry but we're so far from that too you know like we're not close to having enough power to like demand that or having you know workers who even want that or know that that'd be a good thing for their own interests so it's just scary man it's like we're so far from any solution on this and we're getting so close to climate catastrophe yeah and that's one of the things that really upset me actually about the black lives matter movement was that you saw this massive movement for positive change united states obviously that we all support and it was such a populist movement of of people from all walks of life uniting around this understanding of a bad system and i thought to myself somewhat naively this could be the start of something you know real for leftism and it's certainly i don't want to call it like full leftism but i think it was certainly a muscle flex for the progressives it certainly wasn't all for naught but seeing now that it's almost january and you know black lives matter has now been commodified by all these corporations who are like pepsi says black lives matter and it's like no you don't what of course you don't think that but you know it was like showed us how unorganized things are also the commodification of cancer culture is so [ __ ] atrocious oh my god that pissed me off did you see that uh kosher you're not on tick tock that's the way that others are okay okay yeah yeah like kosher kosher just downloads it to post then leaves right after um but there's an account it might have followed you it's called exposing political tick-tock right they claim themselves to be anti-capitalist yet at the same time enjoy and revel in this commodification of a canceled culture nothing more nothing less like it is like that account pissed me off right and it's just a growing like issue of just like this idea of like it's become a thing it's become a commodity in essence to cancel somebody yeah and and that's the case with everything that capitalism gets his hands on and you know one of the things it feels like i'm running on this infinite treadmill on the left where you know you make these positive changes and suddenly it gets capital it gets cap commodified in that it's you get this weird position where okay you asked me are you for the black lives matter movement and i say yes and they say are you for um i don't know coke putting a billboard up that says black lives matter and i'd say you know no i don't really see that as a good thing not really anything or like the minecraft thing yeah like in itself it's a good thing and it's like if i support a movement i would love to have the signs up everywhere because i support it but it's like what a situation on the left that we're in now where the primary instrument of our social life is capitalism and anything that it touches dies and and one of the things they started doing is they'll concede on the social issues they're on the on the symbolism and then there'll be no real change like yeah sure take down statues but we're not you know gonna house people do any sort of economic redistribution of anything that would actually help um oppress committees uh so they're they're smart you know they're like yeah we'll have a black disney princess but you know denny's still an evil [ __ ] corporation that's exploiting however many people um yeah i don't know they're good at it really good at keeping power and tricking people and this and it's just it's difficult so um on that on that note though i did want to talk about um i guess i guess generally in and then we can move on to whatever you guys want but i just had like one more thing to talk about in terms of like fundamental problems of capitalism in terms of what and this thing i think a lot of people actually have different responses to this question so you know it's a quick question what would you say is your fundamental contention if you have one specific thing with capitalism it doesn't have to be like a specific theoretical point it can be it can be a reality of capitalism that's just like i think if you're truly against capitalism you can't go back to being a capitalist like i that you know i could see myself becoming all kind i could see myself becoming all kinds of things but i see all these people who are like i was a communist but now i'm not well you weren't really a communist because you react you know because you realize the situation is so untenable so quickly from a real communist perspective holy sh like this is hell so what is that for you like what is that for you or you're just like this is this is untenable i can't handle this um uh you go first yeah because my revel my like i've i've held vehemently anti-capitalist beliefs for a while i just didn't believe it to be viable and then i realized viability doesn't really matter but my first like hatred of capitalism really came when i realized that like i'm well off or not rather that i'm well off or that i i have privilege even though i'm a black man in the u.s i mean i'm also an immigrant i mean i came from a very very shitty country and i could sit here in a nike hoodie with a with a ring and a decent computer and talk about politics in reality i've had three cousins die from bomb strikes iud uh iud explosions i've had multiple family members die of covid because of lack of access in algeria starvation hunger famine um like like um getting a little bit worse i mean like terrorist civil wars i've been waterboarded three times like it's just it's atrocious and i'm like everything that's happened to algeria everything that's happened to my people stems from capitalism like however way you want to cut and dry it sure capitalism is at fault here like like like it's just like yeah it's just it's just like the terrorist civil war for example that stemmed only because of like capitalist motives with regards to the state and it's just like once i realized that like my people won't be free and when i say my people i mean algerians won't be free uh yeah did i hear him he's been waterboarding yeah three times but yeah like everything that's happened to me is because of capitalism and that's when i realized i was like everything that's happened in algeria is because of capitalism the only way i can fix it is by getting rid of that yes i think the the easiest argument you can make nowadays is capitalism the system based on endless expansion and production in a world that has limited resources that's you know reaching how much we can produce this is the easiest argument but but ultimately what i found most compelling was was similar to m um i studied political science and i had a mark professor and he would kind of do what parente does not explicitly say he's marxist but like talk about history in the global south like from a marxist lens and talking about class struggle and imperialism and then ultimately it led me to this book imperialism by lenin and the best argument is um one of the fundamental aspects of capitalism is the the idea of free trade right and that's what you hear the capitalist idea about and free trade the capitalism dialectically becomes its opposite as capitalism progresses and changes and it transforms from free trade into monopoly capitalism and then monopoly uh giant monopolies and trust so banks mixed up industrial capital which lenin calls finance capital fight for the division of the world and that's why you have wars um so without you know getting rid of private property and without abolishing capitalism you're not going to free the global south exactly um what mj was saying yeah the principle of the principle of free market competition is quite literally monopoly because that's what you're competing for and uh quicker people understand it the better i mean you're not competing to get a small market share yet then you wouldn't compete it's it's competition leading to monopoly because that's what competition leads to i think i think those are really those are really good points and those are fundamental points and i would say to the people watching you need to have those points because somebody at some point is going to say you know why are you a communist and you can't be like well uh you got to have your go-to like why are you a communist because it's a commitment and people um i see a lot of people tweeting like oh revolution not reform and i support that but you have to understand that's a commitment you know what i mean like when you say that you have to be able to back it up because you're asking people to go fight for you and um you got to have your points in check uh because if you don't have your points in check then you shouldn't be asking anyone to do anything at all even if i agree with you if you didn't have your points in check people shouldn't be going to do anything so make sure you have those points and you can convey what you believe to people quickly because what you believe is it's less mainstream more mainstream than it used to be but still less mainstream and very misunderstood so i like that so yeah i guess at this point we can um open it up to just like questions that people have if you guys are into that because i think people come out here they have questions and i'd like to hear your responses to these questions because you know it's always me responding to these questions but someone had a question for you eddie they said do you take uh submissions for midwestern marks uh marcus m had that question yes uh mid uh midwesternmarks gmail.com um if you go on the website we've got a submission link i think or a page on how to submit and we're looking for another one for our print journal if you if something has like a really good essay we would put in there if not we'll put it on the website if it's good then we might you know want to edit it first or help you edit it yeah so tell us a little bit about midwestern markets that actually sounds interesting because that's your yeah i know that's how i got into um that's how i knew who you were originally i think i followed it i followed you on instagram but then i saw you writing some stuff yeah so tell us about that yeah me and my buddy he's a um philosophy major i mean he's getting his master's and eventually phd in philosophy he's read he's a beast he's read like the collective voice american minor normals um but he's uh we decided to start a website we graduated after working for bernie to push people farther left towards um you know and also to get interp you know take philosophy and share it with americans revolutionary uh so we started that and then i just started talking along with it and randomly like picked off what blew up um so yeah but that's where midwestern march is where i put on my like long-form commenting got it got it uh all right so yeah any any people have questions about them i'm going to read through what people have been saying maybe some people ask some questions um [Music] follow me on youtube please i'm banned on tick tock or tweet tic tac toe supporters cut you back up they said i had too many community violations but i've only had one video taken down and it was when i was making fun of the republican hypothesis um and then they called out nick foster and some like kind of like pro israel hardliners in one day and i think both of them probably masturbate they said january 1st that's yeah that's just what they said originally i'm like hey i didn't do anything i don't know i can't get ahold of that nick foster nick foster's so annoying he i have no respect for him i'm usually pretty nice and i talk respond to people but he i have no respect i'm just bullies 15 year olds whatever that's what i'm not on the stupid app what do you think oh this is a good question from eva uh kernicki what do you think about the possibility of a second red scare um i don't think it's possible in in the way that it's possible in the way that it was back then but i think it's possible in a 21st century context the reason that i say that is i think that um i don't think people now are as literate on global issues even as they were then and i think that whatever red scare is going to come is going to even be like less focused on a boogeyman of commune communism that is made up and kind of just an entirety of an attack on like left values non-nationalistic values i just don't think it'll be a specific anti-communist thing um i don't think the boogeyman itself is communism specifically i think it's a whole host of things so we'll just call it liberalism or fascism or communism or whatever they want to call it but it'll be a much more general even less specified version of the red scare but like is it possible in some form i think sure i think we're still living through the iceland yeah and i think they're gonna we're all seeing new cold war with china and russia who are teaming up and and doing a lot in the east you know without the us without the us being involved and they're both growing as like competitors to the us and i mean i'm i think 95 of americans at least if you ask them about china they would have a very very negative response yeah yeah and which is you can have you know obviously you can have legitimate critiques of china but like most us people are just like i don't know communist bad because that's being drilled into our heads through the media right now i think that's similar to the red scare um and then with the liberal media doing the same thing with russia um reminiscent of the cold war but that's different than the red scare i guess yeah i think i think second cold war is probably more appropriate for what's happening and then the demonization will be of anything any sentiment that is perceived of like and as anti-american i think it'll be less ideologically focused partially i think because the left is less organized and i think the boogeyman isn't as much of an organized left as it used to be you know uh so nicholas l says can you explain the nationalization of an industry you want me to do it yeah go for it i think i think eddie would be better at this okay yeah nationalization just means like it transfers from publicly or from being privately owned to publicly owned like the state takes control and um part of the problem with left right now is like that's part of the left-wing agenda there's nobody really in the left who could even run in is like that you know so we have these plans but we don't have you know a concrete enough plan today this is james he's worked you know he's been a union leader in the fossil fuel industry all his life he's around the nationalized industry instead of the koch brothers then we just take it from the koch brothers just using you know we take the money we make from fossil fuels and through the renewables or put it into social programs um because the the amount of surplus value that um you know how many people listening to this are marxist but hit mark's conception um everything you produce you can put it into three categories you gotta pay your labor you gotta pay your meal production which is your mater raw materials resources and the upkeep of your machinery and then the rather the money you make it goes to profit and that's the fossil fuel industry has billions and billions and billions of dollars and also billions get to use on advertising political lobbying propaganda so you just take that out of their hands and you say all that service value is either going to the labor or it's going into this newable industry that we're going to start here so it's using industry uh for public good rather than the good of the koch brothers or whoever else and yeah they're covered okay so alicia or alicia alicia probably says i think fascism is on the rise reading fascism rise i think there is a modern form of fascism that is different than the older form of fascism in a lot of ways that i don't really consider um very important but like fascists consider them important so now they're distinct down to the distinctive so i just call it like neo-fascism but it doesn't really make it any better or any different or any less necessary to avoid by any means necessary but i think that um this modern form of fascism that is existing isn't the old form of fascism was is was was a collectivist in that it advocated for like class collaboration which in itself is pretty damaging but this form is this form of this form of fascism i think is even more ruthlessly pro-market and they just kind of say oh the elites control things but they don't ever like say anything about that and just kind of let that happen so yeah i just call it neo-fascism but it's corporate it's it's a combination of corporatism and ethno-nationalism on the highest level and that's grown like the idea of both corporatism and ethnic nationalism have both grown like those are both beliefs that are now no i wouldn't say mainstream accepted but they're definitely becoming more accepted i mean if you look at europe for example the rise of like the neo uh nazis and austria the polish the current polish leader the election of uh yeah the election of uh victor orban to hungary all these countries show that nazism and leftism is a nazism is on the rise just as much just as fast if not faster than leftism is so a key point that left leftists have to do is be ready to combat nazism otherwise you're doing nothing and and one of the important things also to remember when we talk about fascism in in in europe and and what's happening is that they were they are going to try to use the same tactics that we do they're going to try to appeal to workers um in the way that we do and um it's important to expose them it's why it's important to expose them for the obvious flaws um tell people why class collaboration is not a good idea tell people why rampant nationalism will not fix their problems because you don't want to vote you don't even if you know the fascists obviously work for the for the bourgeoisie no one's denying that but you don't want to you don't win an election from their votes alone so they have to manipulate a lot of working uh peop about that that's a really good announcement yeah it's like fascism has always been the same thing where it's you know it's about class graduation and my own you know every everyone has their own definition offensive basically but mine is it's a misdiagnosis of who the enemy is hey don't look at the capitalists look at ay or b and and like you're talking about in uh with socialism develop different in every country as does fascism leftists love to call everybody a fascist but if you look at kai clips that's an actual really good example of an american style fascist like a social policy like you know and i kind of start ubi but he's like you know i support who's in the family but not class shuttle and we'll just throw you a thousand dollars and then uh i also hate immigrants and and i believe in american nationalism it should be a strong nation it's like well a foundation for who for for college indigenous people uh for uh my people we brought over here or are you talking about um a strong nation for white people you know it's kind of hidden language and the weird rhetoric towards workers and then in america it's always anti-infant and and that's also the how it's occurring in europe is um as a reaction to immigration of course been a lot yeah it's an important thing to keep to keep an eye out for one of the things i was listening to a cool guy i'm sure you know paul warren on youtube it does great stuff um one of the better like marxist youtubers and he said that what fascists will also do is they will take non-controversial issues and take hard-line stances on them and then pretend that everyone else who doesn't agree with them supports those things so what the biggest thing they'll do now is they save the children anti-pedophilia and they'll hold these movements where like oh like we're anti um sex trafficking and it's all fascist there they'll have like a you know sex trafficking fundraiser like anti-sex trafficking fundraiser and that in itself is harmless i just said oh there's an anti-sex trafficking fundraiser of course we don't want to take part because nobody supports that and nobody supports pedophilia nobody supports any of these things but of course what they're really doing is they are creating unfalsifiable positions that nobody's going to disagree with and then uniting people around those positions hey working people you don't like pedophilia do you well that's a way to draw a crowd nobody likes pedophilia nobody wants that and they take these questions instead of a marxist who has to say we want this specific this is class this is economic policy and all that stuff it's a lot easier to you know to just say pedophilia bad than to like throw state revolution at somebody unfortunately but that's the nature right and every i have a friend who's really into that stuff he's always talking about epstein i always bring up state and revolution i'm like okay why do you think cops are murdering black people and we have these enormous prison populations while jeffrey epstein is getting let off for having a pedophile right because the state is a tool of the owning class jeffrey epstein's a big wall street guy he's what you call a capitalist the bourgeoisie they own the state the state means armed bodies the prisons the cops and until workers should pull the state that's gonna you know epstein's gonna get let off and there's gonna be people in jail for charges or for you know for non-violent drug offenses or whatever else because the state is always going to be a tool capital and that's the theory behind it and fascism is always just like you know maybe like slightly addressing the problems that exist inside but with no theoretical um basis for it and then no plan to fix it you know oh look at all these elites i do i do i do apologize but i do have to leave um real quick uh this has been a great discussion though it's been a great hour discussion that we've had so far um also to everybody in chat kosher and eddie are really smart people i haven't really talked to eddie much listen to what they got to say unless they're talking about china if they're talking about china they're completely wrong in every city like literally if they're talking about china just assume the opposite uh but other than that they're right all right thank you to all the folks that are here have a great day thank you very nice to meet you all right so we can go for however much longer you want uh we can ask answer a couple more questions then wrap it up if that's cool with you uh yeah yeah that works all right cool uh so someone asked i don't know this stuff oh this is actually a good question um do we have a skewed narrative of leftism through my early years of school yeah this could be the last question we take so this is a good question uh skewed narrative of leftism throughout my early years of school and because the curriculum and if so how did you leave that mindset um for for me it was when what really did it well i read black shirts and reds by parenting which is so i went into my professor who um got his phd in uh beijing i think i don't know i know he got it in china he studied to china for like a year studied marxism and wrote his dissertation on like the communist party and then i met him and he wouldn't like you know he wouldn't say tanky stuff openly but he would like point us in the direction of parenti and stuff so he pointed me to another student who showed me brenty and then once i decided to write my thesis on venezuela i would go to the academic sources and and read books about venezuela and figure out what was going on and then look at the ui extreme media i'm like it's not even you know in the way the us media is portraying it is so far from reality it actually blew my mind and like everything i know is a lie like i i you literally cannot trust the media at all it is nonsensical and sources like the new york times the washington post ap npr you know places that middle class americans or average americans think they can trust that are just like pure nonsense when it comes to foreign policy at least so that's what um that's what like broke down all the myths in my mind but everyone should read black [ __ ] enough at some point yeah i mean uh probably the first thing i read was state and revolution i have been like an anarchist for about a year and a half or two years but i wasn't ever like reading theory yeah i just call myself an anarchist because you know who likes the government man and um that is like you know i wasn't actually like caring if you just asked me i would have just said i'm an anarchist but you know i wouldn't have known like prudent or bakunin was i didn't know it from a theoretical standpoint um and then yeah i guess i just kind of decided to get more into politics for whatever reason it was i don't know and then i picked up state and revolution and i was like damn like this is so so true and it was like from the beginning the stuff that he was saying it was so crystal clear and then i read black shirts and reds um as you did those are the first two books i read and then from there it was like it really opened my eyes like holy [ __ ] because like you know the fascists in italy never went away like we never got rid of it one of the big things too when people said oh stall you know i'm not like a big stalin fan they're like oh stalin killed like this many people after the war and i was like wait a minute like people after the war you mean war prisoners after the war nazis like you mean he killed nazis like is that like is that what you're okay good like good yeah right and i was thinking they're bad and i condemn them but i don't it makes me happy to know that nazis i didn't work and i was the last thing i'll say i was thinking about this old like cartoon i'd watched a long time ago and it felt like stalin was such a bad guy he used to watch the soldiers the end quote enemy soldiers freeze to death and that made him evil and it's like when you realize like wait the enemy of communism they always talk about how badly communists treat their enemies i mean usually it's a [ __ ] lie but when it's not it's like the enemies are it was it was a nazi though who froze to death and that is cool and fun like i i also would laugh if a nazi was freezing like that doesn't make me a bad person and it's like you know and then the moment you realize historically holy [ __ ] like it's always the reds the communists standing in the way of real real fascism and that's always yeah he's got a good um i did a breakdown of bonus toss it's like one of the more popular ones on youtube where he's like talking about cuba and he's like the passion that gives me goosebumps that gives me goosebumps if he talks about the literacy program and his father that gets me that's so good yeah and people in america oh sorry you were talking about him i was just putting in people should watch michael parente in the chats they know how to spell the name and whatnot especially that video you're talking about with his dad and what it means to read yeah that's one of the best um shoot what was i going to say um we were talking about parentheses existing socialism oh yeah yeah and people in the u.s would be like oh let's be a team they go let's you know eat the rich um but then when anyone actually ate the rich in history they just it's not a total failure don't pay any attention to that you know even people on the left and it's like folks like henry kissinger like you know if you think about the sort of fascist today john bolton mike pompeo like i don't care if people rot in a jail cell for the rest of their lives in fact i want them to you know they are murderous war crimes responsible for kissingers kissinger especially i read the there's a part in black shirts and red's research like lifted listing the death toll and it was written in 94 i believe this is before bush went into all the you know before the war on terror really and he was listing all these death tolls um parenting was from what our imperialism has done and it was just like stuff i had never heard of he's like a million and a half people had gotten killed in angola and i was like what but yeah and they're killing communists and it was like a million and a half a million and a half i probably heard the end goal like the word angola in school like twice in high school you know and um because we all know about iran iraq and stuff but we don't know about that stuff you don't know that three million north koreans were killed in three years i mean it's the korean war anytime i do a piece of content talking about it it blows up and i figured out it's because nobody knows it happened they don't know like it gets glossed over and they maybe talk about vietnam but not korea nobody but it was i mean three million people in three years no matter what way you slice it and and and it's like not so like and and if you say anything about it people say oh you think north korea is a paradise like you think north korea is the best country in the world you think it's like whoa like no absolutely not like i'm not out here saying like they did it like that is utopia like number one uh perfect country like nobody's saying that i hope but you can't even talk about that you can't because the patriots will just come up and it's like you hate america and it's like i just don't want people to die in the millions because of a war i mean that's that's genocide no matter what way you cut it and and one of the one of the worst justifications and say oh it was foreign interests which is the dumbest justification to do anything ever like if i punched somebody and they asked why did you do it and i was like oh it was in my interest like well then my interests aren't very good of course it was in your interest like oh no we invaded that country explicitly because it wasn't in our interest to do so like of course it was in our interests you bring it up you're like it's wrong then korea for economic interest because three million people died understanding north koreans yeah not every north korean is kim jong-un you know and then and people call you a tanki and and when you say hey you have to understand the context of of the drk as they've been at war for the past 70 years with the u.s who divided their country um and and like you said murdered three million of their people and 20 percent of their citizenry and bombed their countries uh so there were no buildings over two feet tall there was nothing i mean there was nothing and and i mean one of the things we're also not talking about south korea is i talk to people and i say what's the difference in north and south korea and they'll give me all the basic [ __ ] and i asked them the question i said you know do you know what reason south when what year sorry south korea became a democracy you know it's capitalism is it a democracy no but you know what year it became like a liberal democracy and they'll you know right after the war they think you know happened right away north korea became this horrible place and i tell them actually 1987 was the first election in south korea student a student had a light himself on fire by the way this light himself on fire and that started waves of protests people were dying it was a right-wing military dictatorship and of course it was because it was sponsored by the us and people that blows their mind 1987 i was alive in 1987. like yeah 1987 is what it took yeah i have a writer on our site that's from south korea and he's posting stuff from there all the time and like the director of parasite is from south korea like north korea is the hellhole and south korea is the paradise like no it's not south korea is you know like you said wasn't a democracy until 87 and then now is facing all these economic struggles because of of capitalism and like you said that's not to say the deep arcane is a paradise but understand that they became authoritarian in response to imperialism one and oh yeah and then the other point is people call me a tanki and you said i don't think anyone wants north korea's system here i've seen people that do i've seen people that say we should take juke like kim il-sung ideology and implement it in the united states this is a tanki okay me and you i mean we just have geopolitical and media literacy what is not for america it's explicitly not for oh [ __ ] i think something happened in fact i know something happened there it probably just got logged off i'll see if uh here we go back hey what's up can you hear me yeah i think we could i think we could probably wrap it up soon but i think i want to finish talking about this in the whole tanki department what is super key and yeah i mean i totally agree with you that there are people that are like [ __ ] crazy like yeah this is the tanky shirt but for the most part yeah it's people with an understanding of stuff beyond propaganda and there's a reason countries do what they do and you ask yourself you know the only countries really that are surviving other than the ones that actually beat the united states off like vietnam the only countries that charted their own successful economic course that are surviving right now are the ones with nukes unfortunately but that's the nature of it and if you want to chart the and and people say oh then we should just do it the fact that you have to have a nuclear arsenal to chart your own economic course i mean it's patently ludicrous because i don't think that anyone should have a nuclear arsenal obviously if i could and but if you ask me would you be armed north korea today i would say no and i freaking hate nukes but that is the reality of our situation where people literally need those nukes to chart their own economic course that's insane it yeah and you had bolton told uh kim jong-un give up your nukes where and we're gonna follow the leopard with your country that's what he said and and we know gaddafi gave up his nukes and then the u.s did an intervention and he got stabbed in the bus bay in that and killed and now there's an open-air slave market in libya it's like why there there's john bolton and people like that would just say it out loud you know like give up your nukes so we can kill you and it's like well of course look at this of course now people want you to leave them alone and you look at the cia people talk like you've ever looked at them talking they're so open they're so evil it's never it's never clandestine not really i mean they're like oh we did a little bit of killing you know we invaded some countries and then both laugh and it's like holy [ __ ] i mean even obama i showed him the clip of oh we tortured some people people think it's edited no he authorized torture because he's sick because they're all sick and what i mean this is the thing too is if you want to like boil it down to pragmatic policy because you know there's no you know if i became president i wouldn't be like marxism leninism now obviously it's more complicated than that so if we want pragmatic policy the fact that i am a radical in this country defined as a radical because my pragmatic policy or medicare for all ending homelessness people deserve healthy food and water and access to school and resources for all that's pretty much it i want to re withdraw all the troops from abroad i want to defund these authoritarian measures like police and military and invest in communities that's really it's and i'm considered a radical it's like holy people should be able to eat and go to the doctor and we shouldn't kill anybody it's it's it's really you shanky right goddamn tank yeah it it sometimes it feels like living in the twilight zone but we're fighting a good fight so yeah exactly all right well thank you for this this is a great talk hope to have you on again hopefully everyone had a good time i'm sure they did so
