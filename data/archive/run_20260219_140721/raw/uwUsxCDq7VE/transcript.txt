I think women have been running the rap game for almost 10 years I know if that's like that might be a a hot take and unpopular opinion define running Define running listen it's one thing to say I don't like her music it's not my style but to like to hate on Beyonce that's a character flaw Al I see your face but he's like Drake for me was like never someone who just who grew up and and became an actual adult artist I think Nicki Minaj is the karma of the rap industry and how they've dealt with women for all these years biggest problem that Drake has had is he thought that he was bigger than the machine now the tables are turning and people are finally starting to see him for who he [Music] is hey everybody do not skip this this is not an ad I have something to tell y'all starting next month I'm going to be posting oay and Friends exclusively on its own separate YouTube channel and that channel is already out now oay and friends so go now and subscribe to oay and friends and turn your notifications on so you do not miss an episode the link is in the description below I'm serious this is the last month I'm going to be posting these episodes on my main Channel Olina you're going to have to go to oay and friends so go subscribe don't come tell me in a month oh what episodes they're there hello beautiful black people I have gathered you here today to talk about the Grammys for which there is a lot to discuss because I think we have to discuss uh baby new uh baby face and AP newses like debacle on the carpet we need to talk about DOI we need to talk about Kendrick and his sweep we need to talk about Beyonce and white people and haters outrage everywhere um there's there's so much to impact but I know we were just talking about baby face so I think I'm going to start there and give chat the floor well hello everyone I'm check and Cade with um let's talk about baby face so basically AP News was live recording they were interviewing baby face asking him a question and in the middle of asking him a question uh one of the ladies she saw Chapel R and now this young lady she's white she looks like she's in her 20s so she's probably more connected to chaperon so instead of continuing and allowing babya face to answer his question you know she's like backing down and she's like chapel and so baby face reacts is like I'mma let youall finish that and just Le lets him off and she's like oh okay sorry baby face and then now that goes viral and then we're looking at complete unprofessionalism so I want to take the floor and say I have a mix of feelings because I do this I work red carpet so there's something called red carpet etiquette 101 um so basically what I did was I worked the red carpet with the photographers in the social media pitch so when you see people like Taylor to your left Gaga look here I did that with social media now everybody walks the carpet everybody who is invited who gets a ticket to the Grammys they walk the carpet whether you're a celebrity or just uh regular pedestrian who got a ticket everybody comes and what people don't understand is people come up they are standing on the step and repeat and just as much as we're staru struck of the celebrities the people on the other side who come up to get their uh photograph taken they're like oh these people are looking and if you're nobody of notoriety or fame you're like people are sort of like you know but I can look at somebody who is looking directly in my eyes and what I will do is I'll take out my phone and I'll record them just you know so they feel good and like you know there are some entertainment journalists who walk the carpet and people are looking at them like who the hell are you so basically what I'm saying is I think it goes both ways red carpet 101 that we don't um my where's my thought that people are just uh I'm lost my thought um so yeah yeah you lost her thought too if it helps any was that I said the reporter lost her thought too if it helps any oh yeah absolutely so basically I feel like what she did was actually very unprofessional like how dare you that's our black Legend but what I want to say is we also have to understand because this whole industry is politics and it's based on like you know she probably had had a moment where she just needed to be reprimanded but where my thought comes in now at this point is how cruel the internet was to her because I can have more of a connection to her because she is a part of the journalistic world so yeah she definitely deserved to be reprimanded but I found the internet to be a bunch of miserable ass dogs to the point where she had to go off off the internet and like you know because she should be reprimanded but like think of it this way the next time you mess up at your job I hope you get fired and never allowed to work in your industry and that's how I look at it yeah love it mean it um and I I agree with you 100% because I felt like my comment was only because I made a comment where I said this is what I because I always talk about this and this is why I be feeling old a little bit um but I'm like there needs to be media literacy because the babies ain't got it we're losing the recipes we're getting on the red carpets we're doing all these things and there's no decorum now you know I graduated from the number one HBCU in the nation Florida a university and you know over there our journalism program is very extensive very prestigious and I got to be a part of that I also um did New Media so but the still the training is there somewhere in there the training is there but I feel like this Freedom that more of these uh journalists are having on the the the red carpet there's a way to have fun entertainment journalists always have fun sometimes they slip up during um interviews we saw our favorite uh entertainment entertainment journalists slip up many times and get caught in hot water for what they've said to to some celebrities um things like that but this I feel I don't like the way they came at them because a lot of people are coming at them really bad like all three of them right now the whole internet when the world is coming at you it gets crazy yet um what we the whole world did see how they treated and dismissed baby face um in front of the whole world and we're like wait hold on that was really disrespectful but then other Clips showed that she was being disrespectful out of line throughout most of the live and yet it was on a live it was on AP live right so she was doing a lot of things that were out of order and um the other journalist and her name is Amy no Leslie ambris is the Hispanic um journalist name and the other one is Christa don't know her last name but it's Christa and she was being very I don't know she gave like very childish very this is super fun type of thing and the people that were like I want to interview her I gotta go interview her it was giving Kai sonat but she is not she's she's working for AP there's a different level here you don't have that freedom so for me I'm like okay girl it was a couple of strikes from the beginning like you just can't did you what's going on and then I went to her page and some of the things the girl be saying she it's like she ungrateful for work okay she's like was like I went to her page just to see what's going I'm like let me go see maybe you know She interviewed a lot of people the thing that she wrote before going to the award show was I would appreciate Glam and makeup if I didn't have to do it myself before going to Red Carpet stuff like that I'm like girl ma'am okay it's just there's a lot of ungratefulness in her post um but I'm just like okay you know so I I don't know I don't like I don't like when the world comes down on people I don't like that but she needs I don't think to be fired but um if she's freelance I don't even know what her position is there but it was the one um that to speak for the moment that happened and she already has interviewed babya face before um asking him questions and things like that people triy to switch it because this is what the internet does they're if if they found out that okay it's not her fault Leslie's fault um it's not her fault but then they said but why would she be asking him a question about black this and black women and well how dare she do that they're always going to find a thing and that's what they began to do they started to dog pile on on them then the black man right don't know his name seen him a couple of times on the red carpet they were like you know he was in it too and people were thinking people were thinking the black man they like why they sent the and here go you know us protecting all black we trying to root for everybody black why did they send out the black man for the white people's problems and that's that's see it's like misinformation going everywhere that became an issue but yeah that's that's just how I feel about the whole thing I I Sean I just I think the whole thing to me was just like outrageous like I I mean I can I can get behind and support you know the idea that internet dogpiling anybody is just a lie right like I absolutely accept that and agree and there is an an there is an an Miss Christa didn't even apologize it wasn't even her who apologized to baby face it was Leslie it was Leslie who said I'm I'm so sorry baby face she was also like juding chrysta like hey girl this is probably not something you should be doing right now and like she didn't she was just like okay but chapel and I mean don't get me wrong I also love the song good luck babe Chapel she ate that she did never heard it it's it's a it's a nice it's a nice song She's I think that she's a rising she's a a cute Rising pop star you know cute I understand it whatever and even even if baby face was not baby face right but he is but even if baby face wasn't baby face this woman Leslie had just posed a question to him that he was just starting to answer it was just rude it was just disrespectful and it's like I think like what it really speaks to is the ways that white people one just like don't have any respect not only for for black folks but any respect in general right like black folks across the diaspora are not interrupting anybody when they're speaking about anything that they know that they're you know an expert on or that's important right like we're just not going to interrupt you we we know that that's not our maners that's not how we get down that's not how we do white folks just don't have that same type of I don't want to even call it training but it is training they don't have that same level of training that like you know that's home training and it just beyond anything it was just rude um and and it pissed me off to the point where I'm like you know I don't know what the internet has been saying about her because I I only saw it on Tik Tok but I was just like girl this was that was a choice yeah I agree I agree with DES in that it it didn't matter who it was in the moment the behavior in and of itself was unprofessional was rude baby face was asked a question he's in the middle of answering the question I understand the red carpet it can be chaotic and that different people can come on and you don't want to miss an opportunity but there is a way that she could have handled that better yeah she could have even particularly because she's not the one who ask the question she could have stepped to the side and said Chapel can we interview you in just a moment we're concluding this interview with baby face but to gawet Chapel while baby face is speaking and then to move her body in such a way to show that she was disinterested in what he had to say and then effectively tried to start an interview with her while baby face is still answering her question was rude it was it was unprofessional and to top it off baby face is an icon so like I know that's why so many of us were angry that you know that anybody would disrespect face in that way but beyond that I I agree with you Chad that I don't believe that she should have per received the the level of response she did on the internet I think that was disproportionate and I'm not necessarily even saying that she should lose her job but she needs some form of reprimand she needs some real training I think Rebecca was really on to that when she was talking about there's we we've lost some recipes somewhere because I feel like there was a window of time where people understood that there is a way that you handle situations like that and I don't I hate to sound old but even like some people who were doing teen summon like I don't think aanda Lewis would have done something like that yeah so I believe that this generation has lost some of that training and part because they get access too easily there used to be protocols used to have to build up to get to the point that you can do the red carpet at the grammies and things like that but overall like I hope she learns her lesson but she she likely is going to land on her feet I mean yeah I believe that too well have we checked in to see if she was a nepo hire or something like that or she got big off of social media because that's also another part of it but I agree with everyone Rebecca Deshawn Timothy cam I agree you know let me just play devil's advocate here I think a lot of it don't need no Advocate but keep going I know that I knew somebody was GNA say it I think a lot of it is our emotion is like how dare this young white lady disrespect our black Legend because look at it this way suppose this young lady was a young black jenz lady and she was interviewing barara stran and Victoria Monae came out way and you know young jenz she might not have known who barara strand is and she's like Victoria and then she was like forgets about Barbara Strand and goes to interview uh um yes yeah just holding my hand so yall know I will talk after you finish my love yeah and so basically I think a lot of it is our emotion and we want to protect baby face like how dare you do that to our Legend but I you know being on the other side of it as well you sort of have an understanding especially when you have experienced you know a publicist while you're interviewing an artist the publicist comes because you're not a big enough platform or something and they pull the artist away so they can go talk to another and so it's just like it goes on both sides okay I I I have thoughts okay so I agree with you that it is emotion like it is the fact that like this being a young white girl disrespecting a black Legend is a part of it on multiple levels like is a part of it on on on the level of you disrespecting baby face but it's also on a part of it of the larger level that black people already live with a certain level of disrespect that we all deal with in our real life and it is extra offensive when you see black people who you know how you know our names Legend have earned a certain amount of respect and you still see them disrespected by nobody's because the level of like white people feel like they don't have to pay us any respect that does emotionally charge us and I think that's valid two um I think the I think the scenario that hypothetical like if it were a black a black gen ear would they da bar I think here's a fundamental difference it's always been true that black people have to know white people's Legends our Legends everybody's Legends and they don't know ours only white people get to have the nerve to act like they don't know Whitney Houston they don't know baby face they don't blah blah blah I you said Barbara stri not one of us said who that like we all knew you know what I mean like it would never happen you would never see it a black a black gen Zia could not find herself on the red carpet without having the extensive knowledge of pop culture and all these people requisit like you just can't find an example of black people being so ass at their job which is another like you know so it's like on one hand I I do feel it in the sense that the internet is a hard thing to deal with like if you're just a human period like the internet is rough Because the Internet the internet doesn't care about like grades of crime there's a line if they can if the internet decides that you you're in trouble for whatever reason you get the same [ __ ] punishment the same treatment as did something super crazy and sometimes it's not even that the the punishment is disproportionate in terms of what people are saying like one person it might be the everyone is expressing the same valid sentiment but by the time a million people expresses a Jesus Christ Overkill and so I I get that and I can imagine her feeling like that um however do I like totally empathize and whatnot no um I I I don't know I was waiting on you to say that part yeah I just I just think it's you know don't get me wrong I'm not saying a chick should be fire or anything like that do I empathize or particularly care no because if the if the roles were reversed they a God had a up out of there the live would have been cut they have pulled it from the side like you give me your give me your card give me your [ __ ] like that's what happened like seen it happen absolutely I think uh I think Chad's Point uh Rings true in that like do we know if this person is brought in from the social media world right and when I say that I mean I've noticed a trend across the board like I'll be watching a video by m NBC or MSNBC and I'm listening to the narrator I'm like this narrator is trash like this narrator is trash this narrator sounds like they're 20 years old fresh out of college bored not interested in the material it's like y'all are one of the biggest broadcast media channels on the planet what you doing and what they're doing is trying to appeal to the newer Generation by hiring these people that are interns that are fresh out of college that are big on social media and there is no protocol anymore there is no like oh are you trained have you done this before it's like oh you have an audience oh get over here get over here and that's the thing we've all experienced it for anybody who's achieved a certain amount of social media clout or whatever people will just email you and be like you want to go to this thing and talk to this important person and it's like wait a minute you don't know if this YouTuber has ever talked to somebody of this raid before they brought me to the White House last year I I make videos outside like there was no question like have you done this are you ready for this they just take you from obscurity and put you in the [ __ ] white house and they don't think it twice about it you're right but it's also different in the sense I'll say this it is true that like in the in the in the economy that we're currently in of the internet and audiences and platforms and stuff that will Propel you and open give you access and doors open that may that you would have never otherwise had access access to I think that's true across the board there's levels to it but it's true across the board but what I will say is this just about every negro that I can think of that has a platform that's popular that does something has a background of expertise in a bunch of [ __ ] like I could EAS like every single one everybody I bring on Olay and friends is a credential human being but then white people don't be having no backgrounds of any kind and nobody questions it n no expertise no nothing nothing to be found and I think that's the difference like black people yeah our platforms us if you're one of the lucky few black people that even manages to be able to build a platform you had to build it off expertise of some kind like had they plucked Herby ralis off of YouTube and put him on the carpet he'd ate down you know what I mean like you see what I'm saying like there is a difference I was like yeah I agree there is definitely this General like social media thing but they are hand they because that's just the ver you know the nature of white perer in America he always going to go like there they hand them to these white people that don't even like and child we say that in for all we know this girl big time journalism degree and she think she's training here and even with um journalism right uh even before social media became so easy it gave easy access for people to get media credentials and get in and do all the things that we literally had to train for and so many people were told you're either going to get a local news job or you just you ain't going to make it that that's pretty much what they told you when you came from media school or when went in and so um you know I'm grateful to have gotten into digital media that was a great breakthrough for me and have worked alongside great people all the things right but I feel like when I see even back then I was told by every Professor that I had who were black right at that time to even get on the anchor news desk you had to be white or like white these nails were not a thing the only person I seen with nails like this in the news was um the black woman and I want to say her I forget her name but she was in Atlanta and she used to wear her nails real white real long shortcut blonde hair she was here and it worked for her in this market but she was one of the few a lot of they would tell us at that time I used to wear my hair long and Bone straight I used to wear super short nails even though I was known for my long colorful nails when I was working at the local news I had to do them super short box square and I had to have like my hair one color no and nothing else I used to wear the most boring colors and that wasn't my life but you had to wear the most boring colors and that wasn't even working on the news desk I was an on the street reporter at the time did live looks onean ban you carrying your camera editing it right before it could get there white people were getting the jobs quicker us black journalists they told us it's going to take you a little longer or it's going to be you're going to have to do a little bit more white folks just had communication degrees they weren't even having real journalism deges it was just it stopped that just communication no journalism training no broadcast training no uh uh writing no none of that they just had like a simple communications degree from FSU and they were getting at the local news station the jobs that we were trained to do and so we had to work six times harder so even in this space the white girl I don't think after this I don't think anything's gon gonna happen to her I saw a lot of people even empathizing with her hey you did really great on the red carpet hey you actually were an amazing dress because people were coming at what she wor and how she looked so then white people were like no you're an amazing reporter you are so good at what you do and she probably is they don't think those black people owed respect like that but what you're saying is such a great point it reminds me of my other answer so what chat was saying like if the hypotheticals had it been reversed and it was a jenzy black girl disrespecting some white legend or whatever and everybody seen it black people would old black people would have said fire has too cuz nothing more black people can stand and the idea that you got an opportunity that is scarce and you it up you weren't there on your tippy top you know what I mean black Roo for everybody black is rooting for everybody black because you have to be good as [ __ ] at your job you know what I mean like that's I also want to say that as so I I am in media I work in digital media as well um a journalist who has not gone to J school right I did attend um morous college so you know Rebecca you know okay you know I I I I heard you I heard you and and I respect I respect what you have to say about you know we love we love fam you I to hold my I tried to hold my pce too look I'm like you know we love FAMU we do we do so so nothing but respect for the Gators but but um I did not attend for for communications or or or Media or anything like that so I was there for sociology so I say that to say that like I think a lot of times people there are a lot of people in media in journalism spaces who are like you must attend J school and what I want to say is that there for anybody who is passionate about their work there are so many ways to find training and to be trained in these fields without necessarily going to Jay school and I think what frustrates me is that there are a number of people that are being found through social media or through having large Platforms in general um who are just not passionate about the work not passionate enough at least to dig in and like find their own training and and like really develop their skills um and I and for me it's like once again this this lady could have several degrees I do not know her I don't know anything about her haven't looked into her look look shout out to her but there's just a level there's a level of of respect and passion that I think you have to have for um for the field that you're in to to to show up with a level of care and again I think this goes back to the fact that white folks just are not raised with the same home training that we are and don't have to care about our black Legends in the ways that we have to care about theirs like o just said but again for me this is just this is hard I'm I struggle I really do struggle with the idea that they don't know who baby face is because it's like baby face is baby face right like baby face is written for Whitney Houston right like he work with Quincy Jones like bab like baby face is how else you describe him like he's with the new the newas the old young past upcoming like he I mean he is baby face so for me is just like I I get confused also we just said a lot of so sorry this might not [Laughter] be and and speaking of white people not respecting our Legends right the share amount of I don't even let at this point I don't even let let the Beyonce slander upset me no more but the share amount of white people that been on here like I Honestly though I I feel like what is the word I feel taken back I actually feel physically pushed back when I hear people use the word deserved when talking to about Beyonce like when I hear someone say like even just feeling like it's open to like debate whether Beyonce deserves the word deserves this award like no please and then they start mentioning the likes of these teeny boa white pop girls I can't even believe it I I honestly have to just like I'm like I just get pushed back so I got to leave the room so I don't disrespect these innocent white ladies Sabrina and them seem nice like what the rebec please yes I just feel because I have it's just my feeling right because but no this is facts um Sabrina Carpenter just came out yesterday she can disappear any day now and nobody will remember I'm telling you that right now she she she made an impact but literally she's too new um and she can disappear tomorrow and we'll move on to the next white girl Beyonce though she has impacts that has trans it's just in every generation she has been in the girl group some people don't know but that's okay because they know Beyonce right now for whatever the hate for Beyonce has a lot to do with people not I don't consider myself part of the Beehive per se but I know every Beyonce song I have done routines to her I have I have I know every Beyonce song every Beyonce Run can't hit all the notes may go a lower octave but I know Beyonce okay and um people she's very gifted very talented um and I think that they don't want to give that credit to her because there are other people who are very gifted and get very talented that they love um and I feel like that all can be a true thing but your person may not be as a global Artist as Beyonce and that's okay because she's your artist might be Global in your house but then the racist part of it I believe that the internet especially right now in this climate right uh they with the country album and everything they have heightened it so much that there are people under the guise of black women or black whoever who are actually white folks Behind These pages and going in on the disrespect but then the black folks are eating it up with them alleged black folks on the internet and feeding into this conversation about Beyonce being mediocre not deserving there are other words like that is so crazy and they can't even give us another artist who can really who deserves that in this particular moment right now they can't hating on Beyonce is a character flaw listen to me I'm not a part of the Beehive I've never been a part of the Beehive right most of Beyonce's catalog was not written with someone like me and mine so like but I can I was I'm not I'm not her target audience but hating on Beyonce is a character flaw she is the greatest artist of her generation unequivocally that is an objective truth she is the only artist that you can reasonably compare to Michael Jackson and actually have a cogent argument about it and so like to even fix your lips to say that she may not be deserving of a Grammy so what does she has more Grammys than anyone else she has earned every single one of them and has not gotten some that she also earned as well and so I just it it is mindboggling that you can watch This Woman's god-given talent and watch the level at which she works because she works like she has no talent and wants to make it he has outworked all of her competition the only that she has in her generation is someone like Kobe Bryant right so like someone like with this generational Talent who outworked all and outlasted all of his competition received all the accolades and especially they started around the same time too it's unfortunate he's not here with this anymore but you're looking at a woman whose career has already spanned three decades she's reasonably done five genres of music and been at the Pinnacle of her career doing all five of them she sings she dances she writes it's just like listen it's one thing to say I don't like her music it's not my style it's not my cup of tea it's one thing to say I prefer someone else's music over that but to like to hate on Beyonce that's a character flaw all I am so glad that we are all 100% on the same page I just want to read a tweet that really summarizes how I feel it's uh it's from Trill Clinton at a Statesman it says Beyonce winning album of the year for cowboy Carter is like when Denzel won the Oscar for training date or when who one for ghost it's definitely well-deserved and a long time coming but it's not for her best work they give these Awards when they think it's time not when it's earned so my thoughts are so what if it's Jay-Z uh Speech would prompted this give the G her T and let her go and so that's exactly how I feel and also it's also not Jay-Z speech that I I'm actually so offended at this idea like no it it actually infuriates me the idea like oh man winning got her this award been talking C cash [ __ ] by the millions every Grammys they don't give Beyonce that award we [ __ ] scream Into The Ether it was not why what happened was they've been getting their the quality of their award show been going down people have been have criticized it as being a scammy award show being full of [ __ ] and so they added we seen because they were on record we remembered articles where the people who in the academy before said they feel like Beyonce wins to wichit so they not voting for it's not about whether or not she deserved it they weren't giving her things based on like it actually being deserved but they were actually trying to hold back [ __ ] from her because like she can't have all these Awards and so what happened was they added thousands of new people to the academy to the vot to vote so what happens when you had more people to vote more representation in the voters you saw more representation in the winners right the thing that annoys me there's so much Beyonce fatique that annoys me like honestly like it it it's ridiculous to me the way the internet like the way people carry on with Beyonce and I'd be remissed if I didn't point point out that Beyonce didn't get this kind of hate on this level she did get a lot of Illuminati [ __ ] for sure and all kind of [ __ ] and stupidness throughout the years but like Beyonce the hate that Beyonce has gotten since the Super Bowl since of 2016 or whatever has been ridiculous and immense and I whatever right this thing that I think with with art people do this thing as though like they do their personal preferences art has to do with best and quality and that's something that I have a problem with especially when it comes to artists and musicians they are making different projects like different kind of music and art and it's not not everything is for everybody not CU you don't like something the most means it isn't at the same quality you know what I mean and like they do this thing where because you don't like cowboy Carter which probably has a lot to do with you don't like country music and these different kinds of things inherently you're like this isn't her best work you know what I mean and also the idea is like if we're looking at work right if this is work and this is everybody's work and all Beyonce work is above all these what does to to what Chad is saying what would it matter you know what I mean if you don't think that this is a best album all that proos is you was missing some some some some awards for those other albums as well because Renaissance should have won and I'm still pissed you know um but that being said when they analyzed this project I'm like what are we looking at like looking at and what are we what is the metric because Cowboy Carter has has done things that these other projects have not done like what what project created a whole conversation around black people in country music the history of of of black Americans in this country and de with and actually like the fact that this isn't her she isn't stepping into a genre or co-opting country or anything like that the whole point of this is to explain that this always had its roots like this always had its black roots whose music made you have that discussion you know what I mean on a regular on a regular basis I also don't see how you watched her perform Cowboy Carter um at that football game over Christmas and you I don't know how you saw that and didn't and don't think she deserved what ration and the holleration I this how Mary Jay said is itation in the what the holleration I'll just add this Brandy in my household goes every day okay Brandy Jasmine Sullivan those are big to they're big artists but I would never be like brandy should have won day I can't they bring out names like they just was performing yesterday Beyonce hasn't had any days off and in between her days off she dropped something random now if this was acting I wouldn't even I wouldn't no that's that's her that's that's all I that's it that's it I'm I'm the only one who think my sister did a good job in Cadillac she did a phom job in record Dre but she was singing so James godam it side note for the record I just want to say I loved Cowboy Carter personally aside from that tweet that was my number one most played album and sweet honey buck I'm gonna I'm gonna let Cam and Timothy talk but trust I'm coming in for the cowboy Carter love trust so like I was was curious that's not my cup of tea but it's an excellent album it is exquisite start to finish like Olay says like even beyond the actual music itself the discourse that it created enforcing people to reckon with that black people not only created country music but the conditions of our people at the time of the music how it's a derivative of Blues and so much of The Narrative of the Blues runs through country and how it's been appropriated and to and to do country in a legitimate way the way that she did listen it's an excellent album again you may not like country music Rebecca said that like you that might not be how your pet is is is formed or whatever that's fine but it's an excellent album so even to say that she got it for something that wasn't her best work I think it Rivals a lot of her best work I'm not a Beyonce like a ficado so like don't don't Stone me or whatever make when it comes to music it's a legitimately excellent album again you don't have to like it you don't have to listen to it you can say like I might have issues with some of the content whatever like it's an objectively excellent album and and it was worthy of the distinction that it received and like I know people are like Billy isy should have won it's her best album she gonna be all right she gonna get one you know like what they say I'm let you talk I was seeing all kind of white people on my on my list that I definitely replied to um being like talking about what white girls album they prefer because they hear it more and blah blah blah and all these different things and I'm just like of course you hear their [ __ ] you know what I mean I'm like like using those kind of arguments that you hear white pop mainstream acts that are being pushed by the machine and their music or whatever more as a reflection of what is best like IR the [ __ ] out of me and I also like you know I m music music is important you know music is important to people I have no problem with white people feeling their their music deeply like Sabrina Carpenter seems cute my Aaron my editor loves Sabrina Carpenter right like um Billy ish like her and her like you know 200 I feel like 2002 Nelly Nelly Nelly drip you know I don't got no problem with that she don't bother me none I wouldn't recognize Charlie xever if you I wouldn't I wouldn't know I never heard none of that music I didn't know what brat summer was for the longest it took trying to figure that out what are you talking about for months okay so like but I wouldn't like try to take away its cultural impact to them you know what I mean like I wouldn't try to say oh it's not this it's not that it's the way they go to diminish works you know what I mean it's the way they have to they have to they have to disrespect this wasn't that this didn't deserve this isn't good this didn't make that I'm like are you already your [ __ ] that's the thing that makes you want to disrespect they little but anyway before I before my blood get going the internet the internet is out of their mind and that's we all know intimately and so arguing over subjective tastes and people's opinions about what's best is kind of black people yelling at a brick wall right um but to that extent y'all's conversation had me thinking about the Grammy's voting process and so I looked it up because I actually I've never been intimately involved in that um I am a professional musician so that that much I do know as far as the process of creating and how people react to your work but there's a submission process and there's a screen process that involves experts from that category and then after that once they've met the technical definition of whatever they're looking forward with that category then it moves to nominations and final voting and stuff like that so ultimately while there is a baseline technical specification here this is subjective this is a lot of people granted but it's it's just people's opinions and I think when we get so like oh my God oh my God oh my God this person won this person didn't win we we just missed the fact that the Grammys is a very inflated very highly funded show that exists to keep the music industry alive like that's that's all it exists for and to provide more slots for advertisers to sell that [ __ ] and the the decisions they make have no bearing on who's great who's not great um we'll talk about the Kendrick sweep later but even that like we can't get so like oh my God that happened and therefore it means that it doesn't mean [ __ ] in my opinion I want to be grounded like you when I gr up um I I really I really do I really do I'm not though I I I want to be like I'm like I'm more grounded that I am here because I didn't argue with nobody online I said you know I go go ahead Chad no you go a sh oh I just wanted to make a point about the artist and to your point Rebecca about Sabrina Carpenter who's a part of that group like the Charlie XX like the Victoria mon who have just made it to mream because Sabrina Carpenter has like this is her six album actually she's been around for a decade so you know a lot of these artists are just coming to the we're just starting to see them so they've been she Mak the 50s type come through the back door black people type music right yeah yeah yeah and so reason the reason why I bring it up is because an artist who I want to focus on right now who's been out for years who deserves the respect is DOI who had hands down the best best performance of the night so congratulations DOI let's talk about because I was so happy when she won The Press Room like very excited yes I say very excited about DOI but we're gonna take it back to Beyonce real quick because I love I love DOI and I'm happy to talk about her in a second but I I feel like this is just important to like contextualize all of this in the history of the Grammys the Grammys has been around since 1959 since then only 12 black people have won album of the year only four of those have been black women Beyonce now making the fourth Beyonce was the first to win album of the year the first black woman to win album of the year in 26 years the last one being Lauren Hill before her being Whitney Houston before that being Natalie Cole right like and the the black men being mostly Stevie Wonder Michael Jackson uh Outcast and a a few others the reason why I feel like this is very important to name is because I think yeah there can be a lot of critiques about the imagery of cowboy Carter that I think are very fair I also think that there's a conversation about you know like just the the whole like Americana um aesthetic of of it all the things like those are very fair critiques but when it when talking about the music specifically like Beyonce went from art song right with with um Carl mien on daughter right which is heavily influenced by black spirituals minstral um songs Etc to Brazilian Funk like and Brazilian Funk if you know anything about it is born of like oppression in Brazil like afro Brazilians talking about poverty and and oppression in Brazil That's What Brazilian Funk comes from and so for me like the beauty of this album is the way that she and all of her collaborators painted the picture like they like it was such a colorful body of work that for me I'm like I actually cannot say that this is not her her well that's not true her best to me will always be lemonade but I think that this is absolutely a top Contender for one of her best projects because of the ways that she was able to build something that really did Bridge a lot of a lot of gaps between so many different genres and reminded us that all of it has its roots in blackness in Black being in in the fact that black folks are creating all of these different types of art from being oppressed through our oppression right and all of it is rooted in what helped make country such a brilliant and beautiful genre of music and so you know like I know that a lot of black folks are like I don't really like country I love country music because of that history but I think that there is like just something really important and Brilliant about the project and the ways that it mixed these um these genres together and the ways that like it brought forth you know like Linda Martell who was notably the first black country artist to get that level of Commercial Success right like just the things that she was able to do by mixing in this the old guard with these with this new guard of of black country artists I think is just brilliant and like I said she's only the fourth black woman in history to earn a Grammy for um album of the year so I just think it's brilliant and honestly this should have been her fourth because losing tobec losing like when she put out subtitle changed the entire game of music of like music on Friday night the Tuesdays because of that album like losing to Beck was crazy and then losing to Adele and then losing to Taylor Swift like and then losing to um Harry Styles don't get me wrong Harry Styles album that album was good to me I loved it sorry Adele Adele also was like make want to L she you know what I mean she acknowledged that she didn't deserve think that she didn't deserve the album she acknowledged that Beyonce should have had that album while she was taking her home but she acknowledged you know this is this this Beyonce should have had this Alum so I appreciate her for doing that tell that I know I just I just needed to say that because there's so much Brilliance with this album it was like it was my top played album last year and probably will be again this year too be honest because it's just such a brilliant album um but any yes let's talk about DOI because she is that girl oh see oh well start on beonce because now there's more is my last thing I'm gonna say my last thing I'm gonna say about Beyonce is this like to what you were saying Desa I don't know who like watched a Renaissance film I don't know if you went to Renaissance but I'm like I think I need people to take a step back and appreciate like what's happening Renaissance was made the like cowboy C or Renaissance are made years in event this is years and years and years and years in the work in the making and I don't think people can appreciate in our like era of immediate immediacy immediate content immediate drop it out you need to put it out you need to this and with the fact that there's this feeling that everything outdates that um that things need to be of the time you know what I mean that something is going to be dated there's something like what I think besets Beyonce above everybody like just above the pack is the fact that she made entirely like we've only seen two out of three acts like think about that like that are years done she made several different distinct transformative pieces of work that were not a part that they you don't know what year she made those you don't know what the years that they're coming out that they're given to us don't they're not reflective of what the rest of the zeist is doing she sat alone in a box you know what I mean and transform and not alone because she went out of her way to collaborate to learn there so much history there's so much learning that obviously went into these process and she waited and it's the patience to me and being able to be like I'm going to take the time like not feel the need to tell everybody what I'm doing you know what I mean not like let them know this big thing is coming but what it takes to take years of methodically working on something and trusting that like it doesn't matter what's going on out in the world like what the music scene is looking like what people are doing I'm going to do this thing and even like with cowboy Carter there were so many people like he like there's this dismissal to oh it's country you're not you know what I mean like Beyond just even people's just like Beyonce critiques of this it's just a lot of people that just don't with country you know what I mean especially like black people that would be on board typically are like whatever I don't want this this was a flash in the pan I didn't care about this y y Yad y but that stop that didn't stop the show and so I thought it was so incredible to see like to watch Beyonce come out Beyonce is a performer like no other and I do think we do have some performers in this gener like in our generation that are currently like that I think are impressive in their own rights like when I see Ty Creator shows when I see a Kendrick show when I see um uh even like a DOA like there are lots of them the weekends you know what I mean stuff that are creative and do do the most and do out the box but ain't nobody doing [ __ ] like beon and I think there's something to watching her put out an album that so many people didn't even give a chance like you they told him I don't like I'm not interested didn't even play it or whatever and to watch her put on a show that is so like you if you watched Renaissance you would think that there's no way she could come up with something more incredible in this like it's so crazy to see somebody do something at that level and they say I'mma do it again I'mma have two more in this you know what I mean I feel confident and I trust that I can up whatever I did last like you would have never thought she could do I remember being at Renaissance being in awe like I can't believe this [ __ ] I'm seeing I felt the same way in the film I feel so to watch her perform like do that cowboy card performance and know that don't got [ __ ] on whatever she gonna do for the tour like when we watch our performance for that football game I'm like be so incredible that so many people who didn't even go who wouldn't even give this music a chance now like this [ __ ] is amazing like I I need to go listen to all of this blown away I think that there's just like there's a certain level of artistry that Beyonce is competing at that nobody else is and I think that's why Beyonce for as much like as much talk and debate and controversy that Beyonce is given out in the world when it comes to her pairs like Beyonce is the Beyonce celebrity of celebrities like her Artistry is UN is is known and unquestioned by the people who who do what she does because they see it you know what I mean there's no way to take away from that level but I let me get off Beyonce's dick for a second last point that is a testament to her being the greatest performer live or just ever because the thing about Beyonce is if you might not like her music once she performs it live and she makes a rendition of it you're going to like it no matter what and that's one of her main talents and also I I just think it's incredible deshaan you mentioned that she's the fourth woman and you know Beyonce's number is four so you know that's pretty significant had to mention that okay doy now I like I like as as the uh resident rapper in the room uh I have I have a lot of respect for DOI period just her story and how she got here like I'm I don't even watch Awards shows like that but I saw I couldn't avoid uh doi's performance at the Grammys so so that that's one thing her performance was a showstopper it was crazy and she did it with a very not traditional song that that um that denial song is um it's not what you think of when you think of rap for one when you think of of um female rap for two because her peers her contemporaries they're not doing that like they're doing what they need to do to hit the algorithm to hit Tik Tock to do all these things and I would argue that what DOI did her approach to releasing this album to getting to the place she's gotten to was not only unconventional but like in Stark opposition from what everybody in her Lane is trying to do right now I'm not I'm not one of those people who groups all female rappers in the same pot together I don't think they're all the same but I do think the ones that make headlines are very very very homogeneous I think I have to my bad [ __ ] rappers no no no no I'm I'm not because that's the thing I'm trying to be make sure I got the Nuance in that in that opinion cuz I'm not calling them all you know bad [ __ ] rappers I'm not putting them all in the same bucket together I'm saying that they are starting to get at least the ones that get the most they're getting very syy over time and the thing is men have done that forever so why not but in the the stardom of female rappers is in its infancy and it's becoming bigger and bigger and bigger to the point where they're starting to compete with the best of our male rappers and it's a fantastic thing to see but DOI has done everything in Stark opposition to what a Meg is going to have to do to get her Grammy moment as an example I think women have been running the rap game for almost 10 years I know if that's like that might be a a hot take and unpopular opinion define running Define running I think I think in terms of who's who's uh uh I guess driving the culture forward who is like what is the the the style the kind of music what's popping what's been the summer anthems I think women have been running it now for almost 10 years like I truly it's it's actually been interesting to me when when you think about how long like how much time could pass and you think something's new like we still talk about like cardies and them like they dropped the other day like if you look at cardi if you look at cardi b as ushering in and they like cardi bust the [ __ ] door open for female rap in a way that is UNF paralleled and that was like 10 years ago like I was like that's like it really was like cardi started to Bak yellow cardi put out Gangsta [ __ ] volume music One 2016 2015 like bodak yellow yeah exactly 2015 it's been 10 years like so I want I want to say that I think women have been dominating and I think women have been killing their male their male contemporaries for a long time like look at their performances there are a couple of men like I do mean the Tyler creators the Kendricks who like perform at the level of the women but not gen like who the others they're not smelling them like I really truly think that I think the reflection of them seeming syy to me is how the industry and how a a a sexist world around them pushes that like mag mag puts out anxiety mag has some rock songs on her on her last disc too like she experiments with all kinds of different music gorilla has a gospel song on her last that's my [ __ ] you know it's pretty hard it's pretty hard yeah listen like I've been and and even to like DOI I'll say that like I see a lot of people I actually responded to a [ __ ] like a horrible take on threads today that I that I I'll read to y'all about DOI right I seen it uhhuh stupid it says it says DOI disrupting the BBL rap agenda is with the more artsy conscious bubbly girlies need Lauren Hill and Missy Elliot stood alongside Lil Kim and Foxy Brown they collectively held down Hip Hop for the ladies with different perspectives different styles and US ' 90s and 2,000 girlies were fed everyone isn't interested in low-key prostitution freak nasty lyrics in the same beat or flow all the time the are you talking about you've never heard a DOI song in your life this is what I people are so they don't let artists be multi-dimensional and specifically they don't let women artists be multi-dimensional because they don't let women be multi-dimensional like it it's that simple like because Missy Elliott Missy Elliott and hold on who who who else they say they put in this foolishness Laur Lauren husband and singing about it right like I don't know what you're talking about Missy have all kind of [ __ ] bad [ __ ] R you just don't identify You Don't See You Don't See Missy in the same desirability to put her with the bad [ __ ] like that's the that's all it is and they don't see DOI the same way and they don't bother to explore her music they're seeing one era of doi's music and not bothering to splore the others because don't don't you have all kind of hypersexual hits like DOI has erors of her music now that if they the people who are talking about her now and saying all that [ __ ] wouldn't even recognize her they probably don't even realize that that's that's what it they don't realize what it is is her they don't realize persuasive and all that stuff is her so I think there is a I have this issue with there are so many female rappers like as somebody who listens to almost entirely like I had to realize the other day that it was sexism that made me feel the need to call male rappers when I say who my favorite rapper is because you expect the sexist world that doesn't respect female Artistry to like debate back with you and say you don't know rap if you don't say and I was like I don't listen to these as much as I listen toen they're out rapping them they make better music than that they outperform them the standard for them it's just it's not even close um and I said it to say there's [ __ ] ton of female rappers like of I mean so many you could find every different kind that you like and every kind of tweak if you wanted bad [ __ ] but Al you could go get you Rico you like there's so many of it like it's just so much so it it's frustrating to me to have it where women and in rap do not get ackn knowledge like I love that DOI is having her moment I love that DOI is like having her breakthrough but there's a reason why this era of DOI is being recognized and why it's being respected and why no one can ever respect female Artistry without using it as a metric to [ __ ] on the rest it can never just be that she's amazing it's always SK she's amazing CA other women CA they don't you know what I mean because it's this and it's like that's not F true and it also annoys me and this this like I feel like not for nothing I feel like Meg is you know a little a little a little snub didn't and I think you know some things are yeah I think her disc two last year was way better than way way better than disc right like I think it's probably yeah this two goes nuts and this going just not kind of it's just kind of not for me you know what I mean I don't think it's bad I don't think it's a top of her you know um repertoire for me but but she put on if you ask me Meg putting out his or Plan B any of those tracks if it was somebody would have should have received more like ention and respect from the rapity rap crowd there's no reason why plan being and his didn't get that and I also think trauma Zine is overlooked so I think a lot of these artists they do go and they try and and the especially these f female rappers they give you the whole Gambit the whole variety but it's disregarded and the gag is too they get [ __ ] on when they do bad [ __ ] rap but when they try to experiment remember when when Meg gave us she you know what I mean she gave us she they've given us I could I could give you all kind of different genre from everybody so this is my long long long way of saying DOI is [ __ ] amazing but I want people to recognize her amazingness the fullness of her like don't think that she's amazing because she's this thing because you put her in this boom back category and you aren't sexualizing her because she's a dark skinned black woman that you're not seeing in that way she boom bing in for you because I'm like I don't know how they not seeing DOI I know DOI for being sexy I know DOI for giving and she goes out of her way the thing about coverage is I see her going out of her way to try and make it clear that those things are not true about her like responding to those kind of Internet misconceptions like y'all are wrong I got me a BBL so don't say I'm I'm different don't say this da but that doesn't get covered so that's all long R I think that she for the for the okay for the for DOI specifically if people have been following her I've heard of her even before she started getting like into music where we' seen it because she's always documented her process on YouTube um as a young woman you know she's a she's a young woman and she's from Florida she's a Florida girl so I've seen her I love i i before all of this I loved how she used to give it up and realness and authent authenticity um about her journey to get to music um and to you know do this full-time so we've seen that she's gotten here um people don't recognize that throughout the time that she's been visible whether it's at this scope or before where it was just on YouTube and then we started to see her in the social media space like Tik Tock because people were calling her a Tik Tok artist back in what 2022 or however um and so she was she looked away then but she likes to change up she's not like people other people where it's just one sound she likes to change up people were talking about the song that she had where she remixed what it is that song right and people were like oh that's one of my I hate that song from her that she liked that moment but she moved on from that moment we've seen her in the in in where um this the bad [ __ ] stage we've seen her where it was very clean and then we've seen her what what it is now where it's gritty but the people can't really place it somewhere they're trying to compare it to Janelle Mo um not Janelle Janelle Monae where the look and then they're saying but the rap is real gritty they're trying to put her in a box and she's telling y'all baby I'mma change tomorrow right I might be a nun tomorrow and rap about lesbian I might do I don't really she she saying don't Place Me In The Box and people keep trying to to the point she's been in so many different um eras in her life that people don't even recognize her from just last year and I think that's the problem she's that talented she's that gifted where she doesn't care to have a stamp sound she likes to change it up and that's all right I think that's really her Artistry with megga stallion I do think that she was NN right I think that she was because um people wanted her to just be they want to put her in the box of just shaking ass the thing is she could shake some ass okay that's an art the way that she does it it's like it's it's beautiful but she wful she and she and she's a tall girl right like me but I ain't got no ass but she she's she raps really really well and I've actually seen her Evolution from wanting to look this way she's she chains her sexy up right and um and people won't allow her to be just that every time she's rapping something great I I love the song that she has with um um Victoria Monae right on on her latest album listen to that all the time and I feel like I when I'm listening to it I'm like damn she really could I think that she has this sound that is her sound there are so many male rappers that rap One Way um on so many different tracks but that's their that's literally like their brand that's I love that for Meg actually that nobody when we can hear somebody else um trying to rap like that we're gonna be like oh that fell out of Meg's pocket like that you know we we'll be like that because Meg has this the sound but because of how especially cuz people was riding don't forget we was doing I'm a remember remember y don't remember we was doing all that but then what happened massage the Hat was hateration and the holleration remember that came out too the girls that didn't like her and wanted to see her fail couldn't wait to jump on the Tory Lane's train right that they and that to me when she was saying all what happened to her people said no and that's when I think that they took away they said that she's Talent L they couldn't wait to stamp that if she talented she's a hoe she's this and that she's but men are men in the in in the industry especially with rap they get away with murder literally they get away I been half acid in rap for 10 years and and yeah they half they half acid but then she comes out and she's even stronger she took a Hiatus people were still talking about her she took a Hiatus came back out gave us real hair gave us real tea on the body and then they said uhuh she went got a mini BBL that she she can never work hard on herself she can never she Dr dropped a whole documentary she did that and then people were like yeah you see how she lied about not having sex with Tori that's all they focused on when it was like like she has a story just like everybody else right and I think they don't want they they just don't want her to be the greatness that she is and they do that with a lot of these young black female rappers they want to just it's they don't create space for for multiple and they want everybody to pick P themselves against each other like this is back in the day like Fox like with like with cardi and like um with cardi and Nikki with um uh Foxy Brown and Lil Kim like all I'm so sick of it and I'm like we can have sexy we can have I like Janelle Monae's change people don't want to accept Janelle Monae and her change but I think it's an illusion of like domination right like when you say accept it that's the thing I think it's an illusion of power and the existing structure wanting to believe that they still need to accept it or give permission because like they're saying what they want but like we don't have to have the conversation that it has to be more that there's more space for more than one female rapper now because there's been you know what I mean like there's constantly there are all kinds of female rappers go like going on runs at any given time right like that is what's happening but they continue to have these conversations so that if you if the rap discourse never changes if who are considered the Gaye Keepers WAP and the knowledgeable rap continue to be these old who just talk about it like it's a male dominated field or like they need their permission to succeed in rap then you keep thinking of it that way instead of realizing like oh [ __ ] like Janelle Monae has been successful for Eon Janelle Monae has gone through several eras of Transformations you know there used to be a Time Janelle Monae only wore black and white suits you couldn't see it you know what I mean a long time ago you see what I'm saying they're gonna but people don't want it the men the way that I see men commenting underneath all of stuff about Janelle Monae or or the the Meg the stallions um ice spice right we haven't seen her since the argument that she had lot right Jesus but with ice spice right she came out a lot of people I I was kind of uncomfortable seeing her because in my mind she was too young see my my old ass she was too young to be out here shaking ass like that it was like girl cover up but you know but at the same time like I'm like even with her she had talent for a certain genre now do my ears need to hear it no but there was children that wanted to hear this music and people people and this is outside of the my music mind right she had she had a place there was a place for her in the industry but they wanted to make it where it was just her and the whole thing but then colorism came to play I just feel like when there's like I said the reason why we can't accept it is because they don't want to they don't want us to accept it we we have to view women in the industry as always at odds right always at odds then be like fighting with each other and then moving on and they rapping together and they be here and they be that or you know what male rappers were nominated for Ramy outside of Kendrick cam you know uh no I think he was mostly competing with Kendrick Cole at least one yeah Cole might delete later for album of the talking about album of the Year oh no just in general like what male rappers do we know kendri were nominated for awards I think Eminem was nominated for one yes he was year as well that's all I [Laughter] know when you think about it you know let me tell you how I know that Fe like women have been Domin like we we gotta go move on to something else because we gotta talk about Kendra before I let y be free quickly but that's more again how I know women have been dominating rap because when you think the men who dominate rap they're all a bunch of from my generation you know what I mean they're all a bunch of like when I was in high school and you decided they were the big three you haven't switched it's my Our Generation fighting because who the [ __ ] knows what's happening on because again women are dominating rap they just will never they don't acknowledge that or the era change or the genre because they'll never go and create a Mount Rushmore of female rappers or recognizing that but who are the males the new of the who came out with the that doing it like them the baby and low baby and those n are not on the level of the female rappers that are running [ __ ] now they're not we haven't we haven't not commercially not talent wise not anything uh and we also have to remember that hip hop has become the pop music in of the last decade it's the most popular music and also the female rappers have also become the pop stars so they have to operate like pop stars they give us variety of performance looks and they're just they perform at a certain level that the male rappers just aren't so I would like to coign you I I just want to say like a couple things one um I think like often times in these conversations we forget exactly how much is determined by these music execs who are put in place to exploit black artists like that is their sole responsibility and so a lot of times people will have arguments and like will go back and forth because of like the cultural implications about who is and is not allowed to like do perform in these ways or whatever but at the end of the day it's the white execs who are like we do or we do not want you and I think what feels important to name or reiterate because o said this earlier is like yes cardi came in and bust down doors when she released particularly when she released Bak yellow in 2017 like and I think what helped with that was that cardi chose to collaborate with other women instead of choosing to be like you know I'm in now so it's just me and so it showed music execs that like okay we can actually profit from women rappers in a way that we did not think was possible before but then what happens is music EXs are like okay this is the Prototype we have to continue to recreate that we can't allow you to deviate from these points because the moment that we do we don't know if there would be any profit in it so right so we won't push it exactly so then there are folks like us who because I I have an entire I have entire like women in Hip Hop playlists because I just enjoy women who rap like I just think that there's something particularly like special about it I think that it's beautiful the ways that like the different sounds you get from the the women who are coming out of the South versus the women who are coming out of the West versus the women who coming out of the north right the same thing with the men right but I feel like what often happens and also just a side point if you realize most of the women who are running [ __ ] right now are from the south so shout out to us but but like I feel like this is it's important to name because um so many times we forget exactly how much power music execs have and and what they are willing or not willing to push and that overdetermines who becomes mainstream and who does not and that also overdetermines how people perform and how they don't and I think what makes DOI so special especially in this moment is that she has been very clear in all of her interviews and all of her music but she's like I don't give a about what the industry tells me to do I'm going to do what I want to do not because I want to be mainstream but because I want to produce art that matters to me and I feel like that like that that is something that just for me is like you are special like you you are showing up being like I know what type of art I want to make and one day I W to you know I wna emulate AIA Bank sound or or I wanna uh I W to go and and create my own sound or i w to like make poke fun at the jco and Kendricks with this record that she's blown up with now or I want to go and and and be in my ALT bag like she just allows herself to do what she wants to do and in that way I feel like she reminds me so much of Doak cat I know a lot of folks have feelings about DOA but I love DOA I feel like her like the the way she approaches music feels very similar to the way that DOI approaches music and so I just appreciate their rap style and their and their sound but I say all that to say that it is important to acknowledge that music execs play a significant role in what we hear but I feel like what's also important is that because we are in this era now where social media allows us access to artists who we may not have ever heard before it is also I think important that we do have these sort of like cultural conversations and arguments about who is and is not allowed to perform in certain ways because that is how we get introduced to other artists that we may not have heard of before so many artists that are on my playlist are artists who have not made a single billboard Hot 100 hit who don't have a bunch of music videos with a million dollar backup but they pla on that playlist you hear it like and a lot of folks are like oh you know I [ __ ] with this sound I'm gonna continue to listen to them because you you introduced me to them and I like their sound um so I just feel like that's important to name I also just want to say real quick Megan DOI cardi DOA JT young Miami Lotto gorilla like we have sexy red we have a whole host of names we can like list off now of black women who are like in this industry running this [ __ ] and for me that just feels like like like o said 10 years ago that was not true and now we're here where we get to we get to list off names and say Hey you know I actually don't really [ __ ] with this person's music I'm just going to go listen to that person music and we can do that because we have the choice we have the option to do that that's special yeah it's beautiful that's and and that's something we talk about too so um I teach a hip-hop class at Temple I've been doing that since 2011 and this is this conversation we're having right now is one of the primary conversations we have towards the latter part of the class because what we're seeing right now is a Resurgence and women at the Forefront of the culture as voices and ways we just literally have not seen in 30 years um all the reasons that you all have named as well um just to touch on some of the things that you all said Desa um we were talking about the the record exec control so much of what we hear that that's that is true in a lot of ways and it's one of the reasons why I'm really glad that DOI is aligned with TDE U particularly with through their partnership with with Capital Records because TDE is one of the last labels that believes in not only black art um in in authentic ways but also believes in art in artist development too so they're they adamant about putting the best iteration the best version of an artist forward and allowing you to grow and not stifling black creativity so that's that's a beautiful thing to see as it relates to that but in terms of DOI she's a special talent and for all the reasons that you all have suggested before and this is really just a beginning for her um to Cam's Point earlier the these these awards are not the thing that we should look to to validate us Diana Ross has a Lifetime Achievement Award with the grand with the recording Academy but she doesn't have a Grammy Pac never got a Grammy U Bob Marley never got a Grammy so that does inv validate us but I love that she had this moment because of what it means to her career because even though she did not need that to get the people's love and affirmation this is going to exalt her to another level and her we uh Rebecca said it we watched her story unfold we remember when she got fired from Chipotle five years ago and said I'm going to really try this music thing and we watched her explored these different dimensions of her talent and things like that and to olay's point too we have such a simplistic view a linear myopic view of women particularly as it relates to the culture for all the reasons Olay suggested I mean like the the thing that she referenced earlier is just like outrageous like the people to try to say that Missy was some Bastian of positivity and and the like just never sat and listened to anything that and it's because this whole notion that they just like Olay said they did not look at Missy as someone to be desired sexually so as a consequence Missy like most of her catalog is drenched in her um exploring different forms of eroticism and sex positivity and theik and so uh but people never look at it that way and and some of it even and none of it is is is hidden like you even look at some of the titles get your freak on one minute man like um and so I say all of that to say that we are in a true like opportunity where we're seeing women flourish um at the Forefront of the culture we just haven't seen Rap City and DOI got um Grammys in the same night and that's just something that we haven't seen in quite some time and just to even to have that level of diversity and we are the ones pitting them against each other but like rapity will be the first to tell you there's there's room for me there's room there's room for the city girls there's room for cardi like stop pitting us against each other because none of them are the sole representation of black women and none of them are even are singular in their focus and so if we allow them to grow and show various dimensions of their personality we can get true art in ways yeah we are getting true art from them just aren't appreci go ahead yeah go ahead k u Timothy you're you're you're you're getting at the point and I know I know as a person who's steeped in you know hip-hop history you know this but we're kind of talking around it how the genre has been inherently competitive for decades and it's the it's the only one like there are there is no who's the goat of rock conversations happening that's not something you hear it's just us and it comes from like like everything with us it comes down to this perception that there can only be a handful of quote unquote goats but I can name a list that's like 50 people long who have contributed to that more no top five top right top there's a top there's a top 70 when it comes to hip hop and and the thing is the reason the number has to be that big is because all of them have contributed something individually significant to this tapestry that we have presented to the world as hip-hop you cannot have hip hop without krs1 without Nas without Tupac without Biggie and all four of those people that those four of 100 plus that I just named have contributed something that no other human being could have contributed to rap and that's what makes our art form beautiful every single person who has done who has t Taken part in it has made it better as a whole and made it something that's more comprehensive and turned it into the world's pop music that we have today so what we need to get to the heart of is why the hell are we always driving black people against black people in every art form in every sport in every field in every category why is it always that person has to be better than that person and why is it only men when we get to that discussion in the first place why because it's a reflection of our lived reality it's a there are so many because we live in a world that is anti-black that wants black people to have as little as possible as little opportunities doesn't like to recognize us as talented in every Arena that we are in they they want to believe because this what they believe about black people in the world they rather what that we are untalented that there're only a couple of exceptions there only a couple that are really smart a couple that are really good at this a couple that are really good in that and so it's reinforced in all our industry is the idea that like everything is so and we internalize it we everything becomes so discardable there can only be a few people that are truly great and then you diminish in media and like downplay everybody else's accomplishments because and and and you see that so much right there there are so many people who have contributed like amazing things to like we're since we're talking about hip-hop hip hop and people and people will they would it's like what have you done from Le lately you're only as good as your your current hit people will [ __ ] on that and dismiss them and it's this constant effort to try to prove yourself or be the best it's never and when you see it not for nothing since we we gonna be talking about Kendrick I think jcole is a perfect example of our unwillingness to accept that people could be comfortable with they're at there's this inherent desire that I'm supposed to be fighting for the top spot that's why people found the so and so [ __ ] offensive the idea that jao like I remember at one point in time jacel had a song that I don't remember which one it was but basically it was like I'm I'm I'm cool with being three to people you know what I mean like like they think I'm the third and I remember all the academics all the people like what this is some antih you supposed to be trying to you know what I mean and I and I always understood like that's a three of greatness there's so much greatness there's so many people who when people talk about hip-hop they talk about the greats they never discuss people are still with us who have amazing careers like people talk about they don't talk about ludicrous ludic you know what so much about that is anti- Southern narratives and we ain't got we look now Olay you gonna get me started you gonna get me started you gon get me started don't get me started ol to your point yes I think that the competition in rap I think is a part of two things and I I think you hit the hit the nail on the head with the most important one just the black experience is is typified in a lot of ways by scarcity of opportuni so we have to compete for opportunity resources and there's this perception that so many of are Unworthy of opportunity but then in rap there's also the literal competition of when rap was emerging as something that was recognizable you had to demonstrate that you were capable of being on the mic and to to actually touch the mic you had to be good and to not only be on the mic to rock the party you had to be ready and better than whoever else wanted to try to rock the party too and that's how you started getting like the cold Crush brothers and fantastic Romantics and the like creating these routines and things like that and their Legend was building around the Bronx because they were known to be able to rock a party sometimes for upwards of an hour and the like so that inherent competition was literally at the formation of rapping and then it got commodified later once corporate interest started entering into the culture too yeah and a couple of points um allowing me something you brought up and you know it allowed me to now speak about this artist because I noticed that she didn't get mentioned because you know whether you don't like her fry ways or not we can't you know exclude you know Nicki Minaj that she has had a huge role in this but but but your comment on you know we are there can only be a select few and the unfortunate part about Nikki is she com main one who believe is only supposed to be right is she comes out on the wrong side of that whereas like a cardi understands that it's about Community we get further ahead when we bring more of us along whereas a Cardi's like I mean Nikki's like well I'm the main one and this is I'm going to block out other people and you it's like a story as old as time right like Tyra versus Naomi there can only be one black supermodel and so you know that's why I give Nikki Grace you know a lot of people don't like to but um yeah and then to your point uh Deshawn and Timothy uh about TDE takes time to you know let their artists simmer slow cook so that they can you know uh grow and become the great artist like siza as well like during The Press Room she talked about there was a certain person that asked her you know R&B artist and S said straight up like no that's the Box y'all put me in I like to make the type of genre of music that I like to make but you guys just see me as R&B some of my favorite songs from sizza on SOS were some of her rock songs and then lastly you know where you talked about Deshawn with the executives and the labels I don't know if you guys caught the the audience video of when Kendrick Lamar won we all went up in The Press Room amazing moment but can't ignore the fact that Dr Dre and Lucian Grange gave each other a high five when he won so it's and his politics but we can move into Kendrick Lamar yeah yeah since you we g go to Kendrick so that we could be we could be free um I'm just gonna say right quick about Nikki my problem with Nikki is that Nikki is part of the problem like that that that's my that's my fundamental no one no one could and no one would ever take away from n from Nikki's cont like Nikki's impact on hip-hop or her Talent no one would ever take it from her the problem is all Nikki ever seems to want to do is take it from everybody else like that been my issue with Nikki to what DeShaun said earlier what made cardi so impactable wasn't just that she bust the door through but by collaborating with all these female artists she showed the industry that there was room to make them profitable there's a reason why Nikki was popular Nikki was popular for dumb long before we got a cardi but she didn't do for the industry and for women in rap the way what cardi did and what a lot of other female artists have continued to do follow like taking the Baton from cardi and it's because every word out of Nikki's mouth is everybody is [ __ ] beneath me it should only be me she likes being the only woman in the room and I think it's because she comes from an AR being the first lady of something where the the the industry itself like hip hop was constantly enforcing that there's only supposed to be one that's why ter squ out their first lady that's why Young Money had their first lady that's why Jun had their first lady because they believe it only could be one woman this is our male industry and Nikki buys into that she was she was forged in that and like she just cannot she cannot wrap her head around like it changing she takes it as an offense to her being and she just does [ __ ] that I think is Despicable and I honestly and I said this to say like somebody who loves rap and loves bad [ __ ] rap and like loves women rappers I loved Nicki Minaj in high school like I can't express the I had Nikki on my wall like I mean I remember when there was a time where you hadn't even seen Nikki like that you remember when you just for like you was hearing her her her verses and music she wasn't like in music vide she was just kind of like breaking you be excited to see her like you didn't see her that much like I remember when like mon a massive attack dropped like that's how like just wanting to see Nikki so it didn't come like people who like at least for me and I think a lot of people who don't like Nikki that was not a quick Fall From Grace I'm telling you I watched Nikki show her ass for so long and honestly by the time that [ __ ] she did with me I even let I st like I'm telling you Nikki's [ __ ] with cardi was so nasty and people were trying to downplay like how it was and then you saw her just Contin I've seen her take it at like much smaller artists I've seen her just attack women artists after women artists every time Nikki even be cool with a woman artist that's two seconds until that's done but the way she did Meg like of a woman like inherently music a woman to be out chair mocking another woman experience violence the way she talked about even the victim husband the way she she talked about that girl's dead mother it's just [ __ ] like that that I'm like you're a despicable person and that's just what it is for me and I rarely I rarely like I mean rarely be like I don't like a [ __ ] on principal I'm really like going to not listen I don't I don't even listen to Niki music no more don't like Nikki so much as a character so it's like it's not Talent I'll never take that away from her bars out monster she slaughtered everybody in the beat we all know all we all know the Nikki facts Nikki's record and resume will always be what it is but Nikki is the one who took away from it Nicki n Nikki hurt her own legacy and that's what makes her and that's what makes it different when people try to compare her at that time before we got all of these you know young women rappers right now but at that time um it was different because with little Kim that's when people try to say oh little Kim was no I I don't I think this is such a different thing with what the monster that Nikki has become and how she uh did bring in some of the girls and do that as like look I did it I'm the queen so I can handpick who's going to come next and then those people had F like found issues with Nikki as well so at this point I just feel like you know Nikki's a great rapper still listen to some of her stuff me I happened to be in college at the time when her mixtape drop and all the stuff and it was great like I love love love love Nikki um I can still listen to her music and still say that she I can't mess with her as a person um and I think that that's just a personality trait that ain't no good um but she she's talented but I think that's why we don't even see her right now like we don't even hear about her right now she doesn't have that just because she has an army online um there's not people really coming at me saying girl you heard that new Nikki but speaking of that with the Kendrick whole thing we're going to go into that they're like you know people saying there's not new Nikki we haven't we didn't hear from Kendrick for a long time for a long time and all of the sudden you know they mentioned he came out a little bit but then in March when they dropped like that on on Futures album which wasn't even at like something that we heard about at the Grammys at all like that whole album that's what I'm saying like that's how much that album didn't make an impact but the one song done literally made that whole year brought Kendrick put Kendrick in the booth see like it really powered him up like that like that on Futures album that we did not hear about at the Grammys this is what really sparked um Kendrick Lamar and what we see um has come of that but I feel like uh and it also became the demise of um Drake who we didn't hear about at this year's Grammys um not even mentioned nothing didn't show up and who would have thought that that cold day in March when futur album dropped that we would now see from from the rest of that year to today that Kendrick Lamar would own like the whole like everything like would be the star and on top of everything I know Dy kendri he he has to and I wanted to say something really quick about uh the last thing I'll say on Nikki and it's extremely short because I think Nicki Minaj is the karma of the rap industry and how they've dealt with women for all these years and forgive my political analogy but I always call Donald Trump America's Karma and I've just seeing a lot of these parallels in that we've done so much so many messed up things to this oppressed oppressed downtrodden population for so many years we were eventually going to create a Nicki Minaj yeah and we've created a trump in this exact same way we created the person that is the worst of everything and at one point people we had a benign attitude about Trump Once Upon a Time too but we have we had a benign attitude towards Nikki and her character flaws and then they just got worse and worse and worse over the years and now it's something that you can't ignore and you can't sit to the side as if it doesn't matter and it doesn't impact people because it does it's rough it's rough to watch in both cases but specifically with Nikki is like we we we we believed in you and like you just never really you never really were able to get over the childish kind of competitiveness and pettiness to just become the rap icon that you deserved I got I gotta say I know I know we're moving on to Kendrick I know but y'all keep talking about Nicki and I'm like I got things to say but um do it I I gotta say that you know one I think that everything y that y'all have said is brilliant and um I think the difference between Nikki and a lot of the women who came before her because the point that Al made I think is really important that Nikki if you think about it was the last of the women rap genre who came from a group of men who was who had to be endorsed by a group of men to be accepted um but that that is not necessarily how it started right if we go back to to Queen Latifa if we go back to ncite if we go back to like you know money love all of like those artists didn't come up from being like first ladies of of a hip-hop group they they came up [ __ ] rapping like talking their [ __ ] um so but I think what happened between then and and the 90s is that you know your your ref your ref Riders your mafia Junior Mafia your you know like all of these different rap groups had to have their EES and their little Kims and what and then Lauren Hills and what ended up happening is like they had they got disciplined in a very particular way into submission right they they could be big but couldn't be too big right they could be they could be large but couldn't be too large and when you got to a point where you where you became too big too large you got disciplined Nikki I think two things happened she one got lucky but two there was a turn of an era right between the 90s early 2000s and the 2010s that allowed that I think allowed for her because of like the way that feminism um had grown allowed for her to not be disciplined in a way that Kim and so many others were and and I I think also Wayne recognized the fact that like [ __ ] I made two monsters and I'm going let them I'm going to let them swore do their thing like we making money off of that um because Wayne was also a monster right so like and is like Wayne is my one of my favorite rappers ever but the point that I'm making with this is that Nikki I I think cam what you just said about her being the karma is just like brilliant because she was not disciplined in the ways that the other women were but helped to discipline those women right she helped to to make sure that Kim was disciplined she helped to make sure that Eve was disciplined even if like not intentionally so right it was just this this way of like making sure that she was the one voice that we heard um both by being just incredibly talented you know like when she was hopping on remixes with other women like the the record with little Chris I mean she outshined I won't say out shine because I'm a huge eeve fan so I loved eeve verse um I love Trina's verse loved Diamond's verse but Nikki outshined on that record um and I think now we're just witnessing Nikki sort of experiencing what it means to be on the other side of that disciplining but it's it's of her own creation and none of the women who she is trying to discipline ever car to discipline her in fact many of them have all named like you know we came up listening to Nikki we enjoyed her we appreciated her music we appreciated her contribution to Hip Hop we don't want to discipline her we want to be able to exist in in the same playing field as her I don't even think they care to be to exist along the same lines as her they're like you know Nicki can be up here whatever we just want to be able to rap make music enjoy like the work that we do yeah and she is come she comes from an era where she got to help discipline the ones who came before her and make sure that she did not have ones come after her so now she has to discipline them and I think that naming her as the karma is like the perfect way of wrapping that up in a bow and see and now you see why we can't move on yall keep making great points then we gonna have to talk about Kendrick D another time because it there's irony in what you're saying because I think to low wange credit something that people have always acknowledge I think generally there's um I think generally it can be a mistake to go sign to to an artist run label or like where it is an artist who's like at the especially while they are still an artist it is hard for them like Kanye is a testament to that right it is hard for them to to care about their project where they want to be and also put into you and I think Lil Wayne is one of the rare like a really good example of stepping aside and letting two people become great and become big like Lil Wayne like Lil Wayne you could see the camaraderie and bringing them up and never truly seeing them as competition and I wonder how much of that like what happened in the process of that that made there something missing because it's not a coincidence to me that like Drake and Nicki Minaj are both people who's like self and conduct within hip hop is something that's on trial it's not litigated in the same way for Nicki Minaj or whatever but they had a little bit of a litigation eror with his you know what I mean and whatnot but to me that's not a coincidence they're they're coming from the same camp you know what I mean with the same mentors and they both don't seem to know how to F act so I don't know but I guess that's a beautiful way for us to finally get to Kendrick and his sweep props props I start us off [ __ ] yeah please go ahead please go ahead team no it's a uh it's a significant like like all the things I said about the Grammys beforehand are still valid but I I think it's just the final bow on the top really the final bow will be the Super Bowl but the final bow on top of what was essentially an unprovoked uh barbecuing of uh one of Hip Hop's biggest figures at the hands of Kendrick and his him having him having to have his hand forced to discipline uh that artist and um I think more than anything it's one of those moments where we're like okay yeah the Grammys ain't that bad you know what I'm saying like they they they eventually they get it right sometimes but no like I I'm still not team Grammys like I'm still team like that show is really really messed up from a historical perspective it's a distraction um and it really creates more arguments within our music Community than existed before every single time every single year um and it's purposely ignored us for so long that I have a hard time celebrating this but the one aspect of it that I will celebrate is the further bearing of the biggest culture vulture I've ever seen in my life uh talk that [ __ ] that's my word on that I have so much rage in my heart like I honestly don't think I would like come off the ledge of Rage like I like I every day I feel like every day I see Drake mishandle this whole situation right like honestly I think all of this Drake's handling of the issue has been so much worse than anything that happened in the Battle right like I like his handling has been despicable at every turn it's like I just do not understand why I for the love of God he just don't go sit down quietly and come back with a great piece of work after some time like had he just done that we' be almost a year he'd almost have a year he doesn't have it in him he he doesn't have it in him and you know why I think he's m as fu is similar to like what I was saying about um similar but different because you know Drake is I I'll still always give Drake his talent right like but similar the different to like academics you know flying off the handle because people are reprimanding him for creep [ __ ] that he does that other people do Drake's rage is in that Drake has been Drake has been allowed to to live this way you know what I mean all time it's like it's infuriating when you think like people who was [ __ ] with you who didn't have no problem with this all in plain sight [ __ ] with your music heavy but P's like I know he cannot understand what could have happened to make Taylor Swift do the sweep along with with with mustard I know like he's trying to like what the [ __ ] how the on God's green earth to all these people hate me and I like I can only imagine I think li like that level of rage and like stewing I think is why Drake is keeps handling this so terribly like I think every day he wakes up in disbelief like and it's CA in everything that he expresses I don't doubt there's ever going to be like a real processing of like what the indictments are that were made against Drake or whatever I don't I doubt he's ever going to do that and honestly I don't think he needed to do that to come back like he didn't need to that he needed to just be quiet like most people don't actually just cosign you know what I mean the indictments against him that's usually not how how life works but had he had he sat down taken time out and came out with music that with with with minimal credits where just been him that's that was hard that was Dope music which I don't care what nobody says Drake is capable of making great music he's made lots of great music whether or not you think it's because uh you know who he's collaborating with who he's stealing from all this is in the next thing but I I say all this to say I agree with Cam that this is I've never seen someone take just everybody just the the universe just unite to whoop your ass like this I actually was so hurt I was hurt for Drake when I when I remembered because I sat in the house CJ I was like you know I'm like I you know I guess can't say nothing you know he did win his Grammy for back to back and then I looked and I said no he didn't win his Grammy for back to back in fact he lost to this [ __ ] Kendrick and I actually thought I was like if I was Drake I think like I I might have to go blow something up like that would I would lose my actual mind like I lost my Dis Track Grammy to this and now y gonna get us all the Grammys on my ass why are all these white people even screaming not like us it's not even dick imagine a bunch of white pop culture vultures at the grammy singing along to not like us about you that's about to happen at the Super Bowl this I think days this is so I'm I'm going to bring a little bit of of nuance here don't throw tomatoes at me please I I love I love that I love that Kendrick swept I want to start by saying that Drake's downfall is one of my favorite things to witness I want to say that too and I do I do think that it is particularly I don't know how I don't know how to phrase so I'm just going to say it I don't like that like pedophilia sexual violence has been used as a punchline in a in a record something that is like deeply serious um that has just been used as like a a dig and to see that being played in a room full of Hollywood folks who we know are overwhelmingly involved in a lot of that behavior it's like I like it it gindes my gears I'm like I don't like this and I don't like the fact that like so much so many people have sat around Drake and witnessed his his blatant misogyny and sexual violence and all the things for years and have not said anything have co-signed it have co-signed him until Kendrick decides to hop on a record and and say this out loud and now it's just be like people are just yelling a minor all over the the world as something that's like just like a funny haha thing to say in the middle of a rap beef and not like a very serious issue and for me it's just like I have very like intense feelings about that you don't like it I think that has to do with and I think that has to do with Drake's inability to process the critique like I I've said this a couple of times like people don't want to hear it it's like yeah yeah yeah I get it I'm not saying that there's any there's lack Val like validity to the critique of that Kendrick is making or anything but I do think there's validity to the argument that it's not truly about the critique you don't really [ __ ] with this and that's really all it boils down to because hip hop is full of proof that you don't give a [ __ ] about this critique like it's just that simple I'm like I and it's not a historical past thing it's a present day thing Kodak Black and all these [ __ ] is rapist like I'm saying and you don't have a problem with it like like it's just true so it's like I think that's my thing is like it feels a little self-righteous when people pretend it's like truly wrapped up in all the Merit of the critiques that Kendrick are making and it's really that this one the rapie he [ __ ] on you you handled it terribly and now you look lame it's not cool you know what I mean to like you and that has a lot to do with I think why Drake is so upset because from Drake's perspective Drake is a pop you know what I mean in so manys not to say he's a rapper I take that away from him I never do that to him but Drake is pop in a sense he has a massive white audience like for him in the world that he lives in it's insane at the Grammy's an environment that would typically Embrace him like these kinds of people that are there the people who make the machine go with a with a drake kind they Drake didn't just come this way Drake was made Drake was betral Drake Drake was pushed by a machine so it's like how the and that's what that's why like the the lawsuit towards umg is personal like he feels so angry at the machine that made me a machine that is okay with me the machine that is okay with all kind of like me is turning on me and adding weight to like and making it making it more than just you don't [ __ ] with me but that I am a thing I am this thing that's so anti the antithesis a hip hop that y'all need to weed me out but y'all don't want to weed out nobody else like me in in it and I think that's his problem so I always I've said this the whole time I understand why Drake is so mad like I get it and even if I'm not on his side I get being that mad if I'm Drake what else could he do I mean I'd be mad yeah tour in Australia did you see that I was blown away like he out there that tickled me as a creator that Drake is only torn in Australia because I was like he clearly looked at the analy analytics and decided only his Australian fans are acting right and that made me laugh because I know what it's like to piss the off at one particular audience like you you're not getting that content I'm go with these over here Le howp so that [ __ ] made me weak he said you know what only these Australian been streaming right acting right speaking up of me he looked the bot Farms was coming out of Australia he said all right I think at the end of the day the biggest problem that Drake has had is he thought that he was bigger than the machine he thought he was bigger than the machine and I've always seen Drake as a pop star who wore a costume of hip-hop and so you know now the tables are turning and people are finally starting to see him for who he is and you know a petty comment I'll make there is a difference when you have one black parent and one white parent and you know you have the white mother instead of the black mother and you know I think you know from experience usually our artists who are the ones of biracial who are mixed race the ones who usually have the white mother sort of act up that's all I'll say on that um but yes um I have to run brother I'll let everybody be be be free we can write I'll let you have the final word since I kept you all ha for so long well hold on real quick I cam was trying to get something we couldn't hear him cam say what you was gonna say spit oh my bad um yeah essentially the the the the thing about if I was if I was Rick I'm putting myself in his shoes right like from just the moment we're in the retrospective on his career we're talking about the arguably the most successful rapper of all time right like it's not argu not debatable like I saw a yeah like it's not it's not arguably like I saw the layout of all the Billboard hits and all the accolades and the streaming and Dr is the biggest thing rap has ever produced like Bar None and he has been for a long time um and so this is a situation where somebody who has done everything right according to the rules of the industry who has penetrated every Market um intentionally like that's where the culture vulture accusations come from he's he's somber his way into every Market every genre every like every region of the world that listens to popular music and when you do all these things and you accomplish all these things at such a young age um that he's done it all in or by you how else can you end up than thinking that you're invincible and thinking that you're untouchable and after after having a success against Meek after surviving push a te and not seeing any significant uh repercussions for indisputably losing that rat battle too um how could you see this bout with Kendrick as anything different his his key mistake was that he went into this thinking that he was big enough to overcome somebody who is actually of the culture and not looking into it from outside in like I've figured out how y'all move I've figured out how y'all do things I've I've had all the Atlanta rapper collection ABS I am hip-hop but no you're not like no you're not you love hip-hop and you make some good rap music like I agree with all 100% on that one you've made some great rap music you've contributed to the genre and your music will stand the test of time in my opinion some of it but two two the two fatal flaws of the one I just named and the fact that he never grew up that the has has never once made a grown man grown man rap song in the last 10 years I can true and that count it got worse I honestly think wouldn't think his catalog was that childish if it weren't for the most recent albums I honestly think for all the dogs I think her um her loss in like quality wise comparison to for all the dogs is a great album you know what I mean because for all the dogs sucked um but I think if his catalog stop if Drake's catalog stopped after I want to say what's scorpion like what comes after scor I feel like if dr's catalog was just at scorpion we wouldn't talk about him and his his maturity and his music the way that we talk about it now we wouldn't I I would go I I would and because that's there always been one of my critiques of him Drake is Peter Pan um but beyond that of rap is disrespectful Timothy now I can never it he is Peter Pan of rap and I'll just say a couple more things to like hold your heart if that if that hurt I mean I mean it's been said before but Drake is a a character that Aubrey Graham plays and it's the greatest method acting that we've ever seen before and it and there's a point in which he began blurring the lines and began to read believe his own press clippings believe his own hype like you all said believe that he was invincible and predators never suspect that their Day of Reckoning is coming get away with something for so long think about Bill Cosby think about Diddy think about all these other people whose Day of Reckoning has come when it comes you don't expected Jeff Epstein didn't think his day was coming Harvey Weinstein didn't think his day was coming especially for the for the reasons that Olay said that Drake knows that there are other people around him doing the same if not worse and so he's like why is it now me that's the target of all of these things and he's the convenient scapegoat at the moment but he's not free of liability he's done these things we know he's done these things and so at this juncture it's it's really about had he done exactly what Olay said that's what I've been saying since March of last year if he had stepped away did some soul searching grown a little bit and let the public miss him come back maybe a year a year and a half later with music that was reminiscent of Scorpion and the time there before he would have rebounded um like look at Rick Ross like 50 came at Rick Ross and said that you're a correctional officer your whole facade is a lie Rick Ross just kept making the music that people wanted to hear mean at some point he began to outpace 50 and now we're talking about 50 as a as a film and television exact and not as an artist and so and with the same way with Drake though um yeah I mean it's unfortunate I guess if you like Drake but I've always said that he's made the Same album eight times or nine times however many albums he's made and it's just like iteration you like yeah I was I was going to say to to that point you know like Drake in my opinion Drake is good with so far G he's good with Thank Me Later he's good with take care once we get past take care and we get to and I'm not I'm not listen once we get to Nothing Was the Same and if you're reading this it's too late I agree Drake you're reading this there's a there's a moment there where he shifts from making cohesive albums to making playlists andl that is when that's when Drake that's when Drake to me starts to completely like that's when he becomes redundant to me I'm like oh you know like we can just throw a couple Drake tracks on on a random playlist and call it a day because you're not making an album anymore when I first heard him with especially thank me later thank me later for me and take care was like impeccable that's me I was like oh you are going to like you are a hip-hop artist and then it just kind of stopped and he never grew up he never he never he never evolved as an artist he never decided he was going to like Al I see your face but he's like Drake for me was like never someone who just who grew up and and became an actual adult artist and I think that if I'm being completely honest I feel that way about most of ym CB artists most of them have had the same approach to music and it has allowed them a certain level of longevity because they've prioritized pop over hip hop but it has I think it will largely tank their their status as as Legends and icons in in the history books I think history will see them differently than we than we do as people who live through their careers because of how they chose to approach music after a certain amount of time that's all I'm gon say that's all I'm gonna say let the record let the record show let the record show that he called it a playlist let the record show that Drake called his album a playlist from reading this I'm sorry it's too late is is a mixtap br playlist like it's not more life is certainly a playl my hands are up I listen I I have to end this show and that's the only reason I can't fight back I be doing drinks catalog like I am I
