But balistic analysis r the real mp, this reveals the angle from where it came the bullet, but also trajectory, and a lot of sht like can actually even determine someones height and even body posture and firing style when the bullet was shoot. Also, balistics matchs the piewpiwe with the bullet, since every piewpiew leaves a unique imprimation on the bullets when they r coming out of the barrel, generating a piewpiew finger print, so u just gonna get ur hands on 1 piew piew, 2 bullet, pum they rest the case, but if u find 3 angles and footage. Case its rested, dawg\n\nHope that helps😀",

The basic gist is that there is only a miss or hit with the vast majority of grazes being from debris from whatever the bullet actually hit (stone chips, wood splinters etc.). Combine this with the video showing her walking post being shot in the foot? \"It isn't that bad\" was the first thought a terrifying number of people had after seeing it.",

        "text": "@i2dorky I hope you’re able to find some sources of healing and comfort. No one deserves to feel that level of violation and trauma from someone they loved and trusted. The fact that you’re still alive is incredible (as of your reply three days ago which I was relieved to see)!!\n\nAll this is to say, I see you, I hear your story, and you’re not alone. I’m just a stranger, but I’m rooting for you! I hope you have folks irl to share love and support too because you deserve that softness and healing. I don’t even know you and you’ve managed to help me recontextualize my own pains. If your courage to share your story here is any indication, you bring so much light into the world.\n\nIf you’d like to know any parts of my story to help feel less alone, I also slept in the same bed, curled up and faced away from, as my abuser the night he sexually assaulted me. This boundary stomping was the pinnacle of weeks of emotional abuse and shaming me for a mistake. During that same period, the same man threatened to sue me, and he had tax-backers-worth of power compared to me. Not only did he leverage his wealth and the judicial system, he had to violate me too. That was back in 2018.\n\nIt’s taken me years to sift through those layers of pain in order to empathize with myself so that I could start to heal. I know it’ll be a lifelong process, but I wanted to share that your story matters. Thank you for fighting and living, I know how heavy it feels to think death would be better, so I hope this check-in brings you some/any comfort ❤️‍🩹",

In a lot of these public cases I have to admit a level of frustration with these women continuing relationships with these men.   Not logical but when I was young I found it particularly devastating when a couple of girls I liked chose to be with guys that abused them psychologically and physically over me.  And now that I am older happily married it is still hard to understand the abusive relationship dynamics.  So many broken people in the world just linking up and passing down generational trauma bond relationship building.  What could I tell my son (even if he shared that pain with me because I didn't with ANYONE for a decade after it happened) if he thought he was in love with a woman who chose an abuser over him?  Give him a psychology book about it he probably won't read or simply say woman she thinks is so special is just a regular broken human being, would that help?  And worse yet my niece has spent a lot of her adult life in abusive relationships.   But I only found out about them years after.  I feel pretty powerless to make difference beyond raising my boys to men the way I have.  Black women are just the most spectacular people on the face of the earth individually.  We have to do better.",

I studied domestic violence in school and I learned that it truly can happen to anyone, even people that are educated about DV and have the resources to get out. That said, there are warning signs that you can learn about to protect yourself and the people around you. Some include misogynistic beliefs, controlling behaviors or comments (like what you're wearing for example), and isolation from friends/family (most important one- this is the first tactic of a DV perpetrator). I'd highly recommend educating yourself about DV because it's a great tool for prevention",

He lied to police when my neighbors intervened and they believed him - even while I had handprint bruises covering me. My rocking chair, the glider I used to nurse  my baby had a broken back because he'd put it in front of my closet while trying to lock me up. The cops said it wasn't there and that I should be arrested for trying to inflict harm on this \"young, innocent white man.\" They literally told me that. Meanwhile, I was the only person thinking of my daughter and how to keep her safe - because he had thrown her in a dark room, half naked when he attacked me.She was screaming and sobbing and all I could think of was how was I going to protect her from this man when no one else believed me except the lesbian couple next door...",

    "text": "Your testimony is so moving! I really appreciate the way you spoke about carceral feminism as a fellow abolitionist who has experienced DV. I've seen so many abolitionists throw around the term \"carceral feminism\" and they're so dismissive about it, and so often the way they present restorative justice is basically just \"women are responsible for protecting and rehabilitating abusive men,\" and I've also seen a lot of abolitionists (lots of white ppl and lots of men) talk about how \"carceral feminism\" endangers men of color---which it absolutely does--but they never talk about  the safety risks for women of color whether or not we go to the police. And they never talk about how restorative justice requires that the abuser is willing to participate, and what are our options when they are unwilling to participate?\nI want so badly to keep believing in restorative justice and rehabilitation! But I can't bear to see so many women of color being sacrificed, humiliated, and harassed for the sake of the men who hurt us!",

I was in a relationship for 4 years with a guy whose manic depression was only sporadically under control, and one night, he took away my phone and threatened me with a gun when he was extremely drunk. I didn't tell anyone for years afterwards because I was scared that the cops might be called and he might be shut out by our mutual friends. But at the same time, I've felt guilty because people I told later were often judgmental about me not reporting him. Thank you for both sharing your story and presenting such a clear abolitionist argument in cases of domestic violence",

I'm myself not black, but I'm central asian, i'm not sure what its called in english correctly, raised in russia and then moved to europe, where i'm also so used of protecting men of not even my, but even vaguely adjacent asian ethnicities, because I know firsthand how mistreated they will be, because my own father is constantly stopped by police and searched as Muslim terrorist for his mere appearance. so it's just ingrained that no matter what our people do, we have to protect them from the state, because the response will be disproportionate. I honestly don't know what the solution is, especially like in my birth countries like russia, which is a dictatorship and prison abolition is not feasible goal right now.",

I wish you all the best and I'm proud of what kind of a person you've become through all this shit. You're not a victim for sure. I'd say \"Stay strong and shit\" , but even strongest people need to share their stories and especially strong people need support.

It wasn’t until years later that a few of them reached out to apologize once but it broke me that I was the one who was treated so awfully when I was the one getting kicked in the chest or shoved into walls, I never put my hands on him but to this day he calls me the crazy bitch to anyone who will listen..
