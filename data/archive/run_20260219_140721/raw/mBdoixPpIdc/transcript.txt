welcome everyone to our first ever episode of escaping the cave with Carlos Grio I'm a philosophy Professor the director at the midwestern marks Institute and the Secretary of Education for the American Communist party I'm also the author of various books and many many articles and amongst the books you have the Purity fetish and the crisis of Western Marxism from 2023 and why we need American Marxism from 2024 this show is going to be dedicated to covering the areas that I work in as a scholar primarily those being philosophy and geopolitics later in our program we will be joined by our first ever guest hazal Dean the philosopher and political theorist behind the infrared Collective he is also the executive chairman of the American Communist party and the person that developed the viral concept of magga Communism we'll be speaking to him later today but for now I want to say a few things about China and the monkey wrench it threw into the world of artificial intelligence up until 2025 the markets that were tied to AI were extremely profitable because partially they assumed that the billions of dollars in infrastructure that uh were required by some of these companies were going to be a given going forward and so they assumed that the amount of capital that was necessary in order order to have a product like uh the various forms of AI in the market uh was going to stay somehow consistent in addition to that because of that amount of investment required for these products they also assumed that there would always be for the top programs a certain form of uh pay wall as there is for instance for chat uh chat GPT 4 which is approximately around $20 a month this is where deep seek the Chinese startup comes in last month it threw a complete monkey wrench into this whole Arrangement because it provided a service an AI model that was comparable to things like GPT 4 for a fraction of the price of gp4 not only did it take uh approximately 111th of an investment to produce which was you know estimate say around $6 million but it was provided open source that means that anyone has uh the general public has access to the codes the algorithms and the model architecture so that they could then go ahead and either use it freely or innovate upon it or you know modify it in whatever means they see fit now imagine what is going through the heads of these shareholders of Western capitalist AI companies and the investors that have seen this whole terrain of potentially profitable Enterprises literally burn into flames uh in one day thanks to this Chinese AI now let me let me give you a thought experiment for those that are not all that caught up in this AI World which I'll admit I myself am no Tech expert in fact I sometimes refer to myself as a tech caveman what has happened here is very simple let's imagine that my family are Apple farmers in order to produce the batch of apples that we take to the market it takes us around $10 of investment to do so then when I take those apples to the market I end up selling the whole batch somewhere around the 20 to $30 range it's a profitable uh Arrangement one that allows me to have the confidence to continue investing money in it but now let's imagine that a farmer from another town comes in and somehow this farmer was able to develop apples that were as good as mine and as many apples as the ones that I bring to the batch for $1 and to make matters worse Not only was he able to do all of this for just one Buck but he ends up offering it to the nison of the market for free this of course would completely destroy my Enterprise why in the world would anyone pay for my apples let alone what I was charging for them previously when now they can get an Apple that's as good for free in essence this is what deep seek did to the AI markets it completely uh destroyed the foundation for the profitability of these Enterprise we have to ask ourselves how was this able to happen was it some fluke of luck that allowed the Chinese to develop this very Innovative and efficient technology and then be able to give it out for free no I don't think it was just a fluke of luck I think this is one of the many many facts that allow us to realize the you know evident superiority of communist governance we have been told for a very very long time here in the west since at least the 70s when the discourse of neoliberalism uh becomes dominant that if you have any sort of government government interference in markets what are you going to get well you're going to get the stifling of innovation you know from from thinkers like Frederick Hayek and his the road to Surf to the popular criticisms of socialism that come from the elk of people like Milton fredman the assumption is that if you have a government that is over seeing the market and and these different forms of Enterprises to ensure that they end up working for the common good or for social welfare what you're actually going to have is a quite negative result you're going to have the the stifling at best and the regressing at worst of the Innovative Tendencies within Humanity you're going to have a society that is either going to go backwards or completely uh be stationed in the same place it's been at for a very long time it's very interesting that some of these ideas end up developing at the time where the Soviet Union has very clearly beat the United States in the Space Race which I don't know about you guys but I think being able to do what they did in terms of uh space exploration is pretty Innovative to me don't you think that that takes at least a bit of uh Innovative and creative capacities but that's neither here nor there you know China has just blown up this conception that somehow socialism stifles Innovation because it was able to do what the most advanced capitalist countries have been able to do in one of their most advanced technological areas in a much more efficient manner so efficient and so costeffective that they can now literally uh give it out for free what this demonstrates is that China has basically proved through its existence that development and and technological innovation under socialism it's much greater it's much more efficient it's it's much more Universal in the sense that you don't have these you know idiotic intellectual property laws and patents that prevent you from genuinely developing on on something you know how much development could we have had with AI if there was n so many blockages for brilliant people who could have developed on it and improved it and modify it if those blockages didn't exist and why do they exist they exist because the purpose of development is not promoting development itself and technological innovation but acquiring profit and I'm going to block people away from anything that gets in the in the way of me achieving my bottom line why would I give people access to the thing that allows me to derive profits it doesn't make any sense from the standpoint of the logic of capital so what China has effectively demonstrated is that that logic contrary to what we have been told is not the one that is most efficient for uh the development of humanity and and for technological innovation on the contrary it's it's quite a bit of a feather feather on such Innovation if only there was a bearded and and long-haired man in the 19th century that would have told this this at an even more basic level I think we should be embarrassed if we ever bought into this delusion that it's from the interest of accumulating uh bigger and bigger numbers in one's bank account that technological innovation and other forms of development come about that's not true at all in fact when the motive is profit and not Innovation itself you have things like planned obsolescence you know that phenomenon that occurs with all of our phones and technological devices and everything else really where the thing we buy is literally has it built into itself the breaking down of that product within a few years for what just so that we're forced to go to the market and buy another one and therefore spend more and therefore derive more prod profits in addition if the motive behind actions is simply deriving profit what would prevent people from just making money from money from making money from debts or or rents or other forms of speculative Enterprises which don't actually produce anything that's productive don't actually develop anything but just parasitically uh end up making money out of money you know some some of the world's uh greatest religions would just call this Usery it's interesting because here in the US we call this establishing a passive income which is a very neat way of whitewashing what would be a much more accurate phrase which would be parasitic income but you know if the profit motive is the bottom line as it is in capitalism that's why it's called capitalism the whole point is to accumulate Capital don't you think that we'll get to a point where the there wouldn't even be an incentive to develop productive Enterprises if you can make money from money and from other speculative means and isn't this exactly what has happened to capitalist countries leading of course with the us since at least the 7s when we have this great uh crisis U of you know we we'd call it in the Marxist tradition a crisis of over production um where it's you have the the results of the uh the tendency of the rate of profit to fall and it gets to a point where the capitalist class is forced to ask itself how do I reinvest this Capital do I reinvest it uh in productive Enterprise well that's not bringing profit so I have two options either I take my productive Enterprises abroad where I can save money on the by Saving on the cost of production paying workers Pennies on the dollars that's what happened of course you have stuff like NAFTA and and the fleeing of of big companies to Asia South America America Etc the other thing I could do is derive profits from just the speculative uh means from uh stock BuyBacks various forms of stock and and Market manipulations from interest rates which is what the big Banks do from Land speculation uh and from other forms of Enterprises that don't actually produce anything that is helpful for society this is what has been happening in the west uh meanwhile in China where you know the aim of growth is actual growth the actual betterment and Improvement of society the actual uh Improvement of the well-being of its people they don't consider these artificial num numerical increases in you know uh in GDP they don't consider that to be the essence of growth for them the essence of growth is actually developing the real economy and what have we seen at no point in all of human history have we been able to observe the level of development that we've seen from China in just the last 40 years I mean it's completely unprecedented some may say well this is because of capitalism and what happens in China is this counterrevolution in 1978 with the reform and opening up and after that China becomes capitalist I say well if that's capitalism let's do some of that here let's put the Communist Party In Charge let's put the key Industries in the hands of the state to function on behalf of the Communist party and uh for the sake of Public Welfare let's ensure that private Enterprises are overseen by members of the Communist Party to ensure that if there's growth at the level of the company it reflects itself in better living standards for the workers in the company and a positive social effect at large you know let's uh develop National Banks so that we ensure that this form of lending is not parasitic and aimed at just trapping people in debt but that whatever loans are giving out are capable of being paid back and uh given for the sake of promoting productive development and development projects Etc let's have the ability to send the corrupt politicians and banksters and big capitalists to prison or worse at times as a form of punishment for their corruption I think you see where I'm getting at here it isn't capitalism that has allowed China to develop it is precisely because it's not capitalist that it's been able to not only develop but develop quicker than the west and to avoid a lot of the pitfalls of capitalist development that we've seen in the west over the last 40 years please tell me the last time a global crisis such as what we saw in 2008 actually hurt China in fact it was in part China that helped save the world in 2008 because it wasn't hit because it was able to prevent some of the more negative uh effects of that crisis because it had government control and oversight of Industries so when Xi Jinping tells us that China's greatness is a testament to the correctness of Marxist leninist theory of marxist leninist philosophy perhaps we should listen and not just uh sh it away when we really think about it the development that China has brought into the world really makes the heads of the western Elites blow up the success of China is completely undeniable but it can't be attributed in the eyes of the western Elites to communist leadership we can't say no it's China's communist governance that's been able to uh lead this development it must be because China's actually capitalists but then when the people in the western count say okay well if that's capitalism then let's do some of that capitalism let's have these policies that resemble China's capitalist policies what do the Western Elites tell them they tell them no no no Slow Down slow down we can't do that because that's communism in his 1877 article the fixation of belief the brilliant and very Innovative American philos philosopher Charles Sanders Pur the founder of American pragmatism itself wrote quote when an ostrich buries its head in the sand as danger approaches it very likely takes the happiest course it hides the danger and then calmly says there is no danger and if it feels perfectly sure there is none then why should it raise its head to see this is effectively what the Western capitalist Elites have done as they show themselves unable to cope with the objective superiority of socialist and communist governance in China they have no resort but to stick their heads in the sand and pretend that it doesn't exist but danger is approaching them and as time passes many many more deep seeks are going to be coming our way to blow up the invented worlds that they have created with that we conclude the first part of our program make sure to stick around as uh on our next segment we will be having the philosopher and political theorist Hazel Dean from the infrared Collective come to talk to us about the first few weeks of the Trump Administration and the trajectory it seems to be embarking on we'll also be talking a little bit about magga communism why it is still completely misunderstood by large segments of the American left and about the American Communist party which has just embarked on its new recruitment launch stay tuned you're not going to want to miss this friends we live under a dictatorship of capital still which means that in order to keep up the work that we're doing we need financial contributions there's many different ways in which you can help us financially you can become a patreon at patreon.com Wester marks you can buy some of our books which you can find at Midwestern marks.com books you can sign up for my classes and the other classes we offer with our Marxism school which you can see at the Midwest of marks selfie page you can also support my work personally as a writer and everything else that I do through substack at my substack page which is philosophy in crisis in addition if you want to support the American Communist Party financially you can also donate to the party at ac. us if you want to subscribe to the party's Journal which I am the Chief editor of you can do so at red am. acp.com on your social media share it with your friends and family and co-workers and get it out as far and wide as possible we thank you dearly welcome H it's a real pleasure to have you on for our first ever episode of Escaping The Cave thank you so much for having me so Trump has recently restated his commitment to impose 100% tariffs on any of the bricks countries that move towards dollarization so uh trading with other forms of currency than the US dollar do you think we're going to see some sort of trade tariff war in this Trump Administration what do you think are going to be the effects of such actions and what is the importance what is the role of dollar hegemony for the US's geopolitical standing in this age of super imperialism well the simple simple answer to the last question is that it gives the United States the ability to impose sanctions on all of the countries that it has political disagreements and problems with that is the main and primary tool that's obvious but there's also the fact that the dollar hegemony plays a role in the concentration and centralization of Financial Capital which is the ability to actually um issue loans and credit which is very desperately needed for developing countries uh into uh Anglo-Saxon international finance and Wall Street and the city of London so it also gives it a monopoly on credit but uh the fact is is that what Trump is doing is accelerating the consolidation of a separate Global Financial system which bricks I think is the represent since the beginning stages of but just out of sheer practical necessity we're going to see an aggressively um new effort uh to to basically craft a new Financial World Order um and it's going to be a game of you know power politics it's going to be a game of um how should I say a game of chicken in a lot of ways right because you have a kind of game theoretical scenario where the United States is going to do something which is not in the interest of the ruling classes of the various brics countries who would prefer to just kind of keep things comfortable but on the other hand is deeply unpopular with the masses so I also think it introduces a new dimension of class struggle into the equation so whether Trump succeeds or not it's going to be political it's going to be a question of class struggle and leverage are these states going to acques and cave in when it comes to their sovereignty or are they going to put up a fight and sacrifice and throw overboard the immediate short-term interest of their ruling classes so two years have passed since you first developed the concept the meme the theory of magga Communism and somehow there's still many American so-called leftists out there that seem to assume it has anything to do with supporting Donald Trump uh recently when Trump made his comments about Gaza just a week or so ago where he said that the US was basically going to openly colonize and take over Gaza which to be honest it's not that much of a break from what we saw with the Biden Administration this stark contrast that they're trying to create it's not necessarily there it's the continuation of a genocidal policy but it's beyond the point uh when this happened there was leftist all over Twitter saying that the bubble that we had of this Anti-Imperialist Trump presidency had completely popped which of course is is very ridiculous now you and I know that magga communism has absolutely nothing to do with supporting Trump and everything to do with winning over and recognizing the objective character of the Maga workingclass base as a partisan Force the only one in the American political Spectrum why do you think so many people on the left continue to push this this uh baseless narrative that we support Trump do you think it's just ignorance do you think they're bad faith actors do you think it's a mixture of both and you know one of the interesting things that we've already started seeing in the last couple of weeks of this Trump presidency is regular Maga workingclass people saying that Trump betrayed Maga do you think that we're going to be seeing a split between the Maga working class base and Trump oh the the rift is already there and that's what I mean look the people that are leading this effort that you're talking about are bad faith actors they know exactly what we mean by Maga communism they are intentionally attempting to pin Upon Us positions that we have never claimed to have but which superficially if you present us using Trump memes uh appear to be true that we have always supported Trump and my reproach to that is very simple Hassan and all of these left liberals who all of our bad faith actor detractors rely upon for support and that that's their audience basically they were making JD Pawn Dawn memes just recently before that and those were ironic funny memes so we made memes and they made memes that depicted Trump positively but it didn't actually seriously amount to in either case serious you know belief that Trump is a principled Anti-Imperialist rather it's just an acknowledgement of the fact that Trump has inadvertently opened the floodgates in terms of the political phenomena that he represents which represents the heightened acceleration of contradictions within the United States of America and that includes opening up the dimension for the first time since the very beginning of neoliberalism which eradicated this element of partisanship political partisanship and Trump is not anything particularly new when it comes to politics when it comes to his beliefs and principles what is new is the form the form and the platform is new the the new cybernetic form of populism that is hyperarc rete National self-interest as opposed to the neoliberal universalism that had prevailed before so this is what Maga has introduced and it's an open door as far as what the future of that is actually going to mean and the riffs that you're talking about are here primarily in the new conflict of interests that's growing in the tensions between the Silicon Valley wing and the blue collar working class wi that was behind Trump's election and campaign so we're going the the new battleground of politics presupposes Mago there's no going back to neoliberal democracy that's why we no longer emphasize the term MAA communism because it's Superfluous because MAA has already won and we are already in MAA politics everyone is MAA now Democrats liberals leftists rtists whatever everyone including our bad faith detractors now presuppose this new context of Politics the American Communist Party launched around 6 months ago now and it made a tremendous Splash both nationally and internationally as we prepare to embark on our first ever recruitment Drive how would you assess the first six months of the party what would you like to see in the next 6 months and how do you think that the party is going to be able to capitalize on this Rift between the Maga workingclass base and Trump what would you say for instance to the workingclass uh Maga person who is watching this interview right now I would say our party has been characterized by a steady and solid and consistent degree of growth and it's on a steady straight and narrow path and it has had certain bumps along the way and that is inevitable for any organization but the important thing is that we are weathering it we have weathered it and that has proven a degree of resilience in our organization that I don't think is there for others so we are on a steady and consistent path and the important thing is to maintain course regardless of the tide and that's what we have been doing and that's we have succeeded in doing and I think we've accomplished more as a party in the past six month six months than the mainstream leftist organizations have in decades in terms of bringing honor and notoriety positive positively by the way I think you can use the word in a positive sense I'm not sure Fame at least to the word communism and um the attacks that we have gotten we are we expected we knew it wasn't going to Bey EAS um I think that we basically were created to prepare for this moment in American politics that is why we are the front and center of attention for everyone right now on the left because they're basically acquiescing to the fact that they they weren't prepared for this new world we're entering into and we did prepare and we're basically the only game in town now as far as the left wing is concerned my message to the manga working class is that Trump by himself will not save you and it's not because he's extraordinarily bad it's not because he's an extraordinarily evil person it's because without a principle of collective organization an individual can only do so much and the people that surround Trump will dominate his administration regardless of his intentions or what you think about his intentions com H thank you so much for being the Show's first guest thank you all for watching the first episode of escaping the cave with Carlos gito many more to come we'll see you all next time
