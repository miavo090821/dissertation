yeah marxist humanism yo yo what's up buddy is capital a good first book to start reading theory no that was the first book i read though so i'm not going to tell you not to read it right like i just like heard about marxism and i'm like okay i like this this makes sense let's get into it ordered capital started reading it finished it after like a year didn't understand anything until like the back half really i didn't understand well that's not true i i took away parts from the first three chapters but like i didn't take away anything close from capital in my first reading to compared to what i've been taking away from it on my second reading oh epic chungus moment thank you for the stickers every time someone sends me a sticker it's an epic chungus moment what do you think of capital in the 21st century is that a book is capital in the 21st century like a new book are you saying like updating capital to the 21st century [Music] you got me looking into to start looking into the cuban revolution oh hi marcus eddie your thoughts on neo-marxism well okay one sec i'll go off in a sec it's a book oh i haven't read it yeah um i'll check it out though it'd be interesting but like every philosopher if they were updating capital for the 21st century it would look different which is like the thing with neo-marxism right so neo-marxist i'm assuming they're big on like adorno horkheimer all through ser people in the french school who um or yeah generally french philosophers who in the 60s and 70s when marxism was really really in a rut um were writing a lot um about marxism and i've been reading all through sir lately he's he's it's very very very interesting like right like even if you don't agree with all of it it's that kind of stuff that it's gonna be like from now on when you're reading marxism you're going to have although sarah in the back of your head and his comments about marxism in the back of your head or or at least you're going to have that knowledge which is good you know because you can entertain a thought a thought without completely accepting it or you could accept some like some of all through sarah's analyses of the state and of superstructure i think are really really really useful in addition to marx so it's like you know and i'm i'm got nothing against coming up with new names it's just like that's just marxism to me right like all like taking all the the new neo-marxist thinkers and discussing their ideas with other marxists and saying this is what i think they got right this is what i think they got wrong that's marxism and that's what marx intended from the outset so i don't but i mean unless unless they're distinguishing unless they're saying this is what makes us neo-marxist and it's a distinct change between marx's thought and this new form of thought um but i don't know um what is marx's cultural background uh he grew up like not well off right he wasn't like ingles but he was smart um kind of partied hard in college but bounced around um and then met ingles he was like a young what was called the young hegelians who were these big philosophers at the time and marx got kind of sick of them because they were writing about atheism and academic philosophy and mark said look at what's happening with the workers outside during the industrial revolution he's like these workers are being exploited by the capitalists the work of philosophy should be to analyze the system of capitalism and find a way for the workers to create a new society right the point of um the point of philosophy is to change it whatever that quote was so then mark started met ingles angles was like i agree i don't like the young hegelians either here's my sketch of the entire history of the working class in england and marx was like and then they started working together and mark's kind and angles was bankrolling him and working on scientific stuff and talking about dialectics while marx was writing about economics and studying math english specialty was kind of science where marx was math which is cool too so whose alienation theory was better sterner remarks i haven't read sterner but i'll go with marks i'll go with marxist based on the fact that i haven't um read sterner what are your main critiques of anarchism uh you need state power to defend the revolution um what are your opinions on anarcho-capitalism it doesn't make any sense if if you had an ar if you truly had a narco-capitalism if you gave um the capitalists all the power and you just abolished the government the capitalists would exploit the workers to the point where the workers had an uprising um or or the capitalists would just form their own private armies and states and we'd essentially have feudalism slash slavery again um anarcho-capitalism is a ridiculous idea that you're just gonna have perfect market competition and there's gonna be no monopolization of markets uh there's gonna be no the capitalists already have private security firms uh that function as like private militaries um so like you don't think if we abolish the military and just try and have capitalism that the capitalists aren't gonna form their own bodies of armed men to do what they want of course that's gonna happen and that's already happening yes exactly like black water and the silver corp the firm that went over into venezuela with airsoft guns oh thank you for the sticker epic chungus moment is that a picture of jerry rubin behind you i think it's pink floyd so that's probably roger waters or david gilmore um you have to abolish class to remove their power but you have to seize the state to abolish class thoughts on the comrade sonic gay video which one i love comrade sinique um i don't think it's the nikkei i think it's sneak um and yeah man also are there paramilitaries in yemen i mean that makes perfect sense but um bestie i love you but isn't that cap a bit tight it probably is let's loosen it one let's see if that feels better kinda come to colorado comrade i am i'm visiting colorado um what's your opinion on what's happening in peru oh with the really close election yeah i need to make a video about it i don't know why i haven't been doing as many tick tock well it's hard for me to stay up to date with tic toc because i've been using the app last but i need to do a full video on peru the election was super super close between castillo and the right winger so so yeah do you have any recommendation for reading leftist theory or leftist history first history history is more important um i always always always always and and i kind of studied history of politics and stuff first but i mean you can also read bad histories right like you can read histories written by liberals and stuff that really won't teach you anything they'll they'll mostly just focus on the psychology the the how the people and wealth and power acted right like when you hear liberal historians talk about world war ii they're like obsessed with how hitler acted like and and these heroes winston churchill fdr uh stalin right rather than looking at the class forces and economic geopolitical forces um so so there are bad ways to learn history but what i do is i always read a history book side by side with a philosophy book so there's one effect that that has after i read the philosophy book i feel like i can fly through the history book because i don't have to take it as slow i don't have to process all the information in my head slowly i can just kind of fly through it when i'm used to philosophy two um all philosophy is you know is trying to look at at phenomena that we observe in the world and in history in the in society and give explanations to it using words and create structures for which we can understand things if you're a structuralist so um so without history there is no philosophy so you gotta read them both what did you study i have a philosophy degree we barely touched on history honestly dang that kind of stinks i have a politics degree and we like we barely touched on philosophy unless it was like my really really good professors um which is like you know we we i i understand why you need specific fields right like in academia you need some people to do geology and you need some people to do biochem and you need some people to do politics because you know like not everybody you know people have their own specific interests and like there's only so much time i could put into politics right like i wouldn't have time to learn biochem at the same time because i have to spend so much of my limited time uh studying politics but that doesn't mean you can't cross over into other fields especially if it's like like i read a ton of philosophy i read a ton of like sociology and anthropological works um and i'm you know in a ton of economics because all those things overlap with what i studied which is politics right i can say uh the u.s government in 2019 a branch of the u.s government and our body the cia over through the bolivian government right and that's the political the political way to look at it i guess a military body of the united states overthrew one um of a country in latin america but until you understand the economics or the philosophy of imperialism and capitalist expansion and capitalist growth then you don't really understand why the united states did that coup in bolivia right you need more than just the political lens you need the economic lens of oh lithium is becoming popular bolivia has all this mineral wealth um which they've been nationalizing and using to reinvest in their people so folks like elon musk want to use the state to get that lithium which is why corporations and banks dump so much money into the state so the state then just acts as a tool for them what i just said is a combination of philosophy history economics and politics right so there's times when you need to combine these fields to make your analysis and um that's why you need to hopefully which is what we've tried to do at midwestern marks surround yourself with people who are still maybe have the same morals and same values as you but who have different areas of expertise when it comes to what they've actually studied like on politics two of the other guys on our editorial board are history carlos is philosophy um thomas reagan's one of our chief editorial counselors is a former nyu philosophy professor and when we have conversations everybody can contribute in a different way because everyone has the same goals of establishing socialism but different backgrounds in what our actual knowledge is okay sorry i went off thoughts on michael parenti read anything about him i've read almost everything by parenting and i've watched almost all of his lectures on youtube at this point to the point where when i find something new by parenti that i haven't seen yet i freak out actually i haven't read parenti's yugoslavia book to kill a nation um it's kind of expensive but it's on my reading list yes michael parente is the best and actually we were talking about whether you should read history or philosophy the first book you should read if you want to get into marxism rather than like you know being a liberal or a social democrat is black shirts and reds because that'll cut through a lot of the anti-communist propaganda that you've been inundated with do you study any striking martial arts any bjj i've done bjj uh bjj and muay thai for like a month before i was good at bjj like when you were when you've been wrestling your whole life and you do brazilian jiu jitsu you crush the white belts right away like because those are people who have never grappled i've grappled my whole life and i know what jiu jitsu is it's just the intricacies that i don't know so like a black belt would whip my butt but like yeah i want to do more jiu-jitsu there's anti-capitalist propaganda too lol yeah that's a good point um actually i don't know if that person meant to say that is a good point but right like the soviet union and and philosophers were never you know they called their own stuff propaganda they were like yeah we publish propaganda because we know for the workers for us socialism is better than capitalism so if the capitalists are publishing propaganda to get people on their side why would we as socialists not also want to prop publish propaganda that doesn't mean it's untrue right you can publish propaganda that's true you can you can publish propaganda that's like a picture of um all the food that the capitalists are throwing away you know like a political cartoon of a capitalist throwing all the food away because we have you know tons of food waste in this system uh next to a picture of the nine million people who starve to death every year right and that that could be considered propaganda if you made a cartoon like that but it'd be true nine million people do starve to death every year while capitalists make insane amounts of money and waste insane amounts of food um because it's not profitable unless you sell it to someone who has enough money the equivalent form of value to buy it from you right food is not produced to feed people food is produced to make money for a capitalist you know you could say that's propaganda that's propaganda that i'm getting on a children's dancing app and saying hey you need to be a socialist because the capitalists are starving people to death it's propaganda it's also true um so yeah that's my opinion on it free palestine yes you bet free palestine all day every day thoughts on the peruvian election yes uh one of the writers on our website sebastian leone is one of like uh he's written a lot of stuff about this that's been really really popular in peru it's all in spanish unfortunately carlos has been trying to translate some of it um but yeah he he's been in favor of castile um i i want i want castillo to win over the right winger we have to radicalize the youth we do comrade brian we really do everyone follow comrade brian so you can be rat lives radicalized are you vegan i went vegan during my philosophy degree when i learned more about communism yeah um i'm not vegan carlos is i'm like a guilty non-vegan but also it's it's hard for me because i have wrestling competitions so when you make a transition to a new diet like obviously you don't know the effects that's going to have on your body so i don't want to go vegan and then go out to wrestle someone and all of a sudden like i haven't been eating taking the right vitamins or eating the right foods and all of a sudden i feel super weak and get dropped on my head so um that's my excuse i guess opinions on castile i hope he wins but obviously it's one of those critical support deals right because he is he is you know not where we would want him to be on social issues but he's going against a right winger who's going to be worse than him on social issues and and castillo has said he will adhere to the democracy what the peruvian people want uh even if it comes to social issues where he disagrees um so yeah i'd rather see a working-class marxist in power opinions on me you're okay is cuban communism a success yes uh where can you work and not feel bad about it i work at a non-profit but i still kind of feel bad about it that's so funny when you just put the clown emoji repeatedly that's so cool that you spend your time sitting in my live commenting the clown emoji that says so much about you as a person and how cool you are and how much time you have to spend doing cool things like sitting in my tick tock life uh hitting clown over and over and over again until i block you i hope you feel really cool about yourself you're a really cool guy ah yes the success of communist cuba yeah i mean cuba's been trapped under an embargo so there's a really good story and there's a whole video on my youtube oh thank you for the stickers calls how do we analyze existing socialist countries right and what perenti says is he's he's spent a lot of time in cuba and uh it was after the revolution and he asked some peasants when he's in the escombrae which is like a rural region he's like oh do you like fidel do you like the revolution they go oh yes yes yes and he's like why do you like the revolution um this is a video on my youtube called how to analyze existing socialism if you want to watch it and and these poor like farmers point they go look at that and they point over to this hospital and he says that hospital was built by the revolution prior to the revolution we had to carry our people miles into the next town anytime they were sick and usually by the time we got them to the hospital they had died the revolution has saved so many people's lives and they say yes we know the paint's peeling off the walls yes when you compare us to the u.s we don't have as much money oh thank you for those diggers sorry i'm trying to mute everyone where are my mods at um so uh he says yeah they say yeah the paint's peeling off the walls but we have hospitals right we have food we have the essentials like we understand we understand we're on in the ocean making sure that cuba doesn't trade with the rest of the world and they're labeling them as a terrorist state the other reason um so so the paint's peeling off the walls but they build hospitals for their people right don't compare cuba this tiny little island country who were run by gangsters and slave plantations um who gave all their money to western multinationals or you know the plantation owners in cuba were in oligarchy who were rich and those were generally the people who fled to miami after the revolution um but yeah don't compare cuba to the us compare cuba to what they had before right compare cuba to what they were under batista that's that's what um why would you compare cuba to the united states when the united states is a country with years of imperialist aggression um who have been profiting off exploitation who after world war ii were the world's largest superpower where cuba was a country run by gangsters and plantation owners who they overthrew in a revolution and built hospitals right you have to compare cuba now to what cuba had before and if you look at cuba during the pandemic they were shipping doctors all around the world jair bolsonaro of brazil called the cuban doctors terrorists because um he's just like the right-wingers in the u.s you know they just treat cuba like this ridiculous comic book evil terrorist state as cuba shipping doctors all around the world so jair bolsonaro kicks all the doctors out of peru i'm sorry out of brazil and then covet hits and jair bolsonaro asked these almost ten thousand cuban doctors to come back because they couldn't take care of all their patients this is at the same time as at the world health organization the western countries are using intellectual property laws to block the global south from importing and manufacturing the vaccine so western pharmaceutical companies like pfizer and johnson and johnson can maximize their profits so the us is blocking human beings in the in countries who they deem too poor to afford the vaccine from getting the vaccine that's going to save their people as the united states has held massive embargoes i mean massive sanction campaigns on venezuela and iran which all the studies show have killed people cause people to die as they're continuing um funding the occupation of palestine and the genocide of the yemeni people the cubans are shipping more doctors around the world exactly as fidel said during the revolution medical scene bombas the u.s ships bombs around the world in cuba we will ship doctors and then the u.s looks at them and says you guys are terrorists right as we hold them under embargo and they ship doctors to countries like jair bolsonaro's brazil who says you're you're you're terrorists right you cuban doctors you're terrorists oh wait there's a global pandemic oh please come back cuban doctors and cuba says yes because we don't care about your ignorance you know we're we have a policy of mutual development and we ship doctors to help our allies not bombs to destroy our economic enemies which you know cuba has sent troops to help fight in revolutionary wars um which you know i support too but uh the idea of shipping bombs you know the idea of shipping doctors where the u.s ships bombs is really cool um and it shows why cuba why cuba has been successful in creating a system that puts people over profit in many ways although they're not perfect and they exist within a system of global capitalism and global finance where the united states is is constantly trying to do regime change and starve their people sorry bro i'm just trying to watch funny videos sorry i could try and be funny [Music] what's your opinion on the french revolution bourgeois revolution [Music] all right y'all i think i'm gonna make a video on the peruvian revolution because that seems what people to be what people want to know about i'm going to make a video on that i'm going to do a podcast with you gopnik and maybe i'll go live again later or maybe i'm going to make a youtube video i don't know i'll put this live on youtube though too midwestern marks everywhere you can find podcasts and youtube and here on tick tackle alright peace thanks everyone y'all are the best
