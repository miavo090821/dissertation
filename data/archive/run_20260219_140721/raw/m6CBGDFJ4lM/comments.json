This leads to frustration amongst both groups. I definitely have heard Black immigrants talk crazy about Black Americans and vice versa.

You'll only find this combo on someone who literally thinks his own cultural back ground is lesser than truly. He's only ever uplifted homophobia claiming it as a Jamaican thing then threatens Meek Mill by saying he will \"beat off to his downfall.\" This is literally edgy white kid trying to clown Jamaica or it's people energy. \n\n Long time watcher of the man due to his ability to influence kids I teach. I can see all the good they see in him, but beyond the usual it just is repetitive and boring him doing his bit for the money bonus I am guessing when he does his Republican bits? Fun fact is that dude was playing dumb on his crime stats argument with that Hasan dude. Met the individual who taught his biostats course at Rutgers randomly. My assessment of this whole situation of his is that his unwillingness to be healthy, when he knows better, prob tied to all this nonsense he has been up to... \n\nI like to clown him like all the other viewers. If you look under his video and see my account saying \"... meanwhile America's two biggest ops sneaking up on him, about to jump him for a heart valve and eye maybe foot or both,\" it's actually factually and statistically correct. 😅 His weight and lifestyle chances are above 50.

As a American-born child of Grenadian immigrants, who grew up in the ultra-Caribbean enclave that is now known as \"Little Caribbean\" in Brooklyn and then later in the African-American \"Mecca\" that is Atlanta I finally feel seen and heard in media! Thank you Olay for hosting this round table, and thank you Foreign for stirring the pot 😂 \n\nThere's a whole essay/blog post I probably could go write about being caught in the cross-hairs of these unique cultures, but it always comes back to what Olay said: there is nowhere in the world that I will go where I will be perceived as anything other than Black. I think there's a beauty to the different flavors of the African diaspora, but the reality that is the fact that we are a diaspora is due to our collective ancestors' shared subjugation under white supremacy; thus it ONLY benefits us to pursue liberation in a shared manner. There are clearly negative perceptions and experiences many of us have faced (once again, authored by white supremacy), and I really hope that discussions like these help us to heal 🖤",

It was very welcome, especially because I'm working on a book that I hope can shed more light on the black diaspora as well as other communities. This came at a time when i had recently had a discussion with my uncle about white people and how i would choose to interpret them in my book. As Antionette sang, \"whiteness is the problem, not white people,\". Another reason I like Olay and friends is because i can study from the way y'all discuss things with each other without invalidating each others experience. Thank you and everyone else for these discussions.",

I had to stop a couple of times to just cry and process it all. \n\nI obviously can't speak for or about the black experience, American, Canadian, Carribean or otherwise. But there's a lot of resemblances to the struggles of Indian diaspora, or at the very least my own. \n\nThat sense of feeling like you aren't welcome even in your own home because you get this kind of tag attached to you, and not being accepted in the new land you go to because of your heritage. Ugh, so much stuff to process. \n\nI often tell people that being an immigrant from India but not belonging to the country we moved to and then finding out the country we came from sees us as pawns to exploit and stereotype as arrogant and rich, it's heartbreaking. \n\nSometimes it feels like we have a homeland but no home, you know?\n\nAnyways, sorry for over sharing. Thank you again for making a great episode. I absolutely need to recommend this to others. Stay awesome.",

    "text": "So im irish american and like. This discussion of black diaspora wars really has me thinking. Because so much of this discussion (\"we think the other one has access to something they dont\" in regards to culture, the hierarchies discussion about haiti that reminds me of the hierarchies in ireland (the way travellers are treated), the legitimate complaints still not being enough when like. Theres bigger fish to fry) is very familiar to discussion between irish americans and irish people... the way colonization and historical white supremacy is working by walking those same paths in spite of the differences between the Irish and black diaspora. The way no one has ever pointed out that i have seen these similarities between these discussions... one more thing white supremacy does to convince us our experiences are so so different from each other and if we could just keep fragmenting and ignoring each other pretty please (cuz it makes it easier to colonize all of us!) man. Man. This conversation is so important.",

I hope this type of dialogue leads to identifying further commonalities amongst the diaspora.  It isn't coming from a book, it was casual conversation amongst people, and it is contained within Black perspectives (not just Black Americans).  And, in my opinion, empathy was shown to the all experiences of Blackness.  Thank you for the lesson.",

    "text": "This is such a fascinating conversation. For context, I’m a first generation South African with Ugandan immigrant parents. My experience mimics first generation Black Americans and immigrants so closely. \n\nA question I’ve had for the longest time was answered in this conversation when the lack of a diverse representation of Black American culture was being discussed. I finally understand the significance of South Africa having 11 official languages (sign language is the 12 unofficial language). \n\nFrom primary school, we are taught there are 11 officially recognised South African cultures and learn about them individually for years. It was incredibly shallow learning when I was that age, yes, and hopefully that’s changed now, but the point was made. \n\nIt’s a mandatory aspect of our public (and private) education system to - at the very least - know them by name. And even that shallow investigation to other cultures I had in school was enough to inform my adult life greatly. \n\nThese cultures are seen and taught to be seen from jump. That’s an incredibly beautiful and powerful thing I took for granted until now.",

So I'm from the island of Dominica (not DR), and in my country along with many other Caribbean countries we consider ourselves West-Indian people right. Obviously, I'm sure y'all know the history as to why. And lately ive noticed a lot of people on social media go by the term \"Caribbean\" vs \"West Indian\". It really baffles me because prior to maybe two years ago I don't think ive ever heard of someone from the Caribbean refer to themselves as \"Caribbean.\" We say \"we're from the Caribbean,\" or \"we're West-Indian.\" Its just a very strange change and ive noticed that it comes from a lot of people who were not born in the Caribbean, but whose parents were born there. Or just random people that have no ties to the Caribbean.",

Marquises story was interesting because I think it highlights discomfort for many surrounding boundaries in proximity to Black Americanness. There’s definitely an idea that it is against the function of the American negro to have boundaries. Which is why people believe that if they are in proximity to us long enough…..that they can become us. A sort of cultural voyeurism if you will. Our cultures interactions are without our consent in most cases.",

Both of my parents are from Guyana but they came over here before I was born, so I was born here. But as you know you don't get citizenship I had to apply for it when I'm 18. It didn't matter tho that I was born here and knew nothing else other than Bahamian culture, I was still \"foreign\" I was bullied for it and all of that is fine an whatever but really impacted me leaving school. I did what I had to do, I was getting good grades, top of the class but I can't reap any of those benefits because I am \"foreign\". I'm able to get into college because I have my permanent residence but that expires at 18 so I applied for my citizenship. Long story short it took me 5 years to finally get accepted and in that time I had to pay the foreign rate at the University which is 2 times the normal rate, I could not travel because I didn't have any documents because I was in limbo, I was not be able to get any sort of job to be able to help out with paying, everything was just insanity for 5 years. I have so much disdain for this country that is just unresolved trauma from the immigration system and I'm working on it as I get older, but truly being an immigrant is one of the worst things in my life story.",

I’ll let others look up the details of the debate, but imagine the Diaspora Wars, but instead of internet commenters it’s a melee of Africana philosophers going at each other for over a decade.\n\nI think African-American I’ll add this: there is no magical, unifying thing that links a people together. We have a shared history, heritage, cultures, language(s), and tradition within this particular nation-state: that is what makes us African-American as it does for all ethnic groups around the world. 400 years of history and people really still scratching their heads about this. The Souls of Black Folk is public domain—you can read it for free and it is as good a primer on African-Americans as any.\n\nAnd Lies My Teacher Told Me is by James W. Loewen.",

I just qualified for a two-year visa to find a job (after killing myself to finish my masters), but the requirements to qualify for a basic work visa and the lack of viable job opportunities in my country makes me seriously scared that I won't find something before the two years are up. And I can't move back to my home country - that's just not an option for me. Even then, the country I immigrated to isn't as strict with foreigners as other countries. I couldn't even imagine being an immigrant in the USA, given how draconian their system is. The border system is broken globally but countries like the USA (and UK) are particularly bad. Can relate to Olay saying she had to be a 'special alien' to even have a chance of securing a visa. There's so much bullshit to go through being an immigrant, and if you're any kind of minority/marginalised person on top of that, it's a whole new level of hell because employers won't even bother with you because you might be too 'difficult' to deal with",

I've always hated seeing the immigrant generation put down Black Americans and saying things like \"they have no culture\" was always wild to me, cause at the end of the day the masses are always going to see us as being black...but the fact that fellow Americans have turned around and started saying that Caribbeans and Africans aren't black is just straight WILD to me. Especially considering how many \n\nI still have a memory of a former friend of mine who once told me that \"Jamaicans didn't experience slavery like Black Americans, they were just butlers\" like with the strongest of conviction to sort of separate my blackness from his own...and it hurt.\n\nI'm just rambling at this point but I feel like we need to have more of these conversations in general because the division amongst the community helps no one.",

To add to the American occupation of Haiti, they literally broke in, forced the parliament to remove the law that said that no White man could walk on the land as owner to open Haiti up to CitiBank and its friends, with american soldiers literally surrounding the parliament house. Then, they broke into our treasury and stole the gold reserves to take back to the US for safekeeping. During that same period America bought out the independence debt from france so for over 2 decades, they were the ones collecting the interest. Sh!t's wild.",
