black Americans are intentionally being fed xenophobia by a by a white America that does not want them to have any power back to Drake not knowing what he is I think he definitely knows what he is he is an opportunist being black in America no matter what until you open your mouth and they hear a different accent or they hear you speaking another language you just black I think like a lot of black Americans since they're like in it it's just like all the negative stuff cuz that's so easy to see right are in shackles like real ones they don't know how to exist outside of patriarchal Society cuz they don't have to we've internalized so much of like we don't have anything to be proud of there's nothing here so we resent those outside who we feel have like a certain like an ethnic Community they can go [Music] to let me do that hello beautiful black people or uh I would usually tell y'all why I've convened you here but we don't truly know but right now we're addressing Delany being the president of Aubrey's Angels she is here to defend Drake okay but here's the thing I'm not actually I'm not gonna defend Drake because let's just start with the the facts Drake lost the rapef he lost it was painful it actually made my stomach hurt it felt like push a te times for because not like us is so good um it's too good like that is an incredible song like he I mean Kendrick did what he needed to do I've been a drake fan for a long time okay you saying loud with since he was on grassy and I wasn't supposed to be watching that show because they had that episode with a girl in her thong out you know what I mean and I exactly and I wasn't to watch that show I loved wheelchair Jimmy and then when I found out he could really rap I was like oh so I really have loved him for a long time but I can't defend him because as a woman you really don't win when you defend [ __ ] ever um but I will say you know I think he tried really hard and I am a drake fan I hope the things about the girls are not true if it comes out that it is true that'll be heartbreaking and I'm going have to do him how our Kelly did how I did R Kelly you know what I mean just stop but yeah I like Drake I was on his side during the battle and what about it oh that was that was powerful you know and listen I'm I've said it before I've said it repeatedly um on the last episode that I'm a drake fan I just have I believe that a lot of about Drake are valid right like so I just intellectually I had no choice but to be in Kendrick's Camp firmly with all of these particular things that doesn't mean like I don't like Drake music or I haven't you know been a F throughout the years child but we can call it thing a thing everybody knows what we said on both episodes um we listen to more Drake than we have Kendrick um the Kendrick songs that I have that I do have in my playlist or the one album that I carry you know they're good um with I love to dance I love to throw ass so when I'm out when I'm around people when I'm whatever I'm dancing to Drake that's that's not an issue but we can still call a thing a thing now Drake okay you just a culture vulture and I'm you know I'm not going to say that I wasn't dancing to your music I'm not going to say that I don't know your lyrics I'm not going to be that's not going to be hypocritic I'm not going to lie um but right here for the sake of you know this um this battle right for whatever reason you know why it is where it is why there's B one for blood Kendrick Kendrick did what he needed to do and that's we can't I say that Drake is a culture vulture is a little crazy to me stop my God Del that man don't set up look at my blood pressure high this man has no not just one I didn't like him when he was rapper I didn't like him when he was a UK drill rapper I didn't like him when he was afro Beach jamaan mul sounds like he can't Dibble and Dabble he can't be a lover of Music Prince reinvented like that Drake does not reinvent [ __ ] sucks them up like [ __ ] cell like let's be real like iing like taking okay sorry that's a Dragon Ball reference by the way oh thank you I I wasn't going to catch [Laughter] that yeah I like to just do a very simple comparative analysis right so when Drake dips into other genres or cultures let's go with house right we have a Renaissance and we have a honestly never mind which should have stay and out of everybody's mind so there's an appreciation that Beyonce can have and still Elevate these other voices and honor and come into a space and know her place within that realm then you Beyonce is 20 writers but yeah go off I agree no oh yeah I forget is never mind what happen did you like wake up and try to get in trouble that's what beyon slander will not be tolerated but I will but I will did not have to cap on I just wanted to finish my point sorry I just wanted to finish my point here we're here we're here we're here so also so when Drake decided to enter honestly never mind yes we love that you want to expand your sound however did you appreciate it truly did you study were you a student there right and so understanding your place when you enter these other cultures is very important you can be someone who witnesses it you can be someone who can participate in it but as an artist did he truly truly embody what house music was did he truly truly embody the culture That Built This thing did he lift up those people who did the thing I don't know so there's a difference on how we talk about appreciation and appropriation I think one appreciates their genre and where they step into very well and the other puts on a very nice costume and speaking of controller in one dance right there's a prime example of that right because originally I think is I think it'sa but popcorn he's going all around the place like with popcorn showing that to everybody or whatever with the sound oh popcorn going to be in the song and then when you drop it no [ __ ] popcorn but now that's your [ __ ] now you on your more life now you doing you see see what I'm saying I get what everybody saying you know I I don't know if this is a safe space for me you know but I'm sorry feel Brave I feel bra bra I brave here what you are sis and you are and you are I think I think I understand the critiques of Drake I will give everybody that I understand the critiques I think that he could do a lot of things better however sure I think he could maybe appreciate the culture a little louder if that would make folks feel better maybe more writing credits maybe a feature here and there maybe not sound like the Apple Jackson sinck um sound like he man I just want to say man like yeah I can't step into that I'm a black American you know what I'm saying so I don't know you know what I mean that's that's you I feel you I'm sorry that happened you should be offended too he's appropriate of black Americans as well yeah but I but here's the thing this is the thing about identity right and black identity especially in America and I know he's from Canada but I would say that there's a similar relationship between whiteness and and black people in Canada and whiteness and people in America I would say that there's a similarity the way that white supremacy functions what I will say is that I know a lot of I know a lot of black people that came into their blackness in college I know a lot of black people who came into whatever it meant for them to be black after college there is it is a struggle from the time you're born to to reclaim whatever type of Blackness you think you can have it is not an easy thing to do and so I think it is funny I think the rap [ __ ] is funny to some to some but I also think [ __ ] are being really dishonest about Blackness and their Journeys and navigating blackness in America I think people are bullshitting and it makes me really really mad because I get it he's light-skinned he got a white Mama but he also has a black father who probably tried to instill whatever type of Blackness he thought he needed like he Drake talks about that in his music about boohoo black American Dad story there stereotypes that he has that he's experienced like I think I think it's more complex that's what I'll say about him and his journey and his identity journey and I think it's more complex for a lot of black people but you don't get a you don't get any claps for saying oh I've struggled with my blackness you don't you don't get anything for that you get you get claps when you've been a real [ __ ] your whole life put you on the payroll he need to put he would get claps if he was honest or he ever in one in any way ever articulated what you just did like that was like that's beautiful right like defense attorney wise that was excellent like that's that's best defense Drake was going to get the problem is that there's no evidence to support that Drake supports but that's not true cuz he talks about it in his music about navigating it I remember that song I probably have every Drake song in my library right like I listen to I've given every Drake project I've listened to I've injected it into my veins so that's I love him [ __ ] so I say that you [Music] like my boyfriend is also a DieHard Drake fan in the background as well come on man CJ man [ __ ] he's hold on hold on he's my boyfriend so he has sense we're in alignment about how Kendrick wased that ass he knows that the Drake allegations are real um but yeah no I I think like I think here's the thing Drake is I'm actually just really coming around to the the position Drake is in a position where he is going to be receiving massive critiques from every camp for different reasons and it's going to slice some ways because there are people who no matter what Drake did or how Drake embodied Blackness how sincere it was or wasn't there are people who were going to disregard him just off the strength that they see they see black as as defined by being American by being black American right like so even if Drake authentically were like he didn't have these issues even if he was here representing the black Canadian experience and all that there would be people um in America diminishing and dismissing his Blackness right so there are people there are some people he's not going to please regardless um then there going to be people who don't have you know they're not interested in and and and not right or wrong but there are going to be people people who don't give a [ __ ] about your navigating yeah yeah oh I'm struggle with my blackness so I'm mixed I'm trying to figure out no one cares a [ __ ] you know what I mean like ah you know so there's going to be that but also there's just the fact that Drake can't convince you without nonsense when all Drake does is wear everybody's culture as a costume like and that's what he does all the time right it's like it's not even just like it's not like it's one black experience it's not like we're just saying oh he cosplays like the black American identity but all of them you know what I mean like every every time he jumps he finds him he meets him a different other black person you wearing their [ __ ] you're like assuming and adopting their own [ __ ] you can't like take other people's like recognized or fully realized image of themselves they're fully realized image of their black of what they represent you can't take it and wear it and then also want me to sympathize with your struggle to like find your way on your whatever marus okay and yeah and if we want to just kind of think around I think about my students who kind of struggle with their identity a little bit and like giving them a positive racial identity development kind of scale right I don't think that Drake has a positive racial identity component to him because he does the wo is me I'm in between this world and this world now the Association of where you think your Blackness should be or associating with like struggle that's a little asinine in terms of like what we're expecting out of him in reality I might compare him no I wouldn't even compare him to a Jack and Jill black because they still know they're black they just know they have some class right and so I think like the association with the culture and the idea of feeling to need to prove your Blackness I think developmentally a lot of young people have struggled with this because they're just like well I don't like the things that we are typically fed as messaging around the things are correlated with Blackness like I'm a kid who grew up in the hood but I'm not Hood right and so I'm just like I think there's a people don't question my blackness depending on how I speak depending on my career space depending on my title there's no question of that but the kids who are said to be like Oreos or the kids to say like you're not black enough there is for young people it's not necessarily and we look at as like oh you're being bully and da da but there's actually a sense of like I don't actually see Community with you which is why I'm questioning like who you are so is there a space where Drake may be either in a space where he may accidentally other himself by trying to be a part of something so much without recognizing like what are your individual values right like my family down south in Charleston they're very different on how they present in their Blackness versus my family up here in the Northeast and Philly and Reading PA very different types of people and so I'm like culturally we still see each other and all of us can just use those synonymous here's your head but thinking around the community that Drake has actually been in I don't think that he is reflective of black community in the ways in which like we're ready everybody's readily able to accept him in that way now he has power and proximity right and so I think that's what people are attach themselves to forer but I think if I'm thinking around like the development of people and how we looking at like a positive racial identity I don't think that he necessarily has the commitment to being around black people and being himself fully so once Drake is able to find who he is in his foundational self and does not associate that with the idea of Blackness versus just simply being then that will be a different conversation but Drake has not presented that piece just yet yeah so I'll say um like we said on the past episodes for me I just kind of view it like it it's not that Drake hasn't been even if he hasn't been accepted into the black community because when he came out immediately black Americans black everybody has accept him everybody's accepted him we played his music um there was no questioning at that time we just vibed and I think more so uh so it's up to it's Drake who is I guess we're trying to find an excuse for Drake in my opinion like okay he doesn't fit in here he doesn't fit in there but where has that ever been we just started having that conversation I feel like more as a whole with this recent um with the recent art um um beef that's happening between him and Kendrick but this may have been on people's minds but everybody in the black Community has accepted them in rap and in in clothing culture and sports and all of that stuff so um I think like when we look at we we brought up um Jay Cole Nobody questions his Blackness he presents is that he's biracial and he presents is that he just if he said black he's black people accept it and that's just what it is so um I feel like for Drake he can jump into the black community and he's accepted just fine he can jump it to the White Community they accept him just fine um I just think that it's him not knowing who he is to me it's like you're black you're biracial so not but why do you got to go here and adopt the um Atlanta uh accent why do you got to go here and and adopt the um um uh you know Caribbean accent why why is that if you black when I listen I think when I listen to all talk I think what I really realize is I think the larger thing when I zoom out that we all have to probably recognize and name it is that Blackness is always being litigated by black people like our Blackness like walk not just being black but Blackness what it means to like be a black person how we should in community is always being litigated that's why we have [ __ ] that's why we call people this that's why it's this that's why there's names there's this like how we recognize people Blackness is always being litigated in some way right right that's why I said like and I think we have to accept that and I think a Drake has to accept that like everybody has to accept that there are people like I'm black I'm but there I'm unequivocally black am African and Caribbean and they're going to be black people like segments of of black populations or black Americans who decide that my that that meanss my blackness is up for litigation whether or not I'm black to them or whether you count people have that there always those conversations going on depending on if you were Clarence Thomas you do something on the right or whatever have you you your Blackness scale slide so low you become the worst like you know what I mean you're a [ __ ] you're a this so I I think there is some semblance of Drake was always going to there's nothing that he could do where his Blackness isn't going to be called into question or are going to be like analyzed or assessed like that like let's be honest right it's not that it's not that j.cole's Blackness isn't L isn't litigated it's that he's passing you know what I mean like he's passing the test like the the the the test you need to do to be in the good graces of how black people perceive you and your Blackness and what you're doing it's just about whether or not you're passing the test just isn't passing the test that's all I'm not saying that it's I'm not saying because I'm failing him I'm saying the obviously the consens no I mean obviously the consensus is the consensus three diss tracks C like saying that he's failing are in the Billboard top top 10 right now like so I'm pretty conf confident he's pinpointing they were pinpointing weaknesses in him like you know and just like okay if you black pick pick pick a black because black is not a monolith you can be biracial you can identify as black but you're jumping from here to here I think the consensus is Drake does not know who he is and um you know um our uh the last panel we were discussing like at his big age but like you were saying Delany like it's always we're learning we're trying to figure out we're trying to you know step into our Blackness you know and I I know this to be true because for me you know I'm American Born but I'm Haitian and where I'm from every it's just the island South Florida is literally just the island so you know moving away from that space and people looking at me like so are you black and I'm like yeah I'm black but they're like well you're not American or whatever so I never identified as being American because black Americans never were they never allowed Us in from where I'm from you was just Haitian you just Caribbean and that's it that's it I got what I wanted in for got what he wanted damn it I was gonna say when he was earlier twiddling his hands like this I was like this is the conversation forign wanted to have that I told not have us into it and no I do understand that but you got to pick you know for me I pick I'm Haitian when people ask me what I am I'm Haan and that's that's it that's fine because black is not like when I say black is not ours I mean the black is bestowed upon us by our colonizers but we didn't call ourselves black I mean even whiteness of course we've said this before like there's literally you're Irish no you're German like no you're you're not so yeah you are Haitian like there's all kind of different things but back to Drake not knowing what he is I think he definitely knows what he is he is an opportunist he understands that there is there is he going for it there is money on being ambiguous is money in being able to be um ditto and and figure out okay I want to be flicking you right I want to be yeah I went you know I'm a man of many trads so yeah man is Diddy like sorry ditto no Diddy um but man would literally turn around and just suck up whatever he want to do and it gives him an extension on his 15 minutes of fame um quite frankly he's OB fiscated a lot of arcs that probably could have been a lot more popular had they not been under his Helm and the thing is he extends his talent talent and quotations by leeching sucking up all kind of different [ __ ] who actually are very Talent not saying that Drake is in talent because he's an excellent songwriter he's made songs that I've listened to and everything that I'm a fan of some Drake songs I'm not a fan of Drake however the man if you listen to take my favorite Drake album A lot of that was made by the weekend like let's be real when we looking when we listen to the songs when we look at the songw writing credits but the weekend able test God rest that part of him because he was hungry and he was trying to get on and he gave him all kind of songs to give him that error that he claims to be is one of his most crucial errors however that's weekend [ __ ] and he bit that [ __ ] we could go and do the same thing for the Atlanta sound that he was able to go and take capitalization over I remember when he was listening to UK drill and he was listening to skepta and all of a sudden you hear him with gigs and he right here talking about thingss and M them and then he trying to go and say oh no gas light the [ __ ] out of me and tell me oh no I'm not saying Caribbean things we say that in Toronto that's toron and slang I would slap you with my M hand if you think that I think that what you saying is tontonan slang you from scar borrow and use a rich [ __ ] from scar BR don't [ __ ] play with me I got time right now and I got a lot of energy Zooms for me yeah whatever you and the [ __ ] hold on even worse the [ __ ] jump all the way back to the Caribbean thing and he just jump popping from flicking um UK to to to to the Caribbean to to to all kind of other [ __ ] and guess what Y is just let [ __ ] get away with it because he son he just doing it and he must look good or he able to go and do it in a way that is posable for a general audience and that's the problem yall need Messengers yall can't listen to The Source y all yall can't drink the concentrated yall don't want to listen to a popcorn you all don't want to listen to her Vibes or this and that you all want to listen to someone that could speak it in a affectation in a particular delivery that you all feel comfortable with or look like some lips and some continents that you all feel con like comfortable looking OD and it's because it doesn't and it's because it doesn't matter to to people right like like oh I [ __ ] hate you forign for this this conversation right we're now because it doesn't matter to people right it's the same way even when people talk about him being a culture vulture they Lev these charges they talk strictly on black American stuff when he is actively walking around in like Caribbean [ __ ] C PL all the [ __ ] time like he's had multiple projects completely like ripping [ __ ] and the reason is is like nobody cares it's the same way like whenever I say like like a a show comes out they could never there are millions of Jamaicans like forget the fact that people don't even consider the RASS of the Caribbean they don't even think about the Bahamas bahamians Bahamas territory of American they call us Jamaican in the comments and when I like be like no I'm beham it like I find it offensive nobody even gives a [ __ ] like why I think that's offensive that you don't even give a [ __ ] to C get what island from correct right like nobody even considers the rest of the Caribbean but they so everybody's just Jamaica to the to like in the Caribbean everybody else but then even that they can't be bothered to get a real Jamaican to play a Jamaican all these Jamaicans millions in Jamaicans in everybody yard Jamaicans are everywhere on the globe can nobody find they can't even do a real J and when you say something they be like I don't you know what I mean they never think about like how little representation like Caribbean people actually have like of our Nations like what bamian do you know anywhere or whatever so when like Drake comes out and suddenly want to take bamian dialect like he did in that in one of his most recent projects I didn't even know that I'm seething I'm seeing I didn't know but but hold on that's the reason why like like [ __ ] is like really because now you're talking about like even something that like we talk about not you can't point to to Caribbean representation at all you're really right like if you look at anything that's what like Tariq is making the show because basically we went over that we looked at all of the different Caribbean representation we look at Lil Jacob GTA we look at sharktail what the [ __ ] is that there's so many different opportunities where you can make fully fleshed out um 3D representations of culture and especially when it's a small place like the Bahamas where both both me and Ali are from you have even more of a risk of flattening it and a lot of the time that's what they end up doing and nobody like know like what people don't realize right like especially when it comes that I'm speaking for being Bahamian right and like specific like the Bahamas is a collection of 700 islands and keys right that's important cuz people don't realize that they think we have one island named Bahamas and they they insist on Lower casing the tea in the Bahamas and I keep saying it's Capital every time right like there's a bunch of islands but we me and forign are from Nassau that's the capital that is 21 by seven miles long that is the size of the island we are from we are from a DOT on the [ __ ] map and everybody has heard about the Bahamas but nobody has heard about bahamians like they have never people have think about that they have never heard of bamian people that's why they can't get it right they call us Bohemian all the time they've never even heard of us as a people so no one knows [ __ ] about our culture so you're like even if someone takes our whole [ __ ] they take they could go to the obas right now take our whole dialect you would have no idea you wouldn't know that's bamian dialect you heard that they took especially when all Caribbean countries and our dialects are all flattened to like it's whatever it's just one mockup they do as like the Jamaican to be everybody and it ain't nobody it ain't even the Jamaicans it's not a fair IR representation to anybody right but like what you going to say cuz you you say something and everybody's like yeah so how I hear it it's funny cuz um I remember when future first came out he came out love future mean it now I love me some future don't get it don't get it twisted right but when he first came out he rocked the Haitian flag everywhere all the time so he let the uh conversations always be y'all know future of Zo right zo is um another word for Haitian so y'all know future is old right y'all know future is old and we just went with it because we didn't know nothing else but we knew he was rapper and a Haitian rapper at that um and then he just stopped wearing it never answered questions about Haitian nothing he would just be rocking they be like so you Haitian and he just be like yeah [ __ ] with his zo finally he want after all of this success so he been stopped wearing the flag all kinds of stuff he stated he was like you know I just you know I I grew up with some those and that that was about it and I feel like you know with the representation if we allow people who are not from the culture to represent it and then just drop it or what no kind of of history no kind of nothing it would have been helpful you know to um bring you know some light to Haitian culture or whatever the case may be because we know how Haitians are viewed especially how they're discussed how America defines Haiti as the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere When anybody thinks about Haiti that's ex that's how they title it when any journalists are talking about it that's what they talk about it's the whole like let point to say this like the Caribbean I grew up specifically like I can't even get to America's like specific V all and like towards Haiti before I address it at home because the Caribbean like the entire black world has been like poisoned against Haiti like intentionally and I've tweeted and talked about this before right because that's that's who did the revolution right like so there's there's an invested interest an invested interest they have in making us look down on Haitians because if you look down on Haitians you will look down on haian hades's contributions which is Revolution you know what I mean to America all over the world like are incred like for beans in general are incredibly xenophobic right like all these places like every like I said places have their own cultures and problems and if you don't know about the place you don't know the thing right but the bahas is very xenophobic so like let me put it to you like this I'm born and raised in the Bas my mommy side or the family is B I've never been I'm I'm half Nigerian my daddy's Nigerian but I've never been to Nigeria I've never stepped foot on the continent of Africa bamans don't give a [ __ ] about none of that that name is African that name is foreign and they have a problem that you experience the xenophobia is crazy and and that can and that pales in comparison to the way payment in general discuss and think of Haitians it's actually really some sick sick [ __ ] right like so that like this level of like you know anti-blackness and also like division like this like lack of like that that's that's colonization like that's white supremacy that white supremacy and colonizations AFF in all of our Nations right to like turn us and poison us against other black populations and other black people and to not know when to look down right that's that is like yes America nuts but boy is the Bahamas nuts on on and the thing is like what people miss out a lot on especially ha it's like when we talking about this off stream Hispanola the the landm that Haiti is on was the richest colony in the peak that's why they Peak I'm talking sugar cane no one made more money in Haiti and they were stripped of his resources and L is absolutely right Haiti serves as an a and a more of a deterrent it's almost like capital punishment of Blackness I call like basically they hang him they hang Haiti in the town square of society and say this is what happens when you Revolt when you revolt against your Masters and not just not just we talk about um France doing this but people forget what America did da the American occupation some would even argue is just as heinous if not more than um the French occupation and all of the global community collaborated in [ __ ] Haiti I talk in rounds on Haiti just constantly raw dog in Haiti and still to this I mean was paying reparations for years paying reparations to France to your colonizers after you free yourself yeah this type of [ __ ] and and Haiti I think is one of the biggest one of the biggest represent representations of Blackness and we all are afraid of it just like obia like obia like they they want to flat is voodoo but obia people scared of it bamian scared of it black people here scared of it when it's more of a black religion than Christianity is yeah yeah it's the same thing with Europe like in in in in Nigeria like it's the it's the it's the same way right like H it the the one thing I'm going to say before I tell y'all something that happened 22 minutes ago that y'all are all going to be really want want to talk about and get out of the diaspora stuff the diaspora I really I really try to stay away from it in its entirety especially because I diaspora Wars in is is white supremacy that is that is that is fed To Us by white supremacy that is white supremacy and very often to a lot of who I receive it from online a lot of these people are Blackfish and if you go check that accounts a lot of these people I'm not there a lot of black people buying into that foolishness buying into this white supremacy buying into this American exceptionalism buying all into all these like things that are intentionally meant to divide and the divide and disempower the black community right because all these other white communities in The Immigrant communities for a reason there's a reason they decided to recognize the Polish and the Irish and all these people as white and embrace those communities because that's what creates power and Le all of that D so there's a reason why they want black people to be against other black people to be against immigrants to be against migrants there's a reason why they they intentionally keep us uninformed about like our shared history because I slavery again is is slavery is not unique to America all right there was slavery in the Caribbean there's the slaves literally came from Africa so I don't from both sides and I try not to get into that because I don't I Blackness should not be defined by what our oppressors do to us it should not be defined by enslavement or what makes us black or anything our shared plight but it is important to know that but all those things are a result of [ __ ] white supremacy so I just try to stay away from it because it can be it can be upsetting and when you when you see that when you receive that that sense of like division or somehow in your Blackness called into question or make you like you feel like you feel your Blackness is being litigated or you're not being received by other black people whatever you can lash out and a way that is the same white supremacy and you know what I like you know what I mean you're mad that it's coming at you and so you view it back and so I just try to like keep those frustrations like make sure I intellect like I talk my way out of that that foolish and and and to before you get to your next one um you know the point that you're going into but I just want to talk about like how that's why I think it's very important about people who you know we don't want people who are not from these cultures representing it like you can you were saying U Maris you can appreciate it but don't appropriate it because um it gives to me the same Vibes right and then now you're responsible for how Americans see this particular culture or whatever and to me it can be um a negative or or even a positive depending on how you do it but even for Haiti Haiti has assisted um the world not only were they the first black uh country to free themselves um in the world like we ain't even talking about like I I said before not on this side of the world not on this the world and they want to make it us an example they would constantly do that even our rice culture our rice farming uh uh former President Bill Clinton this this is documented he said we messed up when we went over there and took that from y'all and I hate that we did that we don't brought it to other places in the world and we took that from Haiti and affected them Gravely uh him saying that it's out there he admitted it to he admitted to it and didn't do and nothing has happened um since and um also the Caribbean so many islands in the Caribbean have housed in a Ed a lot of uh European countries who were seeking Asylum all those things we have we're responsible for them having spaces uh in places of safety so the way that they try to um you know do Haiti even to this day there's an area with Germans um that are active in Haiti still to this day uh and but what they try to do and how they try to be out here and say that Haiti is just a [ __ ] whole country just the the people are responsible for where they are now that's not that's not the truth and it is um Haitian Heritage her Haitian Heritage Month you know so and being a Haitian you know shout out to my zo uh and um May 18th is Haitian Flag Day and you know there's no love stronger than between a Haitian and their flag so shouts out to the Haitians okay no I I real quick um I appreciated the points as well as we think around like overall and like just to bring it as a full circle moment I think that's the importance of thinking around Drake thinking around music thinking around pop culture and our engag with like sub I don't call them subcultures but other cultures within the black community overall is because like I think Chima I don't talk about her a lot but for her she talked around the danger of the single narrative and so like when we really do think around the ability especially as specifically I think around just as a black American like there are very particular stereotypes that we go through and I'm like we don't want to do the same thing that they did to us with minstral C because that flattens our ability to humanize each other that flattens the ability for us to actually engage with each other and actually complicate each other's stories a little bit more and so as we are looking like I even got to sit here and learn even some more stuff right but even for that I always caution whether students colleagues anybody I work with within the education sphere around like hey we all show up differently and our cultures May interact in a very different way from each other and so yeah you may like this very sanitized version of this thing but are you willing to sit with like a much more nuanced story and so I always try to I was an English teacher so I'm like I taught like non-western literature for my high school course and so I'm just like how are we going in as like having cultural humility As Americans looking into other cultures and then how do we experience like a curiosity standpoint so even for those who are listening think around how can I become more curious about having an intro so maybe Drake is like their 000000 course right or 00001 course and now what do I need to learn more about this and I don't think that particularly he activates an audience to go do more research or go learn to appreciate and understand and sit with things a little bit more and so if I'm thinking around the intersection of as we talk about Drake but pop culture overall an actual understanding of cultural development and like history and appreciation I think that's a just an important conversation that I was thinking about as everybody talked overall together and I want to add real quick especially um a defense actually for Black America um in in a very app revealing upset um you know what I mean CU I think that we often what one of the big grievances that I see a lot from Black Americans inside my um comment section and not only that but just in my everyday life is uh the fact that we who immigrate um to the United States of some some depending on how torturous the The Voyage has been um are typically folks of means folks of people who can who are able to immigrate because it is a luxury in some cases to immigrate I mean of course like you do have your Haitians that are trying to literally um like risking um like the sea trying to to anywhere because like they they don't find their home absolutely um habitable in that case however in most cases like a lot of different cases like I shoot a lot of people actually immigrate via plane like Caribbean people into the United States and then one of the biggest grievances um is that they when I say they say black Americans will then see us without the baggage of the unique subjugation that is white people or being shoulder-to-shoulder with your colonizers as a black people um and having white people around you and having to deal with the everyday operations of having your pressures nearby and having to sublimate in a Petri dish of Oppression whereas I from the Bahamas we got black lawyers we had black prime ministers and Premier for the for the majority of my lifetime I had the ability to Aspire to anything I didn't have the baggage necessarily of seeing someone look at me like I was inhuman but when I got to wait is it they say you didn't go to Blair wood I know you got some bars for this but but I do want I want to give some empathy towards um Americans that feel like we are able when I say we I mean black immigrants are able to come to the United States with their Wireless dreams and take advantage of things that they don't feel as though they can take advantage here's the thing and so and I guess let me speak to this because I'm I'm 30 but I moved to America by myself when I was 14 like my family still lives in the Bahamas and I'm going to be 3 31 next month so I spent now the majority of my life in America and I my and I my life my entire life my life my career my everything is to black people in America with the experiences of black people in America and here's something that I see a lot and I see it a lot because people say it to me a lot I I get in my messages is this thing people saying oh because we're immigrants we get to jump in and out of our Blackness or something people somehow make our cultural differences the fact that we are from a different country and we have a different cultural background to have anything to do with our Blackness I am black as [ __ ] there is nowhere in the world where I am not black like what makes us and what makes us be perceived as black people by the world what makes us black and what comes along with that I am never not that I'm never able to jump in I'm a black woman in every context nobody like nowhere does me being African or Caribbean make me less black or protected in any way like that is not true and on top of that like the thing is and this is not black Americans fa and this is why I never I understand and I and I understand that everybody across especially in the diaspora Wars things everybody has real experiences that they have had had or negative ones from different groups why they feel the way that they feel I don't think it's all like anchored in nothing right even though I think all those things the experiences that we're all having that are negative from other black people are still brought about intentionally by white supremacy right and like being able to like be here in America since I was 14 I see the real ways in which like the the major disadvantage that black Americans are set up to have that I think is different it is the true privilege I have is as as somebody from a black nation is the fact that I don't come from a nation that says to me it does in different ways it's it's more nuanced I realize as an adult that I'm being fed that [ __ ] we are beham are force fed colonization like [ __ ] you know making the bomb is don't get me started it's it's there but it's more nuanced right like you have to see it on a more class level and this and next thing but it's not as overt it's way it's no way near as overt as America says to you that because you are black you are not this you are not that and you will not be this and you cannot that right there's a way that like I see I recognize the privilege in growing up in a place where all the other black people around me were middle class well to do lawyers whatever have you like it was never I never it was never in my mind like and there's a black excellent strap sorry to cut you up but there a black excellent strap in that yeah right I think that's actually super interesting because it you made me think around the time I actually studied abroad and I went to to check Republic so just a very interesting space in itself but I was in a bar and I was like I cackle outside of here like I'm very I'm a loud person um but somebody came up to me and was just like oh you must not be from America I said huh and they were just like wellever we see black Americans like you're sad it's you're angry about something you are like that's doesn't exist so the idea of me showing joy in a separate country and they said oh so are you like different are you like full black are you actually black Amer so even the question of my black americanness was kind of messing with them it's not the first time it happened right like my school had a big study abroad program and so even like the idea of like me demonstrating what they have not seen outside of global media what they haven't seen outside of the wire because that's the thing right like and that's the thing what like people don't recognize is and they don't realize it because they're not in the countries with our families and see what they consume right our families my family watches all day long nothing but CNN and MSNBC with mainstream Law and Order main they are Fe they are literally sitting in their black nation so they're not even contextualizing like what it means to not be in that black nation like when I got to America it was a [ __ ] like what the [ __ ] is going on why did I know all these white people around me but no one had said that you don't realize it so black black black people in other places are sitting there watching mainstream American White media feed them stuff about black people in America with no like awareness for like how that juxtaposes to their experience of where they are so there's a a lot of [ __ ] [ __ ] that like I will never tell black Americans or suggest that there aren't black immigrants or black people elsewhere who have misconceptions and white supremacist ideas and looking down on black Americans that is that is absolutely so right and that is that's ignorant and I realize again I'm like I from living in this nation and now growing up and you and you learn the things and you go to school and you're like oh this is an incredible amount of setup to fail right like I don't have like the bamian government is not actively set up to try to make sure generations and my people be incarcerated you see what I'm saying like they're not they're not actively that's not a thing we don't like there's there's different levels to this so that is something that I understand and so I've never been interested in like playing into this like how people think they can perceive or look down on black Americans or anything that's nuts I'll never be a part of that what I don't like is being black and being a black IM you know what it is to be not a citizen like let's stop talking like I start talk about as an immigrant or what people think of as immigrants or migrants what it means to not not be a citizen is to not have rights in a place like that's what it means to not be a citizen so imagine you be black and not have rights in a place and to not have rights in a place like America like I've been I I have been here since I was 14 I have this country tells me every day I am not when I say to you I can't even get a phone in this country without paying an international I'm a foreigner like tax right like I can't do [ __ ] like everything y'all see me do every opportunity you see me do in in all the years of people seeing me work in do media understand that I made a [ __ ] dollar because I can't because the US government won't let me I am a lawful I have done it the right way I came here I went to school I've been in American schooling System since I was 14 I am an admitted State State Bar attorney if I don't have a job that like my Vis is and I can't even practice I can't even go help you as an attorney I can't even go I have no rights in this country I can't do [ __ ] every year is a is a gamble of stress and me trying to figure out how to even still be here so it's nuts like on top of that like having people somehow perceive you walking around like what benefit I have that look like you that are supposed to be your your racan like it's this idea like when people say that to me it's like oh you like this privilege dis benefit what am I I literally make sometimes when I think about it when I think about the choices that I have made for my life and how I feel my commitment to to black people and and and what is black people in America and what is lifeare and trying to improve that how that [ __ ] me as an immigrant as somebody who is more who is immigrant in status but I don't spend my time advocating around that and lobbying around that and trying to do something that like benefits me there is like significant so it's just it it just I am always I I have a globalist that I'm for black people I'm not for for black bamans or black Nigerians or black sis head people or black Americans if I'm for black people and I like I try my Endeavor best not to let like my how I feel about like the way people and it's not black it's not black Americans fault it's not black Americans don't know about their immigration system like they don't know they're intentionally force-fed propaganda about the immigration system on purpose like I said it's not it'll never be black Americans fault and so I'm just in community with black people so when you hearing hearing xenophobia and stuff like that that's who you're hearing from and it's easy to mistakingly get caught up especially when people trying to [ __ ] intentionally and a lot of these are white supremacist Bots and [ __ ] and stuff like that trying to in Stoke these diaspora Wars on the timeline and stuff that's intentional because if see that enough and you and you keep feeling like you're being othered and all these different stuff what it makes people do is Retreat into their Corners you know black immigrants go okay well [ __ ] you then because then think about being like immigrant and being told like oh y'all don't try to assimilate or whatever have you or this is and the next thing and then you try to and then it's like [ __ ] you you're not you're not black you're not this you're not supposed to be that I want to hear from you and it's a real thing like people tell me every I like I made this show and people tell me every Sunday that they don't want to hear from me and my Jamaican accent on the [ __ ] show because they they like it so they decided and you know what I mean they decide because in their mind Blackness means black American so if they decided that this is a black Shir that they like that means it's black American it's theirs and somehow I then become the other the alien on my own [ __ ] you know Tariq I curious to what you have to say because you actually been to the Bahamas and like but of course like you what was it like actually being like in a black nation outside of like is there any do you feel like any real um juxtoposition in that like when you just like oh [ __ ] just out here yeah I mean like uh comparatively um I guess I felt like I guess you could say like a little safer in a way like cuz yeah it was just like like you say it was just like [ __ ] was out here like [ __ ] was outside like it was just it was just like it's it's plain it's plain as simple as that um I do think that like to to what you guys were saying uh just from from talking to you forign about uh just in general like there like a lot of Melting Pot that goes that goes into like the the way people like perceive Caribbean culture and like representation it's not like I mean I'm G bring up cartoons because you brought them up already so I I don't have to feel bad about it anymore but um when we talked about uh when we talked about Futurama and we talked about Hermes and like Hermes has like three jokes it's the weed it's Curry and it's limbo and they Loop that that [ __ ] been around since 1999 and they do the same damn three things every which way uh and he's played by Phil Lamar who is absolutely not Caribbean uh what you say you do you say you do J faking face he do with J faking face a couple and like not only that but like Grim from Billy and Mandi too like yeah GRE and like the the Ching at Jamaican to be the Grim Reaper is wild right it's it's a weird Trope that they do across all all TV it's weird to me cuz I you know I told you this for him before but Grim in that cartoon was not supposed to be Jamaican they wanted like a like a British guy but then Greg Eagles was like hey man what if I just did it in like this accent that's not mine and then everybody was like oh [ __ ] that's dope uh and then they got to the second season and they wanted to do an episode where he was like a real person and I guess they realize uh that a Jamaican uh man probably shouldn't be the slave to these two white children uh so he's white when he becomes a human maybe having to make like and like you even think about like [ __ ] like that and then like you look at something like belly you know like Belly the movie and then you realize like the drug kingpin is this Jamaican violent mystical [ __ ] and like it just goes to show like how even like when we do tell our own stories as black people we still see ourselves as like the the ogres or like the people what the [ __ ] is my [ __ ] raining you're you're doing your iPhone Fe man [ __ ] man I can't stand this goddamn thing anyway reaction what I'm saying very serious time and here you go what I'm saying is very serious despite the the the rain that just came up on here um they see us as VI they see us as violent mystical magical Negroes like and like you you have that all around the place like when you look at like um black women in the Caribbean like they depicted as extem extremely like sexually voracious and Adept and freaky as hell like you can't imagine the amount of white tourists talking about they coming over here to these creu ships and they want to indulge in black women the this the the myth of Caribbean black women like TM trademarks like it's some type of flicking you know brand of perfume like I'm talking the way that we even see ourselves is extremely yeah coded in the context of whiteness and when we could free ourselves from this we need to understand where we came from but when we could free ourselves from this and begin to imagine ourselves outside of the lens of whiteness will there be an end a tree to Diaspora Wars I think it's super systemic and everybody all of us here have our own experiences with being black it's hilarious to me sometimes too because being black in America no matter what you got on or what the people until you open your mouth and they hear a different accent or they hear you speaking another language they going just you just black you just black American you're just black and they just have this view about you when I was coming up my I am first generation right both my parents are immigrants and um Mama mostly everybody in my family didn't speak English right you know and so we our first language was Haitian Creo and going to school all of us me and my little Haitian peers because it was mostly a Haitian community that told other Haans to come move to this community it's safe you know come move over here so we went to a school and most of us were placed in um Esau so uh we had to go into these specialized classes because we spoke English but because we had little accents or but because we spoke creol and it's funny because the school itself would take us and to go be interpreters for other patient children but yet put us in these courses as if we we didn't know anything or we had like a a learning curve because we were bilingual and so they made like they they reprimanded us for being bilingual in a way but yet we were helping system um but that's what they did and my dad had to pull us to the side and tell us y'all can't speak y'all can't y'all can't speak Creo at school because they're going to put you guys they tried to attempt to put us all back even though we knew everything they were like no they speak another language and we either got to beat it out of them um you know even though they know the math they know the um uh the the language parts of the the assignments they're answering the questions correctly they keep speaking creol and you minim you had to minimize your culture in order to that's an allegory for everything that we [ __ ] doing right here like I started like my channel talking about Caribbean [ __ ] [ __ ] did not click I'm talking about like they hated turn this [ __ ] down gang like I'm talking all the time but as soon like as I started talking about like black American adjacent stuff like soon as I started talking about Luke Cage because that's a little black American adjacent that's when to start clicking I had to sublimate in every different way shape or form you think I wouldn't want to be talking about Caribbean [ __ ] I want to they say why don't you talk about your own damn country for once I say I want to but yall [ __ ] Ain't G watch if I don't right like so we all have to fit ourselves into the monolith view the the lens of whiteness in order because they don't have enough they don't have enough like color to to see different shades of what the diaspora is oh Delany well I was just gonna say I think one this conversation is super interesting um and I know I'm high yellow I'm really yellow but I'm a black girl from the south um and um I think what it sounds like there's a critique of The Listener there's a there's a critique of the consumer of all of these different of music of culture and all of that and then also I think one piece that hasn't been mentioned is the way that black American culture and blackness in the United States of America is consumed and like it used to be something that was physically consume like they was eating us over here and now it like culturally they just eat it up especially in the biggest export yeah like it is it's so it's so sick it's so disgusting but it I think like there's a way that certain people get to navigate blackness in America there's there is a certain way that folks that are black immigrants do get to navigate within black American culture and also separate themselves from Black American culture when it's beneficial being the good black at work being the being the Foreigner at work there is a way that that folks get to well I feel it go to lie me I ain't gonna lie like sorry I think about people that I went to school with like when I was in high school and when I was in college there was a there was a cultural and social dilemma around what type of black you were but the way that white people separated black people that were Nigerian or black people there was like a a a perceived like intelligence and and like exoticism as well though and that's that's the double edged sword of this [ __ ] and so it was a really really hard thing I think to navigate because black people that were foreigners that were that were immigrants that were specifically black people that were from the continent there was this like you know like we want you here like we like you're black like you really black like you the you you where we where we from and then there's this like other side of it where black American culture because of what you were saying Olay is like nasty like you don't actually want to be a part of it like it's maybe not a good thing for you to be a part of it so I think it's Nuance like I think it's I think it's really difficult especially just like interc communally in America when you're in the belly of the Beast like I think that all like it's so nuanced and complex and hard um to to navigate I think you know I think maybe I be having so like I said I'm behia Nigerian my daddy is Nigerian so that's his own different kind of Blackness and my daddy's Nigerian Blackness looks down on my mama's Bohemian Blackness right so I I've always been surrounded by different kinds of Blackness and I've always been I've always never been perceived accurately by the society around me like in the Bahamas when I was growing up in bomas to them I was a foreign I'm I'm a Nigerian I've never been nothing about me Nigerian to in in application right I'm born and raised in Bahamas but to behem I was Nigerian and when I get here now especially when you add the public figure to it I'm never anything that I actually am right in fact like um and so I guess the the the thing that I I I struggle with is there is no like there is no opting in or or opting out for for me right like I it just that that that isn't my my my life experience and being an immigrant has honestly especially to one I I try to make sure we don't like I don't miss and mistake I guess the thing that I really need to say going back to like the the perceive like how black different Blackness judges Blackness and how Blackness operates right I've always been surrounded by black people where and the majority of black people are not consciously together it's not like the average black person is super Progressive and pro black and we their politics and consci black people are conservative as [ __ ] across listen to me globally black people have this issue and this struggle and stuff with their Blackness across the board this is the problem that I have black Americans right here in this country I know a [ __ ] ton of black Americans that don't feel half as much care about black people or Community or what's going on or whatever that I as a black immigrant you know what who does right but that doesn't get you that doesn't get painted as though all of Black Americans are like that doesn't become the reflection for black Americans what I don't like is people dismiss and disregard and completely just completely eras all of the black immigrants that run contrary to this narrative that we want to have that black immigrants don't care about their Blackness or don't care or don't see themselves as in community with black Americans there are there are so many so many non-american like black people or black people that were have Caribbean or African roots that contradict that and they are dismissed but then people will bring up their like whatever like anecdotes or whatever individuals so like they'll they'll they'll bring up an em manual ATO or whatever and ignore whose parents are sagales or whatever you know what I mean ignore who is like they ignore they pick and choose when they want to when they want to have a celebrity or or it there's a Persona or there's a public figure that is a is is black and they are not American but they can do something that looks good for black Americans people take them people have no I don't see people trying to act like when Sydney poier is called the first black person to win whatever the [ __ ] or do whatever the [ __ ] I do not see Americans trying to give him to us as behemon they're not trying to say he's not a black American but those things don't come up when people want to talk about our cultural impact that's what I'm saying is like it's like people want to be like they're always talking they will be talking to me a black immigrant who like spends my whole life in this [ __ ] and then be telling you that oh we just we just did you know what I mean it's like it has to be like it cannot be that every you just we it you we have to acknowledge that this is a Glo this is a global issue the black the entire world is anti-black everywhere is not a corner of this world that white supremacy has not found its way and gotten its claws in and there is no black population no black group where there aren't black people like this there are black Americans every day there are the there you could watch a speech right [ __ ] now from Clarence Thomas telling you the day he decided to op out and care about the individual right you there are black Americans that do that and are that we watch nothing but figureheads of black Americans that are right and they don't become Candace Owens does not become who we say is representative of what the black Americans Consciousness is or their commitment to Blackness that's what I hate it's like we can't just dismiss the rest of like all the black non-americans that are getting it right that are very much so run running contrary to that narrative Maris yeah all right I a lot of things were named here forign you really got what you wanted right yeah this is a show right but I'm thinking about it a lot more um because there's a couple things at play like I think about the consumption of black American culture and how we've kind of just named it as that right but in reality if I really wanted to get a nuances of like the Inception of Hip Hop like I can bring in afro Latinos I can bring in uh the Latino Latinos um who else Jamaicans who have all had a piece of the pie in terms of cultivating hip-hop culture in general right and so I think about it a lot because I'm like I think about where my dad my so my dad's SI he's from Puerto Rico from they're from paas um but I know I don't outwardly claim being AFR Latino because I grew up for a black American for all ensal purposes I don't speak Spanish I don't do any of that like um they everybody knows I said I'll get you a couple sentences but my well my well hates it she's just like Mars can you speak back to me I said I listen you see just a little bit but it's actually interesting because when I when I grew up my hair like they were like but you're not like black black are you right and I said ah don't do that and so even hearing it from like other black Americans but I think something that I think is a little bit more more difficult especially if I'm thinking about my black American Experience is that and my boy talk me and my boy talk about it a lot he's like black Americans just don't have like a unifying flag or a unifying thing that are is all here I think a lot of it is like we don't look at the fact that black Americans are very Regional in our different cultures like I I a't know [ __ ] about Florida blacks Floridian black people I don't know nothing about Houston black people New Orleans has its own subset of culture and so we actually don't look at the black americ Amer experience in terms of regionality in a way that we may look at other continents other countries that have their separate regions and subsets that happen here and so as we're thinking around black American overall it doesn't help that America's already hyper racialized right and so the idea of black is also synonymous not only with e ethnic background but also a racial background as well and racial experience for black Americans and so like I think we kind of muddle these two things together which is why I'm just like yeah when I walk outside we're all black but when I go home I'm eating the turkey neck I got my black black eyed PE on New Year's but that's not the same experience from my one boy from domican Republic who's going it should be respected right and it should so yeah so I think like that outside frustration that we're all experiencing as like let's pick and choose who we want as our black representation and who represents Black America I think as we get into it there's a lot of like personal hurt that gets into it versus where like Olay where you're speaking is actually like here's the political alignment a lot of us could be having here's the things that actually prove that I am very Pro black on a pan-african space right and I don't think a lot of us are having that kind of conversation and it's interesting because I'm just like you're we're speaking about this kind of idea of Pana africanism as in five days it's Malcolm X's birthday right and so like we're thinking around like his politic and how it kind of reinvigorates around here in the conversations that we're able to have but I am now wondering like yes there's the opportunistic nature and like when we do see black people being representative as a whole if we go back to even like your platform Olay the reason a bunch of [ __ ] want you to talk about some niggga [ __ ] even you foreign like we want you to talk about some niggga [ __ ] is because as a black person who is platforms you are now speaking for every right because there's very few and far between and so I think there's a resentment that can happen on a interpersonal level and Intercultural level but then that idea of like of the American exceptionalism and having Platforms in America the nuances kind of get flattened because we need us to politically all be liberated but inner personally but we're just like but oay how you get there though and that's my and my thing is this right like I feel that and I understand that that's why I feel I feel I cannot express to you what I feel about my love and commitment to black people right that's why my show like I have started I've said it before like it would have been easier for me I have a large ass white audience or whatever I could be doing some white [ __ ] go be on the show on the right running with some right-wing person bringing on white people they want me to talk to and all of that that's not what I do right I created this really black ass show I've brought on I bring on I brought on like 40 different black people I put on o and friends right and like most of them American I am deeply like and I and I feel that black Americans have the right to deeply critique people who exploit their culture or try and wear it right like not for nothing as much as I've been in a Maj America the majority of my life now by the time that I I die by the time I'm an old lady I will have been in my country the country that I'm from for a very little time like it I know so much more about America and than I know about my own my own country right that being said I never mistake myself for being from a place you don't ever see me trying to act you've never seen me claiming no community no this that's my never have y'all seen it ever I have never to be [ __ ] clear you know what I mean I never perpetrate like I think that is because I I recognize a a a a big gap like there's a the the the missing Gap in my brain is the gap that truly exist right so like I understand when people critique like an academic like I have I blew down on academics what academics did with this platform on shyrack and this in the next thing I think that's crazy like we like there's no reason for me to invest my business in a community that I am not from in a way so solely to like salaciously share their [ __ ] and blah blah blah and it's that's nuts that's insane that's very very different than how I see my role like let me go be a public defender let me go represent black people let me go do this let me go speak to the pl to black people it's a it's a different thing so I understand those critiques the problem that I have is when when people make that critique about an academics the way an individual academics moves or how an academics believes or what his relationship is to Black Americans and what he does instead of critiquing in academics they say see black immigrants you know what I mean and they will be saying that to a [ __ ] like me who's like huh I didn't even know that academics was an immigrant where is he from Jamaica yeah oh how long has how long has wow like talk about he talks about speak it up I'm glad that's why I wanted to bring this conversation speaking of academics it happened I was originally going to say it happened now like 40 minutes ago but um academics was just sued for rape and defamation I just seen that I mean he hangs out with what with [ __ ] that do that [ __ ] well I'm not surprised my hand can't even hearing that [ __ ] doing that [ __ ] he's one of them red pill [ __ ] so naturally he would be rapist so whatever whatever they said he did they did that sorry abolition assaulted um by himself uh a woman and two other men in 20 drugged her and then academics raped her that's the accusation yeah what I'm not shocked about it I mean these are the people that are in these spaces and take their whole like they'll act like we see how he acts he acts like he's an Untouchable [ __ ] and that is crazy crazy to me and then the way that he talks about women that's not surprising um he's uh abusive verbally in how he talks about women and comes for them and so I would I would imagine that that carries over into the real world when he's dealing with women so I'm not I'm not shocked at all yeah same that's always been like a like a consistent like talking point when it comes to him is like uh you'll see how aggravated and like Angry he'll get when addressing a woman uh but like you have other like men come up on his show and like tell him he a [ __ ] to his face and then like it won't be the same kind of animosity the same kind of anger uh yeah so I get it I think on the yeah on the last uh oay and friends I was on I feel like I hinted at some of this and [ __ ] was chewing me up in the comments really pissed me off and you know what's crazy it really like that was prime example to me of like just how irritating the internet is because that's how hilarious that you're on fire that whole episode I'm like if they actually they're not even like argu it's so crazy they were mad at Delaney they heard the word patriarchy and lost their [ __ ] mind cracking the funniest joke in clip they're not even aring with her about what the [ __ ] she's talking about in the video it's a clip our episode is about Diddy these [ __ ] are in there like chewing her out on behalf of Joe Biden no they literally are like not only do you not have any idea how politics work but you obviously have a dad like it's very clear I'm like they were they viewed you as a woman who hates men they viewed that I'm like y'all going off of this clip like they went off of that one clip that was on Instagram the you can tell the whole comment section they were like why this chick on here I'm like y'all watch the show y'all don't even mad she said the word patriarchy y'all and I'm about to say it again and I'm about to say it I'm about to say it again because this is this is exactly what I was talking about like this is the way that patriarchy functions allows men like academics to do things like rape like to to use money and power when I think about even the way that patriarchy functions for people that aren't moneyed like the way that they are they're allowed to to navigate sex and and rape and Power in the household it it's nuts and so what I was saying on the last uh the last episode I was on was that I don't put anything past men siset men because patriarchy has allowed you and socialize you to do really horrible violent things and unless you have proven to me this is just my personal thing unless you've proven to me that you've done the work to to undo those things or you're think or at least thinking about them you can't be around me I'm scared of you because it makes sense for me to be it makes sense for me to be a bit frightened about what you could and could do or could not do or who you could be because that's the way that patriarchy functions and I also I think people would just like have such a more free and safe life if they would invest in in studying the way that patriarchy functions for all of us the way that it impacts all of us [ __ ] are in shackles like real ones because they can't they they don't know how to exist outside of uh a patriarchal society because they don't have to like this is this is where we're at um so no academics potentially being a rapist doesn't surprise me I wouldn't be surprised if any siset men was like man was like yeah I'm I did that yeah because that's sex culture that's the way that we have sex it's about coercion it's not about enthusiastic consent that's not sexy nobody wants that it's about the chase little boys are taught so young a girl says no a ha it's so funny like convince her to say yes that's game having game is convincing somebody why do you want to have to convince somebody to [ __ ] you don't you want them to be excited right but that's it no oh that's a bar oh that might be that might be a word we might be we might give you the last word Delany after foreign has tricked us into this conversation that I just want to let people know necessary I said for it I ain't talking nothing near nobody's diasporas the minute Del the minute you said Drake I and I saw him twiddle his hands like this he said he knew where it's going I knew it I knew I kept trying to we don't know don't know say thank you I do want to say thank you because I think that was a piece that was missing in the internet conversation at least for me around what it feels like to be of like a a culture outside side of Black America who's been a victim of Drake and I don't think I think that Atlanta culture is is one thing I think Southern Culture is one thing I person yeah for real I think me as a southerner I didn't feel I didn't feel victimized by Drake I feel like he like I think about his father I think about Memphis I think about his trying to connect to a specific type of American Blackness so that didn't offend me but hearing what you're saying about like damn you want to hear this accent and this sound of music from this light-skinned Canadian [ __ ] but you don't want to hear the original artist I get you I get you so I want to say thank you for sharing that um oh that's beautiful because I know I'm I'm gonna be getting called every kind of get my [ __ ] ass out this country I already know I'm getting called every kind of tether every kind of disparaging I feel like you know I'm from here and they say that people comment on my [ __ ] and they'll be like people would like thing I swear to God people will literally be like watching something I say and be like oh I liked what she said until I heard that nasty accent slip out she trying hide go to hell they will act like I'm trying to like hide my immigration that like I'm trying they they go around like I'm trying to fool somebody like like I'm trying to pass as a black American I got a Bahamian Nigerian flag and both both in my every bio I have a Nigerian name I go by my name I tell y'all I have a bamian I say beham me every chance like I don't I'm like I'm no one trying to hide it from you but Hotel I'm in I'm in the Bahamas right now and Nas be telling me to go back to my country and like like I here they they send voicemails about like um to me and my uh co-host they be like you you're American Ben but the girl next to you like what what is she like she's she what they call me something and and they're like she needs to go back to wherever like why is she even here she has no experience I've been here all my life people say it's actually insane the way people talk to and about me off being an IM like it's it's it's insane and the way that like people don't have any respect for it as a plight like you see how like people spend all this energy trying to like give space to Drake's by racial experience nobody gives a [ __ ] about you as an immigrant [ __ ] like I swear to you like it's like you get like I like the fact that I don't want to talk about it on my own show because people like I feel like I'm going to be attacked by my own audience who wants me to do my best not to remind them that I'm not an American you know what I mean like like like you ain't even talk about it this much this much but like there's a like a lot of the foreign black people get exotified so that's one thing which is a fetish it's not a good thing it's a fetish and that's very dangerous because as soon as I step out of the sexy bamian you know [ __ ] then it's a problem they don't like that [ __ ] no more they say no do do the do the do the Caribbean thing but um however afcan especially like Continental Africans have never been cool in Black Culture never exactly exactly because they don't like to hear no Nigerian accent they won't let me be Caribbean like at least like foreign they like they and they prity and Caribbean deeply but they acknowledge him as a Caribbean person I am bamian first like I said I've never been the confidence of Africa like I've never been like I am I'm super beham in the way if y'all could see the way black people talk to me in my comments about being a Nigerian it's actually crazy like let me tell you I actually wish I wish that I was Nigerian enough to feel the sting of how badly they disparaged in my country like I go to my daddy like Jesus Christ I didn't know I really like I it's like in the last few years this diaspora Wars this like xenophobia this [ __ ] has really like taken like has really ramped up into like I said I've been American now 15 plus years and I've never experienced it the way I've been experiencing it but the way they talk about being Nigerian spe they don't acknowledge me as being Caribbean because they want to specifically call me every kind of Nigerian like that's the bottom of the barrel the way they talk about me is I'm like Jesus Christ why are y'all talking about Nigeria like this it goes Nigeria and then Haiti I think those are the two of the bottom of the barrel when it comes to Black migrant which is so which is so like fascinating I had an experience at the barber shop about a month ago and it's it's always the barber shop you know we start there I got too many battles to fight already um but I I was in the conversation and it was like this whole idea and I was like H these are like black Americans who don't like the fact that they're black American and it's like a very weird experience because they said well you know we're only attached to Thugs and we're only attached to this and we're only attached to like named everything bad right and so they were just like but you should child don't get me started because I said it's a middle it was a middle class black I said I'm tired of you but um foolishness it was annoying but they were sitting there and they were like well you should want to know more about your heritage you should want to know about your roots and where you come from and this that and the third and I said quiet as a ke I said H my family came from Barbados in 1850 like what are we talking about but they were like but why don't you we out here okay stop playing with him but I told him I was just like in reality I was like yeah I know my family from in Puerto Rico we come from Maroons um and then my family from Barbados like that's where we're at we came up in the 1850s and they were like well why do you identify so heavily with being a black American because you at least have the privilege of being part of your race I said if I were ever in my life to go to Barbados and claim be Invasion by anybody I said cultur carry your ass because you're not carry your and and and black Americans have an amazing culture right but that's the piece that was like confusing I said child just go to the Harlem Renaissance like we lit as [ __ ] what are we talking about like look for it like I don't like you know and again I that's why I say like for as much as I don't like how the black immigrants are disparaged I really don't like black Americans being disparaged that's some [ __ ] like but I thought like interesting yeah like yeah but but even like the problem but even for I hate when people I have only experienced that a couple times in my life like I'm telling you only one time like a devout white supremacist only there's only one it's only two times in my American experience that I've had anyone even kind of try to present being an immigrant as like a better thing or or or an or a benefit in someone two occasions once it was a devout white supremacist like in in Ohio like who said some stupid [ __ ] like that he said something like oh at least she's not black American some ignorant stupid ignorant [ __ ] like that and that's and that and that just like I cannot express to you just like how far I am from the world of people who live in delusion to act like black Americans don't have a very distinct culture and influence and impact they're all looking at everything most things on my bookcase all my black think like so many of my black thinkers are black Americans everything I watch is black black americ my whole pop culture all this da d d lots of that so the [ __ ] is nuts like you don't even have to like look for and and regionally all kinds of different black cultes I'm trying to get Bohemian I'm trying to get people to know to just capitalize the tea in the Bahamas much less get them to recognize different Bohemian cultures from Island to Island right like black Americans have distinct cultures that you can see regionally right that like we can impact we can see right there but that was that like threw me off because I was just like y'all don't I said but do you see like how even in that space of like seeing the experience of people who immigrated to America type situation so black immigrants and then also just like how we think about ourselves so it made me even think around the question of like we've internalized so much of like this is not we don't have anything to be proud of there's nothing here so we resent those outside who we feel have like a certain cultural Community like an ethnic Community they can go to so there's a set of traditions but I was talking to my one friend I was like child I'm so happy like SOA is such a great time like it's great I said however I don't get it I said I know Jazz I know I know the blues I know right and so it was like a very interesting moment because I was just like Yeah because it made me think around like the idea of being able to pop over I was like yeah I can appreciate like I've said I haven't been to a carnival yet I've been invited several times but I'm like for me there's also part of me that K tries to figure out like but that's not my particular world and you know I'm not a carnival or or rity rap rap all night I'm not that's why I thought it was like super interesting around like how they wanted me to like truly attach myself to where my family lineage goes back to but I'm like if for the things that I've known I'm sorry Tariq I'm longwinded but the things I've known I said um this is what I have this is the only thing I can attach myself to so I was like I'm very proud of the culture I came from I appreciate the fact that I know like my family lineage and I've been able to ask that ask those questions to get those answers but I also don't want to diminish the fact that like there's a lot of really strong cultural things here I think the lasting piece is like what do we all want as black Americans to be like our unifying thing I think is what they're trying to look for Tariq you saying yeah I was going to say like uh at least like from my experience uh I've noticed that it really is for a lot of cases just like a perspective thing it's uh comparative to like a similar conversation right like I remember when I was in high school we will have conversations like ah man if you think back to like the 2000s you could think about the fashion the music it has a specific sound a look but in the 2010s we didn't feel like the 2010s have that now I think about hell yeah [ __ ] right everything from 208 2014 you know what I mean like then now that we're out of it there's like a there's like a perspective change you can see what that era is and I think to the to the same degree I think like a lot of black Americans since they're like in it is just like all the negative stuff because that's so easy to see right it's easy to see all the things that like you hate and you wish like weren't attached to your name um but yeah like I think like outside of looking in you could definitely look and see how rich the culture is uh but sometimes it's difficult and it gets cloudy I guess when you're in it you know oh de go are sure yes for sure okay um I also I was just gonna mention that I think one like being able to Define like black culture in the in the United States of America is like lowkey [ __ ] new right like in the United States it's also a baby like this is in in the grand scheme of things like this is a new PL like the United States of America not the continent but this formation is new um and then also like when you're when you're brought up as as a like a black person in public school at least like you aren't learning about all the cool things that you've offered to this place the only thing that you that you're understanding about yourself is is slavery and then all of the black people that assimilated into a system that's trying to kill you and so that's really hard like to go from I was a slave this is okay all right you don't learn about any rebellions you don't learn about any revolts you don't learn about any organizing you don't know who Ella Baker is you damn sure don't know who James Baldwin is you don't know Hugh you don't know any of these people you don't even you don't even understand any you don't even understand the institutions that that were built for you you don't even learn about an HBCU you don't even learn about the importance of of of Faith practices and black movement you don't know any of that stuff until you're po like until you decide damn like I need to go research this thing to learn about myself in the context of the United States of America and I think that for some people you know that may sound like an excuse but I think that social socialization is really like I mean it's how you're [ __ ] made in America like it it's hard it's in the fabric it's in your skin um and I think that the other thing about consumption the way that like late stage capitalism is like post I think you mentioned Tariq the the 2000s there is a way that like the culture I feel like didn't have to be consumed to be cool but now people are broke and need some [ __ ] money the culture doesn't really matter unless it can sell and so I think in in the making of culture and and what that means for culture in general is really important there aren't that many culture makers there's just a lot of culture sellers the making culture not it's not like the making of culture isn't profitable it's the selling of the things the repackaging of the things that's that are that's profitable and when you're in the belly of the beast that's what you have to do to survive so I think there's a lot there I think it there's a lot of nuance there so you know what's interesting right so for like like for what like black Americans have to deal with with consumerism right or the way like the black culture like black American culture is like commod azed is the way that like like to me that's the like one of the firm ways that like white supremacy has it foot on on the like the black American neck right but for black Caribbean people right or like specifically like bamans or the place where we have is tourism like so fed to us like like so so here's the thing black black Caribbean people are are also like in the Bahamas we are we are not taught [ __ ] about like our Real History either and like what's crazy for I think first of all I want to say this like black Americans my best friend Nia is a black American and she'll tell you all the time like she don't care nothing about where anybody descend from she's like I'm American my people are from Philly I'm like you know what I mean and I think and I think that there's that that there is enough there is enough right here in Black American culture there is enough like there's enough like they don't have to feel like they need to seek anything else right in the same way I never I'm never going to take An ancestry task because I don't give a [ __ ] I know enough between the Bahamas and Nigeria that my daddy is Niger and my Bahamas to feel covered I've got enough Rich of a culture that I haven't died into and the same thing is true with black Americans black Americans have enough right here to feel like they have enough in Black American culture and that's just true and that's seen right like when you think about it the reason why like I think there can be so much resentment both different ways is how everybody is viewing all these black people around the world are all viewing ourselves through not only like fragmented lenses but like ones that we've been handed right by like so so much of the black Globe sees that like for what a black American's view right is like okay we have our like we have our Black Nation we have our this and black Americans don't have that right but like when you say like okay America's a baby the Bahamas is forign I'm a bad beham what's our independence how how old are we be this year stop oh [ __ ] um you see not even not y don't know he's there I want to say 51 [ __ ] we could be 51 50 Anniversary last year 51 we have 51 years of Independence I tell like I said we are from a 21 by7 Mile Long 51y Old Nation we have no like ability to even like talk about ourselves on a global scale like we're not heard about like when I think about I'm like my Eric Adams interview has more views than there are bahamians in existence like there aren't even like a million bahamians we're a small people you see what I'm saying so it's not like so for the rest of the black Globe it's like there's a large black globe that only gets to see Blackness presented as the Black American experience and we're from Little nations in America is a superpower so for a world superpower so from what like it's perceived as like okay we have this black nation or a Black Culture we could run around but what we have is really tiny Nations that are disregarded and overrun by the rest of the world that like literally uses and sees us as nothing but their vacation like their vacation spots and we are forc fed in our schools like in our schooling system think about it what the British has thought us like we are force fed that our job is to be tour like is to to please tourists like in our schools like most are getting their jobs in Hospitality like we were we were educated I think about this all the time CU [ __ ] that I realized now as an adult that I could not realize as a kid in school right but we were taught history from this book called making of the Bahamas just you you don't remember making it Bahamas I trying to figure out that's the white one like the little white um textbook or blue one it's the it's the it's like turquoise that I had blue one Alan Murray Alan Murray wrote it I that was my history teacher the white Bo I hated him I [ __ ] hated him you see what I saying in this textbook like as a as a presented to behance as a fact to learn about ourselves is that we're lazy is that we were given our independence because we are a lazy people they wrote that's the book that's what they taught us to learn in schools we were given our independence because we are a lazy people and that our soil didn't doesn't yield [ __ ] that's what they that's what they teaching Us in school like we're taught that so for like it's not like it's like I understand I have this like like this I guess a holistic like approach because I I have a African father in the house the Caribbean I'm raised I'm in America right and it's like so I see the ways that all of that happens to all of our cultures with stes me is seeing all these different black people all be like intentionally led to believe that the other has something that the other doesn't have you know what I mean it's like all all forced to believe that that some other black nation or some other black people are being better set up to know themselves or to know their culture to know their history but in actuality all of us whether or not like we have the history does not mean we're being taught it we are not being taught about slavery and [ __ ] in the Bahamas in the same way we're not being taught about all these different things we're not being we don't realize bamans don't even realize the fact like I always thought like white behemon at a minority right like in numbers right so I'm not thinking about them like as a kid I cannot see what power that they occupy on us as an adult I can now see that all the white bahamians [ __ ] occupy they live in a whole different sets of the islands away from us segregate themselves they have all kind of power and [ __ ] that we don't know you know what I mean so it's like there are ways in which that they we just don't see it or not being told so that I think is the thing is is frustrating it's like not us not all it's not our fault that's why I'm saying it's not our fault that's why I get sad when I see us like arguing with each other in diaspora Wars because we're all arguing based on the one piece of information we know from our black experience that we're holding to the chest that we feel affronted by and we're like BL lashing out at each other which is you keep talking about how your dad is Nigerian and my brother did his ancestry and we got a really Hefty percentage not at 23 and me be related I love it Sis you know my mama is red yeah but you see that's a great point that you're bringing up like even for me in in my culture though yall talking about um ancestry and stuff you know Word of Mouth in my family um because my uncle you know he um my uncle and my grandfather blue eyes curly hair um his father he don't know was allegedly Cambodian so even there but we identify 100% And why we speak the language that we speak is cre because we if with being Haitian through and through and through um but even in Haiti there like I said there are places where um my uncle fit in so well because of what he looks like you they call them um gleo and those uh we call them white Haitians right and in the music industry coming up all of the artists of course it's male dominated but the Haitian artists coming up they were all white like they they're white adjacent or they're white and that's who were coming up um for Haitians T Vice sweet micke um khi all of those groups T Jo zini all of them if when you see them they look like white people um and they they identify with being g g um but at the same time it's like we know that there's a hierarchy and all that so they're the systemic those ways those div those div divisive ways are in all the countries those colonizations uh colonizing way the whiteness it's all there um you're making me think about other things because now you said that and I'm thinking about the fact that like or even think about which of our artists like crossover right like think about that chinia or like Rihanna or who you know what I mean like when remember when Tempo was popping back in the day remember Tempo y'all don't if you if you weren Tempo was the channel was the music channel that we had all the Caribbean artist right and this is no shade to Rihanna or nobody like that or whatever but these were not the most Rihanna is by don't be coming for my people everybody nobody coming for Rihanna but there's a reason why certain a reason why they grab a Rihanna they grab a Shenia but Allison hin still where she at Destra still where she at you know what I mean spice spice gotta fight tooth and nail to [ __ ] cross over you see what I'm saying like there is something to that right who they do allow of us like when they allow one of us to like be cool and they don't question you and stuff they like you know there's a to me there's a reason why Rihanna could be Rihanna and continue to be sound as beijan as [ __ ] peace and they don't a nobody trying to not claim Rihanna my my own I went to an HBCU shouts out to Florida A&M University the number one yes I did yes I so shouts out to the HBCU and North Carolina ENT great school but the number one HBCU F but know we don't want true that's not true we don't have to do that but that's not true the the true for Wars of the americaas or HBCU beast that's what it it realis only we can do that nobody else but um I'll say this even in my school my University which I love so much and when you were talking about Delany that um uh Blackness you know some people had to learn I only knew being black from being in South Florida where it's predominantly and how I seen it in my world Caribbean I went to a Haitian church um the school that I went to my all my friends were Haitians uh that's all I knew we spoke K and then I went off to college you know I had black American friends there too but my core everything was Haitian I went off to colle College uh at fam and I never that's when my world really opened up I never knew that there were other black people I was meeting black people who were from London I was meeting black people who were like Nigerian and African like all of the all of the the things from all types of the from everywhere in the islands places I never heard heard about in the just Asian sis it was just Asians around you not even is in the world that's what I thought and so that's so funny so so when we all got together and I'm like oh my goodness and we were all speaking our different language and we all had our different cultures that's what I loved about FAMU but then I took a course and I L that they also taught us um they had me read this book called The Lies my teacher told me by Zimmerman and I learned more in that book about you know the colonization of Haiti um and from what my dad told me but it it it wasn't just my dad telling me now I'm looking at it in book reference all of the above and those things and then graduating my uh in journalism broadcast journalism U my undergrad degree and my professor pulled me to the side he says you are one of the most skilled here because I did TV journalism in middle school and in high school so going there I already had that under my belt he's like you are one of the uh most talented here you you read the prompter very well you carry yourself well you know you know how to inflect in your voice but he I'm just gonna have to tell you I'm gonna have to be real and mind you this was in 2011 12 um right before I graduated um undergrad he had to pull me to the side and he was like listen but you dark scam and I say this to say when you go out there to go work cuz everybody was getting their little interviews TV news I was getting my interview but it was locally and they had me in the back doing the white man's work not being in front of the screen so he was saying you're you're dark skinned and you present differently you know in this space so you're going to have to work a little harder and then your background is being Haitian so work on because I had a little slight Little Island touch you know so work on that and then I'm from South Florida so it was a little Hood in there too so he's like just work on you know that and um and then you you're just going to have to work a little harder you're going to have to wear you can't wear your hair in a certain way and you can't wear your nails in a certain way because it's just he told me this the I mean at my black school but he was trying to prepare me at that time before we have what we have now in 2024 but what it was going to look like for me and I can tell y'all it was super difficult for me um to and there was people who literally were trash journalists just getting jobs and I was I had to do six jobs in New York City to even do something that was Journal um journ like adjacent with other people and you know and that was like slavery apprenticeship stuff like that my life yeah like and and and that's the thing how my immigration comes up is me not being able to get like no one wants to sponsor you you know everything is a nightmare to try to like get any like to get a job to stay in the country and with that job then you're at the mercy of that job they fire you and you're gone like America decides they're going to deny a Visa for you and you're out of here right like I remember when I got Trump I got a Visa denied for for me while Trump was in in in office and literally I'm not lying to y'all y'all don't I cannot express to you like I I I don't like to talk the reason why I don't even like to talk about immigration or I don't even want to do immigrate like advocacy around it is because I hate being an immigrant like I hate it like it's the worst as a status like what it means to legally be an immigrant is the [ __ ] worst like if you asked me I'd come back in every life black I'd come back in every life a woman I'd come back in every life no like with my citizenship I would come back having told my mother to exercise some long-term vision and birthed me in the [ __ ] States right like it's a nightmare of of stress right so that's the way like it comes up in my life so what happened was during during Trump's Administration I applied for at the time I'm a public defender I am on I went on on immigration leave right like so let me explain how it works I came to the us as a student in in high school like I wanted to be in America I told my parents like I think it'd be easier for me if I were entered the US um schooling system immigration System earlier so I left I've been in America now by myself since I was 14 so that's how long that I have been actively every second of my life has had to be in this long-term immigration thing since I was 14 years old I have had to been the sole person in this country trying to figure it out and trying to figure out how to stay right and so you go through a million student visas keep finish school this is and the next thing Trump gets elected my [ __ ] 3 l year like as I'm finally getting ready to finish law school and now need to go into this immigration system of trying to to get a work visa right like which doesn't give you what you need to understand is when I immigrant has a work visa I can only make money on that one job that has a work visa and they can't give me anything they can't promote me they can't whatever I can't get new money added money bonus anything you see me do I can't sign if a TV show wants to give me if they want to give me a TV show I can't take it I can't accept the money if it get if they want to give me a book deal I can't take it I can't accept the money I can't do any of these things right so I had a student visa and I need to try to get a work visa what they give you when you have a student visa is when you graduate you get what's called you get one year of opt where you're allowed to work on that student visa while you try to find a job that's willing to sponsor you which is damn near impossible damn so I have my one year as a as a public defender and that's fine my job was not initially trying to sponsor me they don't care don't give a flying [ __ ] about my immigration whatever have you leave me to the Wolves right now right so I apply um under a Visa that basically that you would get I call it the Special [ __ ] visa and it's if they find that you are a a special alien right lady they find that you are an alien an outstanding alien with an advanced degree with something with a profession of like substantial Merit doing something that is of national importance right they decide they tell me normally when it wasn't trump it would have been like a few months like a couple of months right where you end up on this unpaid leave right where you have this period of time where your opt expires and you need to you can stay before right it was instead of it being like a few months of unpaid leing you can't leave so you can no longer work your job because your OBT is expired right even though I'm a registered admitted attorney I can't work my job I can't get any of my union benefits because none of my union benefits truly apply to me because I'm an immigrant so I can't get the leave the money the benefits none of that [ __ ] so I cannot make any money but I also cannot return to my country or they'll consider my application abandoned so I have to be broke and struggling in New York City I'm not allowed to make any money and I also cannot go home to my country instead of that being I like I tried to prepare for that I worked in advance to pay like four months rent up front right like normally like a couple of months under a normal Administration not Trump's Administration seven months on unpaid leave right like I can't express to you distress and then literally one day I am walking and I just I get to denial they they first of all they sent me a letter warning me that they were they were going to deny me because of my decision to be a public defender but they send me the denial and they tell me that I am a an outstanding alien I have an advanced degree I'm an attorney uh who's done something of substantial you know uh Merit but my interest in helping the poor and indent persons of New York is not of national importance to the United States of America and so denial and so I had to leave I'm literally walking home from the gym when I get the denial that I have to leave the country the next day [ __ ] my house my life I have been here since I was 14 years old and I had to leave and I had to find a miracle to get even sponsored for a work fees it to be here right so that's the way that being an immigrant like impacts my [ __ ] is like I'm not able to do anything my life I have felt like I been on suspended like Shackled to US immigration since I was 14 like suspended time like just time Rebecca could tell you just working like forum is just saying to me I work like askar in his prime like working a million jobs and and opportunities and things just trying to like make enough opportunities so that the day the US government allows me to capitalize on any of it that it will still be there for me but I can't I got to do all the [ __ ] that I do for the free and out of the goodness and out of this and so the only way that's the only that way is how immigration popped up and two like when I was I interned for the only time anyone's acknowledged me is Caribbean outside of that n my [ __ ] is um when I interned for the DA's office in law school because they made you I went to a prosecutor meal and I interned for the DA's office and they wanted me to listen to all the Caribbean [ __ ] that they were there they wanted me to listen to all their Rikers calls to translate it for them because they can't understand Caribbean dialect so they wanted me to translate to use the only time they've ever cared in my professional career as a Ben they perceived my being Caribbean as a benefit is so they could use it to prosecute a bunch of Caribbean [ __ ] in New York City because it's important to remember there's a huge Caribbean population here so when you see a lot of the black people that are being criminalized in the system those are Caribbean people too those African people too and so that's the only time they care that I am when they can use it against those people that's nuts yeah which is so fascinated that immigrant experience is crazy I have two parents who are immigrants who I watched have it really really tough till this day um that my dad because it was so tough for him he don't even want it no more he don't he he don't want it he don't want nothing to do with it he's like forget it I'll keep my you know keep at least they can um you know still call me Haitian or whatever the case may be but he don't the with the struggle and even him working within the government as somebody who was helping other Haitians um they still treated him and and limited his um access to things all of that stuff mama you know had to get hospitality jobs and was disrespected and couldn't do nothing like it was a lot so that experience is crazy but knowing it from you know a millennial person and and and you being here at such a young age and hearing like how you you know you're still trying to be here and you're still trying to make a life for yourself and you are essentially an American but they are making it so diffic difficult for you even regardless they heard say would they would punch you in chest they and I hear that but that's like my mother and father's experience no matter how much you've contributed to this country or for specific things that are super American um they still want to you know to divide that have that divide and make you work 10 to 15 to a thousand times harder for you to have an essentially a freedom here yeah and and yeah I just have to I I'm just trying to do my best to make sure that I don't let being personally res like that struggle my immigration struggle is like literally the bane of my existence so I try not to like let that upset combin with me receiving all this xenophobia make me become a [ __ ] agent of white supremacy and start lashing out you know what I mean on my [ __ ] whose fault and that's really what it be for me that's why I'd be like I just want to stay away from diaspora worst conversation because I don't want you to catch me in the middle of a bad I'm upset about being my [ __ ] day you know what I mean and blah blah blah because like I said there's no one that speaks no one can speak to that experience right like it's actually super interesting like one kudos to you because I I think about you a lot of like the work that you do no cuz honestly I was like now if they try some [ __ ] some [ __ ] [ __ ] with Olay after this little Eric Adams situation like yeah but I think about it a lot of just like the risk of what your platform represents and what a lot of us do is really speaking uh truth to power and so when we do this kind of stuff there is like this space of like I know I still have the privilege of being able to you ain't sending me no [ __ ] way like right so I can still talk my [ __ ] but like you really take that extra risk so I I commend you for one the platform that you built because I would have been like all right what can I actually talk about what can I not talk about and that shows to you more your commitment the other piece is also just thinking around like for me growing up like being originally from Reading PA it's a huge city with a large undocumented population and so for them it's like the only job that a lot of people had were being exploited exploited in the factories or working in the mushroom factories as well and so it's just like they are getting jobs where it's probably like a dollar and some change that they're like working and I looked at like a lot of my peers who were growing up and so it's just like oh so once some students were able to get like their DACA um certification stuff like that but a lot of them were just like yeah we are barely making it because it's going to take about it took them 16 years before they even could get like a a green card it took them a couple years before even being able to think around like all right what does college look like now because even College acceptances have not created like a strong enough system to really think around how do we get undocumented people into becoming productive members of society right and so I think it's like a very interesting piece because I say all that because I think a lot of the times they forget that black people can be immigrants too and they're actually the largest group of people who targeted within the United States for a lot of these issues and so I think the again the ability to continue to tell stories but our ability to listen that's why I'm just like as we were all talking throughout this conversation today I'm like yeah as you were telling me about some of the stories around how Bahamian people are being represented within pop culture and media and education the same [ __ ] can be said about Black Americans we just learn like Haitians are experiencing this thing Southern black people are we consider them dumb right like the thing around how we are thinking around how all not again my family from Charleston so like I don't consider him dumb but like just the I know but it's just like being mindful of the fact that like so many of it is like a gross miseducation of how every everybody's perspectives on each other but also just shows the lack of humanity that we have to listen to each other's stories because we're so just like yeah back in this one time this thing happened but systemically as you were all talking I was like damn so there's a miseducation in school there's a lack of proper representation in pop culture in music and art and media and all of that and so I think hopefully again I'm thinking around the consumers of people who are listening to this are like hey like listen to All of six very different black experience and different nuances that we have even regally Tariq I don't know where you're from but like I'm from Jersey North New Jersey oh you you across the way I'm in Philly so we out here y'all different but even in this like but like even in this conversation I'm like listening and I'm just like oh this is an I still think as content creators we are able to like continue to be complicate this black narrative that we have across the diaspora but also like we were able to like all engage in a different level of Storytelling from very particular lived experiences but there was like a through line of mised Education across all of it unless we're active participants in the culture and so I think like that's the piece for me that I think about hearing these stories and just like sit with Nuance don't sit with the basic [ __ ] anymore sit with different people and be able to actually learn and you'll see there's a commonality more powerful that way at the end of it no other reason like if for no other reason than to be more powerful right like there's a reason why like when you say that right it's like yes I've been saying that is that immigration is a black issue in America the immigrants that are treated worse the immigrate the messaging around immigration any any all the progressive reforms or discussions around immigration are always like targeted towards the Latino community and the discussions around mistreatment of immigrants is always about the Latino community and I'm I'm not knocking them that's good on them on their messaging right but the reason why but meanwhile like I'm not knocking them cool but it's like Haitian immigrants are actually ones who are who are mistreated the most and haian immigrants have the largest like bonds and and treatments or whatever at ice and all these different things right like black immigrants and immigrants from countries like our [ __ ] hole countries or our what they like to call our third world developing nations they call our island nation right but the problem is like I said it's intentionally black Americans are intentionally being fed xenophobia by a by a white America that does not want them to have any power does not want them toble to consolidate power there's a reason why White America Embrace their white immigrant their European communities why they make it easier for them to immigrate or whatever because that creates more power for them black people imagine if we had the voting power of all these black immigration immigrant communities right like all these black immigrants in this country had rights if they could vote if we were all brought in if we had a more unifying solidarity mission right if we were trying to understand each other but we're intentionally being educated against one another right so you're not going go back go back to the Black Panthers Ten Commandments that's why Fred Hampton stay in my back we just need that Commandments and we move and we mobilize and we got to get there right because even if I can't tell but I can't message effectively around telling people immigration is a bad issue a black issue if black people here believe that the immigrants are their enemy black immigrants are their enemy right so then they don't care they don't see that as if they see it as separate that's why the first thing we have to do is unite us and it goes both ways it goes both ways Delany yeah talk no yeah yeah I agree I do shout out to baji um an organization that does IM uh immigration work for black people specifically shout out to vaji you know you said you what if all these black people could have rights to vote and I don't know if that would even really help you know because a lot of people coming over I don't I'm not putting I know I know I know it just this is not a conversation about electoral politics or voting or anything like that just made me think about how how conservative black people are in America and then also like immigrants that are coming here that are like yo like I need to assimilate in this way um that made me you know it just made me chuckle it made me feel a thing but I also do think that a lot of black folks black Americans when they think about immigration they are not thinking about black people like that is not the image that's popping into their head to the point about stories and storytelling The Narrative absolutely [ __ ] not it's just not happening so I think there is a lot of messaging that has to be done around uh immigration being a black issue um and I think folks are doing their best I think baji's doing doing its best I think there's some other organizations but you know in North Carolina at least being in the South a lot of the immigrants that I come into contact with are Hispanic um and then I didn't realize it was like such a culture shock for me moving to New York and living in Little Haiti I was like I what yeah you live you lived at a block but I was like what is going on here there are a thousand Flags people are speaking 25 different languages Pati in their their crazy yes and I was I literally was so shook that's my best friend prob when you moved it from upstate yeah I was like what what's going on and why is everyone speaking different languages at the same time and like you know that whole that whole experience of being there and meeting people cuz I stay I feel like I stayed in Flatbush like I didn't really go too many places unless I was with my friends so a lot of my interactions I was always like where are you from like people were asking me where I'm from like are you from what is what did they always say was it it wasn't Trinidad was it the the Virgin Virgin Islands something wherein people are at they're everywhere probably in the French metropo or something yeah he's there's a specific everybody kept saying lifein people are everywhere but you know what I mean and they I want you to know y'all are quite literally everywhere if I show you my mother yall y'all you look more like my M than me I believe it but I'm saying like it it was just I had the best conversations about what it meant to be black and an immigrant in New York with people that were living in the neighborhood um that have been there for such a long time it was nuts but I did have to keep explaining that I was black and that I was American black and I was trying to explain what it is to be Plantation black and how you can come you know what I mean you can come and be a little yellow at the end but that does not mean that my mama is white so we were having a lot of those conversations about Blackness again and Caribbean people they know that look at my m so why was they trying to play me then what was going on they were I told you yes and she's a full lady full behan black lady she's white at all she look like my auntie like you see me look like a pip from don't you don't you she is yes she said she up the street she got Nigerian but that's the bamian side look that's exact I might got a little something I might I told you Cambodian somewhere in the line for me I don't know maybe in my be beads I I really don't but it's I'm loving the little 23 and me drops I can come I Liberia that's where I I'm glad y have fun I'm glad y'all have fun remember this feeling that you felt because the comment section I doubt is going to reflect feeling you I don't know why I let foren come here I'm glad Tariq decided to quiet and protect himself watch all Tariq people going to be so mad they be like oh my God I was so excited to hear Tariq and I didn't get to hear him talk y'all didn't let him talk Tariq does not want to get a strongly worded letter saying I'm scared I'm scared of the [ __ ] people they're gonna be like we are bad representation of black Americans let me tell you something people be so mad like I actually again I go to my way I represent there are three there are three um black men or mask presenting people on every episode right people will be so mad they're so used to trying to say like oh you don't you didn't represent they'll be like no they will literally be complaining in my comments on Delan episode like there are no black men here black m
