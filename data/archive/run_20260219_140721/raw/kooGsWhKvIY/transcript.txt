the first question I have to ask you is who's iconic to [Music] you who is Iconic to me oh that's such a hard you know what's funny I feel like when I was a young person I would have answers of like celebrities and people like that who I could like look up to but I feel like every I always I've learned things about everyone I like that make me like them less so I like can't like unabashedly suggest a single person so who's iconic to me is like I would probably say my mom uh who like raised me uh who passed when I was like 12 and she was uh she was like she was like My adoptive mother cuz I wasn't raised by like my birth mother but she was uh you know she had a disability she had suable py she like couldn't drive and couldn't walk very far but she like made everything work and kind of made me have like a very normal childhood and uh kind of bent over backwards to like kind of make it seem like everything was normal to me when I like look in uh you know when I look back it's kind of like how did you do it that that was a magic trick you know and I think that that's like that I would consider that iconic uh really just sacrificing a lot to give you know me a normal childhood or a semblance of a normal childhood oh that's amazing that that is amazing story okay well now now I'm in your childhood AR like yeah we're in we're in yeah okay all right so tell me what are the origin stories if this was a video essay tell me where you're from oh oh well I don't want to that makes it sound more self-important but no I'm from uh I'm from Gainesville Florida um which is a college town it's where like the University of Florida is located and uh that's where I was born and raised and uh my family is originally from Illinois but I never spent any time there but I have an older sister who still lives there and uh yeah like I have two I have two siblings and like none of us were raised together we're all like um like kind of raised by a different family friend if you know what I mean like kind of you know like Grandma like quote unquote Vibes and uh yeah so I mean I grew up with my mom um it was like I grew up in a two-bedroom house with like five people in it you know there know it was I don't know if it was five I think it was four it depended on the time but it was like me uh my mom who I called my mom the distinction is like this was like my mom and my birthmother are two different people if you know what I mean yeah uh it's like me my mom my cousin who was um nonverbal and like had a disability uh had like sort of mental disabilities and so and then my aunt who was like her caretaker um and so uh it's like I my story gets very dark very fast I hope that's okay of course of course I'm just surprised I'm yeah yeah so like my uh you know my mom passed when I was 11 or no uh so a year before my mom passed my cousin actually passed um due to just complications from some of her disabilities and things like that I don't fully know the situation but and then my mom passed shortly after so there were originally like four people in the house and like me and my mom would sleep like uh uh on the couch like like opposite like kind of head to toe opposite side you know when I was a kid we would sleep on the couch and then Aaron my uh cousin would sleep in the room and then my aunt would sleep in her room and uh and then suddenly it was just like me and my aunt uh uh and I had to like go to and then at the same time my birth mother had gotten um had gotten uh custody of my little brother and was like getting her life together cuz she had just like had a lot of stuff going on not I don't want to like kind of tell her business but she had a lot of stuff going on she got custody of my little brother and then wanted to get custody of me but was like oh he's like doing fine on his own but then like when things happened there was this like custody court situation where like at 12 I have to decide if I like want to change households or like stay where I'm at even though I didn't have like an amazing relationship with my aunt uh I like would prefer to like stay in the same house at least and like go to the same school and have the same everything else since everything was in such flux um so then I did that and then my aunt was uh my caretaker until I was 18 and I saw uh I like the agreement was that I would see my birth mother every like other weekend yeah um but what's funny is funny to me is that like my Aunt dropped me off at college and I didn't see her again until I graduated from college and I haven't seen her since why how she calls me every week but like she's like a recluse and she had her own stuff going on there's some like trauma and things related to like she she didn't have it all together at at certain times as well and I'm just kind of like caught in the mix but thankfully I had like a strong sense of self and was able to like uh kind of find my own way but um yeah it was weird and then and then so and then and then uh uh I guess the other thing is that like um I keep saying my aunt but really she was like not well no one's blood related to me uh at this point but we all just by coincidence everyone's last name was Johnson so like no asked any questions it was just pure coincidence that's so funny when I say my aunt it's like that's what I called her but really it was more like um a cousin cuz like her mom my mom or her my mom's sister was her mom so it was my real aunt but I call her like my great aunt and uh she was also kind of like a second mother to me after my mom passed but she lived in a separate household and then some [ __ ] went down and then I spent a bunch of time with her um but then you know she passed right after I graduated college so then I just kind of have no connection to like my family I like talk to my aunt every now and then she'll call me and see like what's up and I like talk to my birth mother every now and again but like I kind of otherwise I like am like a man with no home a little bit like Nomad I I I I get that like I am I really really get that I um when I was born how do you it's so crazy trying to tell your own life St story these people are alive and we'll get exactly exactly yeah no like an accurate retelling of history is offensive to them yep and I mean I'm there's some details I'm I'm definitely skipping over but right I'm like okay so when I when I was born I I lived with my grammy until I was like seven right my mother um my dad my dad had his his first family essentially my um two of my sisters with his first wife and he had me and my sister um my younger sister with my mom around the same time um so I I lived with my grmy so I was about seven and that was my parent and then I moved into the house with my parents um it was very tumultuous that is the the word I'm just going to use to uh capitalize on my childhood and then when I moved away I moved to America when I was 14 about to turn 15 that summer right um and my parents stayed like in the in the always had and I've just been trying to move farther and farther away like I when I first went to Florida like um the first year I went to Florida I was in like bad Del R and they could visit you know what I mean or like so good to you you know what I mean and not like oh my like I'm not too far away yeah yeah I'm like all right so and then I went to boarding school West Virginia then I went to college in Ohio who was your who was your caretaker when you went to Florida my grammy okay okay so she was she was was she came with you no I came to America alone but my grammy would like come and like fly back and forth and she hated America but she would fly back and forth to like be with me for as long as like immigration would let her on a tourist visa right yeah so my grand so then you were like solo then yes okay yeah yeah I've been in America by myself so yeah and that and because that is you know like my I love I I love my family but it's complicated it is it is to say the least and so like when I went went to law school like I hadn't seen my family for like 5 years and I and I I rarely I can I can tell you every time I've seen my family off the top of the dorm and for like the last 10 years meanwhile to my boyfriend like wants to see his family like every month he'd see them he see them every day every week how does that make you feel cuz I admire that in other people yes I know that's not like my story but it doesn't mean that I have to be like jealous or I have to be you know like cynical about it like I think that just everybody's story is different you know yeah I I I love it I love it I love it but I have a complicated relationship with it so first of all I love my boyfriend's family let me say that they're gems like they're so wonderful that's the best thing that could happen to my future kids like I'd be thinking this healthy family loving stuff is going to be wonderful for my children but I don't have the bone like me myself as in like I family is very touching go my family is like a Lon mind like you know when you playing mind sweeper you don't know how that [ __ ] works and you just put the bomb yeah oh and you hit every you hit a bomb and you're like uh I guess the game's over exactly like what dealing with my family is like the bombs are coming and you're trying but you have no idea like how to avoid them all and so for me I being around like my family is very touch and go about me like they don't my my family don't love me consistently and they never have right like I any any little thing any little thing is enough to get me cut off off for years at a time all of this right so I'm always worried like my boyfriend's family loves me and I love them but to me being close like like being around them all the time to me creates more just my anxiety from the relationship I have with family makes me think if we spend too much time together something bad is something bad is gonna happen I know I I think that there's some degree of like fear of getting too close to some members of my family because there is a pattern where people start to like rely on me too much for things and then I feel like I'm um just a pocketbook or I'm just a uh uh like a tool to like enable somebody else's stuff or sometimes I feel like I'm in enabler you know where uh I've had family members who you know tell me one story about they're in Dire Straits and they need something and then I find out through the grap Vine that actually they were just gambling you know and I'm like okay well I don't know what to do with that you know what I mean like I want to be supportive but I also don't want to feel like used you know right right I listen I I have been there and I was watching you know I was watching did you watch the Tik Tok cult documentary no I'm so surprised that you haven't watched that that feels like EX I feel like I I know I I've been like in a media drought lately I haven't been watching anything I need to watch that though called like 7M Tik Tok cult they're like okay like do they do like dances sorry if this is a super dark in there a bunch of people that are like popping on Tik Tok like they have millions of followers but because they there's this cult management church thing or whatever and they're they talking telling their stories right and the crazy part is like this one girl is like I guess they're they kind of Center around her her sister is talking they used to make Tik Tok videos and stuff together and her sister talking about how she's in the cult and I was like watching on my boyfriend and I was thinking to myself I you know I used to be there was a time in my life where I would have been like this could not have been like I would never might have tell my family this and d and I was like now I've lived enough life with my family to know I can't stop them from doing [ __ ] like I can't get like if one of my family members was in a cult there's no amount of I I protested before about things I know I've even had like um um like I some some like Silver Linings like in my life were just like friends families who like really stepped up and like helped me or supported me or were there uh as like a safety net for certain things and so I have like friends F like I have like a best friend from childhood whose family is like family to me right and I've been at like Thanksgiving where like their little brother says some like problematic [ __ ] and you're like oh like do we need to have an intervention right now you know like we're trying and then at the end of the day I'm like I don't even we're not even family I just like want the best for you but I know I can't control I you know I don't have control over anybody so you know best plans you try what you can it's really wild realizing you have very little control over sh as you would want to have uh yeah but on the family side I like when I am when I do like settle down with someone I think I would like to find somebody who has like that kind of relationship with their family because I will not be able to bring that to the table so I think if I were to like yeah bring a child into the world I would want them to have something to that effect you know no dead no dead ass I literally like every time I see it i' be like I at least know I've chosen some stable nice stuff from my boyfriend's side uh to be able to give to my cuz like my family's cool mind you right like if you the individuals like on any given if you meet them on their best day you know what I mean and their best attributes in like then they're like you know what I mean but that is just not guaranteed this is not guaranteed at all like I know exactly what you mean yeah exactly so I'm like my kids will love their F like my family maybe like on a particular occasion and then there's going to be another occasion where they they and they're going to be like ah this is the worst experience of my life funny yeah no that's I I did not know that was your backstory Jarvis I feel like on the internet they you know I feel like the internet has an entirely different perception of you like I feel like they've given you a very like white boy bougie lagona beach background and I that's um I think that's a little bit by design for me I think that I don't I like don't need anybody to know like if I'll if I'm sharing short but it is for there's a small part of me that's like if that's your assumption then I won I beat the I beat the odds you know whatever but yeah who knows yeah I love that that's that I mean that's a good that's a good perspective to to take I'm always like mad whenever it could not be negative but if I just think it's wrong like it's incorrect about me like a perception that's just wrong I it it bugs the [ __ ] out of me like I I I agree no I we've talked about this a little bit before like I I am practicing letting it pass but it is easier said than done cuz CU sometimes just when when I I have this strong desire to correct the record yeah and uh I sometimes have to just let it go like because I'm not going to be able to correct everyone's perception of me you know yeah yeah no that's right how how how hard do you think that's been to like learn cuz I feel like I'm about four or five four years into really really being on the internet B and I think I am still mad and complaining about the same [ __ ] when am I going to get better at handling this me too well I definitely feel like I still complain about the same [ __ ] and it's like okay well what have I what have I done to give myself some coping strategies or tools or you know a plan of how do I avoid it I mentioned this like I personally don't read my comments unless I'm in the best mood ever because I know that if I I can just something catches me the wrong way it can like ruin my whole day and I I maybe you've had this experience I feel so stupid when I when I let some little [ __ ] [ __ ] comment like mess mess up my day simply because my own brain is broken like my own like chemicals are imbalanced that I just read the wrong words in the wrong order at the wrong time and that like shuts me down for like a couple hours it's the worst it's the worst feeling cuz I don't I have to be kind to myself I have to like let myself off the hook but there's a part of me that's like no that was embarrassing that you let that affect you but uh you know it's like I've been in therapy for longer than I've been a content creator and I think that is uh has been helpful yeah um to like kind of have some consistency on that front um and grounding myself in the real world has been another thing that is easier said than done and something I definitely lost sight of like post pandemic when I a lot of my social skills had like atrophied and I wasn't getting out and about and I'm doing a lot of bed rotting at home and I'm just getting in a cycle of like working that I can which I can do from home and then like doing self like um what is it called not self-care but more um I feel like if I am watching like a three-hour YouTube about YouTube video about some [ __ ] that is not going to affect my life in any way but it's like keeping me invested that is like the adult version of like putting a binky in my mouth and like putting myself to bed you know what I mean like it's like a comfort it's like self comfort you know it's like sucking my own videos right now yeah yeah it's like oh oh tell me about how this family was horrible to their kids I don't know why that's comforting to me that's literally me and Jay Aubrey videos right now I don't don't know one [ __ ] person he's talking about and I Amed soon a family can we talk about this for a second cuz literally Jay Aubrey videos will be like this is a story about how the the family of seven Jesus passengers raised their kids and abused them and everything horrible happened and then they got taken off YouTube and they all went to jail just and it's like wait why is the soundtrack going so like why am I bobbing my head videos so good like you let me let me i j i don't even know Jay Aubrey yet like I haven't I met him at the Creator for Palestine uh uh fundraiser actually and we have to talk about that he is so [ __ ] good and I say this as someone who makes video assays it upsets me the way I suddenly feel like I'm in a Cinematic Universe I don't even feel like he's doing the same that I'm doing it feels like I am lost in a movie like and I'm so lost in I I it's very funny when um I think hans's talked about it too where it's like the he scores his own videos like really meticulously and you can tell but it's like did we really need to go this hard on a video about the worst crime you've ever heard of or like and yes yeah the answer is yes cuz I'm in I'm I'm engaged in the last I want you to understand how many it's to the point where I love I made my boyfriend such a YouTube person and he's like he literally tells people and I be putting other people he's like I didn't know he was like yall know like this even is on YouTube like you that's what you could use YouTube for like this people don't even know literally my boyfriend H me for the last how however many nights he's literally like oh we watching Jay Aubrey and I'm like you you want to watch something else he's like no and I'm like we've watched the most recent one on the depravity of kick we watched one on the depraved world of the Duggers we watched one listen sneo pearly we like of and I never heard of none of these people I'm also by the way I realized like I'd be so upset when people call 30 Auntie I'd be upset I'd be ready to fight but and then also why I never heard of the app KCK I never heard of it I never heard people yeah kick it's like um well that one has a if you watch the J video he probably already explained it but it's just like crazy how that came out of nowhere just because twitch was [ __ ] everything up yeah and and everybody was like I know what'll save us a streaming app by the people who made the crypto gambling website Stak finally Our Savior that's so funny no I'm glad you feel me I'm glad I'm not the only one locked into these videos I'm like they're so good oh yeah I mean I will watch like uh Jenny Nicholson is another one where like uh Jenny Nicholson will disappear we we met the sweetest sweetest person we met at a vidcom panel last year but Jenny Nicholson will disappear from the internet and show up with a 4-Hour video about something you've never heard of or even better let me tell you about defunct land have you watched defunct land no okay okay if you look at okay let me just tell you let me just give you a video recommendation so defunk land will do videos originally I found them cuz they would do videos about different rides like a here's the story of this like theme park ride that actually really sucked and people hated it and it got like shut down and it was super creepy and scared kids or [ __ ] like that right but then they they started expanding stuff they did this three-hour video on the history of Disney FastPass and that that uh got everybody in but the one that got me was did you ever watch Disney Channel yes of course okay do you know okay great so you know the Disney Channel Jingle the yes that's my so exactly so he did an hour and a half video about how no one knows the origin of who made that sound and he like goes on this investigative Journey trying to figure out where it came from and uh that video it it you will never expect to be crying in that video but I was like I was blown away and then the other day uh defun tweeted yeah that video like if you just say like Disney Channel defunct land you'll you'll get recommended the video okay I'm getting it right now I'm about to found boom found it um okay boom watch my but it's like this is like there's this you know you know the YouTubers that like consider themselves documentarians I think defunct land is one of those and I think they deserve it you know I think they're really about it they're really doing what they they say and they're really putting the work in and um when when I like follow him on Twitter and they were like new video in two weeks I was like let me mark my calendar actually no it'll show up at the top of my recommendations and I will click it and I will drop everything I'm doing but yeah I love that I love that's why listen I'm I'm glad it's not just me I'm and that's where what I'm really trying to do I like when I watch a YouTube video and I'm like a that just good for real I understand why you have your views like when like when you put it your Steve Harvey one and I text you like yo this is really funny like I I've watched that mad times and it's not I don't watch lots of [ __ ] I'm in right right no me either I um I don't I I don't like to watch stuff I'm in cuz uh I think to I I think about myself too much yeah and I'm like I need to just not do that but I don't ever want it to seem like disrespectful you know like it's not like it's like it's a it's a me problem please like like under please understand it's a self-perception issue it's not you or your content I just cannot see and hear myself I because I I use videos stuff like that as um escapism so I need it to be about stuff that has no connection to me yeah so like I will watch like I will avoid things that my friends are in like I was literally like getting really into Magic the Gathering this like um card game and uh and I was into it as a when I was a kid and I was getting re into it recently and there are these videos where people like make a whole content out of like playing this game and there's like a whole story to it and everything and I was watching this channel really enjoying it and then like I got recommended one with like my friend iffy like iy wway I don't know if you know him but I was like I was like if if you get out of here man I'm trying to we know each other in real life I need to be in a mystery land where none of these people exist for real no that's real that I I understand that cuz there are like all these like YouTube verses of like things that I watch that I like I've never watched in real life the show 90day fiance or any right right right I watch all of the YouTubers like cover the show and I've been watching for years and I've never talked to them I never be in the comments I watch religiously I know it's it's insane and it's just because I'm like that has not [ __ ] to do with anything in my life world blah like and last they start getting way too xenophobic and nobody's calling out the imig like y'all don't see how they Trea an immigrant ha and me as imigrant and then I exit that one and I go to someone else where it's unpr problematic right exactly I'm like no this hit too close to home let me go to something that like I'll watch um there's a true crime I don't watch a lot of True Crime anymore but I was watching True Crime for a bit and I really like um this channel rotten mango let me look at that and it's funny cuz this uh this woman Stephanie is like the host of it and I believe her main thing that she used to do was like mukbang videos where she would talk about crimes but then she just pivoted to just straight up True Crime thing but I think where she differs is one she's like very empathetic and kind of talks to talks to victims and kind of doesn't sensationalize it in a way that traditional True Crime does but then also she talks about stories she works with a bunch of translators and will translate stories from like Korea and you know uh and China and things like that where I'm like I never would have heard about this and for some reason because I know it can't possibly impact anything in my world cuz it's like it's like the land far far away it's like a thousand miles away from me where this crime happened no one's going to break into my house this happened way way over there um it's just like it's like more comforting not that true crime should be comforting but it is like The Morbid curiosity type do type be did have you watched um worst roommate ever on Netflix yes oh my God wait a second you just like unlocked something cuz I've watched so many of those Netflix things every episode is on some roommate they had that end up being like Oh yes I haven't fully seen this but I've seen it a little bit I watched one was there one about how somebody um started squatting and like wouldn't leave the house okay yeah yeah yeah listen back and it's I can watch any like me and my boyfriend can watch a lot of True Crime because I can pause it and and he wants me to pause it every five minutes to be like we want to be like you see how the [ __ ] police didn't do [ __ ] right you see police like by the time because all my true crime is watched with the live commentary of me and my boyfriend like I feel like look at that look at them exposing the police for being wor and that's the thing it's like and if you turned on a camera and were like live while you did that I would watch that yeah like cuz I can watch I can watch someone else watching True Crime who can call the things out like sometimes Hass will react to True Crime and I'll W I'll be able to watch that more if it's like the more morbid stuff because at I this is this is why some people watch me cuz I feel like um they're like holding my hand through this scary scary thing oh I'm safe cuz my friend is here explaining things to me no dead ass you're absolutely right that that makes me think you're always giving me ideas now Aaron is going to want me to do that cuz Aaron ever since we did uh sad boys Aaron wants me to do a pop of girls propaganda video so bad and oh I I yes I it that was so good it was so funny I spent a really long time before we figured out the thumbnail for that I spent a very long time uh photoshopping an image of Mojo Jojo in jail with the Powerpuff Girls laughing next to it it never worked as a thumbnail but I was like this these frames are wild I don't know if I still have them but I'm I'm I'm going to go make it myself for y'all for fun like yeah yeah yeah I I'm extra annoying like that sometimes I I'll be on like consciously YouTube like anybody who's my friend and be like I made you a phone thumbnail like I made you this Thum for this video this video that deserves Justice I do it and conscious will change it and I love it I'm like you go thank you for taking me as your overzealous friend okay so how did you get into YouTube in the first place Jarvis as somebody who similarly has anxiety um yeah so I was I started watching YouTube when I was very young and uh how old are you Jarvis I'm 32 just turned 32 okay I I'm going I'm going to be 31 next month so I I I was in that like I was in Middle School when like YouTube first started existing and uh so I was watching that first generation of YouTubers though I did I did avoid Shane Dawson even back then I never heard of him until recently he used to be all over the YouTube front page but I did watch a lot of um Hank and John Green back in the day uh cuz they were like two older dudes like they both started YouTube like 26 and 29 but it was like 200 it was 2007 and I was like oh these guys are adults and they're like goofy still I guess when you're an adult you like it doesn't have to be like it doesn't have to suck cuz I think I was so afraid about becoming an adult um and so I was yeah I was always kind of just like on YouTube as a fan and then um was a fan of like online creators and things like that and so I was leaving I went to school for computer science I went to Georgia Tech which uh so I left Florida and moved to Atlanta and uh like Atlanta I did yeah and Georgia Tech is like right downtown and it's just like uh I could like walk to you know just all of the I I didn't have a car I didn't get my driver's license till three years ago and so uh and so I didn't have a car uh and so I was like everything was like really walkable and I studied computer science and then started um interning out in California and it was when like my first job out of college was kind of like my resume piece like I interned I interned a Yelp and I really like the team and I was like okay I'm going to really like hone my skills my software skills and stuff here learn learn what I can and then we'll see what's next and I ended up uh getting referred to patreon while I was still at Yelp and I had heard about patreon because of YouTube stuff cuz I knew that like people were starting to use patreon to like support their uh YouTube jobs and stuff so I was like oh it would be cool potentially to work on this product that like supports creators and uh I interviewed I I really like the team there it was a small team at the time the company was like 40 people or something it was you know it's like now it's it was three year it was a three-year-old company when I joined but you know yeah so it was still pretty new and um that was really important for me because uh well one once I had moved out to San Francisco and started like living my life I was like what is my life going to be like what hobbies am I going to have I started doing improv comedy um oh I didn't know that yeah yeah yeah and I started like performing and doing that um and then went to patreon and every one of my co-workers in that early time at patreon was like a talented artist it was like everyone there was like a jazz pianist or like a guitarist or a painter or you know it's just like everyone had some sort of artistic trade that was just like oh but then I work as a designer because like I have to like make ends meet or I work I do this you know sales job but like I'm also the best interior designer you've ever seen you know and um and so being surrounded by so many people like that it was creatively inspiring for me and like uh I just got a lot more creative confidence and I went to VidCon you know vidcon's coming up at the end of this month and I went to VidCon in 2017 and for work like we were Pro promote we were like meeting with people to show creators like a product we were working on and uh in my free time I was going to panels and like how to start a YouTube channel like panels like that and uh I just started my channel after that after I got back from VidCon oh I L that and how how what was the what was the process of growth when did you when did you blow up where you I'm asking this more so for me for research so no this was a so I started in like a different Niche I started doing software engineering like lifestyle Vlogs yeah because um my friend and I started at the same time and her first YouTube video got a million views and I was like now hold on her first YouTube video got a million views her first YouTube video got a million views and so I was like okay hold on wait a minute uh cuz I had made a couple videos it was called day in the life of a software engineer um and it was like it it was literally a vlog set to canals by jokim kude like this royaltyfree royaltyfree song of just like wake up in the morning and it's like people meme on this stuff now where it's like you see that [ __ ] on Tik Tok and it's like where do these people actually work you know you see that kind of [ __ ] but it was like a different time where it was like there wasn't a lot of content like like that yeah and and it was like what is that like cuz it was at a time when um tons of people were wanting to get into the industry things are rough right now there's like a bit of a tech winter there's AI there's like a lot less uh jobs and like software but at the time it was like you're doing this thing how do I get involved in that like and I was I was a TA in college I like L teaching people and sharing things that I know and so I was like oh I can do that also I can pivot off of what I was doing which was just trying to like tell comedic stories and be funny about my life to telling comedic stories and be funny about my life in Tech and so that was like my first 50,000 subscribers were me doing like Tech content I would do like day in the life of a software engineer my whole computer science ree in 12 minutes like like that type of content oh that's dope I did not know that yeah yeah or like Love is Blind I'm such a la yeah yeah no no no I there's not a lot of people left over from this era because uh I scared them all away when I pivoted to commentary yeah uh but basically um I I found uh Drew Gooden's videos in like 2017 and I was like uh Drew is like one of my good friends now um but he does commentary and was kind of you know like there was people like Cody Co and H3 and stuff doing commentary but yeah but like Drew's way of doing it wait he's not an actor or am I imagining that he's not an actor why does he look like you he looks like um you know in the second season of Riverdale when um they get Betty a brother no but I'm sure people are going to find this very funny going to find that person because I'm telling you this person looks just like them um Betty Betty Riverdale brother okay it's not this guy oh yes yes yes I he does look like this guy Charles Smith portrayed by Wyatt Nash yes that's so funny I wonder if anyone's everever said that and they look exactly like d that was who I thought I was like your friend's the guy from Riverdale no no so so when I was watching his videos I was like oh he's like doing jokes like with this backdrop of like this content and I wanted to try doing that but I knew I had a tech audience so I was like I can't just jump straight into it so I started doing commentary videos about software engineering so it would be like the worst software engineering advice I've ever seen where I you know like make fun of people make fun of the stereotypes about software Engineers where it's like oh you need to be so smart yada yada like things that are exclusionary to to people because I felt that way when I was coming into it thankfully like it's huge that I went to school in Atlanta where I I had so many black people around me who were doing the same thing as me and I had black Deans and I had like black student groups and stuff like that that I could be a part of because when I went out to Silicon Valley it was like no one looks like me again round two you know what I mean cuz they're just like all spread out now and then um this guy uh ma day uh and this guy Aston Moes and so these other black software Engineers some of whom were like MIT guys some of whom were like Aston was like the first um black he was the first hire of Dropbox like like employee number three after the founders but he's also you know uh a black dude from MIT and uh they started this thing called Dev color which was like a a resource Group and like kind of club for like black engineers in Tech and that's how it started like black Engineers underrepresented minorities in Tech and um and that was like kind of like the black people meetings for for like tech people and uh and then that was like okay I could find that Community again uh but it there's very much like feeling like an outsider uh and why did I talk about that oh because um well I was talking about like I'm lucky that I felt like I belonged in in college or I had people that like looked like me doing the same thing that I could like look up to and I had mentors and [ __ ] like that who were all like you know uh uh black cuz it was just Atlanta you know there was just so many black people around and um the uh but yeah when I was um I'm trying to remember how I got there but anyway saw so I started doing oh I started oh the exclusionary the exclusionary stuff that's kind of why so it's like I had a different opinion than like what I felt like I felt like I had a unique perspective of like oh actually let's let's let's not make this the the like nerdy Boys Club let's like expand this uh and then I had a friend my friend who video got a million views was um you know a Japanese American woman who was also in Tech and like there's a whole other sort of set of things there so she was like talking about it from her perspective and um and so I uh started making videos that were like commentary about tech or commentary about roasting my old resumés and [ __ ] like that like doing commentary on like why did I make my resume like this this is bad and and it was like trying to you know help people but event I knew that I was building an audience that like I didn't necessarily identify with because try as you might like YouTube is going to make it's uh like the people that were Finding Me were not the people I necessarily wanted to be serving always yeah um and there there people who were like telling me to like take the jokes out of my videos and stuff like that and I was like okay I was like this isn't yeah I'm like this isn't maybe the right place um so I was trying to like um widen that net uh so I started doing like General commentary and I made a video about five minute crafts uh which is like this um content farm that does like horrible life hacks they're still around but they're like way less popular now and that video was like a flop at the time it had like 15 ,000 views yeah uh and then like 6 months later it got like 2 million views like overnight that's or over a weekend and so while that was popping off I like started uh making videos to just literally follow up that video over and over because I was reaching such a different audience and there was no other uh content on my channel that would have been for the type of person that was watching that video I get that so I needed to like kind of build the train tracks like as the train is like going like um and uh that gave me enough momentum to kind of um never look back and kind of pivot yeah okay we love that I didn't know that so when did you get your first 100,000 subscribers like 2018 I think I got I actually don't know but I think I got like 100k and like 500k in the same year that's crazy uh because I blew up like pretty quick CU oh I mean I went from 50k to 250k over like a couple of days that's crazy yeah and then and then uh and then after that there was like some growth but I was still working full-time so it was really hard to like capitalize on the the moment and that was when I first started to think like is this something that could actually be a career but it felt very far off yeah um but by the be by the end of 2018 I'd put in my notice in beginning of 2019 I had like started full-time so yeah we love it yeah and now you live like a Naros I don't know about all that but but um yeah so it's like that was uh um yeah I it was very scary to take that leap of faith but fortunately I was um I was in a career where I not a lot of people out like their first I paid off my student loans my first year out of college yeah it's like not a lot of people are in that situation and I justen to get the right bonuses and [ __ ] like that like at work and things to make that work and uh and so I was able to save some money and basically have a plan where I was like if this doesn't go then I can come back in six months you know yeah or I can come back in a year and then I kind of kept pushing that out and then I'm like okay now I think I'm probably good what's your favorite video you've made is it bad that I don't like a lot of videos that I made but I mean I like them feel that I like them in retrospect uh I do like the metaverse video that I made probably the last video I made but it's been almost a year since I put that out so it's like I really need to let me make sure I've seen this one it's like the most recent video on my main Channel I just never post on my main channel it's crazy how I'm subscribed to all your channels so I never garbage things are popping up okay I'm watching that next to watch later um but yeah so it's like that that is something I like is is more the type of stuff that I want to make in the future but I still haven't made the next thing yet because I just get two in my head about things I get that yeah I fully get that I have a bunch of I have a bunch of video ideas video esses that are like started writing or thought about or have on a list of blah blah blah but do they get made ah who's to say we'll see even one thing that like bums me out sometimes is like I'll be talking to friends who are also YouTubers and they'll like think of a they'll have a video that they're working on that's like probably going to be a very successful video and I like this happened to me recently it's like H you know I had this idea for this video two years ago that was going to be like a similar type of thing but I couldn't get excited enough about it or I couldn't get out of my own head thinking it was a good enough idea yeah and and then that prevented me from like making a thing that probably you know would have been a great idea just fine you know it's like people would have enjoyed it for sure I'm like that I sometimes I put out sometimes I get over that make the content put it out and then still come around to being like ah I don't like it like you know what I mean private ass gone like I I don't like so I get that things like change over time or one little I'll see a typo Aaron and then be over the video for forever I I know what you mean there's like sometimes I don't like if I watch myself and I can tell that I'm trying too hard or I didn't like I know that I'm like for my main Channel videos they're all pretty scripted so it's like oh I this feels too scripted so it like makes me cringe you know and it's like I was still practicing I'm still you know I'm still L like uh there's a video that of mine that people like uh that was on Dan Bill's area and it's very many years old now but in the video I like feel like I overwrote the script I feel like I overwrote the script and I feel like it's a little too obvious that I'm like performing my script and that's what I like about the second Channel cuz I I can just like be myself and improvise and I want to be able to I want to be able to act convincingly in a casual way as myself but it's easier said than done I I'm here to tell you I've watched all content on both channels and that is that is an an impression that only lives in your mind I think you're right absolutely yeah um I you know that I think what I struggle with is I don't you know how it's like oh why you create your artist for everybody else like it's there but it's like I don't I don't think I've come to terms with that I don't think I like subcribe to that like no actually it's my [ __ ] it's still my [ __ ] I I wanted to I used to want to un list or delete my tech videos yeah like like because I was like well that's not what I'm doing now and it was a completely different audience so it's like it's like if you watch an actor doing like uh something that's for kids and you're like oh why are they like so cringey and it's like well it's for a different audience and you're not that audience right and it's like but you know but then you could see that same actor doing like like you watch Malcolm in the Middle and you're like the dad from Malcolm in the Middle is the breaking bad guy and like well this had a different it was a different vibe it was a different thing had nothing to it said nothing about his talent as an actor but I still cringe when I look at those old videos but then I look at the comments and I know how helpful they are for some people or like like and I'm like uh well I don't want to I I guess it is selfish of me you know it's like I guess it is a little bit I know it's in my own head so I should just like Let It Ride yeah I I I I I I definitely I definitely understand that and it is it is it is helpful to folk that's the thing right is like they like it but I do know what it is to be met by the audience like I have three different kind like three major different kinds of content on my channel like technically like five like but um but I have the olna Productions the big video essays I have oay and friends the podcast and I have iconic what we're doing now and I cannot stand when I'm like the other day I got this long comment from this white woman telling me how she loves my urin AI Productions but she doesn't like this oaying friends like go the way it's just like a white lady like Pearl clutching at like black people talk has clearly never seen black people talk and like oay and friends is literally oay and friends like we're having a good time she thought you know when it's like you ever seen like those movies where there's like a like black people are dancing crumping but then they show the white people perceiving it as a fight like pleaseing why are you all so aggressive yes and bringing on all our nothing when hating about here runs up cuz they're crumping like stop that's so funny wow literally that she's like I'm going to not watch these o friends I'll wa for production to come I'm like oh my [ __ ] god lady so I get it I do understand that I do understand that but n you I've never even I feel like your channel has so much content like you would have to seek that to see your old I don't think people I don't think they get recommended them anymore yeah and thus the people who are seeking it out are the people who needed that help like they were looking for that kind of tech help so you can't get rid of it Jaris sorry I I was that I can't no it's like that that passed a long time ago but it was when I was first transitioning into a different type of content I I was I used to get um bring back the tech videos so much that I was like oh bring them back how about I destroy them you know what I mean I would have done that I'm ready like that I absolutely would have done that sometimes like I'd be ready i' be having to remind myself like my [ __ ] is my [ __ ] and also it's monetized because I be the way I be by people trying to police oay and Friends i' be like [ __ ] it no o no friends for anybody yeah I've done that too I have uh I've done that on smaller scales um and I I you know I don't I it's not right it's not wrong but it is what happened I I love that Jaris honestly you always make me feel so like ah I'm not alone cuz you always come off so much calmer and less crazy than me and you also be annoyed by the things I'm I have to I hold myself to such a stupid standard sometimes because I really do just want to like shout into the void or I have like an evil side of me like I have like a vengeful like evil thing and it's like oh I want to like find you and I want to like kick your ice cream cone or whatever you know have you ever seen that there's a TV show on like Hulu I think it's called like shrill with the like white girl from SNL and she like there's a there's a troll like Char she's a journalist like always trolling her like website and she makes the IT person like find them and she goes to his house to beat up like oh I Dre when I said you I was like you wrote this scene for me this is my fantasy right here like beautiful I I like sometimes I wish I could just like tell somebody to their face that they're a bad person it's like very mean I'm like I don't I don't it's for my own selfish catharsis and uh oh man I'm just sometimes sometimes I it's it'll get me into trouble one day I have to you know it's like impulse control like I have to just hold it in I love it I think you do it so well and it makes me you met me I was I cannot express to you how validated how comforting you were to me during the Eric Adams thing oh that was oh my God I was I was so validated I was like so I'm I'm like when I tell you why aren't you choking him out the photo I think you're not really about the cause yo Jaris I was in this house tight like I actually couldn't believe it I was like are y'all serious like are we [ __ ] for real like yo and people were just lying on my name d like showing you like there were people being like you know I always didn't like I always knew something was funny about her didn't she defend Tory Lan I'm like me defend Tory Lan like you literally are just making [ __ ] up you're lying on my goodness they were like oh she probably went to dinner with him she probably went to dinner with Eric Adams oh I was like that's crazy they're like oh I just feel like you know you got to smile in the photo I'm like do you people like yeah and you know I I saw no public apologies like my dad blocked right because no one's they're just it's like so cynical but it's like oh people just want to get their Impressions they want to get their like licks in but but to to what end it's like no one's there's no value to being like upon further in consideration I I really should retract my previous statements right I jumped the gun I was like it's crazy I don't see any of these people coming to tell you how they was lying and play and playing on your name right like but nah but you made me feel real validated that sh annoyed me it was making me annoyed yes absolutely and it was starting to get in my there's this thing where I I'm nosy and I think the Twitter algorithm has changed where it's like whatever you like spend time looking at it's now like recommending more of that obviously to me so I have like a toxic trait where I will just like look at people arguing in the comments to stuff for my own entertainment like I will just like sometimes I'll take screenshots like I think I'm going to use it for Content later like on sabys or something but I never do and then Twitter has just been like oh you just want the worst takes imaginable about everything yeah you just want all the drama and so then it would just be all kinds of stuff where it's like stands of certain creators like arguing amongst themselves about whether someone did or didn't do a thing and I'm like you don't know these people this is ridiculous like get a hob get a real hobby no they really do be like fighting for them I'm like you know at least I don't even feel like uh I don't know how you feel about whether your audience fights for you but I feel like I sometimes but I feel like everybody kind of my audience has a attitude of like she can fight for herself like she can she's good like I don't bring out the like let's please cloak her you know what I mean like I have I have I think okay how do I put this I think that it can very quickly become toxic if you encourage your audience to defend you and fight on your behalf and stuff so I've actively discouraged that and every time I see someone not fighting for me I'm like why did I discourage that why did I I am a prison of my prisoner of my own design I am why don't I just create a world where all my little acolytes like follow me without a critical thought in their mind and fight for me tooth and nail and you and you almost be wanting to especially a moments when people be coming for you but you know why because the scary extreme of the level of liability that gets put on you when they're monsters like as someone who also looks at the drama and sees the YouTube videos and watches all of this and I see I see what's going on I'm watching a whole lot of [ __ ] of [ __ ] I don't say nothing about right exactly exactly I'm very nosy yeah the minute a [ __ ] has like a weaponized like a Discord or a weaponized audience that goes after people you basically become like a boogeyman like you know what I mean like you're a Death Eater now like you're a death you're you're a Death Eater yeah and you got a bunch of little like dark mark kids like going sire sire will will be seeing to this you know it's like okay now I don't want nobody saying that I Cur that's honestly drivers I live in Fe Aaron already like we made a Discord for Lina it's been made it's been done I have yet to say anything cuz I keep feeling like anytime I watch a video on a YouTube Creator's downfall a Discord is always prominent in the story somewhere I I know exactly what you're talking about we have I have a small Discord that I never advertise but luckily I have I have a team of mods who have been with me for like years and years at this point because we I very seldomly ask them for anything so it's a low it's a very low lift engagement but people do like moderate our Discord but it's one of those things where it's like okay every time I've seen one of those discords there's like minors interacting with adults right so then I'm like okay there's no minors on this Discord like uh and we are trying our best to enforce this using like you know discord's like thing but then now it looks like it's a [ __ ] NSFW Discord and it's like no no no that's not what this is no we're we just don't want minors to be interacting with adults so then they can't be minors but I have no children audience to even I've never even considered this cuz not a single minor is a fine of my fan of mine well that's the thing it's like I there's a certain responsibility that I as someone who was a minor who like followed creators and was like influenced by them I am I consider it a um uh I I consider myself very in a lucky position and in a in a position I do not take lightly that I want to kind of wield the power very responsibly and thankfully so far so good because the cutest thing happens which is like someone goes ah well in a year or so I'll be in the Discord but I guess I'm going to so cute but for now I suppose I'll just have to wait and I'm like well thank you for you know thank you for respecting the wishes cuz it's all for everyone's best interest and uh yeah so that's that's cute but I don't talk too much in my actual Discord and every time there's like sometimes there will be a conflict that escalates to me and I'm like all right everybody's banned just get out of here we don't want anybody instigating anything want Good Vibes we want people sharing memes and like Pokemon go friend codes and like that's about it you know how do you decide like um how I guess how to walk the line between like trying to like appreciate your community and build community and engagement and all these different things because obviously like job money all these different things but course while also like mental health because I find that I keep trying to feel like my career necessitates that I like be more active and be more this but the more that I am active or the more that I try to give to my audience the more angry I feel and the more upset I feel like you know what I mean like I remember like two seconds after being like Oh I'll respond to everybody who likes whatever the super chats or if you you know what I mean on on your live thing and then the people are pissing me the actual [ __ ] off in what they're saying when they Super Chat you and they want you to like they want me to like engage their [ __ ] like not even hey uh thanks for the $10 uh the message says oay I really don't like 2third of the content that you put out but the oneir that I do like is good wait why' you have to why' you have to say that why why' you have to make me read that dog it's really is really a thing so how do you do that um easier said than done I think I just don't engage as much as I could um and I so I'm like trying to protect my piece at all costs and uh that sometimes does mean like ruling with an iron fist I had a very fun thing happened where uh a guy let me see if I'm going to get myself in trouble with this a guy who I went to college with who I did not know that well came into my uh Discord and like announced themselves and I was like oh hey dude what's up then I immediately forgot his uh what his username was and then he said something that annoyed me you got and I was like yo this is annoying me I'm going to time you out and and then he like sent me messages on Twitch he sent me messages on uh Facebook then he blocked me then he like he told me he told me I need to do better and I'm like brother like I'm like it's a like I have to rule with an iron fist to keep my own sanity while I'm like streaming or while I'm doing something and so don't take it personal I just have to curate this so that everyone else can enjoy thank you can you cuz tell me so this is the thing that like lives in my mind right like as as a as a child of a problematic childhood where the things that you're you're your parents say to you and your family says you stick with you forever right like I think an and again intellectually you ever you ever be smart enough and enough therapy to know better but it's still oh oh all the time most of my therapy is like look and I know what you're gonna say and it's this but then Counterpoint I can't do that it's too hard you know I want to do something bad for me what was a core tenant of my childhood was my loved ones saying incredibly abusive things and then any push back to that for me or why that's wrong gets gets treated as you nobody just can't say nothing to you like you know what I mean I can't no one can criticize you no one can say whatever and so like having that that that like psychological trigger just of my own like that's a thing I have in life like [ __ ] having a platform or whatever it's like anytime I feel like the internet tries to the internet tries to create rules that enable the internet to abuse you you know what I mean like the internet like it's like me having like I have guidelines on my YouTube comment section like before you go to go when you go to go comment on my session it'll be a guidelines that basically like listen positivity welcomes anything else gets you banished like it will get you blocked and like people there are so many people people leave me the angriest [ __ ] comments like oh we can't say whatever [ __ ] we have to be positive here but you're saying whatever D D and your Chan and it's like exactly precisely yes like yes like like the me comment also like I'm not a drama Channel like I talk about politicians like the only people who get heat on my thing are literal people like killing people let police do it and [ __ ] and I'm also not doing that on their page I'm like I I'm not like on anybody people make hate videos about me I'm not in their comment sections arguing with them or saying nothing to them or whatever have you like I'm like yeah is it not our right to curate our own like they don't get that like I'm not stopping you this is have nothing to do with free speech you're not entitled to disrespect me on my page like you can go say whatever you want onto the internet but like am I allowed am I entitled am I obligated I mean to to let this rock cuz I know there are so many people and I think they're disingenuous creators that have this like oh free market thing but I really think it's just they think all engagement is good all engagement is good because algorithm so they let any kind of [ __ ] Rock because and I also know there's a lot of creators who just like attention like negative or not they like that it R you up I don't like negative [ __ ] I think that I think that there's just different venues are like uh I let more or less I have some like muted terms on YouTube but that I can't remember cuz I set them up so long ago but other than that and then YouTube also has its uh filter other than that that's why I don't read the YouTube comments I have like my producer like hey is there how are the comments looking or I'll look at the top comments that have bubbled up but if I really get down and dirty it's just like why did you feel like you needed to speak on what you're speaking on right now who who is hearing you like hear me out I'm going to say some mean stuff why did you need feel like that needed to be said okay I can't prevent you from saying that so I'm just not going to look and I'm going to look in the places that are healthier for me to that I have better moderation and private moderation cuz like I don't like that it's like uh if you like delete someone's message they're like why did you delete my message I said and then like this message it's like okay your message can stay up but like in my DMs everybody's much nicer right so it's like unless they aren't but then if I don't respond to them or I delete the message no one's there to see it you know oh cuz you don't banish people so you you're just you remove their bad oh no no no if you say something annoying is [ __ ] enough to me the first time to decide I'm getting rid of you all together like I yeah no because I because I because they love to do that followup where they're arguing and screaming about the fact that you remove their comment and it's just like I do love hide user from Channel though yes that's that's exactly good from channel is my [ __ ] I want them to feel like they they're like why is no one engaging with me and you don't know if it's if you've been shadowbanned or if you just had a bad take yes no high user from channel is my [ __ ] like I live for it because it's it's rough um yeah okay good well thank you for making me feel a little bit a little yeah yeah yeah I think that every every Creator is entitled to manage it's it's their they're pruning their Garden you know what I mean like they're they're cultivating their Community however they want and PE it's like people if they're criticizing that sure you're allowed to say whatever but it's not like you don't have a right you know what I mean they're just upset because they want to feel heard and this if they're on YouTube comments then this is clearly one of their place if they're on YouTube writing negative stuff then this is clearly an outlet for them so now it's frustrating that they're being denied their outlet but in reality they need a healthier Outlet anyway you know what I mean like yes and I I think they like never seem to think like I think the thing that I find a little bit frustrating about the internet is the internet thinks that thinks of everything like they gave it to you rather than you are an individual who built your own [ __ ] like I built my content I built this community I built this this I don't have to want to hear from we chose you we we we are the ones yeah yes like they feel like it's their [ __ ] to be able to like be however and it's like no actually I'm trying to create and create something that's an extension to me this is what I'm giving and like I I think it's okay I feel like the internet is always trying to convince you as a creator that you shouldn't give a [ __ ] about you you know what I mean like you should give a [ __ ] about you second and third to whatever it is that they want and if what they want is is to be to say whatever thing about you or whatever have you like the things that people think are constructive comments like or they think are fine like and it's like I don't think fun content right so it's not like people are just annoying me a little bit they're staying like [ __ ] up harmful like stupid disparaging ideas and they think like my obligation like I remember when I I didn't want to engage somebody saiding a bunch of xenophobic [ __ ] about me on my own Friends episode and their aunts they were like oh like and I I try to be nice about it like you know what thank you you can watch something else you know what I mean like and they were like oh you to be passive aggressive like you can engage what I said it's like I actually don't I cannot engage all of the xenophobia amb bigotry and teach every person on the internet about what negative thing you're saying 50 million things that you would have a problem with why can't you point by Point Break It Down Like You have unlimited time to dedicate to some one person who's demanding your attention they're dead ass and they're dead the [ __ ] ass they be so serious and it's like I'm not deleting your comment just cuz like oh you dis agree with me or I think you're Anno or whatever I'm like I literally think you're saying some of the stupidest ignorant [ __ ] up [ __ ] for whatever reason but I have I don't want it to Fester I literally don't want another dummy to read your dumbass comment and think like oh let's come commiserate and build community around this stupid ass point but I also don't have time to engage it but what I will say is one I don't exist in the politics sphere and that insites a certain type of discourse that I am generally not a part of and two I am a sis head guy on the internet and that automatically precludes me from a certain form of like harassment and and and in not even in the most obvious ways but in the like well actually ways because you know like um like my friend Alana Pierce she's in gaming right and every like it's like she could be like the sky is blue today she's Australian she could be like sky is blue today and and and then just like every every dude wants to be like you stupid bee you know what I mean you stupid woman you don't know anything about the sky it's like whoa whoa whoa like I didn't this is not a discourse thing I thought I was stating a fact and it's like well tell me Point by Point why in the marketplace of ideas the sky is not in fact gray um absolutely and it's I just that type of there is a a I was going to call it subtle misogyny but it's very overt it's just like it comes out in a uh it's like people the people engaging in that form of misogyny and especially like Mis Noir and like all these other things like people engaging in that they don't think that that's what they're doing they think it's a unique thought from their mind it be so clear it'd be like textbook one time I one of my friends that was on Olay and friends there was this comment on my Instagram that was like this stupid [ __ ] must not have a father don't know man did a long comment like that I deleted and he messaged me like oh M like I normally love like you know your your content your profile but like why did you delete my well intentioned message or some [ __ ] like that I was like you called her a fatherless [ __ ] and and why can't she engage with me in the marketplace of ideas like why can't she simply defend herself if she does have a father is that she doesn't have a father yeah am I in fact correct it's like they don't oh my god oh J so bad it's so bad but yeah I just like I thankfully uh and this is just I'm lucky in the just like the path that I chose and just the way my natural way of discourse is um doesn't lend itself to a lot of this stuff so usually the stuff that I'm dealing with is like o either over vertly bad faith or it's uh anytime I'm on camera with a woman they tell me that we're dating I some of the comments are insane like um one time I did a collab with my friend Sam and there was a comment that was like they clearly just got out of the shower together and I'm like brother what are you talking about what in the A3 [ __ ] fanfiction ass [ __ ] is this people say crazy [ __ ] I swear to God my boyfriend was in this house was like hot heated after Eric Adams interview sh me in in comment sections right but there were there were people being like oh he must have turned her down for a date or something and that's what I swear to God I swear to God because you were not allowed to engage substantively with someone's beliefs and ideas if if they are of a different sex than you it has to have been romantic and you're just so vengeful because you return down that happens to me all the time you know it is nuts you can I've got to go to my divorce hearing you know it's like it's always some [ __ ] like uh what are your what are your cards jvis and I I I promise you I'm only to ask you a few questions these are these are dividers for uh for cards they're like little they just go in boxes is like but I'm fidgeting you have a box full of dividers uh this is just I have oh it's B you don't even want to see please tell me tell me about your no no no there's just so many cards I I bought 40,000 magic cards magic cards like magic the Gathering like so my my place is like full of [ __ ] like this yeah tell us what kind of secret nerd you are Jarvis I'm not even a secret it's very overt it's it's a it's a trading card game um that was created by Richard Garfield in uh 1993 the first trading card game uh mini came after it like Pokemon with that I'm also into and Yu-Gi-Oh that I am also into um even Disney got into the game recently with a lurana which I'm not into uh but shout out Disney I guess I don't know why aren't you into it since you like all the card trading games why don't well I only have so much money okay and I'm my my business man my accountant is not going to like it if uh I pick up yet another hobby I just opened a pack of the cards and I didn't like the way they looked but sometimes it's that simple um wait let's go through your questions though cuz I do have a I didn't realize I'm I'm going to let I'm going to let you be free I think I have hold on let me just ask you lightning round cuz I can I'm down yes let's let me let me get the lightning round of stupid questions that um my let me don't treat my audiences questions like that let me also show you two of the worst things the most cursed things you're ever going to see uh one this was a wedding favor an Etsy artist made every wedding guest and they made is that supposed to be you it's supposed to be that white man that white man or do you mean this white man this is a just stop doing you this way this was this was so Drew Gooden the guy I mentioned he did a video where he was like he got this Instagram ad for 3D printing photos and uh and so he did it of all of his friends and he and then he presented them to them in uh in in presented them to us in person and he was like I'm so sorry they made you white and so this is white Jarvis that's actually hilarious I have I have your creator Clash card on my fridge oh yeah okay but yeah your question okay I've got your rapid fire okay pancakes or waffles pancakes favorite eveve Evolution Umbreon Umbreon do you still keep up with stuff in the software engineering realm a little bit uh more recently just cuz AI is so big and I'm like man I should probably pay attention to this do you still code sometimes not very often do you do consults uh for like YouTube they just said this sometimes when people if someone reaches out to me and I like know them or like know them through a friend then I will talk to them about stuff uh but usually no just cuz I don't I end up having the time this person says not to be thirsty and nosy but they want to know if you're dating and they want to know your outlook on dating marriage and family and children at this point um I am I am dating it is a hellscape uh I I do I want to get settled down and like have a family one day but I'm not in a rush cuz I want to make sure it's like the right thing uh not just like check the box so I'm I feel like if you want something rare then it should be hard to find you know they said oh so someone has a fall to that they said um how is it dating as a big content creator like does that make it more difficult do people recognize you often not too not too often people do they think I'm a nerd that much as a parent but uh the it doesn't come up that often usually it'll come up with someone like messaging me and referencing they're they're a fan and then I can kind of avoid them yes can you be on dating apps can you still be on dating apps I can yeah but I think if I was uh I think just cuz I'm more of a a niche I'm I'm like a if you're aware of like if you watch YouTube in this corner then you know who I am but otherwise it's like you know you don't so you never you never worry you're going to suddenly see business on Twitter uh I don't conduct myself in a way where I think I conduct myself in a way where I'm always a fearful of that yeah not even in a negative way I just don't even like that idea of people talking about like oh they see that you're on this dat I want on a date with someone and then he told me like at the end of the date or twice like that they were already like fans on the internet and I didn't like that okay well that I would not like that either that hasn't happened to me and I think it's because the people who are fans of me know how I would feel about something like that so because I've probably talked about it but yeah it hasn't it hasn't happened you know n on wood okay their last two questions is what's the time you can recall that made you into the person you are today and what advice would you give to Young content creators um I think that uh I think that the story I told kind of at the beginning of the podcast is very formative for me uh for young content creators would say that like if you can find time to just make stuff and experiment and have fun then do it don't focus on making it a career cuz that is like winning the lottery uh unless unless you want to do some [ __ ] that you don't care about in which case you can be very like um methodical about it but I'd say we don't know what's going to happen always have a backup plan don't put all your don't put all your eggs in a content creator basket cuz you know there could be a apocalypse tomorrow and all of us could stop making money you know this is true I mean again knock on what I'm hoping not but uh it's like do I still code I'm like I should make sure my skills are sharp enough no that mean like do I have to go and be in the court and I'd rather dead every time Alex is trying to get a job I'm like why don't you stop being a lawyer is the worst no but I do think it's something that you can make work if you put your mind to it but it is not something that you can make happen on a timeline you can't choose when like lightning is going to strike with the algorithm you can just kind of have the library of work there when the time comes so don't quit your day job like you know before before like I didn't quit my day job until I had like 400,000 subscribers and I was making like like at least a reasonable amount of money per month to like that would support me yes beautiful thank you Jarvis of course thank you so much for having me you're always amazing Jarvis
