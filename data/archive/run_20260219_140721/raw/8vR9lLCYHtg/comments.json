They’d be saying it so much it rang obviously false, everybody knew it. And then you’d see them on TV at a fundraiser, talking to a white audience with the code switched and the policies of “law and order” front and center. \n\nEric Adams so desperately wants to convince his fellow black people that he’s on their side, when he’s obviously in the bag for capital and white supremacist forces. It’s nakedly just political doublespeak, and he’s not even good at it. Even Charlemagne didn’t buy and that guy was uncritically parroting the GOP line on immigration the entire time.",
