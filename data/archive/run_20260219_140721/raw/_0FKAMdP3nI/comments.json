    "text": "By interfering in 1953 . The United States and Britain left the Iranian people with a terrible problem . \nBringing in the shah only benefited western interests and created a distrust amongst the people and their government. He was a rich kid who didn’t know the struggles of most Iranians . This distrust led them to the ayatollah and is what started the ‘79 revolution . The people had hope for the ayatollah but the war with Iraq (backed by the US) turned the religious leaders even more conservative and anti American . This fueled the proxy wars in Yemen and Syria .\n\nNow people in Iran are struggling at the hands of both their own governments conservative policies and US economic sanctions . Our best hope is to have a leader , who leads secularly but still has national interests as a number 1 priority.  Somebody with socialist ideals like Mossadegh",
