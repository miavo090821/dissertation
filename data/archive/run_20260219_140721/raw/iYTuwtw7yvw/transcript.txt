we got to understand when we're saying humanize we're not saying make excuses for we're figuring out the why we have to unpack everything involved in this and we have to keep our Humanity about it because if we don't we're never going to understand it to do anything about it we know all of the whataboutism that are about to happen rather than just simply looking at this person and we as a collective need to all say this is objectively wrong I think it's really important for us to think about power really really simply as the ability to either wield violence or to have a shield against people having violence against you people are okay with buying into the idea that powerful men men who make a lot of money and successful should be able to exploit women and men and boys and whoever they consider you know what I mean like people buy into that [Applause] right hello beautiful black people look and assada assada is here today sitting here like this is oh she's being a good cat oh is we love proac listen cause that cat I heard until she just swipes do that no more she's change I love that I love a good pivot I love a good pivot honey cuz that would be a mess first of all I would I would honestly feel so redeemed if I had video evidence of the way ass was [ __ ] us up in this house like way people yo people who don't like me on the internet were trying to like reframe

psychopath anymore we go we used to pray for times like this like we be so you don't understand the amount of gratitude we' be in the house like thank you God yes we literally never thought I I when I did not know what to do because I was convinced I need like I was like I I was called to rescue her off the road like and I CJ to take her house I thought it was going to be like how it's always been rahee was a good rescue cat Brutus was a good rescue cat when she started us up in his house I was like and every doctor every behavioralist and they were like get rid of this cat and they're like no

and here I am telling you to let go of that cat and all that cat needed was your belief and that's why she the way like one of them friends support her friend with a no good man H change listen Prozac when I tell you Prozac is literally like it has to be mad like it's a godsend like assada is and it's not like she's not herself like she drives she's still a ganger like know they made drugs for cats in that way I didn't know that they um you know would those type of drugs they have anxi the doctor said that assada is autistic and has anxiety not the cat being I never knew they said she's autistic I didn't say it earlier because I was like at the time when the jury was still out on whether we could keep her and she was F I was like if I tell them the cat is autistic they will Stone me the street if I get so I want you to know I fought with my babies like I I worked on it okay and you did now look at her hair Loving Her Mama but anyway that being said we're not here to talk about cats unfortunately we are here to talk about Diddy and I am gonna put it to the room immediately because I'm sure we have lots to say me wherever y'all want to start there's so much there's sobody even like like Beyond just in being criminally indicted denied bail like the fact that it's really like The Jig Is up times for Diddy but then the amount of people who were coming out with more stories and lawsuits like Dawn Richards I saw like file a lawsuit and she had a lot of like there was a lot a lot of allegations was a lot yeah yeah so there was Dawn I see shine finally speaking up about what you know Diddy did and all of this so to the room well I'll start a little bit because I the latest that I've seen I did see that shine just made a statement saying that didd he ruined his life although um was it two years ago I'm not saying that did he didn't rule his life but he people in power let's let's put this out here everybody says that everyone who is speaking up now why you speaking up now why are you making your statement now and that's what they do to victims a lot and I know that what we saw because I was going to go there what we saw in 20122 I want to say when um young Miami was holding the poppy sign up at the BET Awards and they gave um uh Diddy the lifetime achievement or whatever that was but you know shine had came out we haven't seen him in so long and we know that he took a bid allegedly for um Diddy and his whole life has changed and since then he's um you know living at believe and belies he's uh working in politics there yeah and so his life has since changed but now his story is coming out they was like n you know because you were there on stage with him you did um you know praise him for what he's done in your life then and now you're saying this same thing for everybody else who spoken out when we heard Cassie speak out the first time they was like but why now why wait even after the video we seen But understanding um this is the victim blaming this is the victim shaming that we're going to get a a lot and Don Rashard who spoke up who used to be a part of what Danity Kan with the group that he created um and then when they she was a part of Dirty Money Dirty Money didy Dirty Money whatever and so she made she spoke up what she said the other half I I can't remember her name I'm not disrespecting her but the other woman that was on in the group she put out a statement saying that none of these she didn't see any of these things happen similar to what Young Miami said she you know I was around them I didn't say any of these I didn't see any of these things happen he never trapped me in the car he never made me do sexual things or make me watch sexual things he never tried to um uh you know make yeah he never tried to hurt me and so people were saying that if she saying that if the other half of the um the woman and I really want to get her name but if she didn't say anything then we should Elena Elena colen so with her she you know she put out her statement I said two things could be true still she maybe never experienced that but that shouldn't take away from the people who did and who are sharing their story now when you see a person in power didd he I always say when he changed his name to love saying that he was God all these type of things that whole power play I was like see something's about to happen and he's going deeper in those Psychopaths that abuse power and and and use it to hurt people um we've seen him do it with the groups that he's created we watched them on television do it for a long time um and threaten folks uh we heard the account of uh Shaka kan's daughter I want to say talk about how Diddy had beat up her brother and uh she and so bad and threatened their family and a lot of these things people are saying but they just trying to tear a black man down they just want to bring a black man down and it's like okay he's a black man that did something wrong that's we're not saying this is a general black man consensus we're saying that this black man did wrong and that's okay that we can say that these there's so much evidence to the fact where when we were hearing the attorney speak I couldn't even get my mind off he was saying freak offs that's how you know it's like they're calling it freak offs this is what he called it this is on tape what they found they're not letting him go he will continue to be detained whether or not his children had even fronted their passports so that they can um ensure that okay he gets at least bail and they denied that so there's something plausible here and we shouldn't just be like oh they speaking up too late and he's a father he's a people that he hurt were mothers fathers people who had lives all of the above and I think that we shouldn't um you know what the internet's going to do what the internet does but I believe that he's gonna go down Cat Williams said it when he sat on sh Shay's couch and he ain't been wrong since who I guess I'm not seeing that on the internet I'm seeing a lot of people um almost celebrating the fact that he's being held accountable in this way even folks who I consider to be abolitionists are like yeah lock his ass up which is very interesting and that's also a side of it that I that I always like am interested in discussing I I love that you brought up you know I I don't see this but I'm happy that you're bringing it up and addressing it because you know I don't think that people understand the type of power that did he had and like any millionaire in that position and like like when I'm reading these indictments I'm hearing how he's putting people up in hotel rooms and like that's their home and then threatening to take it away if they don't you know engage in this quote unquote freak off and even that terminology is very interesting to me like a freak off it feels like it was sport it feels like these people it's it makes me think about Gladiator and how like that um Emperor whoever is sitting on the chair and looking at all the people like just fight to the death it's like I feel like that was his way of being in these spaces even though we don't know I mean the feds do cuz they got video but I also think it's him not receiving bail is is so telling it's so telling and I think that people are saying that it's unfair but I'm I'm inviting folks to consider the fact that this man all of the things that he actually did put up right that he did offer up and it wasn't even just his like you said children even his mother like tons of assets he paid off $18 million of his mortgage to be able to offer that as collateral and then to be denied and there's two we're not I mean I've been thinking about them but I don't see a whole lot of people thinking about those two girls who don't have any parents now they have no parent and then to still be denied with that being the case is very is very telling I mean they said that he called Kena 54 times and then all of a sudden that story goes up I mean so he's definitely tampering with Witnesses he's definitely still using the same old tactics I will say that I have no I won't I'm not going to say that but the there the pattern here is that a lot of people who are abusive in this kind of way they need power they come off very charming and they love bomb and then all of a sudden when things start to fade they Gaslight you and you're the reason why things are changing and so this is also part of the unlearning this is why some people are are just now coming forward because half of these people think it's them and half of these people also don't recognize the fact that like there is another way there they do have support and they didn't have support they I mean it's uh oh can y'all hear that yeah that's from mares um so I don't know I I see the jokes and I'm like I see a lot of focus on the the lubricant and the baby oil but I'm also somebody who like I I've suffered from sexual abuse I've suffered from rape I'm somebody who's been in an emotionally abusive relationship and I'm just like yo this [ __ ] ain't it's not funny it's actually deeply disturbing and what disturbs me more is how many people are conflating this I this idea of oh he's being persecuted for being a freak versus you know he was he was manipulating drugging and raping people and had a criminal Enterprise that that um facilitated this and I it's just going over some people's heads and I'm like and people who like I have some respect for that I would expect more from so I'm just like y'all really don't know the difference between you know having sex and rape like we still don't know that in 2024 how hard is it I'm struggling with this I'm like I'm of multiple Minds because on the one hand I'm really fling with that was just saying that like you know as someone who's experienced you know sexual assault rape molestation all those things like that triggers me in a way reading this indictment um but as I was saying like before we before we started recording when this when our Kelly's mess came out again for the 20th 30th 80th time right like I was saying then like yo this is what someone that is illiterate is able to do right this is someone who in the grand scheme of like Moguls is a small bit player right doesn't own his own tracks doesn't have billions of dollars like like a diddy like a Jay-Z or whatever and I was like yo if they get R Kelly the dominoes are really going to start to fall because he is not like he's just a symptom of a lar big head hono right he's not he's not even that can barely finish a sentence right so if he's able to pull this off in Chicago under the nose of some of the most aggressive prosecutors in the country that's huge but on the other hand I'm looking at this Diddy thing and I personally I believe everything happened in the indictment but I've been curious and concerned about what the prosecutors are talking about this I think to anet's point the prosecution and the the governments for the the lawyers for the government have been focusing on the freak part of it about deviant about sexuality about the fact that there were men a thousand bottles of what a thousand bottles of lube is not germine to the case yeah right you're doing this to kind of make a make a kind of spectacle out of this and I hate the way that prosecution prosecutions generally make a spectacle out of people involved with sexual violence particularly those experiencing it but I I I hope that we're able to get in this conversation too a focus on people that are actually doing commercial sex work uh because it seems that as if like everyone that is involved in these parties has now been marked as a victim and I want to be very clear about the agency of people that are actually involved in commercial sex work that are getting paid to do this particular type of work and they should not be vilified by association right with Diddy and others and I thought it was really interesting to I mean some of us have talked about bail already but I think it's important to note right that if you are charged with sex trafficking you're presumed to not be able to have bail right so it's it's a rebuttable presumption which is different and Al you can correct me more this if something more particularly New York law but it's different than a regular court case where you're presumed to be innocent with sex trafficking the presumption is you will not get bail so that doesn't really speak to the strength of the evidence in this case it speaks to the fact that this is the charge that he was indicted on so we don't really know right whether the evidence has been probed how strong it is who the Witnesses are whatever but what we do know is that anytime someone is charged with sex trafficking the notion is you will not get bailed period yeah is really rough yeah generally the the presumption on bail in New York City in general is um that the purpose a bail is to to make sure you return to court right so like in the case of Diddy ese in the case of Diddy just his amount of resources the amount of homes the fact that he's being accused of things like sex trafficking which inherently carries with it you know traveling your ability he you know he has they have they have reason to believe that that that Diddy would be a Flight Risk you know what I mean like somebody who may not return to court which I'm shocked he didn't flee in the first place actually I'm shocked me too I thought that like you know I looked at it like yo Trump is free like 4K this a white manrow the whole government like is that not a r because the two terms rder risk of Public Safety yeah and Flight Risk and they said that he was both yeah and he and and he and here's my thing I I didn't think he would flee because he even in the how he responded when the video came out where in the hotel room with Cassie and how he responded you know he came out like this is how Diddy Diddy when Diddy knew something was coming up that man try to really he said you know what and I said this before on um oay and friends that man said you know what I'mma go to the Lord who can I get I'm gonna go get the best of the best and that's T Jake and I'm gonna make him my mentor and I'm going to wherever I'm going I'm going to have him there with me I want people to see how I'm being revitalized renewed under God and now I'm such a good person and I know these things are going to come out but the church will have my back I'm going to change my name this is still a power play because Psychopaths that are in power and abuse power right and utilize that to attack people to hurt people uh to control people so what he did was change his name to love and God is love and he would always say God is love and all this other stuff but you're not God he wanted to have that Persona and he went over there and he said I'm gonna get the black church usually the black church you know they're very forgiving especially when it comes to a black Mogul of some sort um so let me yeah let me attach myself to to to TIY Jake the best of the best and we saw TD Jakes at these House Parties it was just very uncomfortable but he knew if they see me attached to him I get a Lifetime Achievement Award I'm gonna talk about God there people are going to be like but he changed he pivoted and you know like you were saying you know he but but he changed though but sometimes you got to believe people for who they are so many different accounts have already came out before Cathy said what she said all of those there were different accounts that already have came out but those were people who who weren't popular people you know who weren't high-profile so their accounts aren't going to be taken serious and now we see here and that's I'm like he he handled it as okay I'm gonna stand here I'm let them know that I I it wasn't me I'm I'm not I'm not a Flight Risk I'm going to show myself as that he knew that if he did run it would be more of a whole thing he would be looked at as guilty so anything to make him look as if he wasn't guilty I'm going to stay in place I'm going to have you know I'm going to show them that you know I was I was here at the home I I obliged I cooperated and you know you'll see when it comes out that's what he kept saying you'll see as it comes out go ahead that makes me think of a bit that Chris Rock has want to stand up to think when he was talking about Kobe Bryan he was like oh Kobe should have hired hire Johnny Cochran and people are like oh we can't hire Johnny Cochran because he looked guilty and he's like yeah but he' looked guilty at home like rather than his and I'm like when I hear I'm like you know didy you might want to I guess to me it was very clear that this went passed just a matter of public indictment a long time ago when they issued the warrants to when they searched his home he should have known then this is no longer just about civil suits money and taking a time off period you period you need to get like Russell Simmons and and I honestly thought he was he did know though I think that we're not giving him enough credit for his arrogance yes I think about to say but I'm sure he's that arant he did know cuz cuz he that's why he paid off that house and that's why he was in New York to be taken in he knew he still like Cassie What's mindboggling to me is she wanted to handle this privately yeah and he which says something about the collective right yeah he knew we wouldn't believe her and he was like I pay you [ __ ] [ __ ] out of here you ain't gonna say nothing if you do I'm gonna paint you this kind of way and as soon as that dropped he paid her off and still said she was a liar and still and still and what's still going on with this entire Rebrand and with this Narrative of this Mogul holier than thou it gives you insight into I'm not a therapist I'm not a medical professional but this is like psychotic sociopathic Behavior to me where I'm just like yo you're literally living in an alternate reality you're literally gaslighting all of us because you have been able to and you know that people know that's the thing these other accounts you know people have witnessed you abuse her and you know what else he counted on that they wouldn't say anything I'm looking at the ushers the NEOS the security guards the assistants the housekeepers the makeup artists everybody who helped cover up his abuse and his crimes are all culpable to go ahead just a quick question because you were talking about Usher like do you consider remember Usher gave that interview and he was like when I was 13 he's a victim yeah so like do you see him as like groomed or like I don't know how to groomed groomed groomed certified yeah there are more than one there are more than one interviews with Usher there was one where he was on the street interview there was one where he was a sit down interview and each time the account was he it was to the tea and he even said um in one interview recently that's going um around on the internet he said said um you know I'm like I'm okay Diddy I'm here you trying to get me with some girls I'm not trying to be around no girls I want to he said he went in there and was like this time I want I'm here and I want to do music I'm like I'm a child I want to do music and they were like would you allow you as a as a father now would you allow your children to be around a diddy he said ver no he said no I wouldn't I would not absolutely not yeah absolutely not you know what it is though like the here's the up part right like this is one of those times where like I haven't even seen the internet discourse like I'm not on socials and I don't engage it I know how the black community responds to [ __ ] in real life like I am this real life from R Kelly to all of it to blah blah blah because my little sister just called me to tell me you know you know my mama is hair on Diddy side oh like so yes Mom watching like she was on R Kelly side because there is a generation that give it up like that you know what I mean of of of black women too you know what I mean like trust me don't even get me started so because I want to read a a a tweet from boozy and not even just boozy's the sentiments he's expressing is not even it's not even just that that's incredibly up in a reflection but the fact that booie is even a character we still like the community Embraces and likes in the first place is a reflection of why didd he felt like he could do we could find out about a Cassie and all these different things and live to tell the tale because booy is somebody we know paid literally paid adult women to perform sexual to rape to rap his his underrated son and nephews and we're like that's fine we watch him harass Lil Na's X in the gay community for literally years that's fine you know what I mean so it doesn't shock me that he would say this what I what I am disappointed in is the fact that like our community continues to make jokes out of these people and these things and want to embrace them over but this is what this idiot said he tweeted I feel Diddy in jail for basically doing what every other famous Entertainer has done flew [ __ ] out for three SS he just freak here we actually go call women prostitutes who fly who fly in willingly to be with their partners for sex if that's the case if you've been fluid out had sex you should be labeled a prostitute that's the case that 80% of the women reading this and trafficing you're a celebrity you got a fly [ __ ] and how else you got you can get the [ __ ] you're never in one place when I saw that video I was pissed off with the like he really got a problem but facing life in prison for basically doing what so many others entertainers have done it's so cra it's so czy how the level of re of of completely they try to rewrite and they do this is the thing though in in the hip hop Community they do rewrite narratives all the time it's the way like an Eminem lyric will have thinking that like de barns just got slapped and no one knows the real horrific story like they do rewrite hip-hop does that all the time it's the way they rewrite like real stories we know and they just let these artists just start telling narratives that downplay it and that's why they're focusing on the baby oil that's why they're focusing on all the freak offs and blah blah blah but they're not seeming to point out this is has these are women and men and multiple people coming forward to tell you they were raped they were drugged they were forced to do these things they were losing their homes their resources so what the [ __ ] are you talking about trying to pretend oh he's just freakier and I think the greater thing that you have to like unplug or unpack is the fact that he's like his overall premise not only is he like creating an entirely strong like a straw man but it's the reason he's creating the straw man is because he feels that well all these powerful famous do it and that's the problem like yes yeah well if that is the standard then heads are going to roll I'm sorry as long the people I'm not sorry the people that are on these tapes engaging with f and that's the thing I don't have an issue with sex workers and I think that we should be really specific on this in this conversation around that I don't believe that sex workers show up to work to be drugged to be physically assaulted to to be I mean they they said that there were IV packs because of how [ __ ] up these people would be after this so-called freak off that they would have to be had intravenous iv put in their arms in order to recover there were people hidden in hotels to recover from the physical abuse that they experiened during freak offs when they would not do certain things that Diddy wanted them to do because he would beat them and so they would be hidden away so that is not a part of sex work that's not what folks are signing up for and I just want to be real clear about that and I think I've been watching the news a lot more too and even seeing like the way that they're positioning it it's all a sense of like this deviant it's not necessarily around like the actual assault and so the way that I worry about the media positioning a lot of it and how they're talking about it is around like oh this is sexual deviant this is what um they're doing so it's going into the lore of like you're doing this thing that should still be taboo and in a world where there's like this idea of sexual Liberation and all this other stuff and the acceptance of sex work as work I think they are also looking at this as a way to position it where it demonizes anybody who participated but it also puts a shield up for men in particular because now it's just like well you willingly participated in this thing yeah because for Diddy to still go well I won't invite any women over that also signals something very particular around like oh we don't care around the men that may have experienced this we don't care and the trans and the nonbinary folks trans folks that were included in these videos as folks are reporting because he's capitalizing on the shame that comes along with some of those spaces that people try to do in hiding so he was able to not only capitalize on shame he's also able to capitalize on the fact that it's easier to believe men it's easier to demonize women when it comes to sex um men are rewarded for sex women are not rewarded for sex and so it's really like the societal structure of like oh patriarchy is winning um women are going to be shamed but not only that he has people on camera and so even when people try to go and that's what I think is like the piece around specifically like Don's um accounting of recounting of it is because there was a lack of safety around as well and so though she did not want to be in that space it's also understanding like oh you were there were PE it was if felt like when women have to kind of give each other the look and be like hey friend how are you when they see something that's uncomfortable happening but you have to do it in a very particular way not to alert that something like danger can come your way and so even way that they had to navigate I I know personal friends who had to do stuff like that and that part of Don recounting is what's particularly triggering because know when we get what happened with Kina we now figure oh there was intimidation and she feared for her life as well that's the Humane aspect of like how particularly I see women having a move and whereas the men who are participating in this thing and those men who are also victims and non um and fem there is a difference on how they have to navigate this space because now it's like did you willingly participate or did you sign up for one thing and then you were coerced into another situation that up for but now because of how you're existing oh now I can be associated with this this too with the Crackdown on like black quer people and sex parties um because like I hear the notion of like people are on ketamine and then needing an IV in the morning and I think if that is something like in this case where it's forcable right and you didn't sign up so I think Maris anet's Point that's a really serious thing but I also don't want to paint with a broad brush because if you go and I'm not going to name the parties because you know they probably shut the places down but in certain cities if you a black career person and you want to get your fre on you want to go to a nude party a sex party people are taking ketamine it's a thing to go get your IV in the morning that's a cultural thing so I think we have to be very clear about like what is happening here where people are not signing up for [ __ ] they're having bruises as Antonette said having like being restrained like being physically harmed versus people that really just want to go consenting adult you want to be glory hole you want to be in a dark room and you need your IV in the morning baby because you did Kine poppers and all the [ __ ] and you busted open and you have the right to do that and just because you have the right to do that and you desire it with one group doesn't mean you wanted to do it with Diddy right you want to do everyone so I think we just got to be like contining I'm glad that brought this up and Maris too continue to underscore the difference between like the consent here commercial sex workers and also someone El want to be a freak right but that don't I want to be a freak with you today yeah I think that um yeah the consent and the coercion right um I feel like looking at though from the male perspective with the the male the males that we see who are speaking up um for Diddy uh we see booy booy who was at I it was troubles party um then they had the Cucumber party and when booy filmed Right girls having cucumbers and the whole thing that we know went viral it wasn't such a problem but when I think it was Alexis Sky I want to say partook in it it was a whole thing they pinned on her it was a whole thing but booy's known to be at these parties we know his history what he's done to he what he's done with his children right um uh hired sex workers to rape his children um and then with him at this party seeing nothing wrong with using cucumbers on people whatever and then when Alexa sky this is how he view it Alexa Sky he didn't speak up for her when they everybody was tearing her apart but when he went viral for going live and showing this whole cucumber party situation and the sexual activities nobody said nothing about booy doing that it was just booy at another sex party promoting that kind of stuff booy's used to being around these things fison I believe his name fison love the actor comedian him coming out with his commentary saying you know what we saw on video with Cassie um uh Diddy should be in jail for that but let's talk about why is him being a freak why is him doing sexual acts um a problem that should not be a crime but that's not what he's um that's not the crime here what he's done to people how he did this uh the how he coerced allegedly people into doing this stuff people signed up for one thing right and they were and another thing was done then how he was going around it said obstruction of justice I even was going around calling folks trying to sell them what story to tell if there's no if there's no crime here then let them give their accounts but he was giving everybody a story to tell he called lots of people to give a story to tell on what happened and so with men it's kind of like yeah I hate I hate and I'm going to use that word I you use that word often but I do I hate I despise when men get a pass and it's like y'all know how men are y'all know how men in the industry are this thing has been going on these type of parties have been a thing you know how men gonna do you know how they do they they sexual creatures they're sexual really saying what they're you know how men are is you know how we don't care about these kinds of victims because it's really what it is it's like we don't care we are they buy and we talked about this mad times they buy into people are okay with buying into the idea that power ful men men who make a lot of money and successful should be able to exploit women and men and boys and whoever they consider you know what I mean like people buy into that right so like once they're able to put it as these women and then they they add the stigma it's funny men when men and boys are the victims of of sexual sexual abuse they have their like they have their sexual orientation litigated they have all these different you know what I mean so they're disregarded is it's not even just the element of like oh it's you know how the men do it's also these people we don't care about protecting these people um and I think something I want to make sure I I I talk about is like when people talk about powerful people they never really talk about what that means like what power means and to me that is obviously missing from this discourse if people keep acting like they can't understand why you're just now hearing from shine why you're just now hearing from these people and it's like you know for a fact off the things that we know to be confirmed fact kid Cy confirming that he is a person who blew up his car you know what I mean like these people yes like you know this you've seen you know certifiably that he is a danger to people's lives that's one call that domestic terrorism otherwise consistently and all of the indictments and all the discussion of these parties what I hear is also a lot of police presence a lot of security and that gave these and that's what they talked about they had every reason to believe they would not be protected by anybody because Diddy had a relationship with the police so understand what it means to be a powerful man being powerful does not mean oh we black people all really respect him and really we really [ __ ] with him for the '90s that's not what that means means it means he has a [ __ ] ton of money influence and connection and the ability to in this case not only ruin your life destroy your life or take away the dreams that you have or your livelihood or your home but in some cases end these people's lives like understand that some of the people at Kim Porter is talked about in all these discussions all these indictments of the abuse that she experienced all of this there are many people whose stories who have we have heard stories and what we used to deem as conspiracy theories about uh Diddy throughout the years who are no longer with us so understand what me when me say why a powerful person why you would see shine get out of prison get out of prison after did he sent that boy to prison on on on something he did not do that did he did we all know it he has gotten out he is now in politics and beliefs and he still did not feel comfortable telling youall an honest word about how he felt about that until he was behind bars so understand that's what it means it should tell you the level of like power and influence and what fear these people live in that they all no one felt they didn't feel safe you know what me to speak up until now I think I was especially frustrated when I heard his lawyer speak especially when he was talking about he was referencing Cassie and like Cassie is she was a willing participant in this she had family she had friends she had her own home she could have went home he also stalked her at the house like come on we read Cassie's Cassie's lawsuit like we know the type of power that he wielded I mean I I also want to be clear that they found guns at the house with the serial number scraped off that's a that's an offense baby you can't do it that's like hello like that's another part of this also there are reports saying that some of these people were underage right boom right there crime that's not a consenting adult right so that's the other part of this this the the def the defendants kind of argument that I'm just like okay they're going to lean into the freak thing the media is helping them with that they're going to say that everybody's just a freak sure I'm not a I'm not an ideal citizen sure I cheated on women and I I I've made mistakes but I didn't commit any crimes well there's a lot of crimes there's art even if I don't get you on the trafficking there's arson there you got these weapons there's uh drugs in your home like there's all kinds of [ __ ] bro so but when people deem you as a sexual they're leaning to it into it on purpose even like the lawyers and the media because when people deem you a sexual deviant like when they have that idea about you they don't give a [ __ ] about anything else because they believe you deserve you were into whatever immoral [ __ ] you was into that's not our business you know what I mean the minute they hear sexual Devany and they then attribute that to every person that is in this they like oh I don't need to go look into the facts I don't need to look at anything having a G having a gang bang threesome is is worse than blowing up somebody's car yeah what we talk focus on that part of it the most and that's the problem because we did hear about the arson in Cassie's uh whole lawsuit she brought that up she like uh kid Cy and kid Cy came out and said this did happen gave his account of exactly what happened and people that that's a whole big thing like that's arson and then y'all waited for that video to come out and be like I mean he was going through a hard time you know why because that Rebrand that he did where he got close to Jesus and they were like you know people do these things and but God and no he's a criminal he's a terrible person and he must how about reap what you sow that's also in the Bible so he needs to definitely go down for the crimes that he committed and these are just some of the things if we're talking about all of these things he should be tried for these crimes he should go down for it Diddy is not above the law although like you said Olay powerful people which we understand we we have to understand that they are going to have so much power that they create relationships with the law until it door but all that Eric Adams gave New York City we we had a diddy day Eric Adam you see and it's like that's like oh we're gonna I know what you've probably done I've heard about what you've done some of these things are true but you know what you're a powerful player I'm a powerful player you scratch my back I scratch yours we're good to go you had people Pro protecting the home but not protecting the people within the home and doing all these things that you were doing you are a dangerous person even so that they said you know what even though he got kids he take care of his kids he's still considered a Flight Risk he's still still considered a danger to society so we're going to keep his behind until we get more information and and and I feel like with what was already given to us people want to focus because here we go we can go back to how they are anti- lgbtqia plus they are anti-women they are anti-black women and they are just Pro another black man going down another black man was trying to buy bet all that stuff and it's like no this black man did terrible things and he must go down for what he did we cannot continue to coddle them because of their power or how we see them in music and how we cannot differentiate the two and I think go ahead oh I think that's exactly like what you were touching on a lot because all I'm seeing is like this is the physical manifestation of how patriarchy functions this is how men are protecting other men this is how a lot of the time we protect the few who make it make it to the top of the top as well and so as we're talking around powerful men as we're talking around this Code of Silence that was made it's also because somebody just wanted access to the power that didd he made them feel right and so at this point I actually don't have to care about the woman I don't have to care about children I don't have to care about any of this the only part of the shame that's probably going to happen is the assumption that I was partaking in sexual deviant right and it's not like it's necessarily the one it's coded homophobia and that's really what it is at the end of the day today and how people are discussing Diddy how they're discussing the power how Diddy understands how these structures actually work and the people around understand how this works because it's also at the end of the day if we even take it back to Childhood what are boys rewarded for getting the girls what are we teaching boys a lot of the time when we signal to them and so even if this is the case if we just take it back to children now this signals oh power is the that a CH a young boy must maintain in order to attain manhood and then when you go up to try and attain manhood and you see somebody who reaches sexual domination who reaches power who reaches money and Status that's what they sell to black boys right that's they sell to the black community and then for us to say dang there's one of us up there right so we need to protect him at all possible causes it does not matter what he does because guess what that he must be the Fall Guy yeah that's what they're going to lean with somebody else has done this then they're going to Pivot and say well why didn't they go so hard on a white person who was doing the exact same thing we know all of the whataboutism that are about to happen rather than just simply looking at this person you did a shitty thing this is the consequence you were absolutely going to get and we as a collective need to all say this is objectively wrong yeah and I think there is a moving barometer in terms of what our moral code can be in some cases not I'm not saying us but like just in general this is what the moral code is there's not a critical mass of everybody who's ascribed to this thing because I still want access to that power he got I still want to be able to enact harm because that's power to me that's the reality to a lot of That's So key Maris because I feel like our new thing not us but collectively a new thing a new approach we're conflating freedom with like the ability to do the [ __ ] up stuff white people do with impunity yes and that is not Freedom right you know that is replacing one like that's replacing whiteness with like you're just putting right like I feel like the diddies I won't name other people because I don't want to put them into the having a problem with the system having a problem with your place in the system but but also having a problem with the but there that power thing and there's that there's that impunity thing where it's just like I don't have to answer to anyone I don't have to consider anyone else I don't have to be about a collective I'm bigger than the collective and I feel like there's a lot of folks who are striving to that yeah and that is the new idea of success that is the new idea of even freedom and that is so mindboggling to me it's it's it's not even funny let me bring it back because y'all know I like to bring it back to slavery child it's really important for us to think about the fact that like during enslavement there were black people that got free and wanted status and owned black people there were Native Americans namely the Cherokee that once that they got there you know were pushed off Trail of Tears terrible genocidal [ __ ] that happened right we giving land in Oklahoma and Kansas was taken away they they got their status with the United States government this IST catching runaway slaves and selling them either back into slavery or enslaving themselves or having their Community as workers and denying them citizenship into these native States right so this is something that is part and parcel of American culture and American history and I was want to go back to something Olay was saying earlier about this idea of power I think it's really important for us to think about power really really simply as the ability to either wield violence right or to have a shield against people having violence against you and I'm talking about violence not neily as a good or bad thing but as something that can happen to someone as a tool right because sometimes violence is a response to things and you need violence it's not necessarily always bad I'm not a pacifist right and even as an abolitionist I'm sitting and thinking about this in terms and as a lawyer I'm thinking about the crime part I think that's important but I I think that like and I put this in the chat earlier part of this making it about sexual freedom is kind of weird and strange to me because what Diddy is actually doing right is violating sexual freedom is disabling people from acting autonomy on own so what he's doing is wielding a type of power that allows him literally to inhabit somebody's body to seize someone's body and make it theirs and how different is that from the slave owner and even this notion right about homophobia I don't even see the deviancy piece as this idea of like people wielding homophobia in fact I think that Diddy and his lawyers are taking up the language of the queer and lgbtq rights movement and saying that deviancy is something that is actually part of our sexual freedom and he's he's covering himself in the rainbow flag right if you come at him for deviancy now you're coming with the same language the same rhetoric the same tool set legally right and culturally politically that have been used against queer trans nonbinary people for centuries in this country and in Europe and in Africa so I I I think that like this is It's Complicated because Diddy's lawyers and Diddy himself have done a really amazing job at taking up the language of people that are still currently oppressed and do not have autonomy under their own bodies to cloak himself in that and and and the last point I want to make I'm talking for a second is this kind of notion of like okay well white people get to do this and black people don't I think you can hold that inequity in one hand and at the same time say this [ __ ] is wrong like there's no reason Donald Trump should be free he bragged about grabbing women by the vagina on a recording and then said yeah I did it and then was convicted well found liable for sexual abuse and has dozens of women that say yeah he did that to me too and he run around about like liable to be president again right so I think people can be frustrated by the fact that like violence is dealt with differently based upon your skin and based upon the money that you have you know or perceive on your access that you can give but can also say that yo black folks this is still harm right there's no free passive harm Trump should be in jail too but that don't mean your ass should be out we can't aspire to that the same time yeah yeah I like as far you know me as an as an abolitionist I you know people tend to think in moments like this like you have to reckon with this or something is and and I don't I have like the system is there like that's what the reality is right like it's here right now the system is going to continue to work and did he here's the thing didd he is not a reflection when when Rich powerful men when Rich powerful people in general get caught up in the criminal system they are not a reflection of what is wrong with the criminal system or why the criminal system needs to be dismantled the fact that they usually are not is is a reflection of why the criminal system needs to be dismantled right like it's important to recognize like Diddy is somebody who has relationships with with with legislators and law enforcement and people there's a reason why these people felt as afraid they did they continue to articulate that is that they they were aware of that like that they couldn't just uh uh reach out to help you know what I mean against city which means for decades he's had relationships and power and influence and has obviously been able to skirt responsibility legally for all of these things anybody else would have been would have gone to prison for thinking about one of these things that would have been conspiracy you know what I mean but he's gotten away with all of these things because of the fact that the system is not designed to catch up the the rich and the powerful right so I can't like there's no reason for me to pretend for me to like use Diddy as like some example of like you see the system and oh I'm so unhappy that this is happened it makes no sense you know what I mean like don't get me wrong like as far as like I'm I'm somebody who doesn't believe in like cash bail I don't you know I I don't I don't think that I think the whole idea of cash bill for a number of different reasons uh flies in the face of the idea of proven an innocent until guilty that being said the the specific Notions why rally against the cash bail system in general is not about the diddi it's it's about the poor you know what I mean so like like I said as the system currently stands if there's ever somebody who is should get swept up in it it's a rich powerful person that is using their money and their power and influence in order to destroy the lives of of people right like it's the same thing with like R Kelly like I always understood I understood why I understood a lot of the different movements around R Kelly not just like the the criminal prosecution of him but even when people like stopped streaming his music specifically because he was making money and using it to like uh um to in order to oppress all of these different people and women and that he was that he was oppressing so it makes perfect sense so I understand I'm not I'm not in a place to be like they shouldn't get Diddy when it's obvious that Diddy has been with if they didn't Diddy would be here with the cases with the people doing all kind of [ __ ] right like he's probably been doing for decades so I'm just like ah you know it is what it is they context matters yeah have facts here yeah but people don't want to talk about that part they want to talk about the lubricant they want to talk about oh it's just sex that's all we're but it's not that the attorney at the Press you know definitely talked about more than just the lubricant that actually came a little bit later they talked about the r they talked about the OBU obstruction of justice they talked about what he did to Cassie in the video that came out at that time they talked about the accounts of other people a few other people and they said there were more they said all of this but people wanted to focus on the fact that it just sounds like it's a little bit of sex to me I mean it's a man in power and he having a little sex the same thing same way they they did with um what's the man name the jello guy so many that we that we loved on the what the hell is the the damn it I can't get his name Cosby Cosby yes Cosby why did I F Bill Cosby yeah so with even with him they tried to make excuses like see there's a sensitivity everybody's gonna find some place to be sensitive to so that they can be blind to the truth so we'll find out okay he's really old that was back in the day he heard a few people that wasin that time but contexts do matter to what a Nazi was saying not to say I'm not about to become a Bill Cosby apologist I promise youall I'm not going to die on this hill right now but I do understand people being like this is at the end of his life it's an old man the system going after that that is different than currently like people too father taking care of these children these children don't have a mom right now so there's this like the sensitivity to it they want to be like but that was his old life and I told you here they're utilizing but he is somebody who is born again he came back to God that's what people are saying they want to utilize would own that then when Cassie said it he wouldn't have painted her out to be a liar accountability and said and named the the things that he did wrong to her so anybody a dirty liar he's a good man's trying to tear down his reputation this also goes to like what is the point of the criminal legal system right you think about a Bill Cosby or even R Kelly or a diddy right is the point to punish okay cool whatever is the is the point to reform that's a different question is the is the point to deter further activity from this person or anyone else that's looking and thinking they can get away with it and I think that what has been happening over the last five or 10 years Beyond like all the sex crimes that have been coming out with me too A lot of the other [ __ ] that we're seeing with like people being defrauded from colleges and all other [ __ ] the question that we're really grappling with from George Floyd and Trayvon Martin on bri on on right is what is the the purpose of the criminal legal system and we have not come to an agreement and we all want different things so we're having all these different arguments about well what should we do with Diddy what should we do with so and so because some people think the idea is hey victims have been harmed you need to suffer the same harm right some people say wait a minute the point of jail and prison is to reform and transform this being so we don't have more people like this other people are going to say wait a minute all this [ __ ] is on the state because we as a community as a collective as a nation are nurturing young [ __ ] or white boys whatever to do these particular types of harm I think to Marisa's point and were're incentivizing them through their childhood and when they deviate from that I think about uh Lil Wayne I don't know what he go by now Tucci whatever him as a child right saying that no I wasn't raped by this woman I just had sex because men have this notion of unrap ability and if you as a man can note that you are and I should say CIS heterosexist right s heterosex straight man right can that you're able to be victimized then you lose your claim on humanity and so we have to question ourselves then what do we do with men that are soft what do we do with men that are sensitive right and there's a lot of bad things that we do to young boys that cry or have emotions and we have to figure out where are where do we want this system to do and where are we replicating this system in our households with our partners with our children with our nephews nieces and all of that and and also how are we training our young daughters nieces cousins home girls right to to take the blows for this person being broken yeah right to be their punching bag to be their eroticized sexual therapist where they can work out all the [ __ ] of their childhood we have to get into this [ __ ] and it's it's not just about the court the Court's [ __ ] we know that it's a white supremacist thing it's a white supremacist this heterosexist racial capitalist after lives of slavery mother but what the do we do right and I don't think we've gotten to that convers and it's not to say we shouldn't be dealing with the legal [ __ ] but it's again that both and because we're indictable a lot of us it's that cultural piece right um it is and I mean it's more so even because that's you you passed the Baton easy because I was like one us as boys don't have a good relationship with sex because we we are never taught or never been allowed to be a victim we were never allowed to be soft we were never allowed to just say oh this did not make me feel good right part of some parts Boyhood I've heard is just like well you get the older woman you get this like this is a a it's a right of passage for some people right but it's not understanding that that still has an impact on the body your body's still going to keep the score at the end of the day and so when that is happening we develop a very terrible relationship to sex which means now we don't see women or non-men as like sexual partners we see them as objects and so the reality is the rest of the world the system the legal system culture and policy are going hand in hand in terms of how we are witnessing the dispo the suppos ability of this right and so as yall were talking it made me even think around a little bit more of like we can unpack the stuff that happens that happened to Diddy that turned him into this person because they want to send it to Andre her harell they want to go to all these other people that groomed them into doing this and so in something someone else had to teach Diddy how to be Diddy right Diddy is also who's never been told no right and so what happens to a man that's never been told no that does not have any type of healthy relationship to sex that doesn't have a healthy Rel healthy relationship to power and so I don't even know I'm like at any at anything right we can all just objectively agree trash Guillotine I don't believe in the death penalty Guillotine that immediately however where I am going to push is like wow what how do we have this conversation with young children right how do we continue to have this conversation to unpack how do we go into talking to our boys about this around like dog like that's right we can't make jokes about this kind of violence and harm that's being made we can't just Sully this and reduce it down and I'm thinking even like with Rebecca earlier like talking around like how we are mify the memeification of what's Happening to Haitian people right now that's right right it's we're mify what's actually a very harmful thing and I think we try to reduce it and run away as men to try and just reduce it so we can make sense of it which is why we're focused on the Lou which is why we're focused on The Sensational aspects of it but we don't want to reckon with like oh this is what this is because so many of us are like I participated in something like that but Mar do you think that men though also see themselves because this is what I'm wrestling with I think especially straight men and I see this with us qu too right also see themselves as objects right so it's not just the objectification of women or other people of various genders or no genders that men or people that maybe don't people that are s male at Birth I should say right are seeing as objects to be conquered but they also see themselves as objects that must be unconquerable and I think that is the thing that there is not a notion not only of a shared Humanity but the idea that you have Humanity yourself and think that like it's kind of like going back to my Little Vampire Diaries moment right turn off your humanity and I think that like that's what someone like a diddy and a lot of do they just don't have the power so they end up being in the Trap that are beating the [ __ ] out of their girlfriend cheating on 511 people and so not sexually fulfilled and don't know what they want to do right can't even tell you what they have for breakfast that morning soize as a black boy as a man actually any man it's patriarchy right um we have not rationalized victimhood and I'm not saying victimhood as like a bad thing it's victimhood as like oh I have never been a CH I have never been somebody who said I need help I need to be saved somebody else needs to see that so there's not a Humanity there I'm not trying to necessarily humanize Diddy in this moment so for the viewers and people who are listening it's not a moment of me trying to humanize it him it is also understanding I'm thinking around what are the things that we can put in place that prevents another Diddy from happening I'm going to stick my neck out here I am going to attempt to humanize him in this moment and that's going to be unpopular thing but I think in order for us to prevent this from happening again we have to humanize him and unpa the why because then we're never going to get to the root cause to actually be able to have the real conversations that we need to have we have to unpack his mother we have to unpack the relationship that he had with her we have to unpack what H what meant to him when his father was murdered when he was two we have to unpack what happened to him with Andre harell we have to unpack what happened to him with Russell Simmons we have to unpack what he did to usher in order to make Usher silent after witnessing harm we have to unpack everything involved in this and we have to we must keep our Humanity about it because if we don't then we'll we're never going to understand it to do anything about it and that's I think where we fall we that that's where I don't think that we protect that's where that I think we fall short every time and that we are so reactionary we are not preventative at all because we're just like I'm punishing you now you did a bad thing you should have known better but there is no space to say okay how happened why would you do something like this it's a dismissal and I'm guilty of it so I'm not on a high horse here trust me there's a dismissal of your um psychotic you are nuts you deserve XYZ throw the key away [ __ ] you but I'm the type of person where like after sitting back and needing to and needing to heal from sexual assault from rape from violence in that way I've needed to try to understand the harm that other folks experience and not excuse it I want to be real clear there is no the behavior is not excusable just because you're trying to understand it doesn't mean that you don't have consequences right but in order for me to be able to learn the lessons that I need in order I'm speaking for myself now to learn what I needed to learn to equip myself with being able to move on I needed to humanize these people and understand the why so I'm just inviting folks to remember that is like be really really careful about dehumanizing folks because that is what white folks do to us that is a tool of dismissal and that's a it's it's a scary tool yeah is normal like we keep thinking about diddies and the cosb as like strange this is the norm and I'm not saying this is like the state of the natural state of people right it's when that's Point like but if we keep thinking about these people as outliers we're not realizing that this could be your son unless you do a a particular type of paren or also thinking of them that way underscores enforces reinforces the criminal system because what happens is the whole idea the very foundational idea about a prison is that we have to wash our hands of these people this is greater problem for us to address so we have to just lock them up so when you tell yourself when you allow yourself to believe that Diddy is an exceptional monster even though the people you can see you must know on some level we we just on a regular level of not celebrity can relate to we we've experienced these kinds of sexual abuse physical abuse all these different things but you're hearing countless times finding out this is what happens in the industry they're all seeing it they know it boozy is telling you oh he's doing what the others have done because it's normal to them it says this is not some matter of like and this you don't it's not about like sympathizing with them people think when you like humanize people or you explore the why it's because you have sympathy for them or something or that's what you're trying to do no it's because when you when you're able to answer the why you're able to address a problem if you won't address you can't you know what I mean like you can't address the problem if you just tell yourself you throw your hands up and say this is a monster someone who is different than us something we cannot understand something we cannot contend with therefore just throw all the monsters the problems the mistakes like this rather than accepting that Diddy is not a mistake Diddy is what our society produces you know what I mean created that we created around him created that how do we prevent more of that a book on that with Dr Bruce sorry Rebecca but it's called I just want to note this for the audience and also I put the book that Maris had in our chat but there's one book that Maris referenced it's called the body keep score and it talks about how trauma lives on the body and the ways in which it rots your brain but Oprah and Dr Bruce Perry who is like a pioneering neuro surgeon but also a uh therapist a psychotherapist he they have this book that's called in a podcast one it was a really great interview it says you know what happened to you and so they argue that like our question should not be what's wrong with you are you like this but what happened to you and because trauma literally creates grave matter on the brain and it rots the way you think about things but what he's arguing through his research about 20 years is that you can actually change those Pathways in the brain like these are not it's hard work but these aren the often times not all the time but most times are people who can be intervened upon if they want to because Diddy had the resources right but also it takes the community as James Baldwin says to be the mirror right the people around you have to say hey baby you can't see your own face yeah but I see it and this is the [ __ ] that you're doing so what does it mean right that not just the billionaire multi mogal music industry even lower level people but in your neighborhood we all know that are creeps yes like how what happened to you and did I participate in it by either not intervening yeah we have to and I think being raised and I think we've had this conversation when we actually brought up the Diddy conversation on o and Friends um we've had very nuanced conversation different experiences all of us um can say that in some way shape or form we have been in um abusive relationships in in a way and I I know I have and and then I also know that I was raised in a household where that was normal right and it being normalized in my culture for especially that age group um and beyond that that was the thing to do and if a woman fought back a man was always considered powerful if a man is in the room no matter what a man can shut you up a man can do this a man can do that a man can say this and can say that and nowadays it's it's a it's I'm glad that it's a little different but we had to understand where that was coming from and while it is you know something that happened in my household and I made the choice to figure out where it stemmed from understanding that that you know my father's father did that father's his father's father did that and before and before and we had to break it down and we also had to sit down and have a conversation and be like hey yo you did this you you did this and that was a tough conversation to have so even in speaking with children or however if there was if you know there's some way shape or form that you presented in in a way where you abuse your power like and and kids see that so they kids are not gonna like with booy his children are thinking that the same way that you said Maris that this is a right of passage because that's how booy presented it that if I you know my child he ain't going to be gay my child going to get you know some some coochie early and we GNA he turned of age and we gonna let somebody take it from him not him willing not him like just doing that on his own taking it from him and the world was like that's his child they tried to see there's a difference why is booy like that we got to understand when we're saying humanize we're not saying make excuses for we're figuring out the why so that we prevent that from happening again and it's okay to say that Diddy needs to pay for his crimes while still figuring out the why how did he get here we can do both things we can say uhuh because he knows that he was troubled even in his apology he tried to say like a lot of men especially in my life that have hurt me physically and I have tried to say to them you know why did you do this and the excuse is I'm a broken man I'm I'm broken I'm broken and I'm like well you got to find find out how you got there what happened and you know I give that to them that Grace but that's how far as I was extended like you are broken and I see that and that H probably something that happened into your life that made you this way um you need to figure out what that's about I'm not going to be here for that healing process but you know figure out what that's about and you know at the end of the day you go do that to somebody else you got to pay for your crimes like didd he in his apology was saying basically that I'm broken you know at that time I was a really hard place in my life and it's like okay people wanted to immediately attach themselves to that and empathize with that but it's like yes he is broken how did he get there we know people in our lives that are like that but Cassie is the one that had to deal with that for what 10 years and she was broken and she was silen and she saw other people go through that the details of what she went through were disgusting and didd he went on to allegedly do that again with other people um so those are what people need to see like even when you recognize that you're a monster um you go on to do things and people will sit there and be like you know if like right now how we're talking we keep having to say okay us humanizing him is not no like we're just at we're just literally saying he is a person he did this there are so many other people in our lives that we can say are similar to this and we know why they're like that they need to get help and we understand that we need to talk about it in our family we know that we've been around the table and we had to say call a thing a thing so that we can talk about it because such and such a son or daughter seen this and we need to make sure that they're protected and they don't fall down that path or whatever so it's like we can have these conversations but we can still say this person needs to pay for what they've done it doesn't take away from us saying why did how did did he get here what was his relationship with his mom like you were saying what was his relationship W with his dad and not have his dad in his life what did that do to him who was he around um when he was super young and what did he see and what did they say that this is how you're supposed to make it when you make it you can utilize your power and do this to people as well so yeah yeah and you named a lot of really good things too um and I appreciate where we were able to take this conversation to all let me retract my Guillotine statement because that was rude I said it a moment I did however um I think the hardest thing is like the healing always has to come at it feels like the healing always has to come after a harm when it comes to having to learn lessons right and it's always sucks because somebody else is always on the receiving end of that piece and now you're making me that I feel like I always have to qualify you know as an educator um something we um do is like having to do trauma informed care and so anytime somebody enters our space we do actually ask that question when something is wrong like what happened to you it takes a little bit to like think about because then you have to actually objectively talk about your day and objectively talk around like what actually happened versus how you feel so the feeling is coming after the action and how are we able to begin to unpack that piece and so for those people for those people who are watching right now it's really important to think around um look up what trauma-informed care can look like because then that can give us a much more better framework in terms of how we can refer like talk around Diddy and thinking about it from a preventative measure right and so if we're thinking around the actual Solutions here's the preventative measure on how we are interacting with young people how we're interacting with adults how we're interacting with teenagers elderly and also thinking around how do we have to begin to reshape how we are um engag in impunity how we're engaging in restorative justice how we're engaging with this without excusing so at anything humanize the experience and how we get to him and then we are also able to treat him as a cautionary to we don't want this thing to happen anymore because objectively us as a Community said this is not okay there's no line drawn in sand right here right now and so once we're able to determine what that line is now there's a base level that us as a community are just like yeah get that [ __ ] out of here bro we ain't doing that I think I think that's perfect I think that's a I think we got a show I think those were perfect last words like I think we like unpacked gave Direction I was like resources I was like oh that feels like a completed body of work somebody got to get to his babies though cuz they got a lot of unlearning to do the sun I I actually just saw you tell me a new interview with Quincy and Angelie like just drop like she just I was like you know let me go watch that because I added to my watch later because I was like interesting before all I think that was recorded I fig it was recorded but she just like did the timing so I'm like let me watch it somebody really do need they need so much help they need so much help yes especially that that one that look just like him and act just like him oh the one who was who put out the damn song incriminating him further being like you ain't check the right house it's the one next door yeah and some people were saying um even with him they were making jokes M ifying and they were like check the one you see how you're humanizing him Antonette it makes sense right he's a he's his son and they said check the one who looked just like him he probably doing the same thing because he got his face and they're making that a whole joke and I all I thought about was um he's a he's a child he's a child and he he's technically an adult now but guess what imagine what he saw growing up he saw things growing up imagine what he experienced growing up that's his king that's his hero that's who he you know and he been has been told you look just like me you are me you'll be next in line I'm pretty sure those are the conversations and even in his mus care about that because that's right and I mean that's not on us that's on the one to put that your child out there like that it's important for us not to also like assume I don't think anyone in here is doing that if that's that child's nature because many see Violent parents and run the opposite way yeah listen listen trust his his his behavior leads me to believe that it could get tricky over there quickly we heard and we seen say he could get tricky over [Music] he [Music]
