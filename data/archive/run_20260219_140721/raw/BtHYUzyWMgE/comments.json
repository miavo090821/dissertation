Sharia prescribes about 10 different kinds of situations where muslims can lie with impunity. Hadiths teach that you can lie to your spouse, friends and enemies. Lying to non-muslims is recommended in any situation in order to gain advantage over them. Quran commands that if muslims are in a weaker position compared to non-muslims, they should present as nice and polite while holding hatred in their hearts. \nAnother important point is that islamic jurisprudence considers the whole world as two distinct geopolitical regions: Dar-ul-Islam or \"House of islam\" (territories under muslim rule) and Dar-ul-Harb or \"House of war\"  (territories under non-muslim rule). Islam's end goal is the physical domination of the whole world. Therefore, any muslims living in non-muslim countries is living in the House of War, i.e., in a state of war till islam takes over. It means that muslims in these countries can lie about anything to anyone in any situation for their own benefit.",

I guess the podcast creators are talking to their own audience who won't be suspecting them of blatantly making shit up, but it's always best to give sources.",

        "text": "@joreggelt-y7t That's because he did come across as disingenuous. He first tried placing the burden of proof on another party that itself never made a truth claim to begin with. He then demanded of you (and only because you were the one courteous enough to listen) to justify why said other party didn't meet his arbitrary standards of citation, when the source has no general or specific basis to meet such standards. Perhaps worst of all, he then resorted to a petty personal attack.\n\nThis guy is implicitly expecting (what used to be considered) rigorous academic standards while managing to achieve more logical fallacies than I care to count. You, however, seem to be a tad more sincere, though I'm still only going off a handful of comments online. Read between the lines, pause, and don't doubt yourself any quicker than you'd doubt a stranger. There are people who will, whether consciously and deceitfully or unconsciously and foolishly through brainwashing, attempt to misdirect/gaslight/outright attack you while playing by completely different rules if they deem you to be \"one of them\".\n\nWord to the wise. Give such people the time of day, hear them out, show them common courtesy as you did there, but sniff for BS and then offer them the door if they persistently approach you in bad faith - and likely failing to even try living up to the values they foist on others. That doesn't mean you need to be paranoid about everyone, just that no one is entitled to take advantage of your good faith.\n\nIf you're unsure, ask yourself why such an evidently reasonable individual very quickly and proudly proclaiming to be fiction what is very clearly two guys making no attempt to hide their angle, on a podcast from a niche independent outlet - however high the production values make it appear - with said outlet being no less upfront about their values, whether you or anyone happens to agree with them.\n\nAs an example, my answer would be: we appear to have a contemptible moron in our midst, and while I admit it could be me in the wrong, I only noticed it once he appeared with all the same tired/frivolous/deceptive tactics of the ideologue's handbook. I might then ask myself, well,",

They think it's the most efficient form and have been doing whatever they can to push their countries to it. They absolutely want a unified, one world government and we're watching it happen everywhere. Australia building camps, Canada trampling their own people (crippled elderly women btw) and celebrating it. The unhinged left stealing elections around every corner here.  Not just the major ones, they do it on the local level as well. They want us subjugated and working for their benefit",

        "text": "@herbaliser4207 Yup I absolutely can't stand that one world Bank. I noticed every country that wasn't apart of it, quickly became the enemy of the free world and were then conquered by the west. Last I heard Iran was the only one left not apart of it, but I'm not sure now. I stopped looking into it because it can be soul crushing realizing the whole world is working against you for power. If there is gonna be world unification, it should be the working class and poor banding together to tear down this idea and those who push it. The fuckin task is so daunting and there is no where to go to hide from it. We're all fixing to be knee deep in shit and half of our countries are leading us there thinking they won't be in the pits next to us. The useful idiots actually believe they'll get to be little kings lording over us. No matter how many times we tell them, they still don't believe they're the 1st to be put on the wall. They're weapons used against us and can easily be turned back on them, so they remove the potential problem before they line us up. The saddest part is it won't be blatant and bloody until it's already over. They will tear apart personal freedom, attack independent institutions to bring them into the government fold (our federal officers used to neutral, but now FBI, CIA, IRS, DEA all work for the left) and use them as tools to break us down. They'll use fear tactics to justify spying (nazis and terrorists), implement social currency (likes and retweets atm), remove paper money (you can block digital, not paper) make sure any useful tools are illegal (guns, knives). Before we know it we're in a pseudo democracy and then the real pain will come because we'll be too demoralized to fight back. I wish you the best my friend. I wish your family and fellow countrymen the best. And know that you are free to become a US citizen, buy a bunch of guns and fight with us. The vetting process to get a VISA is thorough enough that you qualify for gun ownership when you get here. Your response was humbling my dude, I was expecting some snide comeback, but you were very forthcoming with your situation and I felt compelled to answer in kind. You're a good person and I'll keep you in my thoughts. Much love from America",

Not all women have familial males either.  Man with a temper? Throws acid on a wife simply because she's there. Husband dies and has no other living male relatives to pass her off to? To the streets with her with no ability to survive.

Again not quite how we seen it in the US.\n\nThis now seems more appealing than whatever progressives or regressives support.",

The US, as an example, was settled by English Dissenter Brownists who wanted to live communally, and much of this can be traced back to the old Diggers and Levellers when the commons were enclosed. A branch of this grew into Communism, as the Jewish community has it within as well with the Hasidic community.\n\nThe truth is, all western government is based upon religion, even after the revolutions, and the same goes for the nations in the east.",

So basically the memes that survive.\n\nFor example, the jews and muslims do not eat pork because of trichniosis. But of course, back then, noone knew of parasites and bacteria as carriers of disease. (they thought, mice spawned from disorder for example :P)\n\nBut  the goups, whose god randomly forbid them from eating pork survived, and now they are muslims, and not the followers of some other desert god.\n\nI give the example of trichniosis of course, because we (likely) know the answer. But you don't know, what you don't know. Just 200 years ago, an enlightened liberal (probably a frenchman) would have said \"those idiots in the desert believe in a sky ghose who tells them they shouldn't eat pigs. There is no reason not to eat pigs. It is just meat. Idiots\"\n\nSo today too we have many rules which are beneficial, but we do not know why. Thats why liberalism dissolving \"arbitrary\" rules is dangerous.\n\nI want a small state, and as many cultures as possible, not one globohomo. It is like cells mutating. If you have a million cells of bacteria, and one mutates, that bacteria dies, and you have 999.999. If you have a million cells which are together a blue whale, and one mutates, all of them die of cancer.\n\nI want many local, distinct cultures, which do not just copy US culture. That way, you can change without destroying implicit knowledge, becuase the others can learn from your mistakes and not do the same. \nYou can have a much higher rate of change that way, without cultural cancer.",

Because your explicit knowledge is limited, and you can not be fully aware of these limits. As I said, the trichniosis example is logical now, but would have been one of the \"haha silly religious people\" example only 200 years ago.\n\nYou seem to have a very liberal attitude regarding intercourse. I think that is one of the things we had implicit knowledge about which we got rid of, and which then hurt us majorly. Look at the marriage rates, look at the birth rates, look at the divorce rate, look at how hapy people are inside relationships and so on.\nIt will be up for future scientists to study, but I think liberalising s*xual norms will turn out to have been a big mistake.\n\nOther than that, I am for change, but on a local level. I want a new HRE basically. If one city tries out \"ACAB, replace them with social workers\" that is fine, and the others can then either learn from it and not do it, or, if it works, adapt to that as a new basis.\n\nChange only becomes a problem when structures are centralized, when not one city tries out a new rule, but all of them at one, without possibly being able to know the consequences.",

How is he more responsible for his place of birth than the black person is for their skin color?\n\nI want a country, first, then we can talk about what kind of country.

I'll explain in more detail.\n\nWe live in a world where even something like basic math or basic biology is taboo to speak. To speak truth in a society such as ours does indeed require great bravery.\n\nIf you are getting the wrong answers in math, (ie 2+2=5) then you are not succeeding. If you are not brave enough to speak the truth, you are not succeeding.\n\nSo while you think it was irony, the irony is your statement; not mine. You cannot succeed at math in this world without bravery.",

The Nazis did the same with the same result. Force alone might get people to pretend to change, to go along with you for a little while, but the minute you stop applying force they'll go back to their old ways and beliefs. If you really want to change a country you need persuasion, not force. Sure, you'll need some force to protect yourself and your converts but lasting change will only happen if you can persuade enough people to give up their old ways and try your own. The west's main issue is that we have so many problems and internal fights that we either won't fix, or won't even honestly address, that it's very difficult for us to make a case that our way is any better than anyone else's. Why would anyone give up their old beliefs on the promise it'll fix a few of their current problems if they think it'll also just cause them even more problems in the near future? If we really want to promote our own beliefs and way of life on a world wide scale then we need to fix the major problems in our own countries first so we can make an honest case that our way really is better.",

They basically wiped out most of the male population of several regions and sent over their own roman veterans to live and farm there, thereby breeding a new people that had mixed heritage: both Roman and local - thus were the basis of several western nations born (in simplistic terms; reality is more nuanced than that and also involved a few generations of occupation and suppressed rebellions). Same goes for many other successful conquerors throughout history. Force very much works if you use enough of it, for a long enough time.\n\n\nThe most effective way to permanently culturally align a people, as shown throughout history, is to genocide the males and breed the remaining females. It's hopefully not something we'll be seeing much of in this millennium, but *it does* work. It works so well, in fact, that 1000+ years later, you'll stil have entire nations that share the conquering cultural framework to some extent or another.\n\nThere are ways, but the most effective ones are not acceptable to western societies anymore.",

        "text": "​@andylewis7360 \n- Mohammed both said bells are the sign of the devil and he heard bells when he met with the angel Gabriel in the cave. \n- Allah is the greatest deceiver. \n- Islam's end time prophecy sounds like the Christian end times prophecies but from the other side. \n- The quran builds way more on gnostic distortions of Christianity than the actual Bible. \n- When it comes to historicity we try to do as much archeology with biblical sites to see if it lines up. And as far as I'm aware it does. Mecca is supposed to be the oldest city of the world and there are over 200 prophets buried close to it in prayer position. But they concrete everything up and don't even bother to look. \n- Even pretty critical scholars like Bart Ehrman say what we have in the Gospels is pretty much what the original authors wrote. And he even accepts that the brother of Jesus himself believes in the died and risen again Jesus and Jesus being God. So corruption or legendary development doesn't work with the Bible. At least not from the point where it was written down. But on the other hand we don't have any early qurans and they were written without the diacritical dots unlike todays qurans. Because of that even if we had a quran from back then we wouldn't know it's interpretation as there are various vastly different possible interpretations. Just look at the many different qurans sold in different parts of the Muslim world. \n- The goal of Christianity is to make a relationship between God and individual humans. It's not a law book. Because of that it doesn't matter if culture changes, as long as the Bible is still followed _(Which it isn't in progressive Christianity for example)._ In Islam the best you can hope for is being a slave at the mercy of Allah. The only thing you can do is rigidly follow every law and hope that Allah looks at you favorably. Even though I have my doubt that Islam is as unchanging as it is made out to be, it still wouldn't be surprising if such a cult would not change over time. \n- In Christianity we are meant to look things up and judge if it aligns with the word of God. In Islam anything which may inspire doubt is evil and to be avoided. Christianity doesn't have a tiered knowledge system and people from all levels of intellect and education can get to know God equally well. That's not the case in Islam.\n\nEven though there are some similarities between the Bible and the quran, this doesn't mean they have the same foundation and message or even the same god. The Bible warns from false prophets and one of the easiest ways to spot them is to see if they attack the foundation of Christianity. \nAccording to Islam:\n- The trinity is not monotheism and if you say Jesus is God then you do shirk, the worst sin possible. \n- Jesus doesn't have a dual nature but was just a human prophet\n- Jesus didn't die on the cross and therefor didn't raise again. \n- In Christianity work are signs of being a Christian but not a requirement for going to heaven. In Islam the only thing that counts are the works and even that is uncertain and insufficient. \n\nBut there are other differences as well. \n- Thanks to the trinity God is self sufficient, even in traits such as being capable of loving before creation. In Islam Allah would have destroyed humanity if they were behaving correctly, as in that case he couldn't show them his mercy. Definitely a behavior Yahweh would never have. \n-The only way of deceiving you could ascribe to Yahweh is called hardening someone's heart. Allah even deceived Mohammed about trivial things like army size of enemies and stuff like this. \n- In Christianity the world is God made and good, but also fallen. In Islam the world is an evil place. Just look at where the paradise was located. In the Bible it's on earth and in Islam it is located in the heaven. This is also why Muslims have a hard time understanding that God is both capable and willing to enter earth in form of a human. \n\nConclusion: Islam and Christianity look similar on the surface but are fundamentally different. There is no possible way to live a life which fulfills the requirements of entering both heavens at the same time. It is quite likely that if one of the two religions is true then the other one is from the devil.",

A sahih hadith is what it is, authentic but you will have to have an understanding of hadith to know its grading or take guidance from those who know. Thus if someone quotes from Sunan Abi Dawud, then it is not automatically authentic unlike the saheehayn, Al-Bukhari and Muslim....and btw if you still didnt notice sunan abu dawud is where that quote come from...you should research more 👍👍",

Afghanistan wanted to move up in the  world. Develop. Then the russians came and the fighting carried on. \nAfter the russians left, the taliban took over by force. They were created in and funded by pakistan specifically to spread sunni islam into afghanistan. The afghan people were forced to live under the boot of taliban rule and it has destroyed them. Education = gone, rights = gone, prospects = gone. \nIn less than one lifetime the place has been returned to ruins. the smart people are gone and the culture that the taliban claim is 'our own' is the  talibans culture. Not afghans. The afghans had that rammed down their throats back in the early 90s. They didnt choose it. \nAfter being tied to the russians and then living under the taliban, there is nothing of substance to work with. Its no wonder we couldnt get them to stand on their own feet.\nToday, women in afghanistan WANT to be educated but are not allowed. That by itself ensures the country will stay poor and ignorant forever.",
