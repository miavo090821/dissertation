        "text": "@waynewayne8419  No, what you are doing is adding all the \"on the run\" stuff to before his life sentence . \nHave you ever won at a casino and started \"playing w house money\"? It's easier money to lose bc it didn't belong to you before. The crimes of a child on the run can be seen in *hindsight* as a too far gone man. But that's looking back on it and judging that *feels like* 20/20 to you, but it isn't. His life was meaningless. So he did more crimes. \n\nAs for before it- he was in poverty. He was given an opportunity to rob someone and help change this. The only wanton and clear disregard was mostly coming from the duplicitous and conniving girls orchestrating it. \nAnd sure, one of the girls' fs was having coercion and stress, but we act like living in 3rd world conditions doesn't also do this. \n\nIf the girls were a product of terrible things, then so was he. And bc he did more crimes on the lam bc he knew he was never going to be free, doesn't move me. Many become suicidal and homicidal for less. \n\nYou can feel for the little girl and never that young boy in any scenario we paint. It really wouldn't matter. This society would find a way to treat him as a cold, calculated adult and the white girl as some smol bean. I've seen it over and over.",

I was always under the impression that he was the one who killed somebody and that’s why he did the race. Obviously, burglary shouldn’t be excused, but Tay-K was a kid and was clearly misled by the environment he grew up in. I was never aware of the unfair treatment of this case. I’m not very knowledgeable about the justice system, so today was my first time hearing about felony murders. Thanks again, you delivered the information in a concise, yet very effective manner.",

Period. I understand some of the reasoning behind some of these \"gang\" laws. Like if 4 people actively beat a guy to death but one person beat him less and probably didn't land the killing blow, then yeah, I'm still OK with that one person still getting charged for the same murder - because that's active participation. I can even see getting charged as an accomplice if you're just the lookout. But screw this group liability stuff and especially screw how it's being applied. Nobody should be responsible for how the cops behave except the cops. And no one should be charged for murder when they had no expectation of violence, weren't armed or involved, and a murder happens to take place near them.",

I am specifically talking about racialized men, especially black men, having a long history of misandric aggression being levied on them due to the prevailing misconceptions about what their maleness represents, in the form of extrajudicial killings and more severe and deliberate exposure to the penal system above not only their white male counterparts, but all their female counterparts as well.",

    "text": "This is so crazy. From my priviledged german perspective american law is just wild and insane.\nCan I see that you want make accomplieces in a crime responsible for any bodily harm or death that occures during the crime? Yes, sure, I can see that. But there are several things that would be a pre-requisite from my perspective to make this just: 1. The harm/death needs to be a direct and foreseeable result of the joined action.\n2. the harm/death needs to be that of a person not part of the conspiratorial party. Every member who entered here freely did so on their own risk.\n3. The harm/death may not be the result of actions of law enforcement. As representative of the state, given higher power, the police is of sole responsibility for the way they approach a situation. No one else is to blame for their failings. Unless it was part of the plan to manipulate individuals in the police to do an action that results in that harm (like a theoretical murderer making a cop accidently push a button that sets of a bomb, just for the sake of the arguement here)\n4. The person either agreed to the plan of harming/killing another person OR had the option to stop the action that caused the harm/death.\n5. Unless the person does hold considerable amount of controlle over the actions of the co-conspirators, that gives them special responsibility for their actions, the sentence cannot be higher, then that of the person who actually harmed/killed another human being.\nAnd even then:\nLocking away a teenager for more then 10 years is insane. The idea to prosecute a minor as an adult is absolutly disgusting for me. But our law works the other way around: we have the option to prosecute adults as minors, when they have a delayed social or intellectual development. As the core principle of our justice system is not revenge and it is much less about what the result of an action is, but more about the individuals ability to know what will happen, and to be intellectually responsible for the outcome.\nAnd 25 years is the absolut maximum sentence reserved for the absolutly worst cases of murder. It is super rare a person is charged with that.",
