greetings and salutations loyal viewers of this channel my name is Sean and I'm trying to keep a straight face and today we're going to talk about this ad that is apparently despite my best efforts to research and prove that it is in fact a parody not a parody that wants to make men vote for kamla Harris and convince you that it is the masculine thing to do I'm not joking about this apparently this is a real thing as Anna kasparian would say it's real I I I just said that Anna just stop interrupting like that and that's what we're going to talk about today but before we do I want to thank everybody who supports this channel via actual Justice warrior.com join I give me the money give you give me the money okay and I also want to say that on Wednesday October 23rd I will be at the Sovereign house at 700 p.m. for a live debate one of the Soho debate series verse a person called Joshua eal and this person will be making the argument against me that it is the libertarian position to vote for kamla Harris in this presidential election you're going to want to tune in for that register with the link in the description of this video if you can be there in person because I'd absolutely love to meet you guys now let's get into the actual story I'm a man so already and I mean already I have issues with the representation of men and we haven't even gotten past the first one this large individual right here with a very high-pitched voice is the lead off person for this an overweight guy that is doing something gardening related or farming related I'm not exactly sure and he's like I'm a man in a very unconvincing way but let's get a little bit further through this because if I stop it every single frame like I definitely could this video is going to take 27 hours I'm a man I'm a man man and I'm man enough I'm man enough to enjoy a barrel prooof Bourbon Neat so I think what this ad is going for if I'm being perfectly honest and being perfectly fair is they're trying to play into what they consider to be masculine stereotypes with the scotch neat or whatever right there and they're trying to kind of tell a joke and be in on the joke like they're trying to say hey this is a little bit absurd but we totally get it kind of like internet culture but the fact of the matter is nobody is laughing with them everybody is laughing at them and one of the reasons why is because some of the folks that they have in this particular video they're not masculine at all whatsoever and again I'm not one of these people who says that every single person who votes for the Democrats that is a man is not masculine because I'm not that dumb obviously we have a huge country and a vast swaths of it can look and act certain ways and vote certain ways but the fact of the matter is there is a left-wing stereotype of more a feminized men voting in this direction and they don't do anything to refute that again just pay attention to this next guy that they pull up man enough to cook my steak rare so I just want to say before I get into this individual right here that we here at the actual Justice Warrior Channel have no problem with the gays we are not against the gays we are supportive of the gays being able to rent a boat on Sunday or whatever the hell the gays want and feel like they're being denied that being said this ad at least what it appears to be going for is a straight heteromasculine man that's why you have the guy in the motorbike that's why you have this guy at the gym but then we stumble upon this guy and he's sitting in a very closed off AFF feminite position and he has a lisp that I can't ignore men enough to cook my steak rare men enough to cook my steak rare is not what you should be going for in this particular type of AD again unless you're trying to parody leftwing men unless you're deliberately trying to mock them which by the way in this particular case I would heavily advise against because this appears to be one of the two Hispanics that they have throughout this whole entire ad KLA Harris is hemorrhaging Hispanics and they have an obese farmer guy with a high-pitch voice and this guy who sounds not straight and again we here on the actual Justice Warrior channel are fully in favor of the gays being able to rent bowling shoes or again whatever rights they feel like they're being denied on this channel it's it's not an insult it's just an observation YouTube Gods be nice to me I've never went after the gays in my entire life and I'm dead serious about that ignore the comedic tone that I'm taking man enough to deadlift 500 then braid the out of my daughter's hair you see what I mean right here it seems like they're trying to be in on the joke but the fact of the matter is they aren't this is ridiculous and again even though this guy is among the more masculine guys he's at the gym he's in good shape he actually has a voice that isn't insanely high pitched it's just it's just it's something's off about the energy right here I might have to apply what I applied to the lisby guy to to this guy right here and I don't want to attribute that to him because he says that he has a daughter and I really really hope that that that everything's okay in the household I I I don't even know what I'm saying I'm going too far but this ad it's just ridiculous you think I'm afraid to rebuild a carburetor I eat carburetors for breakfast look I don't know where this guy is from I got to be perfectly honest with you I am basing this solely on appearances I am judging a book by its cover and you might think that's wrong but the fact of the matter is the reason books have covers is so that you can judge them but this screams Mexican to me this screams the other Hispanic representation in this particular ad because he's an overweight guy he kind of has like Mexican features and he's also dressed like a cowboy so it's like a Mexican stereotype right on display right here and again they're trying to do some comedic bits or whatever but it doesn't appear to be working and considering the other guy that looks vaguely Latino comes off as incredibly gay and then this guy is overweight it it feel it feels a little bit offended honestly it feels like this is not really going to go over as well as they wanted it to go over I ain't afraid of bears that's what Bear Hugs are for okay so I just want to say right off the tap I I'm I'm sorry I apologize to everybody out there in the audience who's about to learn some information that they definitely didn't want to learn but I think it is absolutely crucial that we established that that guy sounds the most non-straight out of all these different guys and he just uttered the phrase I'm not afraid of bears and then the next person the bigger guy ends up saying that's what Bear Hugs are for because if you guys are unaware if you're not upu on your gay dialect if you're not as supportive of the LGBT XX iip Community as I am you might not know this but a bear is is is a reference to something a reference to a larger gay man in in the gay world so when little gay man says not afraid of bears and then bigger man that was kind of questionable a little bit in my opinion says that's what Bear Hugs are for I I'm reading this as completely different than intended and by the way I'm I'm I'm just saying the the the bear gay they tend to be bigger and more masculine by comparison but the the this this version who says he's not afraid of the bear gay I I I think it's it's less masculine I I'm sorry I'm I'm just trying to point out that the intended outcome of this particular ad it it it doesn't seem to be hitting the mark and if you read between the lines even a little bit it it gets even more questionable and it delves into areas that I didn't want to delve into so so I'm sorry I apologize to you guys out there in the audience but the fact of the matter is this ad has layers to how bad it is I'll tell you another thing I sure I'm not afraid of women I'm not afraid of women I'm not afraid of women so look I might believe that these first two guys aren't afraid of women but we've already established that the uh most likely to be nonstraight might might actually be women adversed again I I don't know how else to say it he he said he likes his steak rare which is like kind of more on the raw end and then he says he likes the big bears the big gay bears and uh I I don't I don't think I don't think the the the message it is it's kind of it's honestly it's kind of ruining my day this whole entire message it's making me very uncomfortable I hope you guys are more uncomfortable than I am because I'm Hamming it up but I'm doing it for a purpose which is to ruin your day just like this ad did when I decided to break it down and yes we're 30 seconds in to an ad that is a minute and 30 seconds and I'm going this much into detail they want to control their bodies I say go for it they want to use IVF to start a family I'm not afraid of families they want to be childless cat ladies have all the cats you want so yeah you have them go through the IVF thing which by the way is the lie that the evil orange man is going to ban IVF when he has not indicated he's going to do that at all whatsoever then they go into the childless cat lady thing which is a misrepresentation obviously you have abortion mix in there and they're saying oh it's so masculine for you to support all these different various things but also just as important is for you to not want to have families because whatever you want because the answer to every question in American politics and in society is that women can do whatever they want no matter what and every man should praise it and you're masculine if you praise it if you just say women are correct about everything then you are totally alpha male and not at all weak and cowardly and not able to stand up for yourself and not able to have any standards for yourself so just trust them trust these alpha male guys right here the the one who who likes it raw from the from the big bears he he's he's the one that that's going to guide you into the masculine future woman wants to be president well I hope she has the guts to look me right in the eye and accept my full throated endorsement um full throated endorsement uh um whole throated [Music] uh let let's just say that that that's not the that's not the adjective that I would have used if I was this individual let's just say if I was keeping track of all the different statements from this individual and how they kind of give me a non-straight vibe that full-throated as as as another thing that that this person said it it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't help that direction I I I I don't even remember this was in there when I was ranting about the the the raw steak and and the big the big gay bear thing and and I just remembered now now he said full throated and I I'm I'm just saying that this this is what the left thinks of you in terms of men out there this is what they think you believe is masculine and I I I just want you to understand that that they have all this in here to appeal to you this is not a parody these are the people that are upset with representation and they want you to look this man in the face and say wow I feel rep repres representated by this individual I'm going to give the woman my full-throated support because I'm represented by her because I'm man enough to support women man enough to know what kind of donuts I like so yeah they have this guy saying he's man enough to support women and then they cut to the black guy on the workout bench and he says I'm mad enough to know what kind of donuts I like again a reference to JD Vance you could just tell that this was written by a bitter woman probably a black woman with purple or red hair and about 14 million nose piercings is behind this ad because she's like this is going to be a Zinger if I write these words and they are uttered by men's then all the men's are going to stand up and clap and they're going to say you know what Kamala is the way to go that that's the masculine way to go don't you feel tough remember the line earlier about eating the carburetor remember the thing about the braw bear with the full-throated isn't it so masculine hey guys editing Sean here and I decided to look up the Instagram credited by the New York Post and I found out that it is actually run by a person called Jacob who of course has he him pronouns in his bio because you know you definitely are at Peak masculinity when you're putting pronouns in your bio now it actually lists him as having two art degrees he is a comedy and Commercial director Oscar qualified documentary director and he's written for apparently Kimmel funnier die and Nickelodeon and His Image while not the black woman with the nose piercings is about what you would expect to be a white guy that was behind this absolutely ridiculous and absurd man enough to admit I'm lost even when I refuse to ask for directions now look I know you guys out there in the audience are probably thinking Shan you've been joking about this guy since the first thing that he said it but there's no way you could turn the I'm lost even when I refuse to ask for directions kind of sentiment into another lgbtq X iip Community joke but the fact of the matter is I definitely could I could talk about him feeling lost with his big but big bear Big Bear boy but I'm not going to do so because here on the actual Justice Warrior Channel we try to elevate so we're not going to talk about somebody feeling lost feeling like they need to give full throated support raw to a big bear and not asking for directions from from from the big big bear where we're not going to do that because we're better than that on this channel and you're better than that out there in the audience and remember ma masculinity this this is this is to appeal to you masculine guys out there don't don't you feel so manly man enough to not ban young women from Reading Little Women or one of those pants books that the sisters like I'm man enough to Raw Dog a flight so yeah they get into the disantis book burning thing and then this gu is talking about ladyes clothes I I'm not saying anything about it you stop trying to push me guys I'm I'm not going to do that and then the next guy says raw dogging which is a interesting adjective right after that previous guy talks I'm manad enough to Raw Dog a flight it sucked not worth it I'm man enough to be emotional in front of my wife in front of my kids in front of my horse so yeah we get a reference to going on the flight and not using the entertainment system listening to music or anything like that it is described as raw dogging and then we have people talking about they're okay with being emotional with their wife their kids and then the guy comes back and he says with his horse and then you hear a horse noise and I can't help but think about him saying raw dogging and with the horse and then I realized that maybe just maybe this is meant to appeal to Vos or jck sorry I'm out of here I'm man enough to tell you that I cry at Love Actually Goodwill Hunting W Side Story that and predit unpopular take even though Love Actually ends with Rick from Walking Dead with that note scene and that scene in particular is kind of iconic the fact of the matter is the movie's actually not that good I know I I know I know calm down calm down you animals but these Ensemble romantic comedy movies they don't really hit as they should or as people feel like they should and I would just suggest you rewatch the movie and you tell me what moment in that movie you would start crying because obviously that's ve that's very unmasculine now there are certain scenes in certain movies that they get you they get you in the fields but they didn't a any of the movies that that they should get you also I do want to point out the movies that were referenced aren't exactly up-to-date references if if you know what I mean and I'm sick of so-called men domineering belittling and controlling women just so they can feel more powerful that's not how my mama raised me so yeah then you have this guy saying I'm not into domineering and all this stuff putting down women cuz that's inappropriate I feel like this is an evil orangeman reference and again if this is a parody it is one of the most well executed parodies of all time because the next guy says that's not how my mama raised me again I'm so open to the reveal that this was just a jk LOL kind of situation because it defies all logic that these words are put in this order delivered by these actors and they're meant to be taken seriously I still don't believe that this is an apparity I love women I love women who support their families women who decide not to have families women who take charge and I'm man enough to help them win so yeah then they go back to the previous message which is if you're a woman anything you do no matter what is amazing and worthy of Praise again because if you're a real man if you're a masculine man you can never have any standard of behavior especially a standard of behavior for the opposite sex again I'm not interested in this messaging I can't believe this is actually real but it closes with the kamla haris support thing and apparently this is meant to be legit even though I feel like I could have got together a bunch of male creators to do a parody of this and it wouldn't be as funny but of course that's just my opinion maybe you guys out there in the audience were swayed by this maybe you've been one over to kamla Harris's side and if so let me know why down
