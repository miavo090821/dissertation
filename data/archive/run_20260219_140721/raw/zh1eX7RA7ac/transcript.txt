hello folks and welcome to another youtube video from midwestern marks i'm your host eddie smith today we're going to be talking about a pretty famous milton friedman interview from 1979 where he's discussing the ideology of neoliberalism he's arguing that free markets and individual greed on the part of every single member of society will ultimately lead to the best society for the collective and he's also going to argue that every successful society ever has ran on greed and also on free markets obviously i disagree with this so let's listen to milton babel and then i will respond and debunk his billionaire funded talking here's my question when you see around the globe the male distribution of wealth the the desperate plight of millions of people in underdeveloped countries when you see so few haves and so many have-nots when you when you see the greed and the concentration of power within don't you ever did you ever have a moment of doubt about capitalism and whether greed's a good idea to run on well first of all tell me is there's some society you know that doesn't run on greed you think russia doesn't run on greed you think china doesn't run on greed what is greed of course none of us are greedy it's only the other fellow who's greedy every society runs on greed milton says it's just the other fellow who's greedy right we never see ourselves as greedy well actually milton that's a pretty good explanation of dialectics in the concept that marx lays out between the constant battle that takes place in a capitalist society between labor and capital so within the unity of capitalism one singular thing there are interposing and interpenetrating forces those forces can be various but the two primary forces are labor and capital so what is in the interest the self-interest of capital comes at the expense of labor and what is in the interest of labor most the time comes at the expense of capital so for example when capitalism was first developing there was a battle over the working day to set limits on the working day capitalists wanted to extend the hours of the working day as long as they could in order to keep workers moving and making profit for the capitalists whereas workers wanted to set limits on the working day because they were working 10 to 15 hours here as milton said we see people struggling in their own self-interest within capitalism however you need to recognize that the self-interest of the capitalists within this unity comes at the expense of the self-interest of the laborer in this unity that is capitalism they are both interconnected but at the same time antagonistic dialectics thanks for explaining dialectics for us milton friedman and milton asks what countries don't run on greed right russia china are you telling me that these countries don't run on greed well the goal of russia and under the soviet union when they were the soviet union in china is to build a society that is made to benefit the working class and get rid of the class who benefits at the exploitation of the workers so in a way they do run on greed right the greed of the working class we are going to establish good living conditions for the working class we are going to educate the working class and do all the things that for years capitalists have been trying to prevent them from doing trying to prevent kids from going to school so that capitalists could use them in the factories trying to work around any and all legislations that were put on the exploitation of labor by capital um because these those two antagonisms are not reconcilable when you have one you're always going to have the exploitation of the other so you can you can only create a society without that antagonism when you have labor the the mass of society come to dominate capital what china and the ussr were doing was trying to create a society um that that works in in the interests of the working class rather than against their interests in the interests of capital and what's funny is actually milton friedman was called into china when they were opening up their country to market reforms because friedman had been writing books and giving lectures on inflation china wanted to know how to combat inflation now that they were going to have markets in their society and the chinese intellectuals were blown away at how dogmatic milton friedman was instead of coming and talking about inflation inflation friedman just came and talked about free markets and how free markets are the only way to abolish inflation and you can't have any government intervention at all if you want to do anything about inflation and before he left one of the chinese officials actually told him milton i think you'll be surprised to find in the future that our system is actually better than your system which is dogmatically obsessed with free markets now years later during kovid china is heavily invested in public essential industries like housing transportation and food is heavily controlled by the government the state in order to prevent the horrible market effects that leave the working class without things like food shelter and the other necessities of life like we have in the us where we have more empty homes than we do have homeless people or thousands of people who die every year because they don't have access to basic health insurance and we are the richest country in the world while at the same time 78 of the working class lives paycheck to paycheck because that relationship between capital and labor is antagonistic it is not cohesive and milton friedman's whole grift is based on pretending that the interaction between labor labor and capital is cohesive and one final point here those countries that milton is trashing the ussr and china were attempting to build a state for workers in a world dominated by capitalism so immediately once these socialist countries have socialist revolution you see the us and other western countries using all the tools of capital to try and destabilize them that is what the us did in chile in 1970 when salvador allende came to power before overthrowing him insulting sending milton friedman to be the economic advisor of the horrible dictator augusto pinochet this the world runs on individuals pursuing their separate interests the world runs on individuals following their own self-interest okay let's think about that let's think about the labor process that creates all the things that society needs to maintain itself what part of that labor process is individual is independent is separate from everyone else hardly any of it the entire labor process is incredibly cooperative you go to work and you have to work side by side with your co-workers or you wouldn't get enough work done every manual labor worker knows this if you go to work concrete you can't lay all that concrete wait for it to harden and strip the walls by yourself it's an entire cooperative process it's the opposite of a process of individuals but they treat you as an individual as you go to work every day and cooperate with your co-workers not to mention the different hierarchies that exist at workplaces you have working or the workers management and then the owners so you have multiple hierarchies all who interact with each other and then inter-interact within the hierarchies it's a huge cooperative process and all these relations are interconnected as are the relations between the people or person who owns the company and the workers but that's an antagonistic relation where generally whatever's better for the owner is worse for everyone who works for the company so how is this an independent process or an independent society or how are we independent creatures the whole labor process is cooperative and the whole political system built around it and the economics built around it is based on this lie that were individuals acting like robots in our own self-interest the great achievements of civilization have not come from government bureaus einstein didn't construct his theory under order from a from a bureaucrat henry ford didn't revolutionize the automobile industry that way henry ford made the lives of his workers more monotonous by putting them on an assembly line where they only do one task all day while increasing his own profits albert einstein was a socialist almost all the studies today show that most innovations in science and technology are state subsidized and the soviet bureaucracy dominated the us in the space race other than getting to the moon when the u.s declared themselves the winner in the only cases in which the masses have escaped from the kind of grinding poverty you're talking about the only cases in recorded history or whether where they have had capitalism and largely free trade if you want to know where the masses are worse worse off worst off it's exactly from the kinds of societies that depart from that the only countries that have been able to bring their masses out of poverty and develop have been those that implemented free markets and free trade forget how the soviet union industrialized and became a feudal agrar went from a feudal agrarian society into one of the most powerful superpowers in the entire world through central planning forget what china's done and the way they've grown their economy and brought so many people out of poverty using government intervention forget those countries it was the united states who industrialized using slave labor and sold their cotton to europe who industrialized using brutal child labor with almost no factory regulations where thousands of people died of starvation living in utter misery those are the success stories those are the countries that bring the masses out of poverty like this is ridiculous the place where there was the least regulation was where capitalist industrialization was the most brutal and the advent of machine production was the most brutal in the us in europe and in other countries where they controlled it it was still rough but they were able to do it in a much less brutal fashion than where market forces were throwing people into poverty costs and what's super hilarious about this clip in specific is milton friedman is living and talking in this clip at a time when there had been years of keynesianism in the u.s where after the great depression workers said hey this whole capitalism thing doesn't really work for us they formed into unions and you had the largest number of wildcat strikes in the 1940s post world war ii and even before that in continuing after you have the implementation of lots of social programs you have the new deal you have medicare you have medicaid you have social security these programs keynesian programs meant to put put buffers on capitalism to make sure capitalism doesn't destroy the workers now after 40 years of milton friedman's neoliberalism and telling the workers that the more the government does for them the worse off they'll be we have a situation where 78 of american workers live paycheck to paycheck and our country is dominated by a financial oligarchy of banks and milton friedman got a chance to test his theory when he went to chile after the us overthrew salvador allende and you see him here bashing countries where they've gone away from free markets well what happened in chile was chile was getting 200 million dollars or billion dollars a year from the global financial institutions dominated by the west until they democratically elected a socialist and that number went from 200 to two and the u.s did what nixon called making the economy screen doing everything they could to make put chile's masses in poverty via destabilization efforts and the cia and economic embargo in order to make them overthrow salvador allende which they didn't do until the cia went in and got on the ground and organized the dictator augusto pinochet who would brutally come to power and rule with an iron fist murdering and torturing anyone who wanted the state to do anything in favor of the workers milton friedman was the economic advisor for that guy after milton friedman left pinochet would later have to re-nationalize a lot of the industries that he had sold off to private private entities because people were threatening to have another revolution despite the fact that milton friedman and his cronies refer to chile as the chilean miracle and pretend that milton friedman fixed the economy it's because gdp went up and as soon as they implemented neoliberalism you had a one class of people in chile get super wealthy while the working class experienced 20 to 30 percent unemployment because as we said these classes are antagonistic but milton friedman in his school of economics has no concept of this so if they see gdp going up or if they see people getting rich they go oh we did it the economy is great ignore the 20 to 30 percent unemployment so there you see the us overthrowing countries which milton friedman say only failed because they didn't have free markets and also you see milton friedman's free market policies failing in those countries the us overthrew so that the record of history is absolutely crystal clear that there is no alternative way so far discovered of improving the lot of the ordinary people that can hold a candle to the productive activities that are unleashed by a free enterprise so i guess milton friedman if you were around today would just support china now he would say oh i used to think markets were really great i used to worship these markets but now i see how the chinese communist party has allowed markets into their country and manipulated them using the government and the state to get whatever results that they want therefore i am now a supporter of china milton friedman is a tanki confirmed but it seems to reward not virtue as much as ability to manipulate the system and what does reward virtue you think the uh communist commissary awards virtue do you think a hitler rewards virtue nobody's arguing for a society based on virtue maybe at a higher stage of communism that's the ultimate goal but ultimately we're looking at the antagonistic interests within capitalism labor and capital and realizing that in capitalism to succeed is to get as much money as possible and the more workers that the capitalist exploits and the harder he exploits them the more money he makes so that is what the society is driven on the society is driven on exploitation if you got rid of the exploiting class you could create a society based on the self-interest of everyone and then maybe after that you could create a society after years of development that's actually based on virtue um but for now we just want to create a society that's not based on exploiting as many people as possible so you can buy a hundred mansions or jeff bezos just bought a yacht that needs another yacht to prop it up because it's such a big yacht that's what we're trying to get rid of in society milty i kind of sounded like a live there read what che guevara said about socialism and virtue and being a virtuous person as a part of the transition to socialism yeah screw you milton friedman you individualistic selfish goon you think excuse me if you'll pardon me do you think american presidents reward virtue do they choose their appointees on the basis of the virtue of the people appointed or on the basis of their political clout is it really true that political self-interest is nobler somehow than economic self-interest you know i think you're taking a lot of things for granted actually milton i think the political realm is a reflection of the economic realm so in the economic realm we have a small group of incredibly wealthy people benefiting off the exploitation of the vast mass of the rest of society and therefore the person or political appointees are chosen based on who has the most wealth and who has the most political clout for example donald trump appointed to secretary of state not one not two but three weapons manufacturers he appointed them because they have connections with private industry so trump can know which countries he needs to missile strike and invade in order to increase the profits of the weapons manufacturers so there you see our political sphere is nothing but a reflection of our horribly murderous and exploitative economic sphere just tell me where in the world you find these angels who are going to organize society for us well i don't even trust you to do that it's the working class not one working class individual but them working together as a collective a concept that milton friedman is not familiar with who can bring about a revolution which will bring about a new structure and a new organization of society this is how class struggles always worked in the struggle that moved us from feudalism in the feudal mode of production into capitalism you had peasants and workers rising up against the aristocracy and the the monarchy and the church at the time and the church and the mouthpieces of power at the time and those who own land said very similar stuff to what you hear milton saying in this video no other society is possible this is the only way things work there's no such thing as exploitation the greed of the monarch in the church is the greed of the people whatever is best for them is best for society until people realize it was ridiculous got their pitchforks and overthrew the king and queen which is exactly what we need to do now with these capitalists who rob us and force us into exploitation every day alright everyone this has been eddie smith responding to miltie friedman thank you for watching midwestern marks solidarity
