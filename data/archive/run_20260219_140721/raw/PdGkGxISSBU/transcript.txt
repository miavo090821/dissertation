what's up guys happy new year I was in the middle of shooting a video like a longer video and while I was putting away my lighting and my camera and all my equipment I put YouTube one in the background and I came across a Jeff holiday video about a racial attack in Chicago of racial / political attack in Chicago and that's kind of what I want to talk about today now when I first saw his headline I assumed it was or its title I assumed it was a police attack on black people right Chicago when most people think of Chicago they don't think of the wealthy side they think of like the south side of Chicago and like police brutality is a real thing however I was dead wrong it turned out that a white Trump supporter or white mentally ill person who was assumed to be a trump supporter by his attackers was kidnapped and tortured and his attackers put the video on or filmed it and did a Facebook live stream with it so they were actually live-streaming this guy's torture because they thought they were so right because you know he voted for Trump and Trump is somebody who would target people based on race bring back torture target the mentally ill and take away people's freedom so you know the only way to respond to that is to do all of those things so I'm going to show you a clip and it's not gonna be too graphic it's actually one of the more relevant one to the point I want to make hopefully I'm gonna find it in editing [Music] I think it turn out to be her sister according to news reports told her to stop beating this guy and that she was gonna go to jail and she just left it off like Oh what there's nothing wrong with this and this is like a part of a weird trend among the SJW community where they tend to and I don't know that these people are social justice warriors per se but they were definitely influenced by all the Trump hate that's been in the media and how it's gonna come and get you so at least there's social justice adjacent but anyway these people tend to film their own wrongdoing and then post it up as if it's right like we saw this with xarna Joshi he said that's right the lift girl even though the lift girls video was leaked because she had friends that like still had brain cells and when they shared it privately they're like no you can't release this you look like a [ __ ] jackass so it's this weird thing and it's like I don't want to blame it all on sjw ideology like these are for individuals and they're [ __ ] scumbags right like they were in the wrong they targeted somebody racially overall candidate presumably because they believe the candidate that this person might have voted for would target them racially like you know this doesn't make any like this does not compute kind of thing but then you remember that this according to ask JW's is not a race attack because black people can't be racist so this is just whatever like the person who's being oppressed because of groupthink and all that he was a member of the oppressor group and the people doing the attacking they were the oppressed and according to this kind of backwards ideology nothing that the oppressed group does can be like wrong right and like I'm generalizing the idea of it and I realized that most people are gonna look at this from whatever side and assume that the people who are actually in the wrong here or in the wrong and yeah but like this obviously if you embolden people and you fill them with fear and you tell them that some group of people is gonna you know it's out to get you then a certain percentage of people will believe it and a certain percentage of people will act on it like I don't know why this is so hard to understand like we always hear about America's history of racism America's history of racism but we never [ __ ] learn about America's history of racism white Americans ascribed negative attributes to black people based on their group Association and then [ __ ] racist attacks happened like and segregation happened and all these things that [ __ ] social justice warriors want to bring back happened like they want to bring back segregation but I'm starting to like rant and go like off the rails the other thing I wanted to talk about was some of these article headlines like I don't particularly mind the ones that say like that they're black teenagers because these people are shouting out like [ __ ] white people and like [ __ ] Donald Trump so like there's a racial component to the attack so I understand why like race is introduced for the attackers but there are other headlines that say black lives matter supporters or black lives matter activists attack mentally ill person because he voted for Trump or whatever and those just aren't verified not from any of the articles that I've seen and even if they were and I'm somebody who believes that a part of black lives matter has made like there there's some Horne that has come from like the ideology of black lives matter you can't ascribe the acts of these four individuals to the entire group or the entire race and you know not all black people are members of black lives matter not all black people support black lives matter this [ __ ] should be obvious but I just want to say it so if you see headlines like that read the article or like don't assume them to be true because it's kind of weird for an activist organization to [ __ ] just kidnap a dude it's not unheard of but and violence from BLM is not like a thing that never [ __ ] happens but like you know question it and like there's a difference between inspired by and done in the name of and [ __ ] sanctioned by the organization's so don't paint with a broad brush that's what [ __ ] these attackers it they painted this person of course again turn out to be mentally ill with a broad brush so yeah this is my first video back from the new years I'm going to try to make more videos I got some new lighting equipment and all this fancy [ __ ] that I put away before I did this ran make sure you smash that like button if you liked this video hit the subscribe button if you want to see more for some reason sherry I guess I don't [ __ ] share any videos but if you want to share this video feel free I appreciate it and until next time I wonder if my until next time so Luke lined up fix it in post you
