greetings and salutations loyal viewers of this Channel today we are going to discuss what the media is calling the exoneration of Adnan Saeed Adnan Saeed I don't know if you guys heard they tested some DNA and they discovered that Adon saeed's DNA was not on these items that they tested for therefore according to the media he's innocent who could have predicted that this would have been the outcome of this case at this point in time who could have mentioned exactly what they were going to do and how most people were going to fall for it oh wait a minute that was me let me roll the clip you see DNA evidence does not come with a timestamp it doesn't come with the date of deposit the reason why the defense team is harping on the DNA testing that supposedly wasn't done is because they know for a fact that a bunch of people have been in and out of Heyman Lee's car so they want to catch the DNA because all they're trying to do is shed ambiguity on the conviction not actually discover who the killer was on top of that it's a no risk proposition for them because they know for a fact that Adnan was her ex-boyfriend he had been in that car at other periods of time so even if we discovered that he did in fact leave DNA all over that vehicle it's not really going to make a difference because we all acknowledge that he was in the vehicle so they have a built-in excuse for if the DNA comes back Adnan to say oh well that actually doesn't prove any guilt this is one of the reasons why even though we all think DNA is the gold standard of evidence we have to understand that it can be just as circumstantial as any other piece of evidence especially depending on the scenario if you do DNA testing on the vehicle what you're gonna find is that a bunch of people were in that vehicle at any given time you'll find that her parents were likely in the vehicle her younger brother her cousin other people that she would have given rides to her current boyfriend or her boyfriend at the time of her murder and to Adnan so what you end up doing is creating a situation where you're proving something that doesn't really impact the case but it sheds ambiguity and it allows you to make more crappy commentary more crappy documentaries and assert that this evidence is somehow stronger than any of the evidence put forward when in reality it's the exact opposite now hold on to your hats everybody because I will explain to you in great detail in simple terms in a concise manner in a beautiful manner if I might say how this DNA testing was deliberately done in such a way in order for them to give a phony exoneration to Adnan and why it doesn't stand up to any level of the evidence presented at trial which is still overwhelming and points to ad not being the killer of Heyman Lee however this video is sponsored so since I have to pay the bills I'll toss it over to the sponsor then I'll bring it back over here and we'll discuss it on the other side visible signs of aging only get worse over the years because of a thing that we lose called collagen every decade you lose about 10 percent of the collagen production within your body and that means by the time that you're 45 you're producing about 30 percent less collagen and this is important because collagen rejuvenates collagen keeps your skin looking young it keeps your hair looking nice and this is one of the reasons why I recommend going to the basic Fountain of Youth that is Health with Justice and getting yourself a collagen supplement this powder actually has five different types of collagen within it and it could help fight the visible signs of aging so you can look good because when you look good you feel good and you can try this over at healthwithjustice.com for 51 off and risk-free with this 60 day money back guarantee that's healthwithjustice.com healthwithjustice.com so for some reason people seem to think that DNA is this requirement that we must have in all the cases in order to prove guilt first and foremost 92 percent of convictions have nothing to do with DNA DNA is never introduced at trial as a form of evidence it is neither an exonerating nor is it a convicting factor in 92 percent of cases secondly this murder when Adnan Saeed murdered Heyman Lee took place in 1999 so the things that we looked for in terms of DNA in 1999 are far different from what we look for now so when you have things like a murder weapon or you have somebody completely denying any affiliation the fact that you could use more modern DNA testing in order to look back and see if possibly you can tie that person to the scene of the crime thus proving their guilt that is a good use of DNA evidence however in this case this is not what happened in this case Adnan Saeed murdered Heyman Lee because she broke up with him meaning that they were ex-boyfriend and ex-girlfriend so there was never any question on whether or not Adnan had been at any point in time in hey Min Lee's vehicle this is why I call the DNA testing a farce because what they were going going to do is that if the DNA testing showed anything related to Adon they were going to say well of course his DNA is going to be there DNA doesn't come with the timestamp and Adnan was the ex-boyfriend so obviously he had been in that car before so you ended up setting up a system where you couldn't disprove any hypothesis on top of that the items tested and what actually yielded DNA should be quite telling for those of you who perpetuate the Innocence fraud because what they tested were the clothes that Heyman Lee was wearing the day of the murder and it turns out through the modern testing where they looked for DNA that was undiscoverable back in 1999 which by the way they ended up doing in 2018 upon appeal they were not able to find any DNA samples for anyone so those clothes were completely useless in terms of evidence however they did test one more item and these were the shoes of Heyman Lee now these shoes of Hayman Lee were not shoes that were found on her body these were shoes of haymen that were found in her vehicle so according to the DNA testing they found four DNA profiles on Hayman Lee's shoes therefore since none of those profiles were Adnan saeeds adenine Saeed is supposedly Innocent but here's the thing Hayman Lee's shoes were probably not touched by the person who strangled her during the course of the Strangling here's the thing if you actually look at the shoes or anybody's shoes and you decided to test it for DNA because we walk around on them and people leave biological material everywhere you would likely find multiple DNA samples here's the thing none of the DNA samples found on the shoes match these supposed alternative suspects that supposedly would have been the people to kill Hayman Lee instead of Adnan Saeed so these shoes don't prove anything and the idea that we have now four Killers because four people's DNA were found on shoes in Hayman Lee's vehicle is a absurd and remember there is nothing to indicate that any of these four DNA profiles that were found on Hayman Lee's shoes have any time stamp or any association with her murder if these were the shoes that she used while she was doing Athletics she could have got people sweat from the gym that she was running on on those shoes if these were shoes that she wore anywhere if somebody spit on the sidewalk guess what that saliva would be DNA that could be discoverable if preserved properly 20 years later when they did this DNA testing so the idea that we have four new killers that there's four real killers in this case and that overwhelms all the evidence that proves anad Saeed is guilty Beyond any doubt is absurd and if you really believe that then I would suggest that you call for more DNA testing of more of Heyman Lee's shoes do we have the shoes that Heyman Lee actually kept in her home at the time that she was murdered because I'm sure if you tested those shoes for DNA you could find even more real killers why not test shoes that she wore at a bowling alley imagine all the real killers you could find if Hayman Lee happened to go bowling at some point in her life and you could prove that those shoes were somewhat connected to her at one point in her life you don't have to connect it to the murder all you have to do is prove that she touched something at one point find a DNA sample that shows that some other person's biological material became in contact with the thing that she touched and apparently that proves Adnan Saeed is innocent I mean honestly was it even an argument at any point during the course of the trial that Adnan Saeed took Heyman leaves shoes from the back of her car and decided to strangle her with her own shoes covering his hands who put this Theory forward why was this relevant why was this tested I'll tell you why this was tested it's exactly what I called out earlier it was in order to find any kind of DNA profile so that way you could say that there was some real killer present and I talked about of course how if Adon saeed's DNA was found on anything related to the car they would have excused it by saying that DNA doesn't have a timestamp DNA is not dated etc etc but they don't grant that same courtesy to whoever happened to have their DNA profile connected to Haven Lee's shoes that were found in her vehicle not found on her body so what do they even have to do with her murder let's be clear about the evidence against Adnan Saeed so you can understand why it's overwhelming Adnan Saeed said on January 13th he went to school during his time at school he decided to leave with one J Wilds Jay Wilds was the star witness against Adnan Saeed and he gave details related to Heyman Lee's death that only somebody who was an accomplice after the fact would have known by the way notice how all the people who are claiming Adnan Saeed is innocent aren't talking about getting Jay Wilde's conviction overturned even though he was convicted as an accomplice to Adnan Saeed weird how Jay actually owns up to his role in this crime but Adnan is in full denial and everybody who's on his team goes into full denial with him despite quite the overwhelming inconsistencies now according to Adnan in his own words he decided to leave school with Jay because it was Jay's girlfriend's birthday and AD not wanted to make sure that Jay got his girlfriend a birthday present the problem is when you ask Adnan to go back and tell his version of what happened that day to refute Jay's story everything becomes a lot mushier yes he hung out with Jay on the 13th both during and after school but he doesn't remember exactly where they went or what they did or what time it was here's what he's got January 13th unfolded like any other day a normal mostly uneventful day he says there are a couple of things that do stand out though that day was Stephanie's birthday Stephanie was one of adnan's best friends and also Jay's girlfriend Anan had gotten Stephanie a birthday present stuffed reindeer which he'd given to her in second period Miss ephron's English class and uh one of the it occurred to me that day that that I was going to ask her boyfriend Jay did he get her a gift so sometime during the day before noon um wait I don't just hold up for a second why why did you care whether Jay got Stephanie a a present like what's it to you well uh Stephanie was a very close friend of mine as I mentioned and it was just uh I just kind of wanted to make sure that she also got a gift from him you know she had mentioned to me that um she was looking forward to getting a gift from him she mentioned she was really happy to get the gifts that I gave her so it just as I would with any friend uh just kind of uh you know went to check on that I kind of had a feeling that maybe he didn't get her a gift and I had free periods during school so it wasn't like you know it it was not abnormal for me to leave school to go do something and then come back so I went to his house and I asked him you know did you happen to get a present for Stephanie she said no so I said if you want to you can you can drop me back off to school you can borrow my car and uh you can go to the mall get her a gift or whatever and just come pick me up after a track practice that day so that's Adnan Saeed in his own words making the claim that he hung out with Jay because he decided that he wanted to check on him because he had a feeling that Jay didn't get Jay's girlfriend a present for her birthday and that's why he didn't call him on his new cell phone he didn't page Jay who had a pager because he was a drug dealer he decided unprompted and uninvited to drive over to Jay's house to ask him if he got his girlfriend a present because his girlfriend said I'm looking forward to getting a present from Jay my boyfriend and I would be very disappointed if I did not if you believe this you're an idiot if you believe this you're insane but I want you to remember that key part at the end of it where he says that J specifically was told to pick him up after track practice that's right Adnan says he told Jay after he gave him his car and his cell phone because he was so compelled to make sure Jay got his girlfriend a present that Jay should pick him up at track practice at the school remember that if you want to you can you can drop me back off his car after whatever and just come pick me up after a track practice that day now Jay says the reason he had him borrow the car and the cell phone from addon was because he was going to call him later after he murdered hey Min Lee in order to get picked up which one do you think makes more sense on top of that during the course of the day other people saw Jay and Adnan together two independent Witnesses testified that they saw both of them together on top of that Witnesses testified that Jay told them that Adnan had killed hey Min Lee on the day that she went missing he had told her that they killed her and buried her now hay went missing on January 13th and her body was not found until six weeks later yet you have three people who know the day of the murder that Adnan Saeed committed the murder and they all came forward to testify to that fact in court so how these people all knew coincidentally that Heyman Lee was strangled to death doesn't make any sense if you're one of these Adnan Sai truthers on top of that if you're gonna go with the explanation that Jay Wilds for some reason killed Heyman Lee and then framed himself as the accomplice and Adnan as the perpetrator you're gonna have to come up with some form of motive because Adnan Saeed actually has a motive in the case he was distraught due to the breakup she started dating somebody 13 days before Adon had written on the back of a note where Heyman Lee was telling him to back off stop harassing her that he's going to kill her okay here it goes I'm really getting annoyed that the situation is going the way it is at first I kind of want to make this easy for me and for you people break up all the time your life is not going to end you'll move on and I'll move on but apparently you don't respect me enough to accept my decision this is definitely written probably the Monday or Tuesday after homecoming the more fuss you make the more I'm determined to do what I gotta do I'll be busy today tomorrow and probably till Thursday I got other things to do better than give you any hope that we'll get back together I really don't see that happening especially now I never want to end this like this so hostile and cold hate me if you will but you sure remember that I can never hate you now you might say this letter on its own only goes to her State of Mind at that period of time and this is where you would be wrong because Adnan and hey would actually write notes back and forth and this letter was in the possession of Adnan and what he wrote on the back of this note was the following right at the top and by the way the handwriting analysis proves that this was in fact him he wrote I'm going to kill and this was all presented during the course of the trial the classic thing girl leaves guy guy gets angry if you can't be with me you're not going to be with anyone he kills her that's this case textbook jaywild's killing Heyman Lee doesn't make any sense no motive no rational person would come to that conclusion and on top of that since Adnan says that he decided to go with Jay and he decided to force the issue for them to go and hang out at the mall to get a present for Jay's girlfriend if you believe that nonsense it means that Jay must be the luckiest person in the history of the world because he was able to get adnan's car and cell phone from him unprompted at the same time for no reason that he was gonna kill Heyman Lee on top of that Adnan told the police that he was asking Heyman Lee for a ride so I called her the night before and I think she wrote the number down in her diary I've never talked to the police officer before and when he called me I was like I was literally high of marijuana and his cop calling me so what he asked me about hey I was kind of like hey did I ask hey for a ride that day I spoke to uh Mr Syed and he advised me that uh he was supposed to get a ride home from the victim but he got detained at school and she just got tired so Adnan the day that Hayman Lee went missing was contacted by the police because people were worried when she didn't show up to pick up her cousin and Adnan told the police that day that he asked hey to pick him up because he didn't have a car remember he just told in the podcast the host of the podcast that Jay was supposed to pick him up from track practice but now all of a sudden when it's talking to the police and by the way this is cooperated by what was testified to in trial Adnan was actually supposed to get a ride from hay thus making him the last person to see her alive are you a bit confused by this story right now are you having a little bit of difficulty on why Adnan can't keep his story straight how about this little anecdote Adnan Saeed would actually call Heyman Lee according to phone records each and every day in fact he called her three times the night before in order to arrange this pickup meeting which is weird because he says that this was a spontaneous thing because he lent Jay the car because he was really concerned that Jay didn't get Stephanie a birthday present but the thing is is that after hay went missing and Adnan had no reason to suspect that she was dead Adnan never called her again after she died the day that she died Adnan never called at all he called her every single day when somebody goes missing isn't the first dumb normal guy thing that you would try to do to be to call her well Adnan didn't I wonder why he didn't think calling her would do anything now Jay's told the police that he asked for the ride because that was his plan to kill him and he was going to call him on his own cell phone and have Jay pick him up so which one makes more sense that Adnan coincidentally gave the real killer the vehicle and the cell phone all the things that would lead to his conviction and then coincidentally got a ride from the murder victim and then coincidentally Jay Wilde somehow was able to kill her because remember he knew and told people that Heyman Lee was strangled and buried in a park that day how does that make any sense again people talk Non-Stop about the inconsistencies in Jay Wilde's story and they'll say oh Jay Wilds was inaccurate about this or that moment but all the inaccuracies in Jay wild story don't actually matter him saying that he didn't see the body in front of his grandmother's house because he was a drug dealer dealing drugs out of his grandmother's house and he was worried about consequences for her totally makes sense but the consistencies the things that he told other people at the time a day of before the body was discovered and the things that he told the police that are corroborated by the evidence or the actual key components of this story this is what ties it together Adnan has multiple fake Alibis that don't make any sense Adnan has a reason for hanging out with Jay that doesn't make make any sense it rings false Adnan actually asked hey Minh Lee for a ride that day that she went missing and that's the day that she was murdered none of that makes any sense need I remind you that at one point in time during the course of the trial the defense was going to produce 80 witnesses to claim that the evening at around the time that they were burying the body together Adnan was at the mosque Dear Mr Uric that is the prosecutor by the way these witnesses will be used to support The defendant's Alibi as follows on January 13th 1999 Adnan Masood Saeed attended Woodlawn High School for the duration of the school day by the way this is in fact false at the conclusion of the school day the defendant remained at the high school until the beginning of his track practice after track practice Adnan Saeed went home and remained there until attending services at his mosque that evening these witnesses will testify as to the defendant's regular attendance at school track practice and the mosque and that his absence on January 13 1999 would have been noticed and by the way there's a bunch of names if you look through this two full Pages almost of names and it's signed by the defense attorney this was presented up until the defense figured out that the prosecution could prove Adnan wasn't there so those 80 people that were going to lie for at Don Saeed and that one Alibi that he was gonna go with all of a sudden went away and were supposed to pretend that they don't exist even though I have the document where they claim that they were going to testify and prove that he was there then you have the Asia McLean situation where she says she saw Adnan at the library Adnan didn't even say he was at the library that day but sure whatever and then when she was actually called upon to testify in a 2012 appeal guess what she refused to testify after being convinced that Adnan was the Killer by the district attorney I figured with him being a prosecutor that he would be a reliable source for information and I gave him a call and I actually took notes on the conversation I told him that I saw Saeed in the library in 1999 he told me that they had cell phone records and they had a witness that confessed to helping him bury hay and then I wrote down something yurich said to me directly if I had any doubt that Anon didn't kill hay it would be my moral obligation to see that he didn't serve any time based on what he told me I felt that the conviction was you know airtight and so I didn't see the need for me to get involved 10 years later now if you had a conversation with somebody who's accused of murder at the same time that you had the conversation with them how are you going to be convinced that this person was the killer the reason why Asian McLean didn't testify in 2012 is because she was afraid of perjury charges two people at the time heard her say and were told directly by her and they signed sworn affidavits to the fact that she would lie for Adon Saeed because she believed in Adnan Saeed when she actually went to trial push came to shove turns out she backed out so I don't know if you guys are counting but that is three Alibis down the tube for Adnan Saeed but again we're only gonna talk about the inconsistencies in Jay wild story as in him changing where he saw heyman's body in the trunk of the vehicle that's the only thing that we're going to discuss the next thing that we go over is the cell phone data now everybody and their mother says incoming calls totally not not reliable for location data outgoing calls totally reliable because the incoming calls actually paying at the time of burial to Adnan cell phone in the Lincoln Park area guess what that's where Hayman Lee's body was found guess what that cell tower in particular covers basically the park and not much else so supposedly two independent incoming calls randomly and accidentally for no reason at all whatsoever ping the burial site at around seven o'clock where Adnan can account for his whereabouts and then after that people don't want to talk about this at the car dump site at 804 an outgoing call Pings that location so you have an outgoing call which supposedly according to the conspiracy nuts is reliable for location data after the burial at the car dump site that's totally just dismissed and ignored for no reason and two coincidental incoming calls that are for some reason unreliable even though the serial podcasts themselves when they reached out to experts found no evidence of any distinction between the reliability and location data from incoming and outgoing and those claims come from one piece of paper from a t with no known author and they've actually brought in Wireless Experts to testify an appeal that were more qualified than the one who testified at trial to state that that's ridiculous no no no for some reason that's totally debunks everything for some reason on top of that there's another stupid point that keeps being brought up in my comments and that is the so-called lividity issue that is the so-called full frontal lividity now where this comes from is where all of these conspiracy theories come from which is Adnan saeed's best friend's sister Rabia the person who has sold a best-selling book off of this who did her own podcast who has become a millionaire off of this who the HBO documentary is based on her book this person released an excerpt from the autopsy that said something about full frontal lividity and although to be clear the phrase full frontal lividity is actually a bit of a misnomer that's a bit of a paraphrase that came from Rabia for some reason because what it actually says was lividity was present and fixed on the anterior surface of the body except in areas exposed to pressure now anterior does not mean frontal it doesn't mean full frontal if you look up the definition of anterior guess what it means closer to the front for those of you who don't know when you die and whatever position you're in gravity pulls your blood to that position so the idea is since Hayman Lee was buried kind of on her side then therefore full frontal validity would mean that she was laid face down lividity set in and then she was buried thus disrupting the timeline that is the point that is brought forward by this excerpt of an autopsy put forward by Rabia the propagandist who's making money off of pretending Adnan is innocent now the reason I say excerpt from the autopsy is because it is just in fact that because after the state realized what they were doing that they were using this excerpt they actually released the full autopsy and it turns out one page later they described exactly where the blood was pulling and the blood was pulling inside of her face and part of her chest the exact parts that would have been exposed to the ground where Heyman Lee was buried in the position that she was found to be buried in so the lividity is not full frontal lividity that is made up by Rabia that is something taken out of context from the autopsy and if you bother to read the autopsy one page later it's completely debunked generalized skin slippage was noted and liver mortis was prominently seen on the anterior upper chest and face a poorly defined paranasal areas of dark discoloration of the skin was seen extending to the right of the face which approximately measured one and a half to two inches there there was a fairly circumcised dark brown skin discoloration measuring one inch in diameter on the left cheek these two last described areas are consistent with pressure applied with contact with the elements so what this is saying is that the blood settled nearer to the front than to the back however there were specific areas based on the way that she was contorted where the blood pulled even more and those areas were also responding to pressure now for those of you who think we might have changed subject because the terms were changed from lividity to liver mortis I just want to point out that if you look up the definition of liver mortis you will find that it also means lividity so yes this section right here debunks the claims made about this section right here do I need to go over any other stupid conspiracy theories about Adnan Saeed being innocent what about the Brady violations supposedly it's a Brady violation for the cops to not disclose that at other points they looked at other suspects and allegedly theoretically this would have helped prove Adnan is innocent because this is supposedly exculpatory evidence now this was adjudicated multiple different times this was discovered to not be a failure to disclose kind of situation and more importantly the other suspect that they looked at was not somebody who was randomly completely disconnected from Adnan it was actually adnan's best friend at the mosque and Mentor a 27 year old who only worked as another accomplice not as a suspect on their own so if Adon wanted to run into court with the defense that it was his friend and Mentor who did The Killing without him even though he only works as an accomplice not as a killer then feel free but no that is not a failure to disclose exculpatory evidence what happened here is that Adnan lost every appeal what happened here is that his buddy was making money off of pretending he was innocent and everybody was making money along the way and you kept only hearing one side perpetuated throughout the media and that side does not hold up to scrutiny all of these details all of these facts were brought up in a court of law they lost each and every time on appeal because they happen to be meritless but then Mosby awoke district attorney who refuses to prosecute anybody lost her primaried when she lost her primary and is actually facing fraud charges she decided it would be a good idea while she's going out the door as a final Fu to Baltimore to open up this case and basically follow motion on behalf of the defense with stuff that was contradicted on appeal multiple different times so she did this and she set up a scenario where she would declare him innocent based on frivolous evidence and that evidence is frivolous and as predicted she has done just that so let's be clear if you are under the impression that the shoes found in Hayman Lee's car not found on her body having the DNA profiles of four people that were not Adnan Saeed means that there's four real killers in this case you're an idiot you you're a fool you got suckered in you're somebody who believes that the word DNA is a magic word don't read past the headline and you just go off of that and you deserve to be conned Anytime Anyplace because that's who you are and you falling for this Con you buying into this actually deny Justice to the family of Heyman Lee who once again coincidentally was not informed prior to this hearing prior to this dump prior to the charges being dropped in violation of Maryland's victim right statute remember there's an actual victim in this case well it's all fun and games to pretend that we have a mystery on our hands and pretend to be internet sleuths a girl was murdered by her ex-boyfriend because he could not let her go a family is shocked and destroyed by these actions and is repeatedly destroyed as you put their story on display For Your Entertainment this case is a travesty of Justice this case is a prime example of Innocence fraud and the reason we cover these cases is the reason we tell the truth about these cases is once it's out there it's going to set it in the narrative once it's out there people are going to have it in the back of their minds that random shoe DNA that has nothing to do with the murder that's found on the victim's car somehow exonerates the murderer and they're gonna jump for joy and celebrate that again I can't wait for people to run the testing of Nicole Brown Simpson's shoes that were in her car so that they could find the real killer in the O.J Simpson case can't wait to see it because apparently all you have to do is find a pair of shoes in a car run some DNA testing and you'll find the real killer you don't even need somebody to be murdered if you find DNA on shoes in anybody's car even if that person's still alive then that means the people's whose DNA is on those shoes actually killed that person why do we even need a body for crimes why do we even have trials all we have to do is look for shoe DNA inside somebody's car and apparently that proves something again can't wait for them to test all the other things that Heyman Lee touched at some point in her life so we can find even more Killers maybe there's 50 Killers maybe there's a hundred killers in this case we'll never know because we don't know to the extent that Heyman Lee stepped on other people's DNA going throughout the course of her day-to-day life so yeah this is Injustice this is innocence fraud it's disgusting and if you throw more stupid conspiracy theories in my comments don't think I'm not going to address them don't think I'm not gonna highlight them don't think I'm not gonna look into them find out that they're insane and Destroy them Adnan Saeed is guilty Heyman Lee's family deserves Justice they were denied it make no mistake about it but hey those are just my thoughts they happen to be 100 right and accurate let me know your thoughts down in the comments below if you liked the
