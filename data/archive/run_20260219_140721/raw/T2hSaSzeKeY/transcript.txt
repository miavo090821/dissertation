patriarchy is like shaking right now they're like damn I can't beat my wife no more damn I can't have four secret wives around the block the government desis to put a lot of innocent black men in jail on fous charges didy is not one of those men y'all really are white supremacy's most valuable puppets this right-wing person is just holding black people accountable you literally sound like a slave to me black men become the biggest conspiracy theorists when their Heroes get attacked immediate they turn a Maga 3000 and we saw what happened to Kevin Samuels Kevin Samuels was stepping into territory where he was about to purchase mic for every [ __ ] that we know that want to disrespect women all around the world [Music] hello beautiful black people let me tell you why I've convened you today I want to talk about Diddy I also want to talk about OJ and kayin Clark and some other things but it really depends on what time we have after we unpack Diddy so yeah I had had some I'm very of the camp that we all know what Diddy is and that they whatever they say Diddy did Diddy did but also now that there is a criminal case I have different and more nuanced opinions and how the criminal Cas is being handled and in the court of public opinion that's why I brought all y'all to talk about the different angles but specifically I'm going to pass the wheel to Natalie because Natalie had done like uh she read the documents okay she read the documents did more of a deep dive okay like we're both lawyers but that's the lawyer that read the files so did yes so tell us Natalie yeah so I um like you said Olay I read the files I went 70s something pages I think and then it became 90 something Pages something like that it's a ridiculously long lawsuit um so right now we don't have any criminal indictment we just know that he's being investigated by the feds across multiple jurisdictions so across multiple states by the federal government because his homes in La Miami and New York were raided by the federal government so we know that they're investigating him but that's based on several lawsuits that have been filed by several individuals that have accused him of things including sex trafficking rape uh drugging um and then obviously the the Shady Financial dealings that he's been known for since the Inception of his career the one that's really caught people's attention or I guess the two the first one being the Cassie lawsuit which had a element of sex trafficking to it that lawsuit was settled in one day from the time that it was filed which I said is record-breaking and then you had Lil Rod's lawsuit that was filed um on the heels of that incorp inating a lot of references from the Cassie lawsuit but then also making additional allegations the parts that have been the most salacious and that the media has paid the most attention to are the gay things right that's what everyone seems to be most interested in but that's really not what is an issue here because consensual gay sex is not a crime it's not a civil tort nor is according to little Rod he was trying to groom him into homosexuality that's not really something someone hitting on you and then if they stop after you say no is not really a civil action But continuing to have sexual overtures to someone who does not want to have sex with you is obviously a problem and so it's wide ranging in that it makes several allegations that between the first lawsuit and the amended lawsuit are clear were not necessarily true but some which have not yet been proven and will have to be proven in a court of law because it doesn't seem like Diddy's going to settle this one so I don't know what like particular questions you have about it but that's kind of an overview of what I came across it you know it's crazy because it feels that that feels like that confirms a lot more that I feel like a lot of the media's discussion like how we're discussing the case and the amount of hoopla around the Diddy case is influencing the federal government getting involved like you know what I mean the fact it seems like they didn't like they weren't independently investigating he or had any evidence or anything but they're looking into and paying a lot of attention to his civil lawsuits because of the amount of media attention and now they are they're on a fishing Expedition essentially yes um so what is in Cassie's lawsuit I think should have given law enforcement more of a pause and we don't really know when they started their investigation because they don't have to disclose that until they start to take public actions but um the the Cassie lawsuit was alleging that he was moving her across state lines and coercing her to have sex with prostitutes and then carrying guns and drugs across state lines which I think would be indicative of different types of trafficking and so that would have you know that would have uh summoned the federal government in most cases however after it settled it kind of died down and then Here Comes little Rod the interesting thing is that is that I think little Rod could have potentially swung a double-edged sword for himself because a lot of his allegations were that he was doing things on the behest of Diddy like he was soliciting prostitutes and did he wasn't checking to see if these girls were underage or or adults or not but it's like he was saying that he was the one that was getting the prostitutes so it's just like well then you weren't checking to see if they were underage or not which is interesting that you would put that in a filing um that Diddy was like you know doing all these different type of drugs and bringing them in airplanes and across state lines that's obviously going to make the federal government's ears perk up but I think it's the salaciousness that got everybody interested in it that then made the federal government go and look at the case because when it there were three separate lawsuits before Lil Rod there was Cassie there was the girl that said she was a teenager in the 90s and she was flown from one state to the other where she was sexually assaulted by Diddy and two other men and then there was the girl that said that she like went to the studio that Diddy came and picked her up and then he like filmed her and sent out revenge porn all three of those allegations should be highly concerning and last year there was a lawsuit that settled kind of quietly and again should have been concerning so it's very interesting that once there's the stain of homosexuality that's when the federal government was like oh let's look at this you know so there's there's been allegations for decades about Diddy it's very interesting that it's happening now I think you pointing out a lot of different things I think people what I'm seeing online which you pointed out a really great Point people's focus is on like the um the G part of it or whatever they want to you know make that expand like have those type of conversations and they're making when people are talking about ddy like no ddy like people have um replaced Paws with uh yeah no Diddy or whatever the case may be um you know so that's I don't like that that's the the part that they're focusing on when all the points that you just talked about you read it for all of us um and so this man is can be allegedly um you know a rapist or you know sexually he he's he's charged or can be charged of sexually assaulting somebody um you know holding people it like just this is this man is is evil but then I focus on that part of it um and the second the second part of it is how everybody is online having conversations espe especially in those spaces and places that we've already talked about on this platform Shay rooming them um they'll say you know this black man right this is what they're focused on this black man they're trying to bring down and here go black people going up against black people and I hate that talking point because because what's we're not looking at are the things that you just named all these things that you just you just talked about what he's basically can be charged with what he's done what people's testimonies but people don't want to talk about that part of it which makes it true they want to focus on us talking about this black man and this black man going down and did he was about to buy a company conspiracy and see when because he he wanted to buy this strink company this is what's happened Focus are y'all not seeing what's happening the black men no um are you not seeing what the allegations are what can be true people's testimonies uh are we not are we not seeing that and we can call a thing a thing yes he happens to be black and yes he may have done these things so can we focus on that right now I think this is that's the problem that I'm having with this whole Diddy thing so when you look at the totality of the lawsuits all of the victims are black people the alleged victims of these things they're black people and they're black men and black women but you cannot and this is kind of it's a microcosm of an overall issue within the black community In America which is what I can really speak to and that is that you will have a man in a position of authority and because of the image of Blackness that's so tied to patriarchy and capitalism as you know reaching the American dream that someone that has reached that Pinnacle we don't want to tear them down because they are the example of us and Diddy is oh if we tear down Diddy then who else is going to make it kind of sort of not really considering the fact that he had to harm a lot of people to get to where he is and the victims of his abuse allegedly are black men and women Financial abuse and sexual abuse I think we like the idea of like black Excellence so much that we like it at the expense of black people because a point my boy Messiah had made to me was that if we truly cared about like black people and how black people are treated Diddy would have been a character that we wouldn't have been celebrating long before this because if forget whether we know anything about all these allegations we know as a culture we know that Diddy has been exploiting black artists for decades he's known for that we call it the Diddy curse we know what it is so we know that and yet this is a man we've continued to celebrate so that in of itself says what we as a community are willing to allow to be done to black people in the name of black Excellence even if it's just that one person at the expense of many and then I think the second point that really evidences that is when Cassie who we know we know Cassie we don't even like C the other people in the lawsuits are not even figures we know but we know Cassie we know that relationship we had kidy other people confirm it this was settled within a day and people there was so much unwillingness to to believe that he's done those things but the minute a man makes salacious like or or can makes anything uh that that allows people to say he's gay and they can mock them about that then now you believe it the man makes all these allegations all these allegations even in a complaint that actually in that case if that's the one with the the photos a bunch of different things that have just is obviously salacious for media attention there were discrepancies that had been cleared up by some of the people that were were mentioned in the complaint so there's every reason to actually question that one no questioning you take all that at face value because it's better for you to Mock and say Diddy's gay but you wouldn't listen to the woman so yeah that's exactly right and that connects directly to this whole weird Hollywood conspiracy theory about people and stuff like that and how they're having these weird things in the background and people eat that up it's easier to believe that than actually the exploitation of other people especially women and that's the first thing people jump to you that is the main thing that you hear on the internet and your friend groups and everything is about Diddy doing gay things I'm like wait a minute Diddy's a terrible person for very for various reasons and this is the thing that we're focusing on like yeah really no yeah and then the people that are supporting it the people that are supporting it um Tyrese why you checking in baby because you know I don't I don't understand like you you and he makes these long soliloquies about how great this man is didd he is um that all these other people and here they are they're celebrities but they're they're saying that Diddy's such a great guy but they're ALS they're also other celebrities that they want to quiet but that are also having the same testimonies as other people as Cassie um and they're saying like this man has done this this man has put me in in positions and places and they don't want to hear those stories yet Tyrese comes out here and says how Diddy is such a great man and he's done this for me he may have been good to you but so many other people have witnessed and experienced him differently your favorite person can be a bad person to other people we can say that we can say that yeah yeah I think that like what's one I don't think Tyrese is well so we can I think there's something going on there outside of this but also like this is the way that patriarchal violence functions um the same reason why pidy is able to get the love and support from black people black women the black community in general is the same reason why OJ Simpson was able to do it um after he damn near allegedly or they say he didn't beheaded a woman um the same reason why a pastor or a preacher who could be doing things in the church in a Baptist Church gets to get away with it the same reason why Andre Dickens gets to get away with it in Atlanta like all of these systems of oppressions are as we know like everybody on the call knows they're all interlocked but the way that patriarchal violence and the way that race is used especially for black people is so sick it's like the after the Reagan Era during the Reagan Era with black excellence and black wealth this like this propagandized like nasty like uh like it's just sick the way that that we are manipulated into protecting the like Patriarchs of our community when they are doing really horrible abusive things no that's real that's real that that Mak like that that makes me think of the amount of black people that I've seen since my Eric Adams interview be like oh she was disrespectful to him D and I'm like it's crazy how I could tell you that a man is actively over policing black people getting black people killed pre-trial you know excusing police like murder of black people he could be have his back to me screaming over me talking to me like I'm a child saying s the next thing and somehow you think oh I don't like him but bootlick like you know what I mean oh he's a leader he's a this he's a that and I'm like boy it really has us in a [ __ ] choke old done like we really we really like to protect power at the expense of us while someone's telling you it is hurting us yeah it's so nuts it's like the comments are like he's here like damn daddy like it was it's wild but that is the way that people react when especially when you're talking to a black man with a perceived amount of power they're like please don't he's our King Our God it doesn't matter what he's done yeah yeah and even if they say even if they can acknowledge it's funny because the same people can acknowledge that this person has done this thing that is wrong right but when a black woman um is in the space a woman first of all when a woman but when a black woman is in the space having the conversation leading the conversation actually having the audacity to hold this person accountable um and do their job with their expertise they're going to be like now pipe down and that's what I saw not only with with you know with you ol I did see that in the interview that's one of the first things that I saw was a disrespect and they were like well he may have done those things but you know Olay he's the mayor like you're talking to the mayor and you're at your black woman is showing please please like you know turn it down but even with Cassie speaking of it's like Diddy may have did those things but it's Diddy we're talking about this is this is Diddy yeah like be quiet why are you coming here it goes why believe women why you know she she's coming out now um he may have done these things to other people but here Go Cassie why did she let this time pass to speak her truth she only wanted the money now that it's settled here you know here we just shows that she only wanted a coin in this moment I'm like what did did y'all not hear what kid Cy said so we going to skip around how dangerous this man can be uh we are we going to skip those things are we not going to the goal post will always move cuz she criminal charges that see look look at her trying to send a black man to jail and then she pursues civil suits oh look she only want money if she hadn't pursued anything and just told her story that have been like look at her clout Jason I wanna can can I do a comparison here on the like the facts because what you guys are bringing up is making my brain percolate because I've read both of those lawsuits and kind of compared them side by side in a in a live stream and the Cassie said things that were verifiable so for example didd he beat me in a hotel room and he dragged me in the hallway and there was video footage of it and it's our information and belief that Diddy is in possession of the video footage because we know he paid the hotel to get the video footage and so in the discovery process we're going to want to get the video footage we have witnesses who will testify that they observed Diddy physically assault Cassie we have the witness of kid Cy himself in the lawsuit they said he himself will say that Diddy blew up his car because when they were on a break Cassie was dating kid Cy which is an extreme form of violence of domestic violence to attack the person that your person is trying to move on with like that is that is I don't I don't know how many times I've seen cases where that happens that type of violence right it's very common it's a very it's a part of the cycle of violence it's a big problem verifiable Lil rod on the other hand says did he try to groom me into homosexuality by showing me videos of Stevie J having gay sex it's not even true that's not even Stevie Jay in the video it's an actual gay male porn star in the video right like that's not him verifiably untrue oh um you know another thing that I think Diddy's Representatives had come out with oh Diddy in uh was doing this in this location Diddy wasn't even in that location when those things happen now that's not to say that some of his allegations are not true but some of his allegations are verifiably untrue now what's the response to Cassie where everything she said was verifiable and Diddy settled it the next day she's a liar she's clout chasing that's what she wanted to do she wanted to have sex with those men in those freak offs she wanted to take those drugs because she wanted the clout and now she just wants money what is the response to L Rod he's basically a hero he's brave for exposing the industry right it's not seeing that he just wants money or that this is really a contract dispute that he's adding a little extra salt into in order to get the attention he is seen as this good guy so there is a difference in the response from the public cuz that's the only thing that you're allowed that's the only thing that they find okay to bring down a black man for and its homosexuality that's the only thing that that gets to pass that's that's really what it is it's like anything else you accuse it is a g none of that but being but by by by you know why because he becomes a man they can't emulate what they like is is the idea they like the idea of this really powerful rich black man that's able to do it whatever with women and be able to have people under their control and blah but they don't like the gay that immediately that makes him that knocks him off the pedestal in their mind and willing you know what I mean they're willing to sing that condemnation song right and this reminds me I would never forget when this happened when JayZ was on Twitter spaces X spaces whatever you call it and he got mad at people for calling him a black capitalist and going in on him or whatever and then he was just like you can't do that they're trying to shut me down they're just making up new words making up new words what are you talking about and then there was people defending him and stuff like that well he's different how so please I wait for your dissertation please let me know how this is any different but people are willing to defend it because it has a black face on it even in that moment we could we could talk about these different types of capitalists we could talk about white capitalist and stuff like that then when it comes to black ones hold on wait wait wait wait wait he's different no no he's not what are you talking about cuz a lot of us aren't against the system like we're a lot of us are against like our place in the hierarchy like in the structure right like the issue is not capitalism the issue is how like black people have not been able to excel under capitalism like they want that's why they say things like black capitalism as though it's any [ __ ] different any Lex exploitative or anything like that's capitalism just black people doing it I think I think though it also speaks to um toxic masculinity and like homophobia within the black community because it's like um man some of the people that I've talked to in like high conversations with like just over the years they would rather shoot their mama in the face if ad meant that they weren't going to get called Gay by one of their homies like dead ass and it's just like you see with this Diddy stuff it's like they're going straight towards oh he's gay he's B like look at the look at the all the other [ __ ] and then like the gays at the bottom is like they only focus on what's at the bottom of the [ __ ] list it's like yeah focus on all this [ __ ] right here like this is he's like objectively horrible person but like they only focus on the tap part it's weird speaking gay is not even on the list right and that's what really annoys me about L lawsuit is that that's not actionable like I do not care if Diddy likes to have consensual sex with men and women I do not care I don't care if he liked you and he was just like hey I like you I I care if he physically touches you against your will I care if he doesn't desist after you tell him know but a lot of the complaints just literally had to do with I observed him and engaging in gay activities and that hurt my feelings that's what a lot of the complaints were it wasn't even things that not always but it really wasn't things that Diddy had done to him it was like and then I saw him do this and then I saw him do that and that was him trying to get me to be gay because I was a musical genius and I grew up in the church what are why is this in a lawsuit you know so that just lets me know that our priorities are all messed up it's okay to drug people it's okay to traffic people it's okay to abuse your girlfriend but heaven forbid you observe somebody do something gay now it needs to be a lawsuit and it needs to be you know a think piece you know and I wish people were going to engage in like any kind of like helpful analysis about the D case um or in a way that if they weren't going to talk about uh him being gay or full concern on anything if they actually wanted to talk about the case or what they think is wrong I would be more concerned with like the larger implications right the idea that like if black people of black pop culture Black Culture the black community is discussing something in open like discussing something inhouse the the feds are paying attention to it and deciding they're going to make you know make that their business right that is more interesting to me or why like or like us being so wrapped up in the sensationalism of what's happened in the Diddy like we don't really stop to address this militar like this militarized Force they used to on some on some warrants to raid the homes like whether or not that was necessary and what that means like there are things about the Diddy case that to me show the pro the the UL problem about the the legal system and the criminal system and they could discuss that if they wanted to have their conversation about how black men are treated or something that was unfair or that has implications for everybody else but they're not talking about that because they like again they like the sensationalism and the fun so they don't have any problem with the the militarize r because like w Diddy house getting R you see that [ __ ] on TMZ that's crazy like so they don't care about that they they're not talking about anything like that like oh have yall noticed oh we're talking about this this becomes viral and all of us all of a sudden the feds are like we we have we have to do all of this on on just like looking for something like they don't they don't not bring any charges yet they don't have anything concrete it seems like but raids wild raids like let's have let's lock up the kids yeah no that's the problem with it people are going to focus on that the feds is all a sudden gonna focus on that if you know this this has now become to me sensationalized when the actual whole like you said there's ass salt here this man is can be possibly dangerous has a history of being dangerous and but people want to focus on all of these things that are already um you know placed in the world as something bad being gay is something terrible so like you were saying I love how you josed that Natalie where you said okay you know Lil Rod said this Cassie said this on like if we being honest Cassie's whole list whole life 10 years of her being with this man is in these documents and it's terrible Hotel footage being dragged you know being beat um being locked up you know in in a home being forced to do drugs uh to have sex and whatever the case may be and then Lil Rod saying this man I watched gay sex and it was it hurt my feelings but people immediately went over there and because the uh the you know the trigger word is gay right that's a trigger word so everybody has to focus on it sexual assault is not a trigger word um you know this man don't empathize they they don't empathize with women being sexually assault but they do empathize with your gay [ __ ] hurt my feelings like really like like how dear you know how they are though they like it's the way they hate Jada pink Smith cuz she's ruined will she's masterly destroyed his legacy because destroyed to them a black man's Legacy has everything to do with what performance of masculinity they're giving right if Will Smith is no longer in their eyes this like Untouchable powerful black man that has the perfect black wife who loves him the idea that they they think like they think of him as second to Jada or that he's ad the mercy of Jada's feelings ruins him so they [ __ ] hate so for like that's it it's like they don't hear what they're upset about is the idea that this this this city one of their their black I where they' put a place on a pedestal has been ruined for them with the stain of homosexuality what's even funnier about that those same people who say that have quote unquote imass emasculated Will Smith himself throughout his whole entire career so I find that extra funny and I'm like y'all have always said that he was a punk he wasn't this he wasn't that now all of a sudden J DEA Smith is doing that I'm like I'm pretty sure I heard y'all this whole time doing what y'all say that she does or maybe even worse but hey whatever yeah so I agree with you and just jumping off of what you said I feel like there's like a historical issue here where the performance of masculinity um is one of and this crosses uh races but I think it's a particular issue with our community is one of violence and so if a man is performing masculinity against his significant other through violence that is almost like oh well he went too far but it's kind of un like you as a woman have to accept that that your man might assault you or he might hurt you or something like that because he's had a tough time and it's really hard out here for black men so don't try to take his masculinity away from him right and so we in a way I think because Will Smith always performed this kind of like fatherly or funny role um all all he was always teased for not being masculine enough but the masculinity that he did have was the fact that he was the head of this family and so when he when it was known before this whole Jada pinket Smith thing that Will Smith was cheating on his wife and let me just that is just something that for for some reason we've all forgotten before it came out about August alcena it was known that Will Smith repeatedly cheated on Jada pinket Smith all the time they had there's an allegation that he had an open affair with Margo Robbie Margo Robbie in in public you know like there's a picture of them like all hugged up together inappropriately while he's married to Jada pinket Smith to the point where people were happily saying oh they have an open marriage so the idea of them having an open marriage was oh okay as long it was Will Smith being the masculine one patriarch the of this family but sleeping you know around patriarchy tells them that that's the reward like that a lot of them believe a lot of black men believe that the reward for being successful is that especially if you're considered providing for the family or the woman is that that's his right like that should come with it you should be okay with that that he should be able to sleep with whomever like that is a benefit they see that as a benefit of success or being at the at the top of this so that's fine for them and saying when they were calling an open marriage what they really meant like that's just their way of not wanting you to put the cheater stain on him ultimately what it is is they're fine with that they don't need to mention that because they don't think that that's an they don't think that that counts as an act of misconduct against her like that's not where of harm so he should be allowed to do that that is totally fine open marriage is just so they in their way what they're saying is she's okay with that there's nothing here for you to hold against him that's nothing to criticize him for and so they leave that up because they they don't have it's and it's a bunch of that's we know a bunch of you'll see T tii cheats on Tiny so and refuses but refuses to let tiny be able to be with anybody he thought she was talking to Floyd that one time he lost his [ __ ] mind like that is a regular thing of them feeling like because they feel like as a man they should be able to sleep with whomever and God forbid they were successful they're the black man that managed to do well and blah blah blah of course he should be able to sleep with women Delany I just think that like black men or just me patriarchy is like shaking right now like everyone's like who am I like men are asking themselves like what does it mean for me to be a man what is masculinity they're like damn I can't beat my wife no more damn I can't have four secret wives around the around the block and if that's not socially acceptable damn like I'm not getting paid enough at my job so I really can't be the head of the household so like what the hell am I good for there's so many and it's making black men are just holding on to this idea of this like Rich patriarch which is why they have such an allegiance to Jay-Z to Diddy to all of these people and it makes me like sad because it kind of reminds me of politics in this way that like none of the things that people are saying to black people around like capitalism and go for your dreams none of it is materializing and everyday black people's lives you literally get nothing by aligning yourselves with these people just like when Joe Biden is saying things and he's talking about the black community and black people are like we gotta believe in Joe we have believe in Joe but their but their lives look the exact same as they did from before when he was before him being elected there's something about empty platitudes that like people are just eating up because they're they can't we can't physically touch anything this like fake trickle down [ __ ] it's not working talk about it well and and this organization black men build uh they talk about this often about like they say new men must be born there has to be a new a new type of man that isn't like it's not dependent upon violence and exploitation and capital like damn [ __ ] like do you want to read a book like do you want to ride a bike like who do you want to be outside of outside of violence and outside of um outside of capital who are you but that's the problem is they see it from every direction like they they're getting that from every D direction right it's not like you know and and because I know some people there I know there will be black men or men who hear this and immediately get upset because they feel like it's an indictment it's like it's not it's not an indictment no one is blaming you that it's your fault right you're growing up in a patriarchal society and you're being indoctrinated to believe and to perform to perform that from every direction right like it's not just like me women all of us have been indoctrinated in this Society so you're hearing that constantly regurgitated and reinforced from every direction so like black black men are chasing that because from the time they were black boys they didn't even get to be black boys and black childhood all is ever been about is you're supposed to be raising strong men and strong men are supposed to be performing masculinity and trying to achieve these like goals and there never is really a focus on how they can be individuals how you can learn to be a full person the array of emotions like none of that is you know what I mean that's not what's painted to be to be that should be the focus you know what I mean that's not what's cool it I think what's like interesting about that is that even then in childhood black men there there's like a a lack there's a there's a lack of like emotional um education that black men get and all of those things but I would say that the strongest people in the house would be that black man's mama and his sister like who also believe in patriarchy yes sure but the way that like the way that it's the way that the strength the way that black women and and and black daughters are are have to be like strong and these like anchors in the family I mean you would think we would be like itching for the for the for the powers of patriarchy like because we're the ones that are actually doing the work of it or or the work that they say patriarchy is is supposed to be about I was going to say that's why they have such an allegiance to these people like like Diddy or like R Kelly or like Bill Cosby right because they want to be like these people they've like aspired to be like that their whole lives and they see these and they see them getting like getting attacked for [ __ ] that they did actions that they committed and it's just like I go back to that boom. s all the time like what the hell is wrong with you people every famous [ __ ] that gets arrested is not Nelson Mandela a lot of innoc on fous charges is not one of those men what happened to standards what happened to minim you want to help you want to help Diddy get some counsel for Diddy woman get Hisar don't pretend that [ __ ] is a hero though like that's that's real like like each like one of these people you can f out to Bill Cosby R Kelly Chris Brown so many different [ __ ] people OJ Simpson [ __ ] it's like you don't need to have like an allegiance to these men because you want to be like them CU you aspire to uh to be a billionaire and a millionaire you were you you're like um aspiring for Capital no like you don't got don't don't don't do that like every black men become the biggest conspiracy theorist when their Heroes get attacked immedi they turn 300 was about to buy ABC did it was about to buy gde something I don't know he sent an email to the Delon or whoever the the the drink company he was working with and you know you know he he he challenged them you know and so since did that because he did that as a black man he's that's why they're going down and they're coming against him we saw what happened to Kevin Samuels Kevin Samuels was stepping into territory where he was about to purchase and start buying mics for every [ __ ] that we know that like people will really go out here and try to make it just for these terrible people who are literally causing the black causing conversations in the black community that are problematic um and they'll say they're try to make like us try to be like okay it is a black man and we shouldn't I don't give a damn if it was a black woman you wrong you wrong okay the evidence is here the evidence is here like if we can have these conversations and one thing about it I will point that I love black men I like my man to be nice and black I just love black men but black men are they don't all have they're not a monolith and just because one is a celebrity we can't automatically have an allegiance to this person right um I I don't like that that that's a requirement for us as a black woman I'm going hold my my black man down I'm going to be his peace but he got to be mine too I shouldn't have to be walking around here and and and just because Diddy is doing this and Diddy you're not Diddy like you don't even have Diddy money I'm not like you don't even have stop having this conversation with me about this first of all um secondly if I you know I I can't trust anybody any black man or woman who would sit here and tell me that R Kelly um Diddy uh Bill Cosby or anybody else of those sorts are these Heroes that we must ride with because um because they were about to buy big companies or because they're billionaires or because whatever absolutely love black men that are winning but that black man who is winning could definitely be a terrible person and uh his actions are bad we can call a thing a thing I don't care how much money he got in his pockets if he got to go to jail baby he got to go to jail okay I think I think you know there's a way to me to be always on the side of black people like the rationale is a reason why the court writes opinions right like there opinions there are concurrences there are descents there there are different grounds it would be different to me if what what black people were saying was yes Diddy has done all these things Diddy needs to be accountable we need to like have a discussion about how we what what pedestals we put people on what Behavior we call out who we discard when we first learn about exploitation how if we were having those kind of conversations and saying but I don't support the arm of the criminal State the criminal the criminal justice system coming in or something like that if they were making those kinds of arguments like there are arguments to be made but that's not what's happening like it's not black people it's never you know that we're making the analysis of okay I we really should divest from the criminal system is a problem way the criminal system jumps in to deal with us and handle all of our things whether they've been invited or not because think to me that's important like all of the people who were who were dealing with like cassing them made conscious decisions to pursue civil charges a lot of people don't even want to be involved with criminal cases that's not the route they went with that's not what what happened white federal government sees black discussions having lawsuits filed all these things happen and decides we're going to come here with the mighty arm of the criminal justice system and if they were making that argument I'd be like okay I could at least understand that like whether or not but they're not making that it's very he haha I let the system do whatever whatever whatever but gay but stop that gay [ __ ] I think what's really what's really nuts is like well I don't actually think it's nuts I am not not always rooting for black people not at all I also like am not always trying to be on the side of black people it's not happening because [ __ ] be wrong as [ __ ] like really wrong really violent like really complicit in systems right now what's happening you know in Palestine they've got black women up talking about this situation [ __ ] you Secretary of Defense black man yeah like this we I think we've really we really have to like chip away at this allegiance to black people who are doing us the worst way like it's it just has to stop and I I feel like when Issa Reay you know when she got up there and she was like I'm I'm rooting for everybody black that's what everybody says now and it makes my chest I see it hey hey and I'm G be you also say you know you gonna hold your your your black man down you going to be his you going be his but what I'm saying you know what I mean I'm not holding [ __ ] down I got to go things start getting crazy but what I'm saying be my piece too that's the thing very clear I'm I'm rooting for black people I absolutely am but when I when you know your black card gets revoked if you think that I have to be you know it gets revoked the black people that I'm rooting for you know what I consider black is you know it's different sometimes everybody don't align with Blackness okay sometime people move in whiteness so I'm ruin for everybody black and and and but that's why I see people who have these talking points you know patriarchy I believe that that's drenched in racism and and and and whiteness but a lot of black men adopt that and think that they can move on on around and women too like we have been like you were saying Olay indoctrinated into the system so when I say I'm looking for my peace baby I am but he has to be my peace too it it has to go both ways we're not just riding to get drugg and be like see all these you see all this work all these you know all these scars I got from this relationship because Kevin samels told my man that's what I need to do and I and I you know and I'm just 30 30 pounds too much and I'm 33 years old old so I'm just too damn old eggs ain't no good so I had to no no no no no my man has to respect me and I have to respect him but in this in this space I think you know there are black people like I was just saying there are black people that are no good like Diddy there are black people that are no good like AR Kelly I don't care how what I think our Kelly made great music but you're you're a terrible person and we should be able to have those conversations but they weren't born no good they became like that's the thing right I feel like we I feel like our society is really focused on criticizing and condemning the black man and forsaking the black boy as though that isn't what like that isn't where you need to be going and addressing your attention and resources and Care like the reality is and I like B Hook stop me this um we're not you know my girl we're not we're not giving black boys the tools to be able to do anything else it's like black boys are only allowed black boys are are never considered boys from the minute that they are brought into the household man at the house trying to be a man what's a man what's a black man supposed to be and that and what that means is they're not allowed like normal the array of emotions and feelings and allowed to have that like space to parse that out at all the only thing that is allowed of them is to act out is to be aggressive though that is what is considered that is what is considered masculine in those traits and then you're a boy the only way for you to express yourself that you're allowed to express yourself as a black boy or a black man also gets to criminalized gets who considered like you are disruptive lands you with a bunch of other different negative perceptions and that's the tools you're not being given the tools you're not being given the range to be a fully fleshed person to be a considerate caring partner and all these different things and then one day you wake up you're a man and everybody's like [ __ ] you bad man you're a bad man this is a bad guy but it's like what did you expect them to become I I got something to say about that because um black men black boys are not being are not being raised black boys are not being raised so it's so interesting you hear this all the time you hear parents say well I didn't have to do that much for my boy and this it it like what do you mean cu you didn't do anything you didn't teach them a lot of lessons or anything like that you just told them to go out there not cry be hard all the time uh deal with issues with violence that's what you taught them you didn't course correct you didn't do any of those things whatsoever I think a lot of young black boys are simply not being raised they're not being emotionally regulated they're not they're not doing any of these things the boys will be boys they're supposed to be that way they're supposed to act that way and then when you become an adult just like you said then you're hit with all this stuff I mean I have so many friends it's so interesting and this is really unfortunate because I think a lot of people I grew up with are still 16 years old and I'm not being funny about that and some of the things that I hear is just nuts whether somebody really close to me sitting there telling me my wife made me cheat how she do that and I'm sitting there I'm in the truck I'm in the truck arguing with them and I'm sitting here everybody is against me everybody disagrees and I'm like y'all are nuts y'all y'all are actually nuts and this is something yeah y'all would have said when we was we was in school we was in high school when we were in ninth grade saying stupid stuff and now we're 30-some years old I'm thinking about what Jan said I'm also thinking about something Delaney said because she dropped the name of Jay-Z several times and I think that all of this kind of ties in together so first of all let me just say that as a person that's older than all of you you all are giving me a lot of Hope for this discourse around Blackness masculinity and capitalism that my generation which is older Millennials to Gen X kind of adopted and accepted that the way forward the way to Freedom the way to full Independence and autonomy was through finances capitalism earning getting to the top of the financial food chain everything else be damned and what you guys are doing is echoing what we learned during the Civil Rights Movement under Malcolm X he was very clear um and I'm pulling here from a article from the Washington post that I read recently where he was just basically like these people are these black celebrities are in a different category than the black masses they are not qualified to speak on our issues that goes for Bill Cosby that goes for Jay-Z that goes for all of these people that you know they're they might not even be meaning any harm or anything like that but they cannot speak to your good or to your benefit because they are separate and apart from the daily struggles and issues that black people have to face on a daily basis and I think that if we look at like that you know that live stream that Jay-Z did or whatever he was mad at people calling him a black capitalist and everything that's just an ignorance let's really think about the fact that what black boys have to look up to in popular culture and this is not because I'm a public defender so I'm like get your money how you can get it right like that's how I feel about a lot of my clients and I understand structural poverty and things like that but let's really talk about skill sets here who black boys are supposed to look up to as the Pinnacle of black excellence and black success is somebody who started by harming his community right selling drugs to the people within his community deadly drugs that ruined and decimated entire communities and lives because it was out of necessity right that little black boy did not grow up to harm his community but he needed to make a way for himself and then what did he do he scraped and he sced and stepped on whoever he needed to step on in order to get to the Pinnacle of success that he is and he also had a talent that he knew how to Marshal to his benefit he's an extremely talented rapper does that give him the gravitas or the knowhow of how to tell black people to move forward through the through Society how many of us have the ability to rap how many of us have the ability to move weight safely and not end up in prison and then turn that money to invest and then become you know a CEO married to Beyonce making a billion dollars right and so we do have those people that are in our society that are our role models to look to and that want to be our role models but yet we keep going in the media to commentary from Jay-Z on Ken Kaepernick kneeling and him saying that we're past kneeling and things like that why are we asking Jay-Z about this what is his qualification to tell us anything about our community and so I feel like we are looking to capitalism to save us and we're looking to the Scions of capitalism to save us and let me just be totally honest here I'm trying to make money I'm trying to keep my money and I'm not trying to give it all to Uncle Sam all right so that probably makes me a capitalist it also means that I made not be the person that you want to come to for how do we better the community how do we fix these things how do we do this and how do we do that and we might need to recognize that in the people that we're looking to for all of this guidance and then maybe we won't be so torn down every single time that you know the real world comes for them so maybe we won't feel like oh no don't come after Diddy because he's our only hope don't come after Jay-Z because he's our only hope let's be really really honest here they're not qualified to be the leaders of our community and then as soon as we see that we will start putting them where they need to be which is entertainment and entertainment only I I I I I agree with that because it's all the time I I hear things where people just like oh did you hear what they said and I'm like okay I'll listen to it I'm like I don't give a [ __ ] Actually I don't even know why I just listened because I actually don't care because I ain't got nothing useful to say anyway I don't even know why you had the [ __ ] on a pedestal I I have no idea and we constantly have these conversations I'm like [ __ ] I don't care I simply don't care and we sit there and we have conversations you know have people who will sit there and you know let's say I'm just gonna throw this man's name out there Dr Umar or something like that like he'll say you know something correct out of a thousand million things that he might say and then you know a friend will be like you know like you know we need people like him and I'm like but what about all these other things right thank you oh no we can have other leaders we can have other people I'm just telling you it ain't that [ __ ] so I hate when we have conversations about that yeah C they'll be like from The Breakfast Club I'm listening to people be like oh man I mean hater if you want to what y'all like to do is y'all hate she she have the message but I just hate the messenger no this this has been online disrespect the message dropping terrible points about black people as a black person literally grifting right um and so and you guys just want just because she said this one damn little thing on The Breakfast Club and um and all what Charlemagne was just like you see we we can have these conversations and just no you didn't even challenge her there are so many things that this girl said that was wrong that you guys aren't even having this conversation about like y'all not really holding her accountable this see what I'm talking about I don't need to have do you know how many of that comments I seen from them telling me saying oh y'all just don't like her cuz she holds black people accountable and that's when I realiz like black people saying I was like you [ __ ] [ __ ] believe that Li is I actually I'm like y'all really are white supremacy's most valuable puppets like you really believe like they holding black people accountable in other words blaming black people for the structural and systemic problems that are against us it's it's in it's insane to me like hearing the [ __ ] they were say I'm like holding them accountable some anyway child I'm sorry let me just say this that is when black people say that about ourselves like oh this you know person this right-wing person is just holding black people accountable you literally sound like a slave to me that is what you sound like to me you sound like a slave like you're like like oh she's got to get us the overseer who was often black has to get us back in line so that we walk the line and we don't get in trouble anymore and the Master's not mad at us and we're respect respectable and everybody likes us and everything is okay we're not shaking the table so she needs to she needs to tell us how to behave because of her appr proximity to whiteness right like that's we all know that Candace Owens is steeped in whiteness and that just is what it is and her proximity to whiteness she is then turning around and telling the black community this is what the whites think about you and this is how you can make it so that they don't hate you and think that you're a bunch of anymore right like it's so extremely offensive whenever black people tell me that Candace Owens is just trying to hold the black community accountable cuz when does she ever hold the white Community accountable for the oppression for which they visit upon the black community it makes absolutely no sense to me not never until they don't let her get a covid test yeah oh I think a great point a great point to make I see it all the time I'm just like watch when she steps out of line when I say out of line with her own audience and see what happens she gets lit up she gets lit they only like her when they're perpetuating that [ __ ] that's the only time once she says anything we saved her we saved her right this is what this is what it is when she was doing all that talking and the white people were like her audience was like yes yes as soon as she said something that was remotely like okay y'all okay white people now I have to judge you they was like get this ER out of here get this her out of here we don't to do her and then where did she come to she started doing a tour baby on black spaces in Black places because that's where they just like Kanye West Kanye West sat here and said that slavery was a choice and then what happened he started doing a tour Back in Black spaces particularly in Black the the the black Christian the black church because he knew that's where he would be forgiven and taken in this is what happens all of these [ __ ] will be on the white side of things sharing white red online that is very disruptive that is uh that can be very damaging um but white people can say well Kanye said it well kandace said it they have these you know they they use said it yes and then when things get when St at the fan they'll come to Black back on the black side and here we are will for a pillow to help them land on sick yeah that is that is completely true um I made a video called like the confusing nature of black conservatives I had um Bellamy Jay be interviewed for that and this was like two years a year ago two years ago they said that um watch if Candace Owens does something that Bishop doesn't like she's gonna get the [ __ ] out of there it's gonna be over with she supported pal she supported Palestine and she got fired that's that's it she supported she saw the atrocities happen in Palestine like any decent human being and said something very milk toast it wasn't even like from the rivers to the Sea she just said something very like you know basic and she got fired and now she's on The Breakfast Club that you know what say a and here's the thing right every black I what I really really hate I hate when I hear black people be like oh well she's intelligent talking about any [ __ ] anybody who's like actively decided to be a [ __ ] saled ass like and they're like oh they're intelligent oh they're smart they're this I hate when we pretend that there's anything exceptional exceptional about like deciding to be the one [ __ ] prepared to speak out against the rest like that is a that is a job opportunity that is available to us all every black person that has ever been in white rooms knows that you are always provided the opportunity to decide to be the [ __ ] that's gonna speak out against uh the collective in order to benefit yourself as an individual but here's the problem with that the price you pay is too [ __ ] high okay the price for cooning is way too high because at the end of the day you are a tool you are a tool and you are only so useful to them as you par back what they say because what you're not there let let me make it clear she cace Owens or any of them are not here for us they're not here and I I don't mean just not here for us I mean they're not speaking to us they here for white people amongst themselves to say hey we have this one black person that's willing to that's saying this so they could go that's not racist this black person said that and we all know that and we know how it works it's why they have the right has their avatars they have Caitlyn Jenner's willing to speak out against trans people they have um they always have them they have their Tommy lawrens willing to be there against the women and blah blah blah they they know what it is but the problem with that is you will be gone the moment the moment you don't serve them they get rid of you and there's always a glass ceiling on which you AC you can accomplish how many Ben Carson's Herman kanes all of these have we seen come and go you know what I mean uh Stacy Dash Omar Rosa y'all do this song and dance and the next thing you know you're out on your [ __ ] ass begging for some form of community that you've done nothing but condem and here's the [ __ ] problem we keep inviting them back into the fold and it's upset It's upsetting to me because the reason is we are not condemning structures and systemic issues it's like we don't recognize it's easy for them to re-embrace a canis Owens because everything else out of her mouth is bigotry against other groups of bigotry that we are fine with because we have not recognized how the accepted how that bigotry is directly combined like right intertwined works with white supremacy against us that is really what the ultimate issue is there you mentioned someone mentioned Kanye West a little bit ago and that glass ceiling is actually what I think kicked Kanye's ass yes is because he managed to make a billion dollars and he thought he thought that because he had that much money because that is what had been told to him and everybody else that he could do what the hell he wanted to do and they said hey one second you are still a negro yes sit the [ __ ] down that's what happened and I feel like he was so close he was so so close to to having an actual analysis about this about I would say the means of production not having access to the actual materials to make the things that he wanted to make um he almost had an analysis around uh like the 1% and then he got real anti-semitic I was just about to say which is a lot of what is by the way fueling Candace Owen stuff like like cand like that is a lot of what's Happening Here it's not that she like this is is is too fair to her it's actly she's seeing what happened in Gaza and that's why she's on the right side of things she's on the right side of things because she's been an anti-semitic person like she's been spewing anti-Semitism so that was always her like the line she was [ __ ] treading right and you got like this is the wrong time for been in them you know what I mean she she tried and that's and that's the thing and you know what it's really harmful and I had said this too Charlamagne my son like is incredibly harmful because in from his perspective he was like oh we had her talking about the things like she's making this being pro Palestine or whatever have you I'm like that's [ __ ] worse to take this white supremacist woman whose whole job what she does what she's made a career of intentionally knowingly she's not stupid or or or unaware or understanding the implications this is a white supremacist [ __ ] puppet who at least black people know and recognize as a white supremacist puppet and know to disregard her and discount her but if you bring her up to talk about the few things that you think we will like what you do is legitimize her and present her as something else to these people are not familiar with all of what she's saying and what have you and they think oh okay I can listen to her oh she makes sense and some things and now they decide they're going to listen to her give more Credence more deference and pay attention and that's way more [ __ ] harmful like it's actually harmful for you to bring off there and have her talking about what you think won't upset people rather than have her be the white supremacist she always is and I think we have to be clear like Candace Owens is not pro Palestine yeah Candice Owens is not hoping for the freedom of and liberation of Palestinian people Candace Owens is an anti-semite she does not want to make a distinction between Zionism and Judaism it's not happening because she is a white supremacist like I just we we've just got to be super super clear about that so when people bring her on whoever it is charlam May who they've got to have that in mind because between Candace Owens Kanye West and other people these long long tropes around Jewish folks and money it it's getting real close like black people it I mean you know and black people have an interesting relationship I believe with Jewish people like there's a long history in the civil rights movement and then there's also a really sad history in New York around property management and exploitation against immigrants and black people in New York there's a lot of complication there but I think that there we're towing a line around anti-Semitism that people like Candace Owens and Kanye West are pushing us further to the side that we don't want to be on as a people as a community yeah because a lot of people don't realize like what what I've realized is black people you know Chris Rock has a joke about this that black people he's like black people don't um we don't we don't got time to make distinctions of between white people white is white like he's like if you Romanian you Romanian cracker like that's what he said like they're all white and for us I think that is what it is so it's like it's hard to for us to see if we see Jew a lot of black people see Jewish people as white people they are white people that they see they they are often interacting with them where they are in positions of power over them you know so it's like I see white people I see white people that are more powerful than me I'm experiencing Dynamics where I am being oppressed they don't see how being against Jewish people or being anti-semitic or spreading these Jewish tropes could ever be a tenant of white supremacy because they see these as white people and so because those are completely divorced in their mind they don't get it so it's easy to unwittingly like unwittingly lean into anti-Semitism especially if Kanye and people you have deferred to and been calling a genius for 10 plus years are the ones feeding it to you yeah and they could they could take a black billionaire down what could they do to you like that's the type of [ __ ] that say true I I got one quick thing to say we're kind of getting close to this is like I was watching a Tik Tok today and it pissed me all the way off and I immediately turned it off because it was one of those type of Tik toks where you have black people saying egregious things like egregious and I'm looking in the comments in the first thing I see is nothing but white people is just like yes personal responsibility and all these I'm like that's how you know you [ __ ] up I want each and every one of those black people who made that video and said that [ __ ] go look at the damn comments and see who cheering this [ __ ] on the most tell you every time and they don't care because we have like we again we have because it's always been think about it when you think about it we've always had a willingness because we recognize how hard it is and what what black people have to do what you have to do to become a we've always had a willingness to accept the idea that you have to harm like even other black people in order to get ahead right because that's kind of what America teaches you if you're an American whether you're black or not you're an American America teaches you pull yourself up at a bootstraps do what you have to do get over whatever dog eat dog world and that's always been led a success so if we if as a community if as a culture it's okay for us to know like think about how much we talk about the crack epidemic and and and what that's done and how that decimated the community and also in the same breath we celebrate figures that we know anticipated with no like regard to that because we under we understand or we're fine with recognizing how that happened so of course on a lesser scale they're going to be black people willing a [ __ ] online like they don't who aren't even seeing to them like they're not seeing the the real world effects of the rhetoric and and what they're putting out they're not realizing they're not taking the time to consider how that's affecting like laws and policy and when and social Consciousness they're like o engagement money you know in order that's why so many people that's why not only are so so many people willing to grift but that there willing to gr and play sight with the knowledge that they're going to do a pivot and say sorry whatever I did all this harm and it will be fine because we're cool with that I just think also that the the capitalism the way that capitalism functions you do have to hurt people so yeah we are taught that like you it don't matter what you got to do you got to go get it and that under capitalism that's not the wrong teaching anyone who is making a billion dollars people that are people that are disgustingly wealthy are hurting somebody somewhere whether that be in sweat shops that you never see whether that be in in sweat shops domestically like you that is happening and so I think like a a a conversation around systems and systems change is is where we should be heading when we're talking about causing pain in our communities and and why we've got to do what we've got to do I think we're like this close like not close with the money with the money part of it though like if I were to right now say okay start changing um how I speak online what I stand for which is going to be black um you know black success black forward movement holding black people accountable um if I were to do like C because Candace Owens she started off on the left she started off being pro black she started off that way so a lot of people don't really know about that about her but she grifted because the coin was there so as you begin to grift the coin is there and but there can only be room for one one person like that right like one like so they want they don't want 10 of it they don't want 10 of them but they want they need that one black talking head and that's the and she can be the one our favorite activist right um Sean King I like to say because I can but I like to say even with him that man says steals does in my opinion because this is mine and mine only because I know he like to come after people but I what I you know what I say is like him as a as a a representation for black people do you know in his comment section and even even if it's to me stolen content um that he takes credit for under his comment section is's A whole bunch of white soccer moms saying this is why we love him this is why we need him constantly he they will give this man money to be the black represent representative for their white guilt um you know I watch Sean King and and and but that money is supposed to go towards building this building that building that and he never produces it but they still trust this man as the the their black representation to say you know Sean said it then it's 100% true so we gotta be careful on both sides of it because I feel like we have that he to me um functions in in whiteness as well not only his what he look like but he functions in whiteness and and and it's questionable but like we have that on both sides so I see that with Candice Owens but I also think that we have that in in this space where people are wolves and sheep clothing however they say that like that like needs to be the the first thing people talk about when they talk about Candace she's a grifter that needs to be the first thing if I like I mean we can talk about how yes she's watch prises yes yes she does she does all these things but it's in the context of her being a [ __ ] grifter right like she's only she's only saying these things and doing these things because she's grifting she was not like yeah it's so egregious the most egregious [ __ ] that happens to me all the time that makes me see red is when a random white person or non-black person props up and randomly tells me a black person that I need to listen to Oh They'll be like have you heard of uh Thomas uh sawell um have you ever heard of Candace Owens she's really smart her you don't need to tell me that they be in the comments on o and friends telling me which [ __ ] I should have on my show like they're like you should have I hate all of you you should have this black person I like on here and I'm like and I won't and just because you mentioned them now they're on a list now they on the [ __ ] list AB now I know you know I'm thinking of the thread between Kanye and Candace Owens that you guys brought up just before my dog started freaking out and the that thread of anti-Semitism amongst these um media personalities and celebrities and uh people in the upper Edge Shalon that are black is very common because it's this whole mentality of that somehow Jewish people are the ones that are holding all the purse strings and the ones that are stamping down the black people and outside of the complexities because I'm a girl from New York I'm from Queens right outside of the complexities of the real estate market in New York which is a very real issue for the most people most black people will never interact with a Jewish person in this country this very Jewish people live in certain enclaves that most black people just don't live in and don't really know any Jewish people yet they have all of these comments and Candace Owens and Kanye West are just two of the worst examples of them but I hate to like you know kick somebody that doesn't really have anything to do with anything but Jay-Z just comes up again many of his lyrics are supremely anti-semitic under the guise of oh I'm giving them their props but it's just like oh we're going to make money like the Jews we're gonna control everything like the Jews and it's this I don't know it's this theme that is a little disturbing because it's almost like a divide and conquer mindset because the systemic structural white supremacy that was put in place was not put in place by Jewish people it was put in place by your white Anglo-Saxon Protestants and so it's very interesting that they have become the scapegoat right and the other go yeah no and the other into play is of course Christianity which makes it very difficult because there's almost like this hierarchy where now you have a fraction within or a Schism within the black community between those that support you know Palestine those that support Israel um where so if you're more you know traditionally Christian you're supposed to support Israel so you have a lot of like black commentators with that and then also if you go into black churches some of the commentary around and this is someone who grew up in a black church some of the commentary around Jewish people is extremely anti-semitic and would not be you know for the general public to even hear and so I think there is this again divide and conquer mindset that we have to be very very much aware of because Jewish people do deal with some structural suppression in the country that is not coming from Black black people however we've kind of turned on each other as this like we're all fighting to get to the top of capitalism and so I like the Jewish people are keeping me from getting on top not the people that put the structure in place I I I think it's hard for black people to see that sometimes because black people are always on the worst end of things so like in the sense of like insult stereotypes or generalizations or perceptions or how people discuss us for black people like like the reason Jay-Z can say a bunch of things that are actually anti-semitic tropes but I'm sure in his mind he believes that they're compliments and so do the other black people that receive it or even like is because they like or even like I think of cardi B's lyrics when she be like you know my lawyer is a Jew he gonna chew up all the charges like because how a lot of those stereotypes function in real life it's the way like black people can see how like why when Asian people have a problem with the stereotype of like the um the perfect the the super the model the model minority that that myth because it's like all our stereotypes are criminal dumb Angry bab M everything about us are so op so [ __ ] disparaging that it's hard to really sympathize with oh your stereotype is you make you make a lot of money you're good lawyers like you're good at math and stuff like that right like I think of how many times like I've seen black people like as a PD like people like other black people receive you as their public defender and they are skeptic don't have any faith in your abilities as an attorney because they believe like think about it cardi B even saying that that is a more representative of your average New Yorker that will have interactions with the criminal system and the way it's perceived like having a Jew is going to is a better lawyer is automatically you know because of that perception and because they're having these experiences so I think that that makes it hard for them to realize like oh it is an anti-semitic Trope to believe Jewish people that is a white supremacist a white supremacist narrative that Jewish people secretly run the world and blah blah blah and it's used to justify [ __ ] like the Holocaust and and people having these like discriminatory beliefs against Jews it's hard it's hard to see that when you are feeling like as black people we would we would pay for a nice a nice stereo a nice sounding stereotype when you're not paying attention you know what I mean when you don't realize because black stereotypes not only are black stereotypes just as harmful in application and stuff like that but they're like on its face like you don't have to even make the nuanced argument and step back and be like let me show you how this will work and like how this works for everybody else it's like on its face it's like you know why you don't want to be considered a criminal or dumb or blah blah blah versus yeah I think that'd be happening well you know the only positive stereotypes about us come from physicality and that leads to violence against us right and so a lot of the times when I interact with white people or nonblack people of color whatever the term is these days I don't know but whenever I in interact with non-black people and they think that they're paying me a compliment by oh you're so strong you're so fast um or something sexual in nature right because they they love to find us attractive and dehumanize us at the same time it's a it's hard to explain to people that like I know that you think you're paying me a compliment on my you know sexual virility or my physical prowess or whatever it is that I look like to you but this has been a tool of Oppression of my people so I'd like for you to interact with me as a real person and I think if we turn around and look at Jewish and Asian people the same way and say like um you know saying that the paranoia that was created around Jewish people saying that they were running everything and the rosch child conspiracy and all that type of stuff LED literally to people trying to exterminate them because they were so afraid of them being in control of everything then we would be more mindful of that and then also remember that we are not we're afraid of them controlling but we think that it's a default for white people to control and we want to reach their level we do not want to usurp them so you know I think we should always think about that in terms of like our community self-esteem I think that's a beautiful final word I think I think that's a good final word us off on Natalie I I I appreciate this thank y' all so much for coming and doing oay and Friends abely [Music] [Music]
