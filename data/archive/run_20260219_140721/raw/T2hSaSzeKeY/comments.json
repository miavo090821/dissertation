He's gaining/winning while the woman is losing/ being devalued. \n\nYour partner being with other women doesn't devalue herself while also making you look more valuable. While her getting with other dudes devalues her and makes you a cuck/ weak man. At least that's how I think they rationalize it. Shits weird 😅",

Now the person who really needs to tread lightly is the king of the creep show Stevie J baby we seen you mistreat countless women on TV and we have not forgotten about how your predatory behavior violated a black woman journalist. Aren't you the same dude who was getting fellatio from somebody, while that woman was interviewing you? You need to be focused on gathering up that paperwork because they gone be coming after you next especially if you was participating in the foolishness with Diddy.",

But they don't even get their own safety guaranteed for more than a limited time, and we see it happening so often. \nThe price of becoming the token really is too high, you lose your soul immediately and eventually they'll take your life just the same as the rest of ours.",

And I often feel like it is, on the internet. You don't have to repeatedly tell us that black billionaires are bad. We get it.\n\nAs an anticapitalist it just starts coming off kinda weird that you...\n\n1. Think we're unaware that black capitalism is still capitalism or...\n\n2. Think black capitalism is worse.\n\nBoth options are kinda racist and I'm certainly sure many content creators don't mean it that way. But it starts to come off that way. Similar to how class reductionists come off as racist or deeply out of touch, without trying to.\n\nWe gotta move forward from denouncing Jay and Beyonce for their gains. And we gotta start being careful about labeling audiences and usernames as black, without proof.",

With the lil rod case I feel like people are more so making a joke of it. I feel like it’s more discussed because of homophobia. I think the feds acted on the lil rod case because of the drugs and guns and the shooting allegedly diddy and his son did but I almost feel like the feds have been watching him for years but being a bad business man isn’t illegal. With the Will stuff I thought it was known they were in a open relationship because they were both publicly dating others remember they linked Jada to Marc Anthony so it wasn’t a one sided act where only Will had side pieces. Young black Men need to stop looking at what rich men do and be taught that there are other ways to lead a family but unfortunately some women like was said have adopted the white picket fence life that was sold to us on old family shows that’s why black men get mad and are confused because they aren’t happy with themselves and a lot of their women aren’t satisfied with them either.",
