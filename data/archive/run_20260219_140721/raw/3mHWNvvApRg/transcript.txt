morgan the reactionary i don't know who that is i hope someone invites me to do a live today i want to hop on a live with someone else let's see which of my friends are on right now let's see if i can ask anyone oh how do i even do that can communism and religion coexist this is my biggest issue with the ideology yet um there's a lot of religious communist um liberation theology got really really popular in latin america um in the late uh last century the 1900s um and the the so much so that the us and the cia and dictator hugo bonzer and bolivia launched a campaign called be a patriot kill a priest where they launched a campaign to kill any left-wing priests and prop up any right-wing priests um and churches have long been like a meeting place of resistance of left-wing resistance throughout u.s history if you look at the civil rights movement and then um i was re i was reading yesterday um some of you know i'm reading this book about slavery and its development in the us um and essentially same thing happened as left-wing preachers started propping up during slavery talking about abolition you know jesus wouldn't clearly what's in the bible is not in support of slavery if they launch you know campaigns of lynching against these left-wing preachers um so yeah it's just you know religion is what it is it's it's its own thing and then it can be co-opted to argue for socialism or it can be co-opted to argue for capitalism obviously you know as someone who's grown up around faith my whole life and around religious people my whole life like jesus was 100 percent of socialist like the they have to distort the actual teachings of the bible to make the bible represent capitalism you think cross straits you reunification is possible in the next 10 years or so i don't know enough about that to make an educated um conclusion i apologize what is your job i work at a nursing home favorite band red hot chili peppers jesus wasn't a socialist yeah he was yes he was it listen to anything jesus was talking about he was trying to give everyone free health care he was beating up tax collectors he saw people selling things setting up markets in the church and that's like the only time that you see jesus uh like show rage he goes into the church and he starts whipping while the capitalists look it up there's pictures of it um people have made artwork about it um he right uh all about healing the sick anti-tax tax collector um what are the other parts i don't know there's more ways you can argue that jesus was a socialist but it definitely was all about peace and love oh marcus there we go yo eddie what's up marcus how's it going what up it's good good just uh just chilling nice not much actually yeah i'm off tomorrow so i'm not really doing anything here i go live what about you sweet yeah i don't have to work tomorrow because of memorial day so i'm like oh i'll hop on the live i guess yeah we talking communism it's a pretty nifty ideology you should check it out yeah i've been thinking about it i think i might be a communist someone said on my live yesterday that you were a dangerous is this true a dangerous well yeah i'm of the opinion that's that that's not a real word i actually have dangerous blocked on my twitter so okay so i figured that's fair we have a good my buddy from peru sebastian he's a peruvian marxist he has a pretty good piece about dang on our website specifically um what did dang do exactly because i'm i'm still reading now so i'm into maoism right now but i've heard maui speak very negatively of dengues what's the whole thing there well dang opened up the country to market reforms um so he allowed like private investment with the idea of if we keep dictatorship of the proletariat and if we keep a strong state control of like banking and industry and we keep setting up these central plans we can control the market forces in order to raise our productive forces within the context of global capitalism keep the us off our backs and then uh look to build socialism well their first goal was to raise people out of poverty by 2025 and they've hit that and the next goal is socialism by 2050. um so the critique from maois is that once you reinstate market forces and you allow private investment you've just you know uh like you have capitalism and their critique is that the workers aren't in control of the state anymore and that china has restored capitalism that just sounds like xi and and dang kind of introduced neoliberalism to china well that's what they thought it was like david harvey wrote that book neoliberalism and like dang is on the cover and like that's what they thought at first but even david harvey has said i was wrong about that like um that's what it looked like at first and even that's what perenti thought it was at first but now it's looking like like there's been massive anti-corruption efforts under xi and they moved they've reintroduced a lot of maoist ideas and they moved more towards that that goal of moving to socialism um so it's less neoliberal than people originally thought um and now yeah yeah i support it yeah i mean i have my own personal contentions with china they're pumping a lot of uh foreign capital into africa and stuff like that i think they're a tad neo-colonialist but i like i like their idea of moving to socialism by 2050 or whatever xi jinping said yeah have you you should look at uh well we did a podcast with bay area ml where we touched on it but look up vijay prashad on chinese imperialism in africa and then look up giannis verofocus and then there's one from this place called the paulson institute where it's like an actual thinker from africa talking about it um because china's got very specific rules for like how they're non-intervention interventionist it's actually why they trade with israel because they they make no the basically have open trade um and janus vera falcao says china's non-interventionist in a way the u.s can't even imagine and he's basically basically a social democrat he's not even a marxist so it's interesting to hear him talk about it but yeah complex issue there for sure the belt and road initiative yeah i do know bj prashad i actually want to read his uh washington bullets that came out uh i remember you were talking about it a while ago when you were reading it boom yeah yeah exactly there you go yeah i gotta read that guy it looks really good you should yeah you should i i just got red star over the third world by him too that just came in the middle of that one i'm like going through his like books right now what is that that was about the inspiration that the october revolution in in russia sparked in the third world um and then the kind of protective role that the soviet union played over like revolutions like the the us only like only started bombing and did the gulf war in iraq in 1990 because the soviet union dissolved so they were no longer blocked in the u.n from doing that and like it's kind of about all the countries that the u.s kind of i mean the the soviet proletariat helped yeah i agree i mean uh that was with the uh the warsaw pact and everything right with iraq well just like with with generally like all the countries involved in the warsaw pact and like the countries they helped protect like vietnam and korea even libya a little bit yeah and syria too yeah it was the um the security council when the u.n was first formed was the us france the uk and washington bullets talks about this a lot but the ussr in china and then like the first 59 vetoes at the un were from the ussr just stopping the us and france and the uk from like invading countries in the global south yeah that makes sense so yeah i gotta look into vijay prashad now it looks like i gotta i know what i think it's his daughter on tick-tock who's like mutual's with you yeah yeah so i i want her her uh page but i do i definitely have to check out uh his books um because i mean i've heard nothing but positive things from vj uh i have like a bunch of questions like i know you get like a bunch of questions like all the time but like i just like forget them when i'm on live slowly coming back to me but um what are we talking about what were we talking about before i got on live um what was i not much uh simon says i have to dang pill you you have to dang pill oh god no you can't do that i'm like reading now right now that's possible it's impossible well i mean people have made the distinction between mao with cause like maoists are so like they kind of act like ultras a lot so people made the distinction now between maoism and mao zedong thought like if you like mao you're mao zedong thought but if you're like this hyper extreme maoist who hates modern china then you're like a maoist it's kind of weird yeah i i kind of i see it that way as i mean mostly on the internet i don't know how it is with like now as thinkers or uh people in academia yeah even like teachers like what is parenting considered parenti i mean yeah i'm just i'm just naming like leftist people in academia it's it's hard because you don't even have like like the furthest left thinker who's not been blackballed you know like parenting kind of got shunned from academia it's been like chomsky and he's an anarchist you know it's not we don't really have that many diverse strands of marxist thought in the u.s other than like teenagers on tick-tock which is sad but hopefully that changes yeah i mean in the u.s yeah but like we get like we have like zizek and people like across this like overseas that's like that that are more accepted and left in spaces um but yeah mostly it's just anarchists like i'm not even sure chomsky is like a fallen anarchist because he said some some lib stuff in the past definitely yeah but um but yeah what was i gonna say do you think that the uh or you know what now before i get on like another serious topic are you gonna wrestle benjamin politics i wanna box i wanna box benjamin politics i invited him but he won't box me so i want to see someone fight him but i don't know if if it'll be you or me i'm down for anyone i think we should just set up like a whole card like set up a handful make it happen that'd be amazing there you go we we'd make i don't know if we make the money off of that but it will be not but be you me jp and like we have to get some maybe your boy that'll matt fight me and matt are gonna wrestle when i hit a certain amount of subscriber when he gets 10 000. okay all right if you have his own youtube or do you guys both post on midwestern marks yeah he's been a contributor midwestern marks forever um or i mean you know just because we're buddies but uh yeah he he only has his own tick tock right now yeah okay so we'll we can do we can do like a whole card we'll get benjamin politics we'll fight him and we'll find a bunch of other people [ __ ] yeah oh i don't know if i'm allowed to swear on here no a lot of people have gotten banned but i haven't gotten banned from swearing nice are you still cool with owen owen uh jpg or whatever his that is yeah i feel like i'm the only leftist who's like cool with him anymore i don't know no yeah he when he goes live like from time to time he'll go live and say hi but yeah i think most of most of leftist tick tock is kind of just shunned him he's just sad because he was i mean he was a good creator but i was like yeah he was he was hilarious i mean he did say some stuff in the past but like you know i think he he um kind of learned from it yo marxist humanism is in here the communism wrath oh yeah um marxist humanism because they're they can't get on my life because i unfortunately blocked them i'm sorry for blocking you but i just could not listen to any more of those raps they kept popping up on my for you page i'm like this is bad for my mental health i can't do this i can't do this it was bad that's so funny the ecp one killed me that one was funny i'll i'll i'll admit that one someone's saying chomsky is a syndicalist what's the difference between syndicalism and anarchism i mean syndicalism is just supposedly a sect of anarchism right like yeah but if you look any revolution in history has been partially syndicalist it's just organizing through the trade unions like that's what is that that's what bolivia did that's what pretty much every country has ever had a successful revolution has done is that all it is i i thought it was just organizing through unions but i didn't want to like reduce it to just that i get yeah maybe i'm simplifying it but that's what i yeah i don't my understanding i don't know any cynicalist theory so anybody who does please drop it in my comments i read one syndicalist piece about the original development of capitalism when i didn't know that's like just what capital was about uh and it was good would you read you cut out for a second oh sorry i was just saying that read some anarcho-cynicalist theory like it makes sense but yeah i mean whatever an anarchist tells me to like read anarchist theory i kind of just say that i prefer to win revolutions so which is why i call myself martha feminist i prefer to win revolution so i'm not gonna you know no anarchist theory is still very you know helpful but yeah i don't know i think i think they're kind of idealist especially in the way that like bosch is or like skeptical lefty is where like every leftist project they have to just hate on yeah and it's like theoretically it's kind of like and no offense to anarchists like again i think they're comrades and i think some of their theory is good like the stuff about mutual aid but it's kind of for children like eventually you have to grow up and realize that you're going to need state power and this is why like this is why i think every american should listen to pan-africanist thinkers because part of pan-africanism is you have a state to defend africa right nobody can ever get into the need for a state like like people in the global south because they've actually fought imperialism people in the us don't really understand that which is why most of them are marxist leninists and which is why pan-africanism is considered a sect of marxism leninism i mean like you know when you're talking when they're talking about tankies they're talking about the hugo chavez's of the world and like the the thomas sankaras exactly and it's like well like you expect sankara to to build socialism and burkina faso without a state he had a state and and they still killed him like what did you know how are you supposed to defend the revolution yeah exactly i mean without like the state power like vietnam probably wouldn't have been able to defend itself cuba the dprk they would have been able to nicola they could yeah exactly like places like these wouldn't be able to fight against the west the way that they did that they did uh-huh this person says tanky gang where you at yeah it's like tankies but it's that idea of like siege socialism that perennial like that's the best way to think of it yeah we would love a decentralized revolution where all the factories go to the workers on day one and we abolish the commodity form it doesn't work like that though you go you have a revolution and all the forces of capital descend on you to try and kill you and like you're going to need a way to prevent that and that's all that you know socialist experiments in the past have done their socialist experiments that you know like paul potts could be ruge that weren't actually socialists that we condemn but you know it's good to have critical support for people who are trying to actually build socialism in the face of horrible imperialism like sankara do you think or not you think that like that marxism monetism has to be applied to the us as well because like with the us like because because even like mao famously wrote that like the state can't be done away with until the imperialist west has done away with so i feel like if the u.s moves toward an anarchist sense of the word of socialism then i don't know if we'd have to see state power again i would prefer to go the marxist leninism route because it's most pragmatic but do you think that we have to in the u.s yeah i think you still do especially because of the the role that the us state serves and that like what the us military does like in order to have any kind of revolution you're gonna need to target that state apparatus and and take a hold of it in order to you know pull back the us military and and do all this yeah no you're not getting [ __ ] uh yeah yeah so i think so i get what people are saying like i get i do get what people are saying like once the us goes socialist it's theoretically could be like a domino effect right because you don't have this boot holding down the proletarian revolutions of the rest of the world that is the us military but i do definitely still think that we need to seize the state i mean i don't how do you seize power without seizing the state like how are we gonna like our workers are gonna come up and see like you know just take hold of their boss one day like no way yeah like i said it's idealist i would like it to happen but that's probably not how it's going to work what do you think are you are you like even in the us well the fact that you brought up like the cia in the military you're probably right like we have to seize control of the us state because the u.s state as we've seen historically is like the most violent towards worker revolutions like we've seen them put down unions and stuff like that so you're probably right about the us having to seize state power but uh so yeah i'd say i'm saying i'm ml in the us as well yeah people you know people just think violence when they think of lenin they're like oh lenin was big on violent revolution like he doesn't really talk about that he's big on the state but look what happened in bolivia like as soon as they gained state power the u.s started funding fascist gangs who were killing union leaders um you need to use the state for self-defense even though they didn't take power violently quote unquote and it was the same in russia the actual revolution didn't kill that many people it was the civil war that followed the revolution the counter-revolution of the bourgeoisie where they needed the state to defend themselves where everyone died um yeah that's then that's very true i mean i think people attribute the word revolution in in a sense whereas i think in a in a modern context like i'm going back to mao mao like said uh democratic revolution is part of like the revolution entirely so i think that you know especially in the us it can be it can be done about peacefully right yeah yeah i agree i mean and marx held that opinion too simon says didn't lenin say the bourgeois state needs to be dismantled and replaced not seen yeah and i mean i was talking about bolivia earlier that's like my main critique of them like there are sex in the military that are super reactionary and i know people are scared of like purges um but like bolivia needs to do something about dismantling the reactionary sex of their military and they're gonna get accused of being authoritarian but like they need to do that before the right-wing sex you know work together with the cia to do another coup yeah i mean even the cia admitted in leaked documents that like when stalin did the purges it wasn't that dictatorial or authoritarian they were largely seen as necessary throughout the entire world yeah people i mean people got so mad at me for making a video about the purges but it's like someone asked me about the purges i wasn't just trying to bring him up to be like a big stop no yeah yeah someone asked me like oh well the us lied about them you know like they weren't great but but a lot of them needed that yeah i remember i remember benjamin politics tried making a video on it and it just he just did horrible i mean libertarians can't really argue uh empiricism very well so he he sounded like an idiot when he tried it but but yeah i don't um but yeah i mean even the cia i mean i'm not a huge like stalinist i don't even know what stalinism is but it's not a lot of stuff you do yeah would you agree that like post stalin ussr wasn't really moving toward socialism because a lot of a lot of people will say that it was revisionist uh after 1954 i think yeah yeah khrushchev was bad i mean like part of the ceno soviet split like part of the fault lies on china but most of it lies with the ussr like and you know it's super complex right like a lot of people would call khrushchev socially imperialist which like you could debate that when you look at the soviets role in afghan afghanistan compared to the us yeah i would i would call that i would call that imperialist in afghanistan yeah right they were probably you know going places they didn't need to be and stuff which that but that's not the biggest critique um there are other critiques like especially with how they were planning the economy but yeah i mean khrushchev's secret speech was bad not a big fan of him and then obviously that sowed the seeds for gorby and yeltsin who were atrocious yeah i mean i don't i know gorby of course because he was like the one that brought it all down but i'm not really i'm not really con uh familiar with anyone that took power after khrushchev yeah i think it was just well i i don't know why yeltsin and gorbachev one of them was they had different positions at the same time but they were the ones who followed khrushchev um yeah i don't know i'm not a big khrushchev guy at all uh yeah i don't know if anyone is um right someone trying to argue with you the other day that stalin was behind the creation of israel yes that was a liberal and that's like an actively perpetrated lie by like you know that's like one of those where the cia like has in their documents like let's convince everyone the ussr created israel and then i hear him like repeat it on tick tock i'm like come on what how did that was born by the u.n right that was a collective effort to like how did israel form and who was like responsible for that yeah it was these right so if you watch gods of fights for freedom it's pretty good or you could read um probably that one's from abby martin so it's good for people who speak english but obviously like the best thing to do is go to palestinian academics but the the area was under british mandate and the british were losing which was you know essentially another colony um yeah and that yeah and there were palestinians and jews living on the land um and then the the west the british because they're the british start funding like the most right-wing zionist sects of uh jewish people who start committing massacres eventually commit the knockback where they push like 70 of palestinians off their land that's where 70 of palestinians became refugees as you said the u.n security council like we were talking about earlier which is made up of the ussr china france uk and us draws up this voting plan pushing palestinians off their land and that's what they call the catastrophe and that was mostly funded by the british the cia was backing it but truman didn't want to until he faced extreme pressure from zionists in the us who are like no you need to support the state of israel and the ussr was in the u.n like we said at that time they were staunchly anti-zionist people accused stalin of being anti-semitic sometimes but then he they eventually you know were like okay we'll you know try and do the best we can and they uh ended up voting in favor of the creation of the state of israel and then later on is when the us would replace the british as the main funders of israel um as as they would expand and the u.n would continuously redraw the borders shrinking you know the amount of land given to palestinians every time so they they exp expelled palestinians prior to the creation of israel yeah that's what the nakba is what what how do you spell that i'm going to look that up n-a-k-b-a yeah don't i mean i can explain it but you should just look it up yeah i'll look it up later but uh but essentially it was just to make way for the creation of israel yes yeah push push palestinian people off their land create these settlements and then they drew israel's borders at the u.n and and approved it yeah i mean that's why that's why a lot of people don't trust i mean that's why i personally don't trust the uh the two-state solution because you know that would be like we talked about before in the group chat like you know it would just it uh the un would draw the the borders the us would influence it it just wouldn't be fair for palestinians right i mean look at the two-state solution they did in korea where they've been you know had troops on the border ever since and have kept the dprk in a constant state of warfare like that's what would happen to palestine the us would continue to shrink and shrink their borders meg like i mean trump drew up borders for the two-state solution and it was palestine lost like half their land like do you really actually want to see trump draw the borders to uh to the two-state solution you should look it up it's uh he had his own map it was just like we're gonna take half the palestinians land away and like everyone should agree to this and everyone's going to be fine with this right oh yeah i'm finding it uh the trump peace plan it looks horrible trump peace claim yeah said would you consider it would you so how do you feel about like the statement like when people say israel has no right to exist yeah uh yeah they i mean i don't i mean i don't know how to feel about that statement i'm just asking you the jewish people have a right to live there for sure but under like yeah not under an apartheid state like like you know they were formed in 1948 heavily funded by the west exclusively on the premise of like pushing palace right like the nakba israel's founding they were founded on pushing 70 percent of palestinian people into being refugees like they deserve a place to be you know in a place to be protected but they don't deserve an apartheid state you know they deserve a one-state solution is what you know yeah so it would be called it would not be called israel no it should be called palestine israel doesn't actually have a right to the land they yeah took it via colonization funded by the west yeah yeah which makes sense yeah i mean there's talks of like netanyahu uh being ousted soon but i don't i don't know if that's gonna work if since he's backed by the west well yeah and the zionists don't like netanyahu anyways so like they'll get another zionist in yeah netanyahu's like right-wing on like labor policy for uh like israelis like even israeli workers are struggling because it's still capitalism you know um so like there's been a lot of critique you know labor labor zionism is a thing like continue massacring palestinians but give israeli workers better wages you know yeah so that that's kind of a double-edged sword like you don't know how to feel about that i mean like yes give workers better wages but no don't massacre palestinians right i feel like netanyahu kind of uh co-opted the uh zionist movement for his neocolonialism i mean i think i said that before of course but i mean i i don't know why zionists wouldn't like him i feel like he's kind of been carrying out that the reactionary motives of zionism yeah i was shocked but like i said you know it's complex like so i when i first started talking about israel palestine it like it was one of my first videos that blew up and the zionists were like going insane um yeah i zoom chatted with a bunch of members of the idf you know and people who live in the west bank and whatnot and they're like one they were saying some insane stuff about palestinians like where i was like oh my goodness this is straight up like racism and apartheid like i don't want to be talking to these people but then second of all they uh you know it's complex like they're living there so it's like yeah i don't like netanyahu because he got rid you know he did whatever whatever thing that wasn't good for labor you know everyone has their own personal reasons they're like i want a different zionist president who gives more more workers rights to to jewish people i don't know um there's always internal politics yeah i mean you can see like hassan like does these streams where he'll like he'll watch like interviews of idf soldiers or of like israeli pop politicians and um it'll just he'll just show how like how borderline fascistic that the government is yeah and it's you know it's kind of disturbing to be fair it's the best example of like an ethno state anywhere in the world like and you know what it you know it's usually like even when you look at the us like the most imperialist nation when you talk to the people on the ground like the workers i get well i don't know a lot of workers in the us are like white supremacists but like if you talk to people like you and me i don't know if you talk to the majority of the workers they're not going to support imperialism and stuff right but no israel has indoctrinated their citizens to hate palestinians to a point where they're like if you look at abby martin's interviews with them you were giving examples or like i was zoom chatting with these people i'm like oh my god like how can you say this stuff this is so clearly racist a lot of propaganda and it it can be resembled to the u.s how like the u.s and the state kind of indoctrinates people into hating people that they're imperializing like you remember like you know during iraq or during libya where they kind of just spread this propaganda about the people and it kind of justify to the worker to the workers or the people receiving this information that the invasion was justified yeah so i get idf people reminding me of like talking to talking to americans about iraq where it's like they have no you know they're just like oh we gotta be over there they're bad like what yeah you don't even know what's going on in iraq exactly and you can't really like blame them like you kind of have to blame the us uh right propaganda machine you know so you know it's it's a it's it's tough to see like when people are defending the fascistic motives of israel and the and and the apartheid but it is yeah what someone's asking is kosovo in serbia i don't know kosovo yeah kosovo yeah i don't know how to say that is that the i don't i don't even know that is that the no i'm thinking of rojava kosovo is oh i'm drawing a blank this is so bad i can't think of it now i look it up is it like a political issue or are they just asking like yeah isn't it it's said i mean it says like it's part it's a recognized estate in southeastern europe so it's its own thing huh yeah i guess i don't know anything about it technically independent um i guess it's time to be as of now it's technically independent oh i don't know anything about kosovo i was totally thinking of rojava oh okay i was thinking of the kurds but yeah that's a separate the whole separate thing right it's not even close yeah no yeah i mean i don't know i mean maybe i don't know if they're asking it for political reasons like maybe there's a there's a thing going on there i don't know honestly if there's a region of the world i know the least about it's probably europe like i have a pretty good grasp about like their role in africa in the last century as far as colonization but um yeah i know less about their actual struggle for socialism i know i i hear of the paris commune i don't really know what that is oh really no yeah i just i i've just heard of it i've never really bothered to look into it i usually focus on projects in the global south but what was the paris me too that's why i don't have as good of a knowledge of europe but the paris commune was the first worker uprising that uh it happened when marx was alive so him and lenin like analyzed the crap out of it like this is what happened this is how the state crack down on the commune which is like an example we've had so many socialist experiments today you know like marx and lenin would be studying them seeing what worked what didn't that's you know they studied the crap out of the paris commune this one worker uprising and and when the soviet union had had lasted more days than the paris commune lenin had like a party because it that's how much it meant to him he's like we're the longest workers uprising now they say yeah they made it which people think of the soviet union you know as this giant communist dictatorial force it's like they were having a party when they made it longer than the commune in paris you know because they're like oh you've made socialism work this long like you know we built it in the face of imperialism yeah i mean did they did the paris commune follow like marxist ideals or was this like a separate thing yeah so it was a workers uprising they took power for like two months started doing all these worker thing you know giving power back to the workers and then the state just brutally crushed them and that's when marx comes up with dictatorship of the proletariat and he says first the workers must seize state power otherwise the state's gonna crush their revolution that was marks or was that lenin marx okay so yeah so that's kind of intrinsic to marxism to see state power now oh yeah state and revolution is mostly just quoting marx and angles it's yeah lenin didn't die a lot of that with the state power stuff yeah people just attributed to leninism and maoism because they kind of just went off of that afterwards because london because they did stuff in real life so people yeah they actually yeah and yeah it actually worked and it worked right for them you know yeah do you think that marx's view on the state is uh is kind of reductionist and i've seen that take floating around the internet lately and i kind of agree with it i don't really know in what way well when marx was writing like i don't even know like anything that any any book that marx was writing where he mentions the state people think that it's kind of reductionist to say that the state solely works to uh to oppress the working class because you know whether uh you can take the state in the u.s which which works to hold up white supremacy or uh the patriarchy etc it would be kind of reductionist to say that it only goes after the working like it solely goes after classes yet not read the working day chapter of capital he's very clear that the state will do stuff for workers but those things need to be fought for and gained like you know anything any social democratic stuff we have in the us medicare medicaid social security like the working the actual working day like the limits of the working day are set when workers struggle and they demand hey the state needs to pass laws on the working day but if they were to you know attempt to actually seize the means of production like in the blair mountain uprising that's when the police come in and start killing the workers and and put it down it's still still an instrument for suppression but you can through controlling industry and and controlling the economy and through you know class struggle you can force the state to put worker protections on um and mark i mean yeah that was marx's whole point uh so yeah i do have that yeah i agree i agree with what you're saying but i you know i just don't know if mark's ever avidly spoke out against like uh just the way that the state apparatuses hold up white supremacy uh maybe because in russia it was different i don't really know the material conditions of russia at the time but uh in america that's 100 the case towards towards the end of his life you know he started doing more but like that's why i call myself a marxist-leninist even more so than the vanguard party and state power and whatnot it's the imperialism aspect had not seen capitalism develop to the point of imperialism and imperialism is where like the video we did you see the blatant white supremacy of the white house that's because the black countries and pover you know using financial oligarchy what not so so i mean one that's you know marx's biggest shortcoming and where we need to you know add to his analysis is how capitalism turns into imperialism but then you know he was still dealing with a very early stage of capitalism so he probably didn't see it as much that is true but uh yeah it looks like i'm gonna have to go back and read capital which i'm dreading because i don't want to read capital again because it's like it's like the longest book ever and it's written like a third grader yeah and i got to read uh i want to get in because like i've seen you been doing videos on like plato and hagel and i want to read into that and like i would like to get into dialectics and uh kind of call myself a dialectician yeah but uh you know it's a that's a very common topic to read it's very hard to simplify especially when people try and do it on tech talk yeah i always end up doing a string of videos because it's like then people at i do one and it's not long enough and then people ask questions but like yeah even me you know i haven't read that much hegel myself a lot of it's from my co-editor carlos who's getting his master's in philosophy like that's the next jump for me is to jump into like the thinkers who inspired marx like once i finished capital for the second time like what did hegel actually say and how did marx draw from that um yeah like i want to read into the people that inspired marx and marx did inspire a lot of people afterwards who weren't necessarily leftist like thinkers like like for example freud who wasn't really like political but like he he was inspired by marx so i just need to get into those kind of people uh for whatever reason but just for the sake of it absolutely all right i'm probably gonna head out and go to sleep here marcus but appreciate you hopping on the live with me yeah please we should do it again yeah anytime just just send me the request yeah all right doc talk to you later peace bro thank you
