what's it feel like to be an icon there's no trans question I'm not a question [Music] this tier [Music] girl [Music] um I mean I sometimes have awareness of that like when people say something like that I you know I think if you if you are a person walking around every day waking up saying I'm an icon um it would be a problem and I'm certainly not that person and really for me I'm just so grateful to be alive I'm so grateful that I've gotten to work um as an artist and that I've been able to use my voice in the way that I that I have and so that's the gratitude that I get to continue to work and be an artist and that the work has inspired people and moved people the icon thing is really for someone else because on at the end of the day I mean I'm so I work really really hard at what I do and I'm always concerned about getting better at it and that is what sort of motivates me with everything I do and I'm really lucky I was thinking about how many actors um a dear friend of mine who um Coleman Domingo I also say his name because he is so talented I've known coma for like 20 years and he's working his ass off and he's been incredibly talented for years and he is acting he was like I saw him a few weeks ago he was like I'm booked till next May or something just acting and I'm a busy girl but it's I I do a podcast and I host a red carpet and I do speaking engagements I do my music and acting is a is my first love and my biggest love but it's not what I do most um and part of that is you know I'm black I'm trans you know I'm 51 years old there's just not that many parts for me but I I Endure and I keep going and I keep working really really hard at everything I do and actually keep trying to get better and that's what I'm more concerned with instead of like I'm an icon because I think the icon thing is about Laurels and sort of resting on what you've done and being acknowledged for that and I'm interested in the next thing I'm interested in like what's next how do I get better how do I get to the next level and then um just as an artist in terms of um storytelling what kind of power can I have in the industry because at the end of the day it's like you know I'm a worker I'm still a worker I'm not like a boss boss um yeah and like that's where the power is and that's you know so these are the things that I I think about um but that's what makes you that's What Makes You iconic lover like I still remember the first time I seen you on Orange Is the New Black and it's not even just that you are the first person I think of or I think most people think of when we think of black Trans women or women in entertainment and media it's not just that but I remember seeing you for the first time you're like she is acting down I am weeping weeping loved you from time and you know it's funny when the minute I I called my this is a collaboration I have like 20 questions that my friends who all love you have curated to ask your child I called I was like you know what I'm calling all my black gay friends and y'all but to tell me exactly what y'all want to hear and the first thing my friend Philip said was he said she is such a light and I was like I know from the first time I seen her he's like no no the first time I saw was not Orange is the New Black he said it was on an interview and he's like and all of her interviews something that I always have noticed is that he said better than anybody else the bad faith questions all of these narratives that they try to center around trans people that are not trans narrative she does such an excellent job at pivoting that to legislation and the real issues and that's it's so much that makes you iconic it's not just that you're an actress not just that you're a singer we have to talk about trip Opera because me and my bestie definitely watched it drop and you are amazing uh it's not just fashion it's not just looks but it's the way that you in a world where especially as a black woman period let alone a trans black woman there's so much hate and there's so much uh push to mute yourself you will so confidently carved out a lane and I'm so like excited and want to know like who influenced that how you got to the place to be 51 years old and be this woman that's so iconic to all of us the how we frame narratives so first of all um that I think that is just that is one of the things that you know makes me different from a lot of people that I have I'm an actor and I do all these things but then I can I can go into an interview situation and um and and break hopefully break it down and hopefully be nuanced but also get be clear and um break the [ __ ] down break like what really matters down so I I've learned from it I've learned from experience um years before Orange is the New Black I I did a reality show in 2008 called I'm gonna work for Diddy and then I started I used the little platform I got from there to really Advocate and I was and so I've been an activist I've been going to equality and justice days in Albany trying to you know get the agenda passed for years and writing um um transpieces for The Huffington Post and and going to protest and and being involved a new movie came out called um the stroll that my friend Zachary Drucker um directed and there's a photo for me in like 2001 when we were trying to get the um human rights um on law in New York City um on change to include trans people and I was there testifying you know it was one of the things I kind of you know forgot about and there's like documentation of me there there's a photo and I'm just like you know so I've been doing this for a while and so and kind of sort of figuring out how to navigate media and um yeah when I when when orange happened too I I knew all I knew when that show came out because Netflix was in a completely different place than it is now so I you know House of Cards had come out I didn't I thought I was doing a web series and I was 40 years old when I booked that part so I was like I don't know how long this is gonna last so I need to try to build a brand for myself um and also change the conversation with and about trans people uh so it was an activist um mentality in relationship to how we're talked with and about in the media that I thought was crucial that was bigger than me but it was also like how do I I think there can't be space created for me with this old conversation we cannot have a space for me and other trans people with the ways that they've been talking about with and about trans people up until that point it was 2014 when things really started to change and we're in an interesting point now you know I was in the cover of Time magazine in 2014 to call the transgender Tipping Point and nine years later you know for Trans people it is um it's dire it really is dire what I whew I'm just taking a breath because I just um it's gonna be all over the place but I just got back from Savannah Georgia now shooting a show that I'm the lead of that I co-created executive produced um it's the first scripted um show that I've um created um and it's been a dream 15 years in the making it's a miracle that that show got produced um Amazon freebies doing it because a lot of trans LED projects are dying in development right now so there's there's something going on in Hollywood yes we're more visible than we've ever been but a lot of trans creators are finding that their projects aren't being bought that they're um stalling and development um so all this you know sort of backlash against trans people is affecting um it's affecting us in Hollywood too and so I but I was also so grateful that I got to tell this story and got to be an artist and I realized this week that I use it as a distraction from everything that's going on in the world with all this anti-trans legislation because it is devastating and I didn't you know and I I did I just posted something I did in um when the Montana law passed um back in January I was like okay I gotta I gotta go you know go out and like talk about this because they've been saying this is about the kids for years and then this the Montana law ban gender for me here up to the age of 26. so I'm like girl it's never been about the children and so and but I it takes so much out of me because I'm not just talking this is my this is my life and it's very emotional and I don't know and this is part of the way I haven't you know I've been seeing a lot of me talking about this yeah because it is so I love I love my community and when I hear about young people and their parents having the flee states can you imagine like your working class and you have to flee an entire State because you're they're banning your care or they want to criminalize your parents or your health care providers for giving you care you just can't access any and you have to flee a state that's devastating the suicide attempts that that children are um um engaged in just when they hear about these men this is real life and there's an attempted genocide against my community right now and as a public figure who you know who's been at this for a long time it's just sort of like I feel at a loss because this is just happening and I've been I've been on TV and I've been in DC and I've been at the Supreme Court and I've you know I've been places trying to like Elevate our humanity and tell people what's at stake for a very long time and this is happening anyway it's devastating it is in it and it's um traumatizing and and so I'm trying to sort of be in my resilience with it and not fall apart and not feel hopeless and and what that that's the piece you know because I don't want I don't want to go on a platform and and be hopeless and be to and be just devastated because there's Devastation but what's the both end of it it's also the resilience it's like how do we fight back what do we what can we do in this moment how do we look to our ancestors and transistors what are folks doing right now you know um the campaign for southern equality is something I've been talking a lot about I know um um Alejandra talked about it um on on leftist Mafia a few weeks ago but the campaign for sale the new quality is um they're providing grants um to help people flee States or get access to care and so this is what we as lgbtq people as people of color have been doing for centuries this this idea of mutual Aid this idea of being there for each other and and the most oppressive of circumstances and so I'm like this is how do we be there for each other and then how I mean as much as we can I think the context of what where we are now um is that the right wing right-wing media and when I say media I say I mean social media I mean corporate media um I'm some left Center left leaning media has done a really good job of manufacturing consent that dehumanizes trans people right they've dehuman and when you can successfully dehumanize people you can take away their rights and we're seeing this in real time right right so much of what happened with um black folks in slavery they had to dehumanize us right they had to say that we were less than that we were animals so that they could justify enslaving us we know what they were doing with um immigrants at the border you know the dehumanizing so we see all of this dehumanization and they've been so successful with trans people partly because we're such a small part of the population a lot of people don't know trans folks and they the strategy was I mean they tried with bathrooms that failed but then when they started with the sports band several years ago well people because people really don't think trans women women so they were just yeah that's not fair and then they focused on children and then that focus is obviously about banning care you know as Michael said we want to eradicate transgenderism so it's a it's a it's a genocide and they've been so successful also because of the manufacture consent of the algorithms the profit motive that that exists where people don't get any other information that P that you can exist and go through the world and just be fed your own confirmation bias or whatever it terms in Social in terms of social media and nuance and the truth doesn't play in the algorithm you know that Facebook leaker gave us a few years ago gave us so much information that in Facebook's their internal research stated you know I mean this is I'm remembering this from a few years ago but stated that um people stay on the platforms longer when there's conflict and when there's conspiracy theories for whatever reason people stay on the platform and they wanted you to stay on the platforms longer so they can sell ads and they can say people are on this and we can make money and so so much of the profit motive the algorithm is not interested in Nuance the algorithm is not interested in love and empathy and the humanity of everybody the algorithm responds to conflict to conspiracy theories to people at each other's throats so there's so many factors that that have led to the moment that we're in right now and we have to have a critical relationship to it but how do we change the conversation yeah and changing the conversation is so crucial and I I you know I I you know I'm a leftist mafia fan and I'm a um serve times fan I love Lance and he's been such a wonderful advocate for for Trans um folks and trans issues but that whole Tim that whole Tim pool debate it's I'm like for me it's not a debate because there's I mean the second we're in a situation where we're debating whether I should existing into a debate we're having the conversation on their terms we have to change the conversation it's not up for debate for me and then and and there's a lot of people on the left who say well you know access to gender affirming care for children that is something we no no no no no no no no no no it's actually not it's not a conversation that we should be having I said this before and I'll say it again if you are the parent of a trans child or health care professional that's a conversation that you can have or you're a trans child yourself that is a conversation you should have but if you're not the parent of a trans child a trans child yourself or a healthcare provider it's actually not your conversation to have because it's none of your business it is none of your business what someone is doing with their bodies whether they're a child or an adult it's no it's not up for passion it's not a public debate it's about bodily autonomy it's about freedom and it is about the humanity the humanity of folks I believe this about uh Reproductive Rights as well it's nobody the second we start talking about 15 weeks versus six weeks no yeah you know I'm trying to be I try to be respectable black woman and not get angry you know this is and this is hard and so this is also why you don't see me a lot because I will I'm I'm mad I'm really really mad and it's like no six weeks fifty no the government should not be involved period and what's going on between me and my doctor in terms of Reproductive Rights in terms of what happens to my body period point blank and the second the second we get into conversations about how many we we're having the conversation on their terms we're having a conversation that is debating whether someone should have control over their bodies in every situation and have freedom in the United States of America and so so it is no it's none of your business it's not up it's my existence is not up for a debate the trans question trans trans ideology isn't even a thing all of this language that they're using I we I exist I'm here we've always been here historically gender non-conforming folks have existed throughout history and it is a colonialist um idea Western colonialist idea this whole idea of the gender binary we know that like third genders fourth genders non-binary pihedra two-spirit folks Etc all over the world have existed I'm here we're here this is I'm not a question this is not up for debate that I exist and that we exist and that we have a right to be here and so that for me is where where I need to start and where we need to like how we need to reframe this and one last thing I'll say about the conversation is that the culture wars this culture work that language is so it's not a cultural War this is a human rights attack this is because people just it feels very dismissive this culture that is what it is how does abortion a culture War issue exactly it's me and it's meant to do that right it's a straw man that they put up in place because if you call it the culture wars then it immediately becomes a two sides of an issue rather than one side needs their rights and equality and another group of people oppose them having their rights inequality and so they call it culture wars to dismiss that you know and Lieutenant Laverne and this is something you know I realize because the lifetime fine now um and I watched the interview you did where someone someone said to you you know oh your first role they called Orange is the New Black your first rule and you're like no no that's my breakout rule to many people but I had my first role in the 90s and I think that's something important to remember is like you are this Advocate and you are this person and it's because this is your lived experience you don't get the opportunity you're not playing a role it's not you don't get to just be an actress you have to be you know an advocate you have to speak around issues you have to support your community and that's the reason why you're so excellent at pivoting and being able to show them like no no no you're actually centering this narrative wrong this should be about this this should be this conversation and that makes me think you know as a black woman in media spaces how often you have to be in that room like how often do you get to be in a room where you're not being forced to feel bad faith questions and and um set avoid and circumvent these narratives how often do you feel like you walk into media spaces interview rooms and you feel like you don't have to do that I've been very blessed that I've been able to create a space in a lane for myself where I'm not always talking about trans um issues and I've done that intentionally and I've done it you know just for Branding but also for my sanity and there's so many other things that are interesting I I'd like to think about me besides being you know a black Trans woman I'm an artist and I'm committed to that work and I I love interior design and I love fashion and I love music and I and I love people and I love love and I love healing being in this space of of trying to heal and and um that's so much the work too right now because the um under estimating how traumatizing all of this is um on one of the for the first season of my podcast the interview Dr Joy degree um who coined the term post-traumatic slave syndrome and one of the most powerful things um she said to the most powerful things that I call her staying on that podcast is that um when you know folks who enslave black folks and who people who were you know complicit in that when they enslaved us they weren't just dehumanizing us they were dehumanizing themselves right and so where is the project of them rehumanizing and then also after we were emancipated where was the you know obviously it was you know 18 you know 265 you know and then like you know then Juneteenth you know we were just coming out Juneteenth a few years later for um where you know we understood that we were free and I say in quotes where was all the traumas therapy uh the generations of being enslaved and brutalized where was the the healing you know around and the trauma resilience work and just the the pts dealing with the PTSD of it all and that is something that we're still particularly in America struggling with I wonder for you as someone from the Caribbean if you feel that in the same way I mean obviously colonialism was Global but like do you do you feel I you know I always think it's I always I think if there's something interesting this is a slight digression there's something interesting about black women I think who particularly from Africa in the Caribbean specifically or even in terms of I remember in um meeting Iman and interviewing her and looking at Naomi Campbell and Grace Jones these are women I I idolize enough and obsessed with and none of them are from America and they their sense of their worth is so in the core of them that Iman went in and when she came to the states in the in this in the 70s and they wanted to exoticize her and they didn't want to pay her there was just nothing in her Constitution that was like any this is acceptable she was like no no no I'm gonna get paid what everybody else gets paid and this is not an exotic thing and and I you know and I speak seven languages and I you know if there was a sense of of um you know as Americans I think we internalize I think I'll speak for myself but you know for me as an American someone born here I internalized so much white supremacy right the colonization that happens that's so sort of instantaneous here and I know colonialism is global so we'll we'll talk about your experience in the Caribbean but I internalized so much racism that I had to unpack and and I had to work on my sense of worthiness and I feel uh Naomi Campbell and and Iman and the Grace Jones when you read Grace his biography um she just always knew who she was and and felt a sense of um her power um I mean I mean what do you think about that in terms of in terms of your experience and around so I have um so I grew up in the Bahamas born and raised in the Bahamas my daddy is a Nigerian and so the Bahamas is a very very I mean the amount of black lingerie black majority country black country proud black behemians and you let anybody until we are proud black people but we were colonized and the in the internalization of that is hyper present in many respects Obama is very colorist very xenophobic all these different things and so I had to bet I will say this my mom is my mom is light like light light but she's always hip to colorism as the most ignorant thing and she she got in she got in front of it and she got in front of it and my big sister my big sister thank God for her early vanity in life um made me the way that I am but my big sister was always like she came out from front like y'all look gorgeous y'all look like me so any way y'all thinking but they don't think she always kind of let me know beauty standards and this was dictated by other Norms she was like she would say y'all aren't in style yet you know these people think this because they believe light skin is this and certain hands and I was always under the impression that I look good they don't know it I'm top tear they don't know it yet and so then when I got to America and I came alone so my family stayed in the Bahamas and they had no ability to tell me at first I was in Florida then West Virginia then Ohio uh before New York and so I truly learned unraveled racism of realizing wait a [ __ ] minute you know what I mean like what is going on here like a lot of people you know you heard on these stereotypes and all these things but they're so foreign too you don't have any contacts for it I'm like what is going on but you look around and you see how people are treating all of the black people the few black people around you how they're talking about them and then you also recognize and something that you know makes you realize and I'm gonna talk to you about it is respectability politics I think is one of the the greatest signs of colonization and the way we internalize it both in the Caribbean and here because so so often people would say to me even black people I know would make these stereotypes or comments to me based on aesthetic things that are so inconsistent with my background or my reality or my schooling but it's because we're married to these respectability politics and these ideas and I've I've always wrapped the colonialism what I'm hearing is that the colonialism is different because in a majority black um on majority Black Island country that that the um and that your mother was hip to it that your mother because I think it's so I mean so important if you know you're loved you know by your parents and you're told that you're beautiful and you feel that sense of um of unconditional love that can shift everything that will shift so much in terms of worthiness right um attachment Theory all that all that stuff so I think that's what I'm hearing do you do you agree yeah absolutely absolutely and that's why I think something I've recognized is very often and I think we all know it implicitly it just you know the conversation stops short often in the black community because of where uh black people are interested in having the conversation about LGBT rights but there's so many respects we know like it or not we know when white people go and say something about racism it's received much better than if we go say it right it's discredited from us and in the same respect the same is true for lgbtq rights like the reality is Lions could say something and that it could be but because just by virtual lines being by just by even though has a partner with women all this that would be discredited in a way that they will hear it more if they hear it from a CIS woman or a straight person or whatever Lance going on Tim Poole's show I I I'm not interested in going on Tim full show but I don't know if tempu would have me you know you know yeah there's there's there is something of about then there's something wonderful about someone who looks like Lance with Lance's experience um advocating for us and it's a it's a beautiful thing um absolutely need that yeah and I think and that's what I I want to have the conversation about because I think so often you hear people like screaming they they both want to ignore and dismiss the trans Community while also barking down at them that they're not explaining it to them rights or bothering to educate them meanwhile you're ignoring all of John's people anyway and so something I wanted to ask was how do we better show up like what is it that you think are the most um popular misconceptions or things that as CIS people with a platform that they will listen to that we should be trying to say and what we should be trying to do with our platforms well I you know I love the video you did a video I don't remember when um you did a video when you sort of talked about how all these things are connected right and I like to remind people of that that they're not just coming when they're coming for Trans rights and they're coming for Reproductive Rights they're coming from civil right they're coming for all of it at the same time and it's and what's amazing to me is the destiny of the Republican party and like that the ambidextrousness of the Republican Party how many things they're doing it once and how organized and how much money there is but so I think I love what you're doing and I think a lot of it is about elevating them I've always believed this by elevating the voices and lived experiences of real trans folks but then um so that's important so that people can hear from us and experience our humanity and not just in the context of us talking about transness but like just living our lives a lot of what I'm trying to do right now is live my best life and do that publicly and be human in all the multiple ways that I am because I'm a human being and so often that is stripped from us and so elevating the humanity of trans people beyond our transness is so important um the interconnectedness of it and then figuring and and and how do we change the conversation how do we take it back to the live you know I'm all about data and all that stuff but the lived experiences of what people are going through what what's happening to folks the impact of this what's really going on with people and how they're struggling is um really important and then how it also how we're thriving because it's not just a struggle you know yeah um but using your platform to to platform other trans folks and other trans voices I think it's crucial having and then also and constantly being in a space of interrogating and holding ourselves accountable and interrogating our own positionalities God that feels like such a bell hooks in kind of a phrase interrogating our own positionalities yes tell like that sometimes but but being self-reflective and constantly like I have to in this Mo in this moment in my life I have to be really critical of my privilege I have like this class privilege I've never had before and most of my community doesn't have this and the platform I have there's a there's a considerable amount of privilege there so I have to be critical um and self-reflective as much as possible and hold myself accountable and allow myself to be held accountable too and I think that's the piece we don't I I still don't see enough of um folks holding each other accountable in loving ways and then that being received with the love and intention that was intended so that people can transform yeah that is not what I'm seeing I I um the um I can't believe I'm getting into this mess but the Anna kasparian moment that happened uh on Twitter and I'm a Young Turks fan and I watch and critically I watch everything critically by the way I'm not I don't consume any media we cannot consume any media uncritically right now left right center independent we have to be critical of everything but what was interesting to me about the Anna um moment is how much um Emma Emma biglin from majority report specifically and then and so many of the um your panelists on the um leftist Mafia extended Grace to her and extended love and compassion and we're attempting not to call her out but to invite her in right so this is what this is how it should be done I think I think this is how it should be done and what was interesting is um Anna's response as much as I you know I'm I'm a fan and I'm a fan you know but her response was not commiserate with the love and the intent to bring her in and to for her to be self-reflective and it's it's interesting ironic because she talks so much about being self-reflective and that in that moment she was completely incapable of doing that and can and seemingly at least maybe privately she's in process but publicly we haven't seen her um be transformed or even like taking in the critique and saying this I've heard what my what my what my friends have said ever heard what my trans um audience members have said and I need to hold myself accountable and I need to I need to I can do better and I will work on this and this is the process right so that is like because we have to Envision a world because we all internalize transphobia white supremacy classism Etc so what what does the transformation look like and there's just not enough work because we because there's no profit motive in that right the work is exactly each other out fighting and so it's like again go so it goes back to capitalism so modeling transformation modeling what that looks like is so crucial and then even someone saying you know I used to feel this way about trans people and then like I was you know a dear friend of mine or even just getting to know some trading trans or doing my own research I really realized that that was erroneous for whatever reason or about black people or about immigrants I remember when I got to college and at Indiana University like you know back in the day and I oh it's a weird thing to say out loud but I believed that if that if you're in America you should speak English like you know this is like 18 year old me who's you know Alabama I was just like well you should speak English and someone was like tell me more and they kind of called me out and it was loving and I had to like interrogate what that was about and what I had internalized and it makes me cringe when I think about that now you know it was 30 years ago but like though and it's uncomfortable yeah I think being willing and I've talked about this too with my own some of my own um moments publicly when I've been called out you know by my community and I've had to hold myself accountable or allow myself to be held accountable it is deeply uncomfortable yeah especially publicly it was it was a moment on Twitter when I um that I gave a Commencement Address about many years ago when um Alabama passed I'm from Alabama and Alabama passed that one of their abortion restrictions and I retweeted a friend who said a woman's body a woman's choice and a story and I retweeted that and a trans man was like Laverne you're really gonna erase trans men and non-binary people in this discussion I'm just like and this was years ago you know this was um God this is probably like four or five years ago and I had to just I was so uncomfortable it was so I remember just this you know I've learned to sit with in my trauma work I've learned to sit with uncomfortable feelings too um it's a process I'm just being so uncomfortable and I feel so called out and in the moment I said thank you for bringing this to my attention I'll think about it and I just felt like ashamed and I felt like all this stuff like it just felt really yucky yeah inside and I had to reflect on why that felt yucky what that moment was about and it's okay to have to feel uncomfortable for a minute you know it really is because that is what's going to get us to the other side that's what's gonna get me to the other side and days later I I had the privilege of giving a commitment dress where I talked about that where I talked about those uncomfortable moments of of being um held accountable and I could have last day we go into it's real it's when we're shamed shame had when we the shame response that we have so that was publicly shamed and I felt and there's a difference between shaming someone and feeling shame right so I felt shamed in that moment and we respond to shame we move away we move towards or we move against which is the um response that we have when we went to trauma it's fight lighter breeds right so it's the fight fighter freeze moving away towards or again so a lot of people when they're called out and I would suggest that this what it seemed what seemed to happen with Anna kasparian we're using her as an example now is that she lashed out that she went into the fight um part of the fight flight or freeze right and I kind of I froze and you know I I tend to internalize things I don't want to be fighting people on Twitter yeah and but so it's just like how do we sit with that that though that uncomfortability that in that impulse to fight that's biological that we all have yeah and how do we like you know and then when we do fight then we maybe need to just listen and we hold ourselves accountable and be and be transformed and allow ourselves to be transformed because that's how we get to the next place in terms of acknowledging each other's humanity and you know listen it is very much so a conscious effort because even with the Hanukkah experience stuff I I I put myself in her shoes and understanding like it can be it's very frustrating being the character of the day on Twitter and when people are are on your head regardless and because we have a natural response to defend ourselves whether or not right wrong or if somebody says something bad about me I don't like that you know so you know I understand those things I also think it's something I try to be mindful of because I recognize that you will always you're not always going to be I've been dragged on Twitter several times myself it will happen again I am sure um and I try to yes and what I try to do now is make a conscious effort to like go on creators that I like and I respect like watch their streams even when they're criticizing me and take it you know what I mean watch it and what I normally realize is if I get past the criticism the constructive criticism I usually hear something positive I realize they're common from a good place and I can you know receive it when it's constructive though when it's constructed constructive yes when it's constructive no no I will draft this is torture it's torture to just sit and watch somebody like Miss oh I ain't doing nothing no I ain't doing that that ain't happening in La Verne no ain't no way in a way um but something I also think is something too is I think we have to really think about our communities because something that I noticed like repeatedly in that situation is yes everybody trying to bring her in but none of the people trying to bring her in or who are friends whether or the community that you're in are actually members of that community and I think that makes a difference right because I've had a lot of conversations with like white content creators about racist things they would do and that they're sorry for now and I'll be like but black people told you it was wrong then and they were like not no black people I was friends but I don't know no black I didn't I wasn't in community with black people that I valued or I humanized or I whatever it is so I think that is something to be that you have to be mindful of it's not good enough for us to say you know I believe in the right thing so I will advocate for Trans people but I don't know them they're a distant unicorn fairy tale to me I don't have any of those friends I'm not in community with that because that makes a difference like something that happened to me yesterday I was gonna go to queer palooza uh for pride and if you are a queer person a queer um any Femme anybody like that you should go to square Palouse it's gonna be a ball and I was going to go and queer palooza put out a statement that was like nah they were like they're like if you are not you know if you are um you know assistant straight people stay out of here okay it's not just space and I was like you know what and I remember my skin and I sent it to my two gay besties and they were like they were like yeah and that is fine and I'm like yeah and that is fine whatever your initial oomph to feel oh excluded and I was like as they should as they [ __ ] [ __ ] exclude me and and that was something me stopping to say huh I had my own moment for a split second it was only a split second but of me being like well I can't be there and then I thought about how I feel when I'm trying to talk to black people directly and why people respond and I'm like this isn't about excluding you this is even about you this is about considering people and what I realize the reason why I'm able to do that is because I genuinely am in community with these people and I hear them and I can't I think that's something important that we have to go forward with these platforms like it's not enough to make my platform allegedly inclusive in rhetoric but I got my platform should be an extension of the life I live the people that I really do talk to and hear from because I think that informs who we listen to like this interview is great because I went to my friends like hey what did you really yeah giving living you know and sometimes it's hard to go out and meet people from different communities and we don't want to have like our token whatever friend right this should be about that but how do we have people around us who are like-minded but diverse in some way that is like I mean it's easier in New York you know I think it's easier in in certain places but there are parts of the country where we're just where folks are just I mean segregate like racial segregation is still such a huge thing in parts of this country but having living being in community makes such a difference right if you had that dear friend trans friend of yours who's like girl I love you so much and you know I see you but this you were dead wrong on this you know and and you're dead wrong because of this right and and that it does it make it that does make a difference when you are in community and it's and that's a tricky thing and um because you don't want to just go out and find you know a token you know whatever um um but yeah that's that's so much of the work but then it's just like so but but again it's like the re-humanizing process brene Brown uses that term in her book Brave in the wilderness which I think is a must read for these times she uses the term rehumanizing that we have to re-humanize ourselves and each other in uh uh cultural and political environment that has us at each other's throats that seeks to be like if you're not with us you're against us the US versus them stuff that is so dehumanizing like the work is to if that's what we're interested in there's so many people just making money right off this division corporations individuals and and we see it's just a grift for so many yeah but for those of us and I believe I want to believe in the humanity and the goodness of of of of regular people right that we want to be in a space where we are loving and there's just so much energy to like be in this hateful place and it's just such a negative energy I'm like who wants to walk around like that that so like and it's D and it dehumanizes us too so the work of like you know being acknowledging my own humanity and that and when I say that you know and this is me being the artistic part of me as an actor I have to approach every character I play with empathy I cannot judge that character because the second I'm judging a character I can't be in her shoes I can't literally play her with the um layers in humanity that she needs and so I I try to bring that practice into into real life and then when I say that everybody has a struggle everybody is has been through something and have land they've landed where they are because of some reason some psychological emotional reason they weren't loved enough as a child they were abused they were whatever you know that's the human human piece there's certainly you know many media figures who are you know doing the propaganda and doing all the misinformation stuff we're not acting in good faith and it's hard to see those folks as human beings but they have a story too and they've maybe chosen this corrupt path out of some scarcity something or other and so having compassion for them even as we you know do it from a distance with some boundaries you know whatever you think about these people into our lives you know brene Brown also says the most compassionate people are the most boundary so having lovely healthy boundaries is important but like really being in the space of like Beyond like you know pundits and politicians and and that everyday people like the people who are who are who we see on the street the people in our lives um how do we humanize them you know and and walk through the world in my humanity and meaning I can't I don't have the right to judge anybody else because I am fallible I've made mistakes I have done some [ __ ] that I just like not cute at all and every and everybody's going through something so it's like I can't judge you because I my [ __ ] is messy and I'm in process that's what I our shared humanity is that we're all going through something and can we acknowledge that that we're all going through something at different levels of privilege and I think being able to acknowledge privilege is important and it's like oh God the privileged conversation and we all have it in in different ways and other ways we don't right and that's something that's contextual it's like in one room you might be the most privileged person and in another room you might be the least exactly anyway exactly you know that made me think of because first of all you recently celebrated your 51st birthday happy I told you happy birthday online on the day of but I'm telling you it again hair um first of all and also pictures videos everything fantastic chef's kiss you didn't miss no notes and what I wanted to say is one I wanted to want to celebrate that and also something I feel like is always left out of the conversation black Trans women are left out of the conversation to me in a way that bothers me in mainstream media and you know there's this this intentional just nefarious attempt to dismiss and trivialize trans issues and I find that what is so startling is the lifespan the average lifespan that we know of black Trans women and that and so I wanted to know like what's that what does that feel for you reaching to 51 in light of all these things which you've been able to accomplish in this world around for your sisters if I mean it feels like a miracle a dear friend of mine it's just that miracle that I'm alive you know I you know in so many ways I'm not supposed to be here you know when you think of this that you know statistics that that um stat that you know the average lifespan of a black Trans woman is 35 years old it's like when you hear that it's like oh my God that's that's and and when you uh it's it's so deep I was talking to a dear friend of mine honey Dijon we were talking um recently I need to reach out to her again um you know she just won a first Grammy for producing two tracks on Beyonce's Renaissance um album and she I've known honey for 25 years um and we came up in New York at the same time she's a black Trans woman living in London now and DJing all over the world and winning Grammys and very successful and she's just like she says the same thing I'm alive like the thing I'm most proud of is I'm I'm still here I'm not even supposed to be here when you especially in the 90s you know like you know transitioning in the 90s in New York and just walking down the street you know just walking down the act of being trans and black particularly at that intersection and having the audacity to like walk down the street is like and then if you get from point A to point B you know without someone physically attacking you because the verbal attacks were just a part of my day-to-day life that was just what it was that I got used to that like people are gonna you know misgender me and laugh at me when I walk into Subways and subway cars and that was just my life and but just to to get home alive was um felt I made it because it was a war and there are girls still and I you know I I get to get in a car you know now I haven't taken the subway in a minute so this is these are the levels of privilege that Shield me from that um but they're girls still walking around they're trans girls in the hood right now not in the hood who leave their house and it's like you know and the girls with the um tasers and the box cutters and the Hammers and the pepper spray because stuff might pop off like all that stuff is so real that we're living right now and and that's never changed for black Trans women specifically and for not our non-binary siblings as well the danger the physical danger of just being trans and particularly Femme in public across that film Spectrum the lit the danger of that just the it's it's just really deep so I I'm grateful to be alive but again I always think about I think about my my siblings who are still in that like bracing yourself before you leave the house you know and I had make the makeup is armor or like just being hyper aware you know just to walk out of the door you know yeah um so it's it's Wonder it's a it's wonderful and it's a miracle and it's great um and I want to rejoice and celebrate that and I want and I you know I don't like to focus on things that are dire but it's like it's important to contextualize things too you know um but then I was also you know the both end of it is that like yes um I'm a black Trans woman but my mom was a teacher and she corrected my grammar and I wanted to go to the Alabama School of Fine Arts to study ballet and I did in high school and it was a boarding school and so I was surrounded by mostly white kids from affluent backgrounds and that was really challenging and hard and I didn't realize that one of the skills I was learning in addition to Classical Ballet and you know all my AP classes is I was also learning how to make white people comfortable I didn't know that that was a skill set that I was learning at the Alabama School of I know I said it's also served me well in in this um imperialist white supremacist capitalist patriarchy um quote Bell hooks so it's those privileges right like that yes I'm a black Trans woman but those privileges are in part why I'm why I've managed to be alive and I've managed not to do drugs you know I mean like I mean I think like I've never believed that you know recreational drug use is something and I don't I think I'm all about you know decriminalizing drugs and all that but I've I've believed in maybe it's a generational thing that as a as a working class black person that casual drug use is not something I could do that like that was not something that I could do and think I would like be successful for me personally because the consequences were different right that like you know I don't have like somebody to bail me out of jail or it's just and just oding and becoming addicted and like so so the the the desire to you know 23 years ago when I went to therapy at Colin Laura at Cal North Community Health Center when I started getting my um gender firming care there here in New York they required therapy and I think I needed therapy and Old MacDonald needed therapy right so so much of the reason I'm here at 51 is that I've been in therapy for all these years and I've been committed to um personal healing and and and dealing with my demons and traumas there's so much trauma in my from my childhood but there was also so much resilience too for a long time I talked about like the trauma in my childhood there's so many beautiful things like this mother who was a teacher and me taking her letting me take dance classes and going to the Alabama School of Fine Arts and being a straight A student and figuring out that like you know I was a good public speaker and I you know summarizing the studying school lesson every day in this oppressive religious context you know that was also wonderful you know so the both end of it um it's so that that's that you know all of it is why I'm here like the the challenges and the Beautiful resources are why I'm here and I was thinking too as an aside as a black Trans woman I was thinking about that whole Dylan Mulvaney thing and Bud Light right and I was um and obviously she has 10 million followers on Tick Tock and Tick Tock is the thing right now I've 6.6 million followers on Instagram and I'm not that big on on Tick Tock and I had um an ad campaign with Smirnoff for three years you know obviously this is the anti-trans year right this is the year where they just they're going hard right they're going really really hard and I noticed that I'm not on the right Wing's radar the same way that a Dylan Mulvaney would be and it's rare that um trans people of color and particular trans women of color on the radar of right-wing media in the same way that like a white trans person would be and I'm grateful for that I'm sorry I think there's a reason for that oh there's a reason I'm grateful for it but it's like I'm really grateful because I don't want to be in that mess but I think it's like they don't they they can't sleep just not transmit they can't they can't see the like the racism is so deep the massage Noir is so deep that they just can't even like comprehend this be like they talk about lizzo you know things like that only black woman they can find you know figure out how to talk about but you know what I've realized I've noticed especially in looking at like black people that are are becoming mouthpieces for for transphobia the way that they do it and they are able to justify to the black community is by selling it as some kind of um like like as though trans right to some are anti-black like they make it say separated you know the need to protect if this is a white thing you make it a white thing and so by by allowing them to if they focus on the Dylan Mulvaney's if they focus and and they focus on a white trans person that is seemingly to the public doing well because they have millions of dollars whatever it is it allows them to trivialize trans issues to to go after a black Trans woman would have to open up the discourse to issues that affect black Trans women which are by no means trivial you can't trivialize them once you know them so they keep them out the conversation and they're interested in their intersectional um it's and then and arguments fall apart you know I have not said this person's name publicly and we'll I'm gonna I'm gonna do it right now Dave Chappelle Dave Dave Chappelle and his closer thing I haven't because I didn't want to be in that mess in that I don't ever want to be like because people will have a headline Laverne Cox calls out blah blah blah and that's not anything I've ever been interested in but what's interesting and I'm not the first person to say this what's interesting about Dave Chappelle is that never does he talk about black Trans folks either that's it completely fall apart when he when you acknowledge that black Trans people exist it's always white I mean he literally talked about Caitlyn Jenner is like you know they epitome of like white privilege because like and whatever I forget the context and it was just I was sitting there I was sitting here with my black and my black ass cell being like um wait what right so and then all the trans people that he cites all of them and I know one of them that he talked about in the closer he completely lied about um anyway I should be careful about that because I don't wanna I got you so he he lied about some of that stuff but all the arguments fall apart when you ignore their black Trans people exist exists apart so it just it's it's not and for yeah for the black community it's like it's so interesting that's so much that's so much of why I wanted to go on The Breakfast Club um and do the interview there and I also reached out to Joe Rogan's people and I I we have not gotten a response from his people but that's part of why I wanted to go in The Breakfast Club to just be myself and just be a human being certainly they brought up you know trans issues and we talked about them and it was a lovely conversation and then you know you know The Breakfast Club did what The Breakfast Club did and I have love for them and it was and they were love they were so lovely man I know you've been on The Breakfast Club as well they were so lovely to me and yeah it's just like you know it's for me it's just about like how do I go on and just be human you know and have fun and just be be myself um and I want you to know I I have at least my last I'm gonna ask you one more serious question before I pivot to the fun things I I have to ask you before I let you get out of here the um when I read so something as somebody I I deal with you know they come from my head all the time and something that always makes me really comfortable when people ask me how you deal with that is I really really remind myself that I am not new I am not about like anything that I experience someone is everybody before me is experienced you know amen and I looked like Audrey Lord and hear her say there are no new pains and so when I heard you tell your story about what it means to transition in the 90s in New York and all of this I'm like I know that there's somebody hearing that experience in that or like wow you've gone from there to there and like what would you say to those people like well if you could talk to yourself at the time or anybody who's going through that what would be the advice that you give them or the words that you think that would really motivate them I think that an SS said this like a lot in the first season of my podcast and I believe this I think that like when I think about myself in the world I think that there are that it's important to acknowledge that there are some things that are systemic right that they're that racism transphobia all these things exist and are going to affect my day-to-day life but then what is my 50 what is my 50 in this where is the possibility of resistance to all that right that not to not be in denial of it but like what's my 50 what can I do today to elevate my circumstances and my mental health I think that there's there's a there's a mental health component to it to acknowledging I think therapy is so important if you are in people places and things is so important like so trying to surround yourself with people who are going to affirm you I am so I'm so blessed and I've been I'm very particular about who I invited to my circle and I didn't and one of my best girlfriends I could cry right now my best girlfriends Mila the Mila jam on on she's a she's a singer and a recording artist and so many other things we um we I met her in 2005 and she was like you know oh I want to hang out and I was like oh I don't really do that and in 2005 I was very I didn't have any girlfriends I didn't have many friends I was so protective of myself because I just did being so traumatized and I didn't let people in and Mila is so amazing and remember she was like oh I can hang weekend out at your place I was like I don't do that and at the time there was also shame around the 315 square foot apartment I lived in and I didn't part of it part of the reason I didn't entertain and invite people over because I was ashamed of my apartment but it's also like you know so that was class internalized class shame but it was also like I just kept people at a distance and Mila is just so amazing and wonderful and we have so much in common shoes from the south she grew up dancing and Performing two she doesn't do drugs she's just such a light she is such a light she's a black Trans woman too and like over the years like we started hanging out and then like I remember she even tell us the story and I didn't remember it she always tells the story I was like oh we were hanging out I was like oh why don't you come up and she was just like I'm coming up I mean I'm being let in and I just it was like and she and with her and so many the the group of trans women that like I call my like you know my family family um we all most of us are artists and you know none of us do drugs and I say the drug thing because there is a culture sometimes when you and for a lot of young trans um women specifically I'll talk about my experience where we come out and we're in clubs and we find ours and people are doing drugs and there's a and that is it is what it people do drugs for so many reasons and I get why people want to numb there's a lot to numb ourselves from but I just can't I can't be close friends with people who are active drug users it's just not ever been something I could do and part of this because I've never done drugs too so like he's just I was talking to a friend the other day about like when people are on drugs and you're not there's this weird suspicion thing going on it's weird you know so it's like and I get I don't poo-poo anybody doing but I don't and I don't count weed is that way I don't count weed is in in the context of that I think smoke your weed honey I'm I'm not mad anybody smoking a week but anyway but it was when I Mila and and and and Jocelyn and peppermint and and and Trace the group of women that we um that we sort of formed that is like a family and a Sisterhood is like so important to just affirm each other and to be truly seen and known that is such a I think like when um trying to surround yourself with people who really see you because I think so often for um trans folks particularly coming from whatever environments people don't see us people can't acknowledge us people like don't they have all these narratives about who we are if you can have somebody if one person who sees you and who could mirror back your authentic self to you that [ __ ] is life-saving it really and truly is and so but slowly but slowly bringing in the right people into your life and letting go of the energy and the people who aren't going to serve bets and we're going to keep us doing everybody's not excited for our success either I was talking about this with with the girls the other day there was a trans woman who I was really close to and then you know I kind of blew up and then our relationship shifted and I was just sort of like and I didn't take it personally I don't take things personally but I just in retrospect this is years ago but she's like everybody's not happy for you and I didn't I was like okay that's what was going on there and that's okay and that person is dealing with what they're dealing with and I have love for them still so surrounding yourself was really good energy and really good people and letting go of those people and those energies that are not serving us and understanding that you were put here for a purpose and for a reason and that trans is beautiful that like wherever you want to go in your transition um is fine but like so much of like you know because when you don't have money and I'm actually really glad I didn't have money early in my transition because girl I would have probably had way too much surgery and look be looking real crazy right now um so the blessing of not being poor um I don't like kept me from like some crazy surgery but like wherever you are in your transition being able to embrace today that like the things that are beautiful about me I really I believe this in my spirit you know I have to remind myself I started the hashtag trans is beautiful in 2015 to remind myself and other trans people that I'm not beautiful despite my big hands my big feet my deep voice my wife's shoulders my height all the things that make me noticeably trans I'm beautiful because of those things I could look at other trans women who were noticeably trans right and see their beauty I really could and I I could at the time I still can and they have things that are noticeably trans about them um and I can see their beauty but I couldn't see it in myself and now I can now I can and so that is so much part of the piece too because this like what really figuring out what self-love is and like and and a practice of self-love how we treat ourselves people always talk about self-love but not in a way that's like an active practice this um how we treat ourselves what we say to ourselves about ourselves those internalized messages like unpacking all of that so that we can be good with ourselves I got to be good with myself first before I can go out into the world and Conquer it I can't I mean there are people who don't like themselves who are you know doing whatever but like being interrogating all that and figuring out getting a practice um with therapy with friends if you need to be in some kind of 12-step program to to get off drugs or alcohol there those meetings are free and those needing save people's lives so like that's loving yourself like doing all that work and then when you can begin I think the blessing for me and I did I didn't I was interviewing Leslie Jones um for my show if we're being honest and she talked about how Katt Williams said you're gonna um you're gonna um break through and you're gonna be famous when you let go of your desperation and because she I always used to see Leslie Jones say you know because she would go right after Chris Rock and she knew Chris for years he's like when are you gonna put me on I'm not gonna be famous to this one but it puts me on and Chris said you're not ready and I was like but she would never say why what he meant by that and what he meant was what Katt Williams said is that you're leading with your desperation not your talent when you let go of your desperation then it'll happen for you and that desperation for me that's I was in that space between I mean I moved to New York in 1993 and Orange is the New Black premiered in 2013. that was literally 20 years later I was working I was working on my craft I was when I was prepared when that happened but there was so much desperation there was so much not enoughness that I was operating from and I had to go through a process to let all that go I actually was going to quit acting um Leslie was gonna probably kill herself and she didn't give a [ __ ] and she stopped doing her hair and that's when Chris was like you're ready when she was like I don't even I don't think I want to live anymore so yeah that's the D we have to let go of so much to step into who we're meant to be like who were meant to be in that way and people criticize Oprah I live for Oprah don't come for Oprah but that person that we are meant to be that person that God put us here to be we have to let go of stuff because we because we get all this stuff is put on us right and imperialist why supremacist capitalist patriarchy we have to let go of so much to get to that pure Divine Light if if people see a light in me it is because on a daily daily basis I'm working to let go of all this stuff so the light that that God has placed in me and I'm not a religious person but I'm a spiritual person the light that God put in me can shine This Little Light of Mine I'm gonna let it shine so that I'm just letting go of all these things that are going to keep me from the from the Divine that is within me and so that's what I would say and then and surrounding yourself with the right people putting yourself in the right situations doing everything single thing you can to let go of Shame of trauma to heal to to you know that the thing I would say about the drugs if that it not or anything to numb right we're addicts to our phones we're addicted to shopping we me let's let's keep let's keep it up keep it in the eye all these things that we use to chronically numb right they keep us from you can't selectively numb feelings so we numb the bad stuff we're numbing the good stuff too and the good stuff is like that's the Jews and we got to be able to like get up get rid of all the mess so we can see the good stuff in us and then we can see it then the world can see it that is beautiful Lauren and speaking of the good stuff let me make them my last question no we can check if you have a few more questions I can take a little more time unless you need to go good no no long answers so I'm like no you are you're my plans Laverne like this uh my friend Philip he said and he he this is his specific question he worded it like this and he said ask it like this he said when you go out and you definitely want to show out what's the most sickening pump you feel the most sexy in that's like God you know I don't I really don't wear heels like a lot like in real life like I wear for photo shoots and I wear heels for photo shoots I went I went up I actually did wear I did wear heels I went to dinner the other night I wore a little it was a comfy little um booty um to feel sickening I love like a a pant legging right now I'm really into my panty leggings and like over the knee boots like like a nice like that just just skin tight and a panther legging like I just live for that I didn't even look up yeah I'm glad you bring that look up because that brings me to my last question um that will bring me into your trip Offroad because Phillip says he says you have a vintage and he believes look how much he in your business he said she has a vintage I believe black jacket that's stunning

but I love that collection so much and I love that Hardware is like and that was just kind of a dream for me to like yeah own that jacket for a long time I coveted that jacket and then they have the Moto version of it um yeah that's one of my favorites I'll say that but there's there's a lot which is gonna be a moogly or two and then in the video the um and um summertime a trip Opera there's uh the last outfit that I wear in front of the red curtain is um a mood layer piece that I wanted for years and that looks so good I found the cape so it is a cape and it's a um kind of peplum skirt and I it just wasn't anywhere um I was just searching and I it just came one day I was on Etsy and boom it popped up and I bought it it needed just my mild alterations and that piece makes me so so happy and if you go to if you're a fashion person and you go to like Vogue Runway and you can like look at um Terry mugler's show from 1995. it was his 20th anniversary show that piece is not there they were like 300 pieces in the show but you have to watch the show there's a moment when the model a model slides down a staircase in this look and then she walks around the perimeter of the runway these shows were like theatrical Productions and she walks around the perimeter of the um of the stage because it's like a runway in the center and then there's like a perimeter and she was walking so there's a video and I'll put it in I'm doing a whole video on like the looks from the video from my music video and you'll see the look there and I just am obsessed with that look partly because I think it's just so this it's the structure for me with mugler as the structure it's the architecture I've always loved architectural fashion there's something because it feels like art you know I grew up at the end of the day I'm an art school kid I one of the great things about being at the LM School of finances I got to like you know any week I could go to a you know a play in the theater Department I could go to um Opera recital or violin recital or you know play and just being surrounded by it by Art it's just the best thing for me and so I when I look at the best of mugler for me it's like in that piece particularly the architecture of it feels like art it feels like art to me and like art is the most healing thing in in the world for me and that and that video too is like it's an interesting it's been wonderful we're like at a over a hundred thousand views on YouTube which is like crazy and and it's it's kind of an artsy conceptual idea to have this uh these Opera vocals to this kind of trap beat you know and I'm calling it trip Opera and it's because it's artsy thing but I think the fashion piece I wanted to bring in fashion and some elements from like uh that you might see in a hip-hop video right I love it um that could like just these are things I love I mean a lot of this is about bringing together things I love Opera I love hip-hop I love you know Beyonce I love fashion I just bringing all together all these things that I love and have it be an artistic expression and being an artist for me right now feels like the most healing thing it's the thing that got me through my childhood and these are the what is one of the most difficult times I mean I think one one person said that there have been more um anti-lgbt bills introduced this year than the whole entire history of this country combined yeah all the years that this country has existed so these are really difficult times and what got me through my childhood was was um was dancing and having music in my head when the kids were bullying me I would just start dancing everywhere and have music in my head and this dreaming of being creative you know and I played dressed up as a kid these are the things that got me through a difficult childhood and these are the things that still get me through and so getting to be an artist and getting to like you know I directed this video I styled myself I produced it I basically edited it too I had editors but I was like this is you know I know uh I know and even conceiving of the project you know I'm going to different you know Hector Fonseca who did the um um remix for the remix the track I you know I recorded these vocals in 2021 and he kind of hooked me up with different producers and DJs and all the remixes that I'm not feeling but then this one just and then the follow-up I just it's just it just gave me life and I was like this is like this is something this feels like something special and so it's just great to be able to be an artist and be and express myself it's just it's deeply healing and I need that right now and I think we need to find in these troubling times the things that bring us joy the things that bring us healing that those things are in place so that we don't get sucked into the admire of of of the depression of like all the things that are going on in the world that could like take us out and that are trying to take us out um what is what brings you Joy what makes you happy what puts a smile on your face it makes you want to go on and and being an artist and being creative in this way has been so healing and wonderful for me Laverne thank you so much like thank you you listen you say you know you say oh I got to New York in 1993 and I listen I was born in 1993. so I want you to know when you you think oh it took you 20 years old orange and new black listen you have no idea how many people's lives you touch and Inspire and who will never be as lucky as I am in this moment to be able to tell you but I remember being in Athens Ohio being like wow like wow and I felt that way every second of your career since and I am so humbled and glad when is your birthday you were born in 93 what July 27th coming up so yeah cancer still no Leo a true Leo Laverne it's so funny my boyfriend was born in 1994. yes go ahead and these babies we were talking and I was just like I was telling him like I was like I moved to New York in 1993 it's like yeah I was like he was born in 94. but like yeah that's deep so you're about to be 30. yes about 3 30 not even 30 yet can I just tell you how brilliant you are and how what a light you are and how you break [ __ ] down and I just there's something so incredible about you that it's just I live and that's why I'm here because that is for you and I love New Media but I live for you I think your voice is so important your energy all the aspects of your Humanity that like you could be this you know well-resourced you know sources cited you know um a movement lawyer but they're but you're fun and you're Fly and you don't give a [ __ ] you know and it's just I I live you're just a superstar you know and I think that for what I would what I'll say to you at this stage in your life I don't know if you're having a return to Saturn moment is that like keeping that understanding that you're a superstar but like also like you know don't just beware of ego just beware of ego I'm listening I am trust me I am a very hyper cognizant of it because listen my and my daddy is going to watch this and I love you Daddy but my daddy I've had ex-boyfriend said your daddy made a fine young man in you and I I definitely can have an ego tendency about my spirit so I try to be hyper cognizant of it and thank God I have friends that will humble my black ass every day it's nothing wrong with being confident yeah I know it's wonderful and we love that confidence about you when I say ego it's like I this is something I check in myself and that's the only reason I'm saying it because I feel like sometimes for me when I there was a moment and um around 2016 and I was you know I was I started feeling myself a little bit you know it was like I had you know a show on CBS that had a show on Fox I was you know I was I was feeling myself I was feeling cute and the beautiful thing about that is that the world humbled me like when you even in Hollywood even with all of the you know success I've had like I'm still I'm still a black Trans woman and I and I and I and I'm not old money there's a whole other level of celebrity like when you go to certain parties you go to a certain people you meet and there's a whole other level of like Fame and celebrity and money that I probably will never have fully have access to and I'm okay with that because they're so that's fair weather [ __ ] that's also like me wanting to like get into those spaces feels like that would be about my ego and not why I'm really here which is about art which is about telling stories you know it's not about like hobnobbing you know I've had these for me my ego is like oh I should be hobnobbing I'm on Instagram I should be I know this celebrity she loves me why am I not on the yacht with her you know and all the girls you know key keying I have and that's like about my ego right that's about that's some [ __ ] that's about my ego and that's the stuff I have to I have to be aware of right now and let go of and not and not like because and not get caught up you know for me it's like is it getting caught up and like the for me it's like I'm also able to see it I think being older too I see that it's [ __ ] I see that yeah I'll turn on you in a second these famous people bless their hearts that girl you get a scandal like they will switch they listen I seen it on even just the Independent Media circuit okay people will switch up Hey listen they will switch up you will hear a PSA from your boys so he's like just for me that's how I that's what I'm talking about in terms in terms of money yeah that I should be in this space now I shouldn't be in should be in that space now it should be hobnobbing with this person and at the end I'm not owed anything I'm not old you know when I um and I hope he's cool with me saying this when my my documentary disclosure streaming on Netflix right now um when we weren't shortlisted for for an Oscar and we had done this big campaign and my director was just he was he was pissed and he worked so hard on this and for years of his life and um he was so upset and I was just like nobody owes us an Oscar like nobody owes us a short list you know I'm proud the work has to be the reward you know nobody owes me anything you know like it's just there is there's a Justice thing right and then like there's that piece and it's like okay no one owes me anything but then like what does Justice look like you know what do reparations look like that that's a systemic thing right so I so yes people are old things systemically right I think people are owed Healthcare and people are old you know a living wage I think all that yeah and we need unions and yeah so yeah systemically people owe some [ __ ] but like an end of like an Oscar or an Emmy or being invited to a party a friend of mine was like you know upset because we were at the Vanity Fair party and like I was going to the gold party Beyonce and Jay-Z's party and she didn't get her she was she went the previous year and didn't have her invite and I was just like I just know I would be like and I I live for Beyonce I like I'm if I didn't get that invite I don't feel entitled to the invite to her party I'd live for her I would have I would have just taken my black girls home and just like stressing out about not getting the invite I'm just it's like it's not that serious I see it a lot even and it's funny I see that a lot like egos even on just like regular content creators not famous not this and I think you know as much as I hate my experience as an immigrant in this country I'm so grateful for what that has made me and how I see the world but like I'm from an island that is 21 by seven miles long like my grammy my fam I I remember having to convince my parents to let me come to America and they were not my daddy wasn't jacking it no one thought my family everybody nobody thought I would I can't even believe I'm my still being in America is a miracle might being a lawyer as a miracle all these different things and I walk around around myself how blessed I am like I live in a neighborhood where I live in a black neighborhood in New York where they over police and I'll even think I walk around acting like the Avenger and getting people out of Dynamics and I think to myself you know what kind of privilege that is you're not from here you could be in the same that you a lawyer and so you the people that look like you are treated with such a disregard and rights violated that you even have the ability to step in with your privilege to help somebody get what they should just be getting and I so I think about all those things and I'm like you know what the people that I read from I am I'm not a revolutionary I see myself as a harm reductionist and a black person just doing my part and I'm reminded that everything that I learned everything that I espouse somebody died to say it before somebody's a political prisoner somewhere somebody is not getting a post a cat being cute on Twitter and you know blah blah blah so I I keep that with me every single day and I'm like you know what just the fact that you could say that it could help anybody because you don't you don't get to see all the people that you impact or how somebody you know it changes somebody's mindset like you didn't know me before you did it when you reached out to me and me I was like I I am a big fan so you don't even know all the people that you're touching and so I try to remember that that's the big blessing in it and I thought I could say one other thing too I really appreciate it because I'm a huge fan of Cornell West and I you know not uncritically but a huge fan and he's been a huge inspiration I think Justice is what love looks like in public just like tenderness is what love feels like in private is a quote of like yes it's my [ __ ] and so much of his other work and I love that the way that you approach that conversation with with respect and with reverence let's talk about it let's be critical and I think he would even you know say that he is not you know above being critiqued I remember a conversation he had with bell hooks um in the 90s um right after the Million Man Mars that he participated in and she rest in peace um I love her so much I'm so glad I got to know her anyway she was she was saying in the talk she was just like I'm I'm so happy to see you Cornell but it's hard for me because I don't agree with you right now in public I don't agree with you right now and I don't agree with what's going on but I still have love with you but for you but I we need to be able to talk about what's going on here you know she was like she and I when I and I um the day she she hadn't passed it the day I interviewed um Cornell West from my podcast I called her and I said I'm interviewing um brother West later today you know do you want me to ask him anything or say anything to him and she said she said I love Bella she said tell him I still love him even though he don't treat me right and then she said and then she said like and this is um she hadn't been well for a while um she had been struggling with her health and she said even in that moment that like I really want him to like I don't think he's really into fully interrogated his relationship to patriarchy that then just he hasn't really done that and I and I and I and I asked him about that and what's and so even in these moments when she was um when she was struggling and and wasn't going to be on the earth that much longer she this was the thing that she had to get out this is the thing that she had to say to this person that she's loved that love deeply loves for over 30 plus years let's talk about patriarchy what is your relationship to patriarchy if you really interrogated and gone there I just um I love her so much and it's such a um and she said and she was so criticized we have an episode of um podcast I'm dedicate to Belle she was so criticized right and people have issued a lot of issues with Belle um and I don't I don't love Bill hooks on critically either but I love her I love her so much and she changed my life and that woman oh that woman um and she was so kind and loving and generous to me um but that that she was in that state and she was that's what she had to say um that's my [ __ ] that's like that's what it's all about that's about to be the last word of this of this interview that's my bachelor and I love that thank you LeBron [Music] and the minute you said yes you could do it in June I said nobody comes on there will be nobody interviewed into like an interview you first and June 1st girl you were like you had the email out yeah I was literally just
