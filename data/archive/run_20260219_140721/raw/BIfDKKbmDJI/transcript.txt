little stand up or something yeah I don't know I can do some wrestling moves I guess that's all I got some push-ups I've been seeing more wrestlers at communist events lately it's inspiring it's a awesome sign of the times I think that things are starting to change the first the first wrestler I ever saw was Jeff mson at the last Revolution report event but then at the free America to free Palestine event I went to there were a couple guys who were wrestlers now in the workforce and fighting for communism so that's that was awesome for me to see um yeah that that presentation by Slava was really interesting and thanks to the revolution report for hosting it's great to see all these organizations coming together um coalescing uh to to Advance the class struggle um cuz that's what we need um but it was interesting for me too cuz some of you might know my arch nemesis Cass he's a Colombian diaspora type guy who says that I'm not allowed to talk about Venezuela cuz I'm not from there and he doxed me and has released my phone number in public and things like that and but his main accusation against me is that I don't condemn Stalin who genocided the Crimean tatars um so it was interesting to hear his speech and I also that forced me to do a bunch of research about it I'm like oh they all join the SS go figure like probably probably shouldn't have done that um but yeah very interesting um so I want to talk a little bit about American Marxism specifically and American communism because we know that Marxism and socialism in every country will take a national form and even if you look at the us there are different cultures across the country um so you know reaching people in New York in California might be a little different than reaching people in Appalachia or in the midwest so um it's important that we all understand our own conditions and and learn to apply Marxist analysis and and to build our own American Marxist theory and um Professor Danny Shaw is a member at Midwestern Marx and he was on the revolution report the other day and he said because of Midwestern marks I've changed from uh um I can't remember remember exactly what he said like an activist brain Coastal Elite to an American Communist and you know I think that's a positive development I think that's where we need to move um obviously America is an imperialist country it's a country that's done things that we're all ashamed of but um that's that makes our job more important right and and we can't fall into National nihilism of rejecting the fact that we are a country right which is what is being pushed with books like J Sakai settlers and and a lot of ultra left elements we are a country we we are Americans if you go anywhere around the world you will be recognized as as being American and you know if if you read The Works of folks like Martin Luther King and and American Heroes they they stress that Martin Luther King one of my favorite quotes of his is we came here in different ships but we're all in the same boat now and these these ultr left elements reject that and and they say no all America's settlers and what they're basically calling for is race war you know let's let's divide people by race and fight it out that's not Marxism right Marxism is rooted in class struggle um which is why at Midwestern marks and this is thanks to Anthony Montero and uh the the free school that he runs um he's really encouraged us to incorporate four figures Henry Winston James Baldwin WB Duo and um Martin Luther King and I think those figures are are really important especially because Americans care about those figures right you can talk to Americans about Lenin and stuff and I encourage that but Americans want to hear about their own history they want to hear about MLK and and that theory um or the what MLK and Duo's fought for who's actually right there that's awesome um what they fought for is it overlaps with Marxism a lot of people consider WB Duo's black reconstruction which I think is a must read for American Communists people consider that to be in the Marxist tradition and it really is like these if you read these Marxist analyses of the Civil War um from during Duo's time there's almost no talk about uh the slaves and the class contradiction between the slaves and the enslavers and Duo not only makes an analysis of the slaves but he calls them the black proletariat which is huge because he's for the first time in in American history putting black and white workers um or defining them with the same name they're both part of the proletariat and you know we can't uh fight the class struggle unless we overcome this racial divide which you know was the same thing that MLK would would bring to fruition with the civil rights movement and um at least legally Place black and and white workers on the same same playing field obviously black Americans have to suffer with the um from the legacy of of economic suppression and and aparte but legally um the Civil Rights Movement put them on the same playing field so we consider the Civil Rights Movement to be almost a third reol ution in America you have the the revolution against British colonialism in 1776 you have the Civil War in the 1860s and then you have the Civil Rights Movement which which ends apartheid so the next Revolution is the Socialist Revolution and that's what MLK himself was talking about when they when they killed him um or when he was killed I guess we don't have proof but um I think we all have our suspicions um and and now is you know 80% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck we're all drowning in debt we're all watching our money be funneled into Israel and Ukraine now is the time for real American Communist forces to come together to coales and to start building an American Communist Theory um based off of of course our our ideological um mentors and leaders like Marx and Lenin but also you know with uh dubo and MLK like Marx's capital is is wonderful I'm I'm reading volume three right now but it talks a lot about the transition to capitalism out of European feudalism we didn't have European feudalism in America we had the Confederacy and we had this slavocracy we had indigenous people who were genocided in order to replace their mode of production with uh the capitalist mode of production and that unique history needs a unique analysis um and that's where we see the value in folks like d boys and and reading their work um yeah I in addition to to talking about um Duo and MLK in the American Communist Theory I want to talk about this concept that I've been developing and writing about called high ins sight anti-imperialism I think combating highin sight anti-imperialism in this country is extremely important um so I'll explain what I mean by highsight anti-imperialism there are two forms of high Insight Anti-Imperialist there's the politician High Insight Anti-Imperialist like Barack Obama or David from David from recently he was one of the Architects and the main people pushing the Iraq War and recently he published an article called the Iraq War reconsidered where he basically admitted that the whole thing was a mistake but his goal in doing that was to to lie and say that it was an honest mistake right we were actually trying to fight terrorism we were actually trying to fight these bad guys we just so happened to topple the government and allow Isis to take power and stole all their oil right he doesn't want Americans to see the truth Obama also called olbia his greatest mistake but again he's he's doing this he's coming out as an Anti-Imperialist and highin sight um in order to convince you that it was an honest mistake he doesn't want people to know that they took out Gaddafi because he had a socialist economic system and because he wanted to to set up an African developmental bank which is the real thing so you have these politicians who come out and like oh sorry about the war I lied us into that brought slavery back to Libya or brought Isis to power in Iraq but you can trust me about the next War you can trust me when it comes to Ukraine you can trust me when it comes to Israel cuz those were just honest mistakes um and we have to see through that right they weren't honest mistakes the um Wars that the US perpetrates around the world are for their geopolitical and and economic interests and you know that again gets to the the importance of reading Theory and and forming these book clubs and educating ourselves cuz once you once you understand Marx's Theory you can see through this this for lack of better word you can you can see through the lies and you see what it's all about of course we're supporting Israel because we want a neoc colony in the Arab world right it has nothing to do with freedom and democracy um you don't support an apartheid state because you care about freedom and democracy so the second form of high Insight Anti-Imperialist is the leftist Anti-Imperialist and these ones might be a little more genuine right like the Occupy Wall Street protesters who um derided and spit at my friend Danny Shaw because he tried to do an anti- Libya War an anti- Syria war protest during occupy and they're like what these Occupy Wall Street protesters came up and were literally spitting on them and saying you support dictators you support Assad you support Gaddafi and then here they are you know years later after millions of libyans have been forced to flee many of them drowning in the Mediterranean Sea trying to get to Europe out of Libya um after slavery has been been brought back to the country after the socialist economic system has been dismantled and Warlords and different Terror groups have have been allowed to take over a formerly stable and prosperous country now these leftists are like oh yeah that was bad that was bad well you were supporting it right so good job coming out against the war 10 years later after we know know that they lied about you know wmbs or Gaddafi giving his soldiers Viagra or whatever propaganda lines that they push you know now you can see through it 10 years later but what good does that do it doesn't do any good we need to be Anti-Imperialist when the the media is beating the war drums when the politicians are are beating the war drums um and again that's uh reading Theory and and education and you know what we we call Cadre formation too is is going to be really important in in combating that um so I encourage people to to hit the books as much as possible but um but when I hear stories like that from Danny about occup Wall Street it makes me realize how rapidly and and how much things have changed now you're having these giant Anti-Imperialist events um like the free America to free Palestine event or like um this obviously isn't a giant event but look at all the people in this room who are are Anti-Imperialist socialists and I don't know that this would have been possible that many years ago and I wasn't around but um it's a sign of the times that there's a more mature less infantile communist movement forming in this country you know that's where where we should get excited and and you know uh take part in in advancing the class struggle um educating each other and educating ourselves uh CU a real Marxist leninist movement is emerging in this country it's it's finally happening um and and we need to be there to to keep pushing it and when I come here to events like this or when I go to the free America to free Palestine event and I get to meet with so many people I I can't even put into words how much it inspires me and fills me with hope um and and just fills me with happiness uh not only to know that you know the stuff that we're doing at Midwestern marks is having a positive effect but just to know that there are people out there who are also educating themselves who are also dedicated to the struggle who aren't um hyper obsessed with identity politics who aren't anti-imperialists and high Insight um who are willing to do the reading and do the hard work that we need cuz you know we we do our work with Midwestern marks and a lot of it's online and stuff and and um until recently we hadn't got to see all the people who that we had influenced or on the ground doing doing the work that needs to be done you know going into the trades going into the unions organizing workplaces and to see that we have so many people in our community who are doing that I'm like wow we're really actually doing something here The the this country is actually going to change it's it's inevitable um the real movement of history is is actually coming um yeah and it's also nice to see how many people are also fed up with the ultra left elements that I am also completely fed up with um if you want to be a Democrat go join the Democratic party but if you want to be a communist you got to be a communist um so and the American people are are ready for Marxism right they're they um they love railing against the banks you know all like a giant percentage of Americans don't trust the media they don't trust our government they recognize it's corrupt so that's where we need to be there to meet them with a uniquely um American Communist Theory um and it's not going to be telling them to read settlers and move back to Europe right it's going to be talking about figures like Duo and MLK and what they did to advance our country to better our country to move it forward creating the conditions of today um and creating the possibility of socialism today there were there was no possibility of socialism in America before the Civil Rights Movement because they just had workers divided by race right but because of that we now have the possibility for a real socialist movement in our multiethnic multi-racial country um yeah so like I said we we have this theory that we call the American trajectory you know it starts with the the Revolutionary War that's the first American Revolution then you have the Civil War and then you have the civil rights movement and the next Revolution is is going to be the Socialist Revolution um and I I think that's a really important theory for reaching Americans and um I tell magga people that we need to recapture the spirit of 1776 all the time they're always like yeah they love it um yeah what I I wrote recently in uh my defense of the magga communism strategy article um about my my wrestling coach who's one of the greatest American wrestlers of all time he just rails against the banks to me all day he's like think how much money you pay to the banks for your house what do they produce what do they provide nothing he's like we don't need them we don't need our politicians and it's like yeah yeah he and before he was scared of the word communism right but now he knows I'm a communist he knows I'm a Marxist and he knows we're in agreement on 99% of things so he's much more open to these ideas and you know that's all we got to do is is Reach people with this Theory and also it's important to be a good and upstanding member in your community too so that you can gain people's respect um right people will people will trust you um or they'll they'll be more inclined to listen to what you're saying about politics if they know that they can trust you and they know that you're an upstanding and respectable person so um which is another thing that I've noticed recently so many um dedicated leftists recently who are really committed to reading the theory being upstanding members of their community and I think um Chris halali is a fantastic example of that um for all of us um so that's really encouraging as well um so yeah I guess that's all I got to say but read do boys read MLK read marks and [Applause] Lennon got any questions or comments um I was just curious you talked a lot about settlers and I was wondering your opinion on the settler colonialism I think it's a theory that applies to Israel where there's an active process of settler colonialism going on where we have these radical fascistic settlers pushing literally pushing Palestinians out of their homes and just stealing their homes but I I talked to some indigenous comrades um at the free America to free Palestine event they like that's not what's happening to us anymore right what they want is development Economic Development and and political sovereignty in in their areas right they don't want for all the white people to start labeling themselves as settlers and you know move to Europe or whatever it has you know all that does is inflame racial conflicts to be honest um what they they want is development cuz they're you know indigenous people and people of every kind of background um are living under capitalism we're all dealing with the same exploitation and de-industrialization and um financialization and debt trapping it's it's the same for all of us no matter um what color we are so it's it's like MLK said we're all in the same boat now um so I I think settler or colonialism is fine as a concept I think it's a concept that applies to americ America during the indigenous genocide but that was over 200 years ago you know the the conditions have changed um when you talk about things kind of like um like for example uh you mentioned how black Americans specifically are still dealing with the the economic um realities of of slavery and of Jim Crow but you don't or at least it didn't seem like you were talking uh necessarily as much about the systemic oppression that occurs in the modern day and how indigenous Americans are still being relegated to reservations that are kind of um I would say intentionally like bad um so I was wondering I guess what you would say about land back or how you would acknowledge the very specific racialized struggles that Americans do go through even though we all are Americans and militarians yes I see those as forms of class struggle right so they're they're forms of class struggle that are based in specific um kinds of Oppression um that specific racial or ethnic groups face but it's still class struggle landback I feel like has been largely co-opted by liberals and corporate NOS um the the landback NGO specifically is being funded by Jeff Bezos and Amazon and they're using it almost as a way to try and control the market um and gain control of more areas so at least based on what my conversations were from with the indigenous comrades last week they were like we want Economic Development and politic iCal sovereignty but we don't agree with this whole land back thing for one because it's been co-opted by corporations and um two they feel like that land back just means putting them on reservations you know which like you said haven't worked they're they're not economically developed regions um so what they were saying was like we want jobs we want political sovereignty we want to to better our economic conditions we don't just want to be placed on a reservation um by ourselves separate from every body else with with you know no Economic Development or or um and all the the issues that we see on the the reservations today so yeah you had a question about uh I don't know how much you've been following the convention of the cpusa in context of you know American Marxism by all accounts it's been a bit of a clown show pushing through resolutions or essentially tbling resolutions that are going to get passed that essent to just tie them to the Democratic party uh they published a piece recently that attacked you guys liel lied about someone that uh you know we're on good relations with what do you make of them and what do you think the next decade or so looks like in terms of a real American communist movement and the party yeah I got to be careful what I say but cpusa doesn't follow Democratic centralism anymore it's it's a cult of the National Committee it's a cult of Joe Sims I I'll just say it um the second genocide Joe um he he runs it like a cult and you know every year at the National Convention he overrides the you know anything that goes against supporting Democrats and then he'll Purge those people from the party shortly after um and that's what I think we're going to see again um there's lots of information um from people at cpusa coming out about the convention now and like they did the same thing there was the vote on resolution 5 whether they should support Democrats or not um and basically the consensus was that the vote um they did they did a a vocal vote a Voice vote they didn't actually count the voters but the impression of the people there was that the anti-democratic side won because you have like um the there was just a big Coalition of people who don't want to support the Democrats especially with the genocide that they're sponsoring right now and um what what they did was they said it was a tie um they tabled it and then they gave the final decision to the National Committee to Joe Sims and his cronies um and of course they're going to vote to support Democrats because that's what they've been pushing for the last 20 years that's their whole political basis it's like dude if you want to be a Democrat go join the Democrats we're Communists um but yeah uh something needs to be done um something is being done like I said said the the real movement of history is happening we're getting more and more real dedicated Communists involved who are are wary of this BS that's going on um and it's not going to last forever that's all I'll say and it's not going to last very much longer anything else sweet thank you
