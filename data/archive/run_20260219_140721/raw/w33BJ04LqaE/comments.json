This is because they just playcate to the prisoners and give them more and more even though it's created dangerous environments for the officers and civilians in the prisons. Once they impmembted HALT and inmates or \"incarcerated individuals\"(the dems love to change language to make horrible things sound like flowers ie illigals to undocumented immigrants, mother into birthing person, abortion into bodily atonomy\n and so on) have zero accountability for their actions and get away wifh whatever thry want.
