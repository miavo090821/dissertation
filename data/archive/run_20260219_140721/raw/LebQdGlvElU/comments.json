Bulgarian troops refused to be sent to the CCCP in operation Barbarosa by the fascists. Bulgaria remains majority pro Russia.",

I do accept that there might be troops training in Russia and I do accept that there could be combat engineers from the DPRK that were sent to the Kursk region to gain some understanding of the conflict however even the latter would prove extremely difficult due to integration and language. Brian Berletic at The New Atlas and Mark Sleboda have discussed this subject quite thoroughly and have explained the difficulties in North Korean integration within another nations military such as Russia",
