nobody is going to come save you we we have to do this as a collective and it is really really difficult to even convince people of that simple thing there's a overall frustration with the system lack of appreciation a complete lack of understanding of how this political system actually works too I think Trump has mastered the art of blasting out so many lies to the point where you have to swim through them and you can't back check fast enough cuz they keep coming at you the overarching problem is around education there has been a lot of misinformation and disinformation spread intentionally targeting the blackmail demographic the idea that a black woman should have to minimize herself and a hold less space is absurd they do not want to DARE hair cuz God forbid they internalize some facts that dispels the bull they want to be screaming about like [Music] hello beautiful black people see and no one ever says that's why I thought you were talking to we don't I you're right I don't get called Beautiful a lot so I didn't know what thought I thought you were talking to beautiful black people watching for some reason it's like oh beautiful black people well that can't mean us that's that's them other people those other beautiful black people no it's literally all okay so I brought y'all here to have I think hopefully one of my last conversations for this exhausting ass election season exhausting exhausting I like I want this to end so bad and next election season I'm not going to acknowledge an election season at all no one is getting me to even even acknowledge it's happening I don't care what I'm not I'm not in it I don't want no parts but I brought yall here because so I wrote I I did a video recently talking about Obama's comments uh about uh you know him feeling like some black men who are like reluctant to vote for KLA are doing it because you know sexism and that has got like that got a lot a lot of discourse and I tried to tackle that as nuanced as I thought and honestly I feel like the comments disappointed me more like it was funny because I felt like I explained like I understand I'm sensitive I understand why people are sensitive to Obama saying that because there is a a real reality of black men being like scapegoated and painted like this really regressive group that doesn't like vote progressively when in fact like black men majority like right right underneath black women are the like by a lot vote for Democrats and stuff more than anybody else right so like I wanted to speak to that as a real thing and I get that but on on the flip side of that I'm like it's not untrue I think it is really unrealistic for people to act like it's untrue that there are black men and men in general yes there are tons of men there I'm sure it's worse in in the other racial demographics by by far for sure but we're black people and and in the case of this election like Obama comma needs overwhelming black support because Obama I think we forget like Obama never won the white vote none of the Democrats win the white vote even the white candidates right like they how Obama won was because of record black turnout so it's not just that we know black people always black people that vote majority vote Democrat but it's about the turnout so it like it made sense why Obama is speaking to that because I think he's not just people took it as like this overall indictment of black men and black men who aren't voting and black men who have reasons why they're not against the Democratic party but it seemed very clear to me that he was speaking specifically to black men who he feels otherwise would support the whoever the Democratic candidate is but are now looking for a reason to not support kamla and I thought like that was as nuanced as I could do it and the way the funny like the comments I got a lot of comments and a lot of feedback and honestly it was interesting because the black men in my comments that were giv feedback you know granted I'm sure there are people who are Bots and whatever but in so far as I could see they were very mad about Obama's comments while also saying things that solidified Obama's comments like I was like by the time I read their comments I felt like I actually gave too much grace because I was like not for nothing we can see I can see the like the amount of black men that are all over our social medias all over interviews like black men of note you know saying these crazy sexist things and all these different things but I recognize that they're also over represented they're giv more attention they're giv more light because that's who the that's the black man that they want to show us that and so I I was like I'm not gonna acknowledge that in this I'm gonna you know give the grace of that argument but the way they hear my comments like I like I understand being frustrated with the Democratic party I fully get that but I don't understand I really don't on a practical level don't understand how we have like this amount of like rage for Democrat like because it's not just like oh it's not just I'm not talking about the people like oh I hate the Dem they're all the same I don't want to participate in both parties I'm talking about the people who like specifically and you could see them the shade room blacks they are they're like f the Democrats the Democrats ain't do [ __ ] for me either but they are like praising the Republicans and I cannot for the love of God understand what lens you look at or you look at the state of black people and you come to the conclusion that like the Democrats are the devil but the Republicans are good or doing something for you and so I don't know I say all L to say I don't know how the [ __ ] I feel anymore I'm putting it to the room I think it's hard I think it's hard for people to hold two maybe like almost contradictory things in their head at the same time um and I think it's also just you know we're reaching a boiling point we're reaching a situation where things are becoming untenable for a lot of people so um that's where like that that's where contrarianism thrives right if the Democratic party hasn't been working us for so long then we're gonna have to find some other way and in that scramble people start looking in all the wrong places yeah I think twoo uh no go ahead go ahead bro okay uh real quick I was pick backing off Nicholas and I think um I think uh part of his point uh was particularly Salient to me and I think it's just the the the idea that we've been had for so long um I think it's like Democrats have been the default vote for black people specifically black men for a very very long time and I think when you get the um Veil lifted off your eyes and it's like oh I've been scammed this whole time it can um create some bitterness and I think that bitterness is causing us to intentionally want to like yeah that capture that contrarian energy but also just like literally purposely go to the party that's going to hurt the Democrats the most like that's what I've seen in my comment section right people that are like not only [ __ ] the Democrats but like yeah the Democrats but we're going to do everything we can to now own the libs and smash the leftists and it's like they've joined the opposition party just to hurt the Democrat cause the most and I think that's the part that's confusing yeah that's spite that's just pure cuz I'm just like who are you spiting I get spite I just don't understand how they've come to the conclusion that they're spiting anybody but themselves like I I'm like you can't hurt power you're not going to hurt the Democrats you're not going to we first of all I think we've shown we did 2016 we've demonstrated that we cannot we're not going to like you know upset the Democrats fight the Democrats cost the Democrats an election into becoming radically different or being the ones who suffer that's just not how it works so I think that's what confuses me but I'm not going to talk no more other than the only thing I'm question I'm gonna throw out that I guess I want us to think about because I keep seeing a lot of people be like we've black people like pointing out to me like what your analysis is missing is that black men have been like like losing support have been you know dropping off from the Democratic party steadily since the 2000s and I'm like yeah but they're saying that and I don't know if this it's a thing I don't know if I agree with they're saying it as though it's a reflection of proof that the Democrats don't do anything for us or and I'm like I think it it's a reflection of maybe some like larger dissatisfaction I also think there like more voter disenfranchisement and things that happened to black men um to like suppress you know depress the black male vote but I was like in the same period of time black women support for the Democrats has remained you know steadily high and black women have been doing way better throughout the 2000s like not just then black men I don't mean that like in society like black women are now the most educated doing the most businesses so I'm wondering what is the Democratic party what are black men seeing that you know the scale is dropping from their eyes that they're deciding that the Democrats are doing to them that they're somehow some not also doing to black women how are black women being so successful in the same period of time so I guess that's that's all I've been thinking I think um I'm I'm going speak to like some of the stuff I've heard from Friends people I've known for a long time stuff my barber says to me when they ask questions about this stuff and I think it there's a overall frustration with the system lack of appreciation and I think you can like combine that also too with a full like a complete lack of understanding of how this political system actually works too because I think as a whole I don't think black men feel appreciated I don't think it's a Democratic thing I just think in society and then when we look at the party that we're supposed to be aligned to like we're big on like loyalty respect so was like I'm giving you this but what are you tangibly giving like we like we we we know that we're getting things but because it's not postmarked as like black there are some people who don't see it but there are certain things that are going to benefit us like health care for example and forgiving student loans for example and I'm very frustrated with I don't both parties you know what I'm saying but we can't act like there's not one that's better in terms of what they do domestically you know what I'm saying so I I I think I could kind of boil this down to so the DNC was was in my city I'm in the Chicago area and I went to a session to learn and it was a session about reaching black men and I kind of wanted to see and just kind of hear what they were going to say because I went in there thinking okay they going to act like they know how to reach us but they actually had a brother there who was a mayor from a small town of North Carolina who was talking from the perspective of Democrats don't listen and this is what they need to be understanding and his main talking point was we don't have a lot of like trusted Messengers who communicate these things to us and we're often uh we feel disrespected by the way we're communicating things for example they'll bring out you know celebrity endorsements or they'll have your favorite rapper talking about why you should do this or um and and this ain't even really just for us like even the white Community they brought out for y'all you know what I'm saying and uh the Insane Clown posy I think was endorsing too but like I think that's an American thing but we feel it more because it's either celebrities or nothing for us and his point was we want to hear from people we're close to about why this is important and why we should vote but as a society do we ever really have those conversations think about that like where do we even learned about politics it ain't in school really we learning we passing a test I'm just trying to get out get is this a b whatever I got to get and then it's media friends and now what we didn't have when we were growing up was this the polarization of social media now that frustration is expressed but not just is it expressed there are content creators who will feed off that and keep feeding you more of that anger while they profiting and while you suffering the answer is not to go to the far far right to me the answer is until we get a better system we got to keep organizing over here I think that's a good point that we don't have a lot of uh yeah I think to add I think to add I think there's a certain level of like political incoherence that exists and I don't and that goes back to the education I I don't know if people understand the difference between different political ideologies I don't think that they necessarily fully understand how the government works at the different levels whether that's local or federal whatever the case may be and I also think people want to be even though they hate this they want to be Pander to and I've been having conversations about this and they're just like I don't want to be Pander to yet what you're saying to me yeah you do want to be Pander to you want to be specifically Pander to and then if you don't get specifically Pander to in in the way that you want to then you're mad like it's really confusing I think that's one of the biggest things right when kamla came out with her plan um a lot of people were sharing like the little small Snippets but actually it's like a a nine-page plan with all these different things right and then I see saw people say you know like oh I don't even smoke weed why is this targeted towards black people and I'm like wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait okay so what exactly do you want because we know what the implications are of black men and weed and incarceration right and mass incarceration all that stuff and it's just like I'm confused to why you're even saying that because this is an attempt and then this other person on the other side of the aisle Trump and all those people are not even remotely inter interested in those types of things and going back to what Obama said I understood what Obama was saying but I also understood how people got all mad because there is this trend or this situation where everybody seems to be aiming at black men and I feel like a lot of black men feel targeted and unwanted and all these different things and it it might even well I think it absolutely is related to that whole uh uh loneliness loneliness that's going on with men in general and then they they turn to the alt-right pipeline stuff like that and some of the things I hear from my own friends my associates and stuff like that some of the most right-wing things I've never heard of I don't know what they looking at I'm confused and I'm like man I've been knowing you for a long time what are you talking about you know and I think these are interesting conversations we need to have we need to have better uh examples or redirect our community to uh to people that are going to actually help us and not like do what a lot of people are doing I I think a lot of people are very viby right they likes they like uh Trump's Vibe I know that sound I know I know they like Trump's Vibe you're not crazy sound crazy it does not sound crazy like you're not crazy um like I did a I did a video recently where I was breaking down my criticisms for every candidate right Trump kamla uh even the libertarian which is Chase is crazy I don't know if yall looked at him um and even the Socialist candidates Claudia and Karina in uh New York and just seeing the varied landscape there for one until I made that video I had never even looked into anybody who wasn't a Democrat or Republican so start there I think you're right to question the level of Education across the landscape most of us don't know what the hell is going on beyond the Snippets we get on social media period we don't even watch mainstream TV anym I got I got a question for so the education is absolutely not there what's up oh uh so when it comes to Obama is he are like we don't have a lot of public figures that represent black men as a whole anymore he can really speak to us where we're at is Obama the guy is Obama our is is he our representative is he does he represent black men in in the United States of America and then I have a follow-up question about that but is he the guy does he represent us not not not for me I think a certain like generation maybe I I admire what he accomplished I admire a lot of what he was what he did of course like actually prior to being elected too um I mean like and I I'll take it personal I'll admit because his Pastor was my father's childhood Pastor I didn't like the way that was handled so I'm I'm always gonna have kind of like type feeling about how he did Jeremiah right um but I I I watched the speech yesterday I'm always inspired but I also always differentiate between him like cting you know uh Al Green lyrics and Eminem lyrics versus what he actually represents as the American Empire um I I keep people where they are you know what I'm saying yeah I I would I would agree with that um I think Obama has done just as much harm as uh most of the presidents you can name and I think we need to I think it's it's tough for us because he's the first right like he um he was the first one to punch through he was the first one with the combination of education and polish and ability to speak that dynamically and ability to inspire us that allowed him to win the presidency we've never seen anything like it and so we're we're we're leaning towards all the time like giving him giving him the credit he deserves and giving him the prop but at the same time American presidents are frequently war criminals and probably giv Obama is not really an exception yeah like you can give somebody props like like like a black man you know and admire their accomplishments but we know too much about uh Obama and and at least in my case to kind of continue to hold him up as like this Paragon of virtue like no he's uh he's a politician and he's a more favorable as far as his personality and his ability to speak and Inspire than a lot of other politicians that does not that does not exclude him from the criticism that he deserves as the commander-in-chief yeah I think I do think that he had that glow or whatever uh you know for us you know he maintained that aura for all eight years and I don't think that it started to fade until a lot of us started to look back and uh you know be because we felt so much pride in what he had accomplished and for what it uh rep or what we felt to represented at the time for all of us um he was my introduction to politics in a lot of ways you know I was in I it was my senior year in college when I could vote for him we were like I was a minor in African-American studies we were watching his speeches like as they were happening or the next day and dissecting them and just the feeling like I had the shirts and all of that and then I started teaching too and then that was also my introduction to learning about drone strikes I was like oh a bunch and a bunch of other stuff and I was just like yo so by 2012 I I voted for him but I didn't really feel good about it you know um but and I and I wonder too for this generation of folks who are coming up who is their introduction in terms of like because I had to do a lot of soul searching reflec and then also understanding the Dynamics of the you know our system of federalism um but but I think that just like you said Kim I think he he like he's he seemed like personally like a really cool dude but we know he had a job and I also bring back some of the criticism because I say I can't expect one person to do it all yeah and that's why I land with kin I was like the maturity says she's gonna be one person he was one person this ship has been steering this direction for this long and it might be even dangerous for them to try to you know go off course a little bit so I I I really struggle with how to judge a president effectively in the system oh I'm talking about I've been thinking about that I was writing a thing literally about that last night because I'm writing a video called uh that I'm going to put out at the end of this month called the seven deadly sins of black politicians and I've been basically writing and starting it all year and stopping and scrapping and starting over because I keep changing I guess like my frame of mind work and like what I basically came up with is like political Purgatory for like black politicians who like they they've done things that say that suggests that they probably heart might be in the right place or that they align in themselves they believe that they are working on your side and they're progressives and they're trying to navigate they're maybe try I'm trying to give the benefit of the doubt that they maybe are navigating Landscapes I can't see like I can't pretend that I know every area in every political Arena the way that I might know like a New York City here but at the same time while I have evidence of that I have a lot of evidence of like their being being just as doing things that I would indict another black politician for right so like in my video if I have like oh these are the Sinners so I had like some examples of that like in a political Purgatory I put was like uh the mayor of Baltimore someone who I can see like you can hear in his language I can see other things that he's done that shows like a motivation like he's trying to help the people of Baltimore but then on the flip side of that there's cop City that he's behind but then at the same time I'm like I don't know Baltimore is a complicated Rich history of policing what actual black people think on the ground what the black voters think because I have to keep like the thing I've been Reckoning with is that a lot of black people don't agree with me like or us like you know what I mean the progressive school of thought they don't they don't see the same like being pro policing as in be being inherently anti-black there's a lot of black voters especially of the black generation before us that very much like those politicians we have because they believe those are who we should have like not for every of these like older black people are these like black politicians pulling the wool over their eyes like that's what they feel like the community needs so I'm like who am I to say like I don't know what's being called on by his church leaders the black communities there so that's what I've come up with Ernest I'm like struggling with that too like political Purgatory till I figure it out like where like what I think is going on there yeah it's it's it's difficult it's very difficult I mean who commute us where shahen what do you think about Obama I was curious about that um I'll be honest I think this whole thing is like so complicated and so multifaceted that Obama is just a single representation of part of how people feel I don't look at any personally I don't look at any politicians as Idols because I believe that is a foolish thing to do um considering how they make their money I I can't trust it but I think like the over the overarching problem and I heard it echoed a few times is around education like there has been a lot of misinformation and disinformation spread uh intentionally targeting like the black male demographic uh I actually was in Milwaukee a few weeks ago uh doing some stuff around activating voting um and I found out that they uh the Trump campaign is doing targeted ads towards black men in Atlanta for example um sending out like uh flyers and uh things like that trying to get people to feel swaye I got some to to vote uh towards the right and I say that to say that a lot of people don't have the education around like what is and what isn't truth and I think like while we on this panel it seems like have a pretty good grasp on the the the state of the current political landscape a lot of people are not there um and similar to what you just said I had to realize that a lot of black people just are not like there like there is not a lot of political education and I think the problem that the Democrats are facing right now in losing the black losing the black male vote because again like black men vote like very much so in alignment with the Democratic party is that the systems that Democrats were complicit in creating are is eating away at their own populace and I think that is evident in like the school to prison pipeline for example uh prioritizing certain factions of policy over others and I think it's just like yeah they kind of screwed themselves and I think like having a more left-leaning politic makes it hard to look at these problems and to kind of like feel uh any sympathy towards the Democratic party for that but I do believe like there is a difference between Trump Lord Jesus and Kamala I think uh you know the president is going to be a cop either way it's just a matter of like how bad you want to be uh how bad you want your police brutality to be at this point is there anyone um that's the American Empire man is there anyone that you guys do see is is there anyone who does speak for us CU that's I think that's part of the problem is we don't have um somebody to Rally around as black men currently I think uh there's a lot of desperate figures out there you know just kind of spread out yeah leaders thought leaders cultural leaders yeah there's like a smatter that's 100% that's 100% true because you know back during the Civil Rights era and stuff like that we had all types of leaders um we don't have stuff like that anymore I don't even know where to begin with that one I was about to say I feel like a I'm gonna let shaheim talk I feel like we probably on the same page in my soul I'll probably like I'm probably this probably gonna be taken in the wrong way I hope it's not but black men similar to all men in this country in general have been so inducted into the manosphere the the uh the where a lot of the representation is I think of the Kevin Kevin Samuels of the world who take advantage of male loneliness which is like definitely an epidemic happening here um and like constantly feed into this idea that women are the blame again I said this is such a complicated and multifaceted issue I think a large part of why a lot of black men immediately feel reprehensive towards Kamala even though we all agree there is a lack of Education across the board is simply because a lot of black men hate black women and I know I know it might not be like uh blatant hate it might not be outright hate but I believe like culturally like we have a problem in our our culture as black people where especially here where black women are constantly degraded and put down I think a lot of the reasons why uh somebody mentioned [ __ ] towards the the Democrats which is why people are like going in the oppos opposite direction I think it's deeper than that I think it might be [ __ ] towards black women and how black women like typically lean politically because a lot of men are conditioned to blame women for their their problems and the things that they lack specifically black women because those are the closest women to them in proximity um and I know it's to me it's a cultural thing and it's also so many other because don't take this too far out of context it's so many different layers to it because there are different people who are coming to the same conclusions for different reasons like there are still black men who believe that we are the original Hebrew Israelites um a lot of them there are lot there are black men who are like extreme extremely left um or I don't say extreme like they lean more to the left and they are able to take a step back and analyze that a lot of these systems are just and the way that the country Works in general it's just like exploitative and anti-black and then there are people who just like feed into conspir things thinking that think like you know p didy is running the government or some [ __ ] like I think there's so many layers but she knows across the exactly often across the board especially with black men it is a deep hatred for black women um and that's just agree what do you mean exactly though but but like can we break down the Nuance of that though in terms of hate because hate can be viewed a few different ways I feel like because there's a hate that white races have for us and cuz I get what you're saying but like can you break that down a little bit more in terms of like hate is like I can't stand this you know what I'm saying or I feel like I got answer this one as as the woman here I feel like that's the issue too like I think that what I found crazy about the discussions about black women and black men in this election right is like on one hand I felt very like I've gone out of my way like every time to be very sensitive to like how the black man perceives things and how I talk about things you know even though I can see and I've lived my life as a black woman and I experience I know the vitriol that is had for black women it is a it is a lived experience and how we're perceived all this all yada yada Y and yet like I see that I I feel the the need to like discuss it in this way and like and I've seen like black women trying to discuss it in a way like trying to be like sensitive to that and there's a flip side to the way that black women are regularly discussed and I think it's important to like point out people think of it's like when you try to explain to like white people about racism and white privilege and micro aggressions and the fact that you can do these things and these can be racist and these can be harmful without you waking up and consciously deciding I am racist I think black people are inferior but you were raised and indoctrinate indoctrinated around in a society that ingrains that notion in things so you are going to implicitly and unintentionally like uh uh uh conduct yourself and do things that are racist right regardless of like who you are in your spirit and it's the same thing when it comes to sexism and patriarchy like this is a patriarchal society like it's not like so many men particularly I'm not saying black men because of the majority I'm saying black men because that's who I'm in community with you know um that that take offense like the way I saw so many black men jumping down like Angry like has nothing to do with sexism black men aren't sexist like they're not in the same breath calling C every kind of [ __ ] refusing to say her name there's a certain level to which they're like [ __ ] shaming her they're you know like denigrating her I'm like it it's it's it's evident and it's present and I'm like when you think about hey the existence of the manere and of itself right I I don't think we when I think of the manosphere I like I very often sometimes like think of like these bunch of like white incels right like that's who I think like in my picture but when I think of who the actual Manis faere leaders are they're Kevin Samuels they're Andrew Tate whose daddy is black it's fresh and fit those are you know what I mean and like you look at like where the shade room like I think about how many black people were like upset that like commo was even going to the shade room but the reality is a lot of black people if not the majority of black people between a TI like a teenage like 30 something age demographic are getting their news from the shade room and if you go look at the culture of those comments in that community and see how they talk about and think about black women is is crazy to me we can look at who the majority of black media both mainstream and independent and look at how they talk about and think about and treat black women in even their lives like Beyond just like on media so I I think like that's that's like what we mean the hate the hate is not like in the conscious way that you like wake up and you say I hate women or that I don't want to be with a woman but it's the way that you you uh you judge and pick apart and you feel like like a visceral you get a reaction out of the idea that a woman might even be in a spot that a woman might get a thing you know what I mean like the leadership role and the gender I think that's all like the hierarchy thing like oh not to conspiratorial but I do think that go ahead go ahead go ahead do it's a part of the plan right it's divide and conquer right if if if if if black men can't get to the point where they can stand side by side with black women and they're being fed all of this stuff to to to make that divide further and further and further we're never going to be looking in the right direction and there are so many other versions of that there are so many other ways that we're being pitted against each other so that we all can't collectivize and look in the right direction I think there are so many other versions of that that that you know that pit poor people against each other that pit uh races against each other age groups against each other other um this there's a gender War you know that goes beyond black people obviously um even though those top names like uh fresh and fit and and uh and Andrew Tate and uh I mean they are black people but Ander Tate's fan base isn't primarily black I'll tell you that much you know what I'm saying um that the gender divide the gender divide has a has has a wider appeal and the and I mean the reason I think it works so well is because um there's a lot you know you you hear all the stuff being blamed on the patriarchy and then you take it personally as a man without recognizing that the patriarchy is also what's hurting you that not enough emphasis or uh right not enough emphasis is put on the idea that like look here's here's here's the patriarchy here's how it works and here's how it hurts you directly as a man this is why you should also not like this thing um instead yeah people get in their feelings and think everything is a personal attack on their manhood right I I think you know something I've been thinking about and I feel like Cam and Jan and your comments like made me um remember a comment I read from a a black thinker I can't remember she I think she deleted I went to go search for the Post um but she posted it like around the Obama time and I thought it was interesting because she talked about like how much energy and work like is being spent to Pander to black man this election and how that's like being called for right like J Sean's being that is being demanded like and so what Erna said earlier is this the idea that like if black if things can be done that help black people but if it's not marked black man it's not for the black man and I don't know really how to reconcile that if like you dismiss what isn't marked black man but you also if it's marked black man it's pandering um and which but but what she pointed out was the fact that ha is this election where you get like it's the first black woman president and it should be historical and you're not even allowed to Center that like we're not expected she's not expected to have a plan for black women nothing says black women on it no one has come up with any plan for black women you don't hear anybody talking about black maternal uh health care the fact that we're dying more in hospitals are any of the things like that really affect us in our real things happening but we are expected demanded everywhere black Outlet mainstream independent and I'm like I'm guilty of it too like reading what she said is like yeah I'm doing the same thing I feel a certain sense of Jesus why do people call me um I'm feeling a certain sense of having to like how can I I like I'm always trying to be extra sensitive and like thoughtful about how I talk to and about black men versus like not only am I not having to do the same for black women and I'm not expected to but I would be chewed out if I did like even down to how I conduct like when I was reading this and they talking about the indictment I was like [ __ ] that's not not true like I have like o friends I've done multiple like only black men and blah blah and I feel like I have to do that because the way is received that there's even you know what if I have four black women to two black men that is like black men are in the comments up and outrage I always do three black women three black men if it's not you know what I mean and then you'll have black men and then they'll say if that's not the black man that represents them if they're not black men that are like spewing a traditional kind of like toxic masculinity then they say those are not the black men so it's very like not only does it feel impossible but there is a level of like I'm like yeah there's an inherent misogyny and sexism and even how we're like dealing with this election and how we're like think about it like when is the black first black man is the first black man president y yada y like no one has ever expected no black women have never been centered you know and even still now so I'm just like the idea that's a great point because I just saw recently that was a post uh where it was Latino men and families she made one recently about that as well also you know before that black men and I'm just like no you're totally right there's an expectation that these minority men get centered and then I guess like oh if women are being centered is centered around like you know abortion rights and and things related to that and it's just almost like a throwaway but there is an emphasis on that because I think it's maybe there's an expectation or something like that where um there is that disconnect with black and Latino men that you have to convince them that you as a woman are going to help them because they like almost inherently believe that you're not going to I'm not saying all black men or all Latino men I'm not I'm not saying that but I think there is this thing where they think like oh I need to specifically Pander to them because they have told me that I need to Pander to them specifically to to get something what are you specifically doing for me and it it's debatable if the thing that you say actually is going to work or not uh whatever you might say you know it's a latent it's a latent thing with us where I think all minority males it's a latent thing where it's like if you censor women then you are the opposition uh I don't think I don't think kamla could censor women and win this election and I think kamla is very very aware of what she can and can't do to close out this final stretch of the of the election that's why she waffles on questions and interviews she cannot take a stance like that she will lose like she like she's very hyper aware of what each how each stance would affect her chances of of finishing this stretch without alienating a certain sect of the population she is a politician and she's a good one um and her team is aware of how these things usually go so there is no world where she's going to put up a flag and be like yeah I'm a black woman the only reason she's even mentioned it is because Trump is like she turned black all of a sudden uh she had no choice but to address it because he's being ridiculous but even if he wasn't yeah there is no world at least not yet at least not in America's current makeup where she could be like I'm a black woman these are the things that are important to black women we need to address this directly no she would prefer to go on call her daddy the white podcast and talk about Reproductive Rights to all women at once as opposed to prioritizing black women is that so that I'm glad that we got to that point because I think it it speaks to one political reality but also how unchanged that political reality in is a way that I think is going to upset us again like the way K set up a failure right because I remember when Obama was in office and I remember even my daddy like explaining to me why Obama has to do things more for like maybe the LGBT community but he can't do things for black people in the same way because it's perceived as this and this is the next thing right like I recall it and it's not untrue right like it's not untrue it wasn't untrue like it wasn't untrue and I also don't like by the way the way this idea that like Obama is explicitly a failure for the purposes of not like have having done things that benefited other marginalized communities is a very like selfish and anti Liberation type argument that is ridiculous to me like but anyway like that all all Obama critiques with standing um but like not for nothing in the same way that was the case in 2018 in 2008 2012 here we are with KLA knowing recognizing that she can't advocate for black women you know what I mean she can't advocate for black women we know that and she can't even do that and maintain like a certain amount of black support let alone other support so like that I think that like that really to me illuminates like a political reality that I think we struggle to like accept as progressives like the fact that America's elect America's populist and America like the American populations and America's voting public and stuff are not as Progressive as you would like and and like they're not they're they're absolutely not like I don't know what that means Shah you go I'm sorry I just like okay so one I will say I don't know exactly what Barack Obama did for the lgbtq community he came into office not even believing in same-sex marriage so that's one uh the Supreme Court like ruled for samesex marriage and that is like a white lgbtq issue so I'm not even GNA touch on that too much because I give about marriage when the majority of homeless youth are lgbtq black youth okay that's one uh but two I think this strange thing happens when there's uh an oppress oppressed identity intersecting with a privileged identity and this is the part where I'm I like have tried to find so many different ways to say this gently um no matter how gently I say it though it's still received the same way but I say this as someone I'm a queer black person like but still I'm a male like at the end of the day I acknowledge like that I have privilege because I am male in a patriarchal society um a lot of people who have an oppressed identity like being black and a privileged identity like being a man have a hard time like acknowledging the privileged part of their identity and that creates this victim complex that kicks into overdrive anytime someone that they hold privilege over gets any semblance of power um or equality before equality before them before it seems like it shouldn't be that hard all our oppressions are inter interwoven and interconnected it seems like it shouldn't be that hard to illustrate to some my main point I thought you were sorry go ahead go ahead oh I just think it's absurd it's because there be a delay Nicholas that we're that we're trying to explain um it should be simple to explain to somebody um that the idea that a black woman should have to minimize herself and a hold less space for a black man is absurd it's like that like the the fact that um that she's going to put her rights and her needs on the back burner so that I will feel more comfortable is ridiculous um that like we need to wait to ustr to people that that doesn't make any goddamn sense um like you were saying about privilege uh I I wish that because that argument about Barack Obama and not doing anything for black people that's going to happen all over again there going to be a whole other um nuanced argument that people aren't ready to have about kamla Harris and we just started kind of opening that can of worms right now um that's kind of why I was talking about we need a person uh who can meet us where we're at as black men because we need somebody to explain the absurdity to that to the average black man I think that's all I wanted to say yeah I I think you're right I was I forgot about this point I thought about it earlier when you talking about it I think an another issue like cuz y'all are right like in the in in the past like in the civil rights movement and stuff there were lots of leaders right but what I think is the difference uh today if you think of who the people were that were considered leaders and like they weren't just like the activists they're the writers they're the this you know what I mean they're all they're all the James Baldwin all of these all of those people like the variations the generation of who are those people in this present world exist but they exist in a world where in an entirely different landscape than existed then one where everybody is online where everyone is trying to have a platform and more importantly everybody is trying to tear down those platforms and it's like before you always had the infighting in the civil rights movement and all these people and people and them trying to critique each other and other people trying to do it but it TR didn't travel at the same rate that it can travel now you know what I mean like there's a certain way people spend their time actively trying to bring and other people within the movement on their side other black people spend all their time trying to cast out on everybody that is trying to be a thought leader or trying to do that work so I think it is much harder for black people black men to have a leader because who can they Trust when every single person like I'm sure all of us even it's just regular on a much lesser scale as thought leaders or whatever in our spaces can can show you the anti movement saying that we're we're Shields and we're the enemy and we're the op and blah blah blah blah blah like I could see it I could point to them right now I'm like I I see that so it's like I think that's the difficulty right like imagine if like imagine if MLK did I have a dream and was on Twitter by the thousands like look at this s ass and it's non viol you know what I mean Democratic over there Shilling right with this non [ __ ] of course they let him go be there with the March on Washington cuz white people like it that's how you know the establishment is fine with it you me that's what would be happening you're speaking on something that I think about all the time I talk to some of my friends about and this might sound crazy I don't know but sometimes I'm like the internet was a mistake the internet was a mistake social media was a mistake I get on social media and I immediately am like what the is this don't even get me started Twitter did the same thing I had my Twitter I I took some screenshots because I'm gonna make a video about how Elon has turned that into a racist a racist Wasteland but then I deleted my account because yeah to your point social media has not only created a rise of contrarians it's also created a rise of just the simple fact that you can monetize being being a contrarian now yeah so like uh and and and to be fair to be completely Fair it started with people monetizing being pro black in general like the blue checks when the blue checks started happening and the blue check black people on Twitter started having their rise in audiences and you I don't know if y'all noticed but there be it became a thing where people who constantly talk about civil rights were getting speaking engagements they were getting like endorsements on the side they were getting brand deals etc etc and once it becomes a business to be loudly Pro black then you have to go looking for things to complain about and that's when it started it started there and then the contrarians to those people they also rose up and now everybody who amasses a certain level of audience we've all amassed a certain level of audience has the ability to monetize their random thoughts and so I don't I think we're at the point of no return you know to J point there is no going back like we should just stop entertaining that notion altogether the technology does not go backwards so we reach the point where we're permanently in this space where no matter what you're doing no matter how much good you're doing there's a YouTuber that's looking in the way for you to mess up so they can make a video on you there's journalists like analyzing your background to see if they can do an expose before that YouTuber even gets to it we're permanently in a space where there are no leaders because all the leaders are just they have a mob around them waiting to monetize their failures thousand can I can I add can I get in my historical bag real quick and then shim I think you was about to make a point too about something that you say that make people angry I want to hear that um but I got to get in my history bag first um I think two one of the big differences is when MLK and all of them was doing their thing like TVs were just starting to become common in everybody's house so like the distractions work there people what were we doing for fun reading books like going outside you know what I'm saying double duts playing Jacks and dominoes and stuff like that having Face conversations actually having to sit down and read something and digest and and those conversations we have now publicly were kept inside you know one of the things that I feel like every content creator PR really anybody on social media should have is a group chat of people that you can dump stuff to you know like when you did when you when you frustrated about something or you might be about to make a post or you got a visceral reaction it's like say it there first like what y'all think about that you know oh bro no don't you know what I'm saying like like wait a couple days wait you know what I'm saying I mean because for real like when when I don't want to say specifically but like when when certain presidential people life's in danger and I was like oh I wanted to like really say some but I'm like no let me just let me just keep that in the group chat because that probably ain't good but like so so it's kind of like what y'all said about the difference between then I would always tell my students when I was a teacher like yo do y'all think y'all could really abstain from doing riding the bus for a year and so in a couple day like in a week or so like they did back then in carpool and do all this stuffold in a week they and they was passing out flyers hand to hand and people were showing up and we got this we got all of this and we struggle with that so I think to your your question Nicholas I think that the leaders honestly are in Pockets now I think every region probably has that and I think I don't think I think we're better off with that like one person we you as the person and even then MLK was not universally loved like we say he was um but even if that person gets elevated in our society today like y'all said we gonna tear him down oh he getting paid off he a shell he this he that and and I still clear of even elevating politicians to that because I think your your main focus is again maintaining the Empire and and not helping people so like I again I compartmentalize you're here I need you for this but I look at people in my community that doing the work and honestly I look at y'all as a leader too because I think that again not having like we do some of make a living off of this but we don't operate off of the same things as other people do um as somebody who's getting paid to of course they got to get their extra term and to my last point like I think Corey bush is an example of what it means to be a politician and really try to hold on to that morality and and and being for the people and they ran a whole campaign against her for another Democrat right quote unquote you know yeah yeah they were just talking about that on the last episode Leah Goodridge who's a big housing attorney in New York City was talking about like how like and I didn't even realizes and I'm in New York City plugged in but like Yousef Salam you know one of the exonerated five won a seat which I was really excited about what I didn't realize was that he replaced another like a a progressive who had been very much so working for the people in Harlem to like prevent these these affordable buildings that were not actually affordable or even like family places that people in Harlem could actually and so she gets pushed out by the Democrats and I even realize it because sometimes what they do is they they replace them with a black person you might like and you don't even if you're not plugged in you don't know and and and the thing is I think you're right right that like we are in pockets and sometimes I think even with that we don't have enough of us because what at least in particular roles I think we're in Pockets where we have we have black people in every single region doing amazing [ __ ] on the ground like organizers activists like lawyers and people doing amazing dope [ __ ] what is we don't have a lot of Messengers to the to the public to black the black community I wouldn't even say leaders but we don't have a lot of Messengers you're right trusted Messengers and we also don't have a a lot of people I think with that power trying to make more because something I realized like maybe four years ago I've said this a lot of times is my like kind of ethos for probably even why oay in friends with this is my mentor M Lord who's a black male lawyer said to me pointed it out to me in like 2020 when I first started app parent on media he was like you notice there are never a lot of black male progressives like in these spaces at all like he was like think about it there are not any and like because he pointed that out to me and he insisted it to me cuz I might not have noticed because I know a [ __ ] ton of black progressives in real life obviously and like people who I know I see doing the work like I can find a million like that I like have to go and find you know but when he said that and I like noticed over the four years like okay he's right I don't see many on the media and then I looked at even like Independent Media I noticed at first like oh [ __ ] I had to think about this like when I made the original list like how I even came to know about cam or n actually all people except for like shahem and I already followed each other Jan is my friend in real life but everyone else I found because I went in like ask like I went to FD one day like FD who are the black men that you think are doing dope content or whatever and stuff like you and are good voices that like we should know about more and he was like Cam and Nicholas and I was like okay cool right on my list and my boyfriend was like oh Ernest like love him like all every time and so that was how I knew but I recognized like if I had to think off the top of my Dome black women and black media people and thinkers like I had a million but I didn't have the same for black Progressive voices and so I think that's also something is like us having to make a conscious effort to be like we have to create an opportunity for there to be more messages of us that survive and like Point them out to people because there is a truth that even with the mediums that we have even though we have the benefit I think of living in a time where we could reach people more like faster like you said the the Black Panthers and them are whole passing out things by hand there getting people to show up at a thousands Community that's a different kind of thing and and much harder to do with the problem is we're still competing against algorithms that suppress polit political content which is anything our black asses have to say like we have algorithms that literally don't Rec recognize US unless we like put ourselves we literally manufacture like a pocket for us on YouTube in like cornbread to where it says okay chahe was on cam James was on on on o friends okay so oladyi like users were like that and cam James and then they start showing us to each other like that so I think there is like I do think it has to be incumbent on us in in these spaces to say like okay what is what is this I have to learn this on a more technical level and how do I expand and make more am because something I find very often when people come to me to like uplift things and I'm like I can't do what I do in for New York City everywhere like even if I could do it even if I weren't one person I'm not qualified to do it like I don't I can't like I I can't act like I know Chicago and and Baltimore and all these places the way that I know where I'm at you know what I mean and so I think it's like every time I'll ask people they'll come to me and I be like who's your me you know what I mean in your area and they're like there isn't one they have a lot of them doing the work you know what I mean doing all the real work bringing it to but as far as the messenger who's going to amplify it so I think that's what we have to like do more like try to find them cuz I don't think we're going to get a world like where we have a leader that everybody agrees on and doesn't trust like I don't even think we could get like a group of them we could get them to agree to you know what I mean like think about how the squad gets done you know I mean like like I don't even think we can get that so I think we have to like be like all right how do we create Messengers for like everywhere because I think if we had like a person like we had us everywhere you know what I mean with platforms I think we could do a lot better in counteracting a lot of these like misinformation and all this lack of political education that's getting to the Forefront if we had a smart version instead of the shade room if we had an anti like you know what I mean the opposite of that that at least exists like I'm not even saying the shade room has to go but like at least you know what I mean have another vehicle there I think we'd be in better shape than we are now I think looking at the incentives though um is probably the most crucial aspect here is what are the incentives in place that would even allow them to exist cuz there's more incentives on the monetization side the sponsorship side for misinformation for um Loosely researched content that just draws in a lot of Engagement which is the shade room in a nutshell um it's like how are we going to create those people um how are we going to elevate those people and give them a way to survive while doing so you know what I'm saying it's different of course it's different standards from the leaders we used to have how did MLK get by right he was a preacher and he I'm sure got you know Community funding to do a lot of the work he did on the ground but what what is that what is that model transferred to 2024 you need sponsorship deals you need a patreon you need you know that crowdfunding support but let's just think about YouTube let's think about how we all got to where we are in our various platforms you have to be giving people a level of certain level of entertainment right for them to decide to invest in to lift you up to fund your um your the good that you're doing outside of this platform and quite frankly a lot of this stuff is Bleak and not entertaining and if you don't have the the skills to pair with it to be like oh this is an entertaining show and I'm talking about some real [ __ ] then they will leave you they will leave you in the dust they will stop supporting you they will let you fall and move on to the next person that has a little bit more shiny of a presentation so I think that's the reality we're living in yeah and you know how do you conquer that I used to um I would get questions because like I started content creating when I was a teacher um primarily to fight for justice for myself and then it began the thing where it was for everybody else and kids would start to see my content I had a kid one time we had a black suit in Union and she asked me like how do I become an activist like you and I didn't even know how to respond to that I was like what do you mean like be it's not like a job you know what I'm saying like it's yeah like you you looking at it because you see me people might want to interview me because of this so they might want but it's not that's that just comes with it sometimes it's not what you're doing it for you know and I think there's like some people get taken back because they think so the perfect example of this cam too is like on Instagram when you create content they got rid of it now but you used to be able to categorize your content they didn't have one thing for Education it was like teaching methods we ain't even supposed to be in this space like they don't even want to categorize it it's just it was like a million things for animals and food right so it's like I mean one of the things I would tell people when they ask me it's like well become a teacher then that's what I did I can't speak to nothing else get a job get a job helping people and and like you can't you can't like start just creating content it's like yeah this is the thing but you don't have a lived experience to even speak from it means something real when you actually been doing something what whatever the job is in terms of like you you know you working for Amazon organizing like you know what I'm saying it got to be something and and I think again that goes back to to KLA something she even mentioned for black man is like we need to increase more of us in the classroom you know whether it be teaching or just like let's just volunteer to local school you know what I'm saying just just be there for the kids and I think for me a passion of mine too is like I I really feel a certain way about the way that we we uh recruit our young kids to be these to be athletes man we selling them a pipe dram you know we they are 300 something sponsor in the NBA you know like and and they picking 60 people a year 30 going to get cut within a couple years the other 30 from the first round cut that in half they probably ain't going to make it they're going to be overseas same thing with football we killing our kids brains selling them this dream of them being millionaires but again to your point the dangling carrot is I could be a millionaire with content creation like we we don't have people that are saying that kid right there could be the next fill in the blank a politician or somebody who stands up and I think that we have to be more intentional about me being a Grassroots person is what can we do with our local schools to say who are those kids who are on a debate team for example who are I did a black suit in Union y'all already know the demographics we had 30 kids how many was men how many was young menbe maybe three consistent on I think some of this stuff you got to try to make like cool again oh sorry oh I just think some there's some stuff you got to try and make cool culturally like uh one the thing I will give the democratics credit credit for is that this year you know they were a little more aggressive and just calling Republicans weird and I think that did kind of put out a vibe that like yeah they just do get into some weird [ __ ] they make everybody uncomfortable it made being a republican uncool y one thing that I've been thinking about a lot lately um in the 90s um you know when gangster rap was popping off and stuff there was a lot of um uh there was a lot of stuff in their RS that made stuff that I mean it didn't last but the stuff like wearing a condom having safe sex they would talk about it so much and they would do it in a way that made it sound cool like something that you wanted to do like if you weren't wearing a condom you were a loser um we just need we need that we need that that we need to return that attitude of the truth is cool knowing what the you're talking about is cool um being informed that's the way you want to move around in the world if you don't know what the is going on you're kind of whack I don't know I don't know how to do that I'm trying you know what else we did bro we made guess who guess what else we made cool up until 2015 Donald Trump y'all remember y remember our favorite rappers like he he just had money and they're still doing that and we still have mad black rappers like popping up like all the time doing it like that that's something I felt like because i' I've been on receiving and it is like having this argument with other black women like all election season and I think finally started to wear me down like At first like last year I was very like okay this argument is like unreasonable this attack on black men y y yeah black men vot Democrat yeah XYZ but I'm like I would and I and I know that they intentionally highlight these people more but I was like godamn I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a [ __ ] like I feel like every time I see a black person come out every other [ __ ] day they are especially like these Lord Jamar these blackmail rappers they're saying crazy [ __ ] and like yeah we dismiss it so much because we want to keep them and we want to like downplay the impact but I'm like I don't know why we keep acting like every like all our like black male rappers and people that we love in the community and we act like a leaders coming out and spewing this ignorant [ __ ] has no impact and I think the worst shittiest part about it is like you're right that it's a lack of like they're not informed they don't know what they're talking about like if you look at a lord Jamar L Jamar has been going on he didn't just go on Godfrey's podcast viewing a bunch of stupid [ __ ] um about the election the world he's a flat Earth all kind of nut [ __ ] he went on Paris Morgan and he did the same thing but if you look it up Lord Jamar don't vote and like people might think of that as a reason why you should dismiss him but it's also it's also a thing that should upset you like these people who do not vote who are who have never voted who are like not engaged they don't know about this process but they jump up to tell you like you shouldn't vote for KLA I hate her he's calling KLA a [ __ ] and then it and then it makes you sit down like an Obama and be like why what is the what what's the why why a person who has never voted who is not politically engaged just jumping up to [ __ ] on kamla and say oh don't vote don't for don't vote for and I think that's my my frustrating part is not that like black men feel that like oh the people haven't done for them and the Democrats it's like when you ask a lot of the people who are saying that the specific one saying that tell me more what didn't they do for you what did you want them and they've got nothing they don't know nothing about what has happened and I think that's something that is blowing me no real talk like bro who called me a democratic chill the other day and I just I I just sometimes I I don't like to feed into but sometimes you make time for CU it was 99% comment was good I'm like this dude said what so I said I said I said what's the Shi bro he said people who Pander to the and I clicked on this page dude from from Nashville so I say bro you understand that a Democrat LBJ you know I a give him too much credit I mean dror King and them was forcing it but he signed something that desegregated nationally like your city for example but I mean I'm not even H the they may make made some mistakes and all that get it but like how are you this like it's just it's just these empty names that don't even mean anything bro like what does it mean to be a we talk in common sense bro like a lot of these people parting these things they might not even be impacted directly you good economically but a lot of it could be we like some of us might be vedi our grandparents our parents the people on the street our kids that makes me think like if my boyfriend is not on a workall he has to tell yall a story he be dying to tell everybody the other day my boyfriend went to go um let me hold on hold on CJ I need you to come tell the slavery story oh not the SL sound y need to hear like I'm telling you I'm having some crazy conversations with like black man I know offshoot in real life like not my black like like closest friends like J Sean and I are like this is nuts but I'd be lying if I said I don't see the rise in this like rhetoric like I'm I'm actually interested to see what the how black men vote this election because honestly the way it's been given I was like this might this seems like we might be at the point where the problem is real you know what I mean like I was like you know when like I was like okay the the supporter has been dropping off every other election we do see you know I I think it's still negligible to everybody else we do see more black men going over the right and stuff like that but I'm like I'm not gonna hold you I'm 31 years old I I've never seen this amount of like black men out here on just rightwing propaganda and I'm like and I understand I'm not confused as to where it happened it happened because people don't look at all these like man is fair all the shade room they don't see those things political but they are because to what Cam said earlier people don't just receive politics from us or education from us we have to make it entertainment it's like like there's so much about like everybody wants to receive their [ __ ] as entertainment they don't want to receive it as traditional politics like if you even go look like whenever I'm making an aurina production I'm getting this research it's all readily available all the reporters have made it visible the videos are there you can see these politicians saying it has barely any views no one's reading it no one's engaging they only like receive what you give to them in this entertainment world so like what people are getting all Year from all this Trad wife content on Tik Tok from all this like all these people that they're consuming is right-wing thought process right-wing ideology it's not being expressed to them as though it's political because that's how you get them to digest it so it's not confusing to me that for the last four years I've seen this massive burst in all those figures online and those kinds of uh internet spaces and now we have a bunch of black people who watch that [ __ ] saying right-wing [ __ ] that they like would said and it's very hard to like tackle something in the middle of election season that has gone unaddressed for what it is you know what I mean in the last however many years but I think [ __ ] is I think I think we might like I I I'm like I don't know I don't know if it's going to be this election where I have to say I have to stop saying that the black male Republican is a negligible like myth that they're running on with but I'm like I've been having some crazy convos there's there's there's two things I know we are not going to go throughout this conversation without talking about that whole uh KLA if she wants to do something for me you know what she need to do she need to do child support forgiveness see that I heard about it but I didn't I didn't see it I just kind of ran from my phone see that heard saw and I kept seeing it and I'm like I cannot believe this and I'm like it's we talked about it Olay we talked about how that's directly related to that damn Boondock episode that that booty warrior episode when they was in prison and they were all talking about oh you you want to tell the story or I can slavery story yes first off hello everybody of all y'all Mr man it's absolute pleasure I'm glad to see you here appreciate you bro thank you here love content I love y'all too um quick story I went to my 10-year High School reunion back in Raleigh North Carolina just to give youall some commentary where just it's somewhere that matters you feel me so Raleigh North Carolina see a guy that I played football with I told Jan it's always my old football teammates I'm seeing the correlation of where this goes um and so um see him see him we go to dinner like let's link up go to dinner let's chat up Talk Back reconnect whole dinner goes fine it's the last 10 minutes I didn't know it was the last 10 minutes because it wasn't until said to myself it's going to be the last I gotta get out of here got get out um I talked to I talked to dud a little also context I knew that he had a criminal um he had some criminal past in between the time we had disconnected okay and so did some time and got out now he's in the trucking business cool he we talk about how on the Comm on the commercial we were watching college football but uh Kamala ad up so then we get to that's just how we end up getting the chat in and I was talking about immigration and my girlfriend about how things are this so that's how we just got into it speaking to him I said I don't know if you're voting or not at the time because I didn't know that at the time but it was I don't know if you're voting or not but hey I am not telling you to lean one way or another but hey I want to let it be known that one side for sure cuz I think he said like I don't get too much into it uh both sides be such and such and I said okay brother I got you one side for surely I know is against us and I can tell you on a number of different places on how they're against us I once started with then he told me about his CRI criminal past I said hey anything about helping CRI helping um reformed convicts reforming incar incarcerated people after they get out of jail to like get any type of program to get back into civilization is I promise you is a democratic policy more times than not a republican to not put that forward he then tells me he said hey by the way I did get um a program funded to get my Trucking license thing I said I exactly so you won percent had benefited from policies he was like okay I don't know I'm like okay all right I got you brother I got I got a two plus two I got you listen I can tell you right now for sure one side is telling us that they don't want any criminal um critical race theory in any of our classrooms they want to band any um history of our people and of learning about slavery and stuff like that right there he goes are we sure slavery happened the way they said it did oh boy I said I like face a black man a black man that here I said hold on yet who is they who is I said you know what no it's absolutely it actually is worse than what they tell us because they're trying to hide it from us and we learn something new every day I learned something new about slay me every day and he was like uh I said okay all right all right all right all right I see I see I've yeah so I just wanted to tell you this is happening in real life where the slave ships is what I hear what I had a three hour argument with another guy we know in North Carolina three hours of him explaining me how he just don't trust K High School by the way just different years of age of people no just don't trust Kamala but he like Donald Trump I'm having these conversations in real life and I never had them before so I'm like I can't act like there's another rise it's made its way to my real life y y'all are bringing up great points and I don't know like y'all obviously haven't met me before a lot of y'all um like I'm an archaeologist in in real life you know I'm an archaeologist in real life and I've actually and I'm one of the very few black archaeologist you probably ever met black before yeah I've gotten literal arguments I've gotten to many arguments with other black people people about this exact topic and I've had black people tell me I'm no longer black I'm not black and then they have literally sent me videos of a random white man talking at a bar who is not an academic none of those things trying to prove their point so I'm like wait wait wait wait wait I'm not black but you listening to this white man because he telling you the truth because he telling you what you want to hear okay y'all really y'all really interesting okay y'all really interesting and and that's crazy to me that's crazy to me I I be having to tell people like okay you might be indigenous but I'm I'm my people from Africa because like people will get like well no everybody everybody a I don't because I don't have time to try to debate like I'm just I'm just like well for me I just know me like I don't know about you but I'm AF the same level of uh understanding all the time Shah I said I understand why Harry Tubman carried the gun that this point real can you imagine can you imagine like no yes I think about it all the time like so you want to be free you know I find frustrating and and I like and I get out what happened but but I get a lot in my comments from everybody but I care when I get it from black people right white people do it too but I care when I get it from Black Folk of like you explain something you make these videos we do what we all do it make this content you explain a Nuance thing you break it down and then people are like yeah but like this is still how like people feel and we feel this way and black men feel this way and I'm like at what point do your feelings not prioritize real people's life like that's what I like what like reality and that's the part I'm trying to figure out like when am I supposed to deprioritize your feelings to the facts that's the issue with uh that's my that's been my issue for years now and I would say that it's just just Republicans that do the feelings thing but it's Democrats too it it was something I observed in Obama's campaign uh Clinton's campaign even it's like I don't even know when it started but I think it's easier to get on a large platform and broadcast oh you feel this way this is terrible um but I think it's reached a different Crescendo with uh Trump I think Trump has mastered the art of blasting out so many lies like Lies per second record has got to be his like just lies lies lies right right to the point where you have to swim through them and you can't fact check fast enough because they keep coming at you but like he's mastered the fact of like oh I'm not going to cite anything ever I'm not going to quote anybody ever I'm just going to say oh I heard and if it's not true then you know maybe it's true I don't even know like he'll be confronted about something he lied directly to your face about and be like oh well you know I don't know if true but you know maybe it is I heard this I saw this on TV and about the geese yeah what about the he recently did that exact thing in the interview yeah about about the geese and the Haitians and but once you get to the point where where once you get to that point there is no coming back from it and so like that was honestly one of the impetuses for my entire channel was like oh okay so everybody's just going to blast disinformation out there okay well I'm going to site my sources like a journalist in every video and and you know leave leave behind this atmosphere where we're just going to be arguing about oh my opinion is this my homie said this my cousin said this who gives a [ __ ] this is that all that [ __ ] is not true like here's what peer-reviewed Studies have shown here's what professional journalists have dug up here's what scientists are saying now they may not be entirely correct they might not be entirely correct like there there's flaws in their in their way of thinking and all that too but let's at least start from a basis of relative fact and argue from that standpoint as opposed to how we feel in general because that can go all directions right you know what I'm saying shahe I am so sorry but I have like cited so many sources I'm a therapist so I talk about health a whole lot yeah don't get me started on my my war with pop psychology I can site every Source in the book A lot of people just do not give a [ __ ] about that these days I have to be honest 100% yeah I think we kind of all hinted at like the the way that the internet and social media has elevated like everybody's voice um and stupid I hate to say it like this but stupidity can be Amplified to and there's nothing more scary than a bunch of stupid people agreeing with each other about some stuff like I've literally seen that that's 100% I recently seen a video it was a AI ass video about uh supposedly Tim Wall's uh student who they're trying to say was sexually assaulted by him it was so obviously AI y'all it looked like the fakest [ __ ] I didn't ever seen and under the comments talking about oh my God I can't believe this and I'm sitting here like are we looking at the same thing I I literally War at this point bro a war against disinformation like and it's like I know that you know I'm not I'm just one small pocket of you but I think I think every single person matters in this fight um I think if we lose this war there there there is no there is no going back the only way somebody like Trump can win an election in the first place is because there is no factchecking if if in a world where we actually laid out everything he said and pointed it out in real time to everybody every time he spoke this would be a completely different conversation because they'd have to be they would be forced in real time not after the fact not an article not a correction that comes after the broadcast they be have they'll have to force it Force to face it in real time like oh he just lied to my face oh he just did it again oh he did it again like it would it would take everything takes repetition I come from the advertising world you have to see an ad seven eight times before you even like oh maybe I'll buy that so we need to see that he's lying over and over and over but once you cross the line where everybody's like cool all politicians lie it's a normal thing why do we even have debates anymore did y'all watch the last last Deb yes why do we even do this [ __ ] anymore there's nobody factchecking there's nobody even talking about policies anymore what the [ __ ] are we doing like you absolutely I think Donald Trump uh lowered the bar Donald Trump lowered the bar yeah um also it doesn't exist yeah like I I worry about what you're saying because I I think that the information I think the information War I think that's lost like I this this technology is only going to get better I think there's eventually there going to be a brief window of time when people remember when you could prove something but that was you know there's going to be before then and after then that's that's going to be yeah I'm afraid of what's coming I will say I don't think I don't I think proving things is GNA fly out the window he's an amalgamation to me of just like of everybody like mostly white insecurity you know and Fe feeding into that we're being replaced we're losing this especially after Obama and there's just this feeling of like they're losing things and for those of us who are going over there there's a feeling of We aren't able to to provide or we aren't able to be what we view as a man in this society and one of the things that I don't think we touch on a lot too get in my history bag real quick is like the like the de-industrialization of our society where it's like where I live now I live outside of Chicago about 45 minutes away and caterpillar was really big out here and a lot of black folks came to this town called Julet for those those good factory jobs they was able to make a lot of money provide for their family get a pension all of that but by the end of the 70s those jobs are gone those jobs are being you know overseas and you have Reagan and then you got the war on drugs and like the complete decimation of I don't even think we fully comprehended we talk about slavery and we should Jim Crow we should but y'all the the 80s the the early like that was a wild time that just tore apart everything the fabric of our communities so a lot of those jobs being gone and then in school system we operate off of sedentary so we're going from you know helping kids get into trades to a sedentary style where it's just you sitting down for seven eight hours a day school of prison pipeline right like we have a a a a group of young black men who don't have any advocates in their imedia Community outside of maybe the coach who's screaming at them you know what I'm saying to to hit somebody or whatever but like you don't see a black man in the class maybe or you you get up cuz you can't sit still you being ridiculed you you getting ISS you're being thrown out of school so then you're looking for somebody to affirm who you are and lo and behold you gonna find this guy on the blog just saying stuff that sounds good because he can communicate and then you got this politician who is like the white embodiment of the rap like capitalist archetype that we've seen throughout our life and I feel like all of that combined is is is Trump and where we are now in short you know and you know what scary I think I think my last thing I want to say is like everybody want to be Devil's Advocate like everybody always want to play Devil's Advocate but nobody wants to critique the devil because what I realize is like I swear to you like people will they will eat up you criticizing criticism for a progressive criticism for a Democrat criticism for a leftist criticism for anybody on your side they the minute you w to like do the fact checking you want to explain to do the work or like on on the right the real they they will not watch I it it honestly blows my mind like I when I go I to like other content creators like stuff just to confirm I'm not the only one experiencing this foolishness like I've seen like I watch medy do like a 10minute like thorough breakdown and explain in this election and it was just people in the comments like I'm not going to watch this because they know they know they don't even want to they do not want to DARE hair fact because God forbid they internalize some facts that dispels the [ __ ] that they want to be screaming about like I know it all the time any time somebody asks me to make a video that's like sensible and productive and like oh let's address something that's happening real time I'm like ain't nobody watch it I can make it nobody watch it like I made a video with my issues with like like same kind of I made my videos with my issues with KLA or whatever 84,000 views even a second one 50,000 views I made one like a whole X breaking down project 2025 and the issues with Donald Trump and on the Supreme Court like real like way more factual information research what 30,000 views and not watching that [ __ ] like then they then they cussing they'll be no comments you'll get all the flak and all the negativity and all the this like for even doing the thing that they won't even watch they won't even like internalize it so like that's the thing that's that's really hard to beat like because not only is everything set up to like make sure you're messenging doesn't get out and that you can't fact check propaganda and that but the the populace ain't working with you either to get it out like you know what I mean because so many is like you know it's like how the LIE travels faster than the truth people enjoy the lie like they enjoy it all and because it's all entertainment like they like the outrage of it they don't see the you know what I mean they think people like us are just you you you're doing too much you're too upset you're making a big deal everything and because they don't see like how a lot of these other things are political too they just see us as like nuisances you know what I mean people are just complaining and nitpicking and Y yada Y and they won't sit down to let you thread it all together to explain how it's related yeah no you're talking about the hate you talking about the comments the the push back uh is is brutal my most recent video I actually went to DC I was talking to politicians there were there were house Democrats and and house senators are coming up in the next one and it was like I think I think even the closer you get to actually giving them truth from The Source from a cited Source or from the actual people who make these laws they're pissed off that you even had the nerve to do it like they're just like they're like you like and I'm like look I'm just bringing you all the information who else is giving you this like you know what I'm saying like there's a few people on YouTube that are trying to give you firsthand information from people who can actually change things and I'm not even saying you have to support these people or vote for them but at least listen to what they have to say you know what I'm saying like and they're so focused on whether you're a shill or not that they're not taking the information and whatsoever it it is it is like deflating at times like I was I was talking to my girlfriend and I was like look I it's one of the first times since I started this and I've had some rough videos but it's the first time where I was like I don't know how long I want to do YouTube you know what I'm saying like when you're pushing that hard against um that much resistance and that much like willful stupidity that's tough like that's really tough cuz you think you're fighting a good fight and then you're like I maybe I can't win this yeah May to win this I I totally understand and and I come from a little bit of different perspective because I don't make content but I I am a union organizer uh out here you know and um one of the hardest things is like just organizing in general talking to people trying to convince them to even participate uh like you know being in a union that's difficult you know people think of themselves as individuals not as a collective so when you do Collective action people do still see themselves as separate so what often happens is like the union did this they did this I'm like did you participate did you vote did you go out to the picket did you do the thing we asked you to do to see the structure test where we're at to reach a critical mass to do a particular uh Collective action did you do any you didn't do any of that nobody's going to come save you yeah nobody is going to come save you we we have to do this as a collective and it is really really difficult to even convince people of that simple thing and I'm this is not just exclusive to uh to unions and stuff like that like I just recently canvased uh in Arizona to you know potentially um uh unionize a battery plant that they're putting out there and stuff like that all these different things for the community and whatnot a lot of people are detached the the the type of or sense of community doesn't exist in the way that it used to exist everybody is so individualistic and if you not helping them immediately or with the exact thing that they want you I have people literally telling me that they were just like you never did anything for uh for me blah blah blah blah blah Did you anything for yourself you know you're having these issues do you want to make those things and situations better these are questions that you have to ask and I think that is something that we struggle with in all of this conversation that we're having whether it's with black men black people or whatever our sense of community seems to be dwindling especially I think since the pandemic and whatnot everything being you know remote or V virtual and stuff like that uh there's just like a a lack of community that I think we used to have even compared to when I was a child you know like it it's like in infecting Black Men especially I think you know it's just like I'm a get mine you I'm G get mine yeah yeah I think black people have always been in a in a vulnerable place as a minority just because we and like after the pandemic like you were saying and all that stuff the the erosion of collectivism I think it's hit us especially hard because our identity is so politicized right like um juneth is not seen the same way as like um St Patrick's Day that we are not we don't just get to take pride in something and eat some tacos or whatever like we um everything everything comes with side eye uh when you're black and and part of that narrative is that the Civil Rights Movement our collectivism happened all already it happened a long time ago and it's over um and yeah we see you know upright I mean 2020 we saw a huge we saw a huge movement but you also I don't know it seems like those things um those things get stamped out as soon as they rise up now it's like um as soon as uh now now that now like um corporations are ready for those things they're ready to incept those things and like red disseminate them as a as a product uh so they can't function the same way right right I think we uh really um like there's this thing I think we do in politics I don't have the term for it but we relinquish our power and our our ability to advocate for ourselves to people that we don't even know especially president to one person and I think that speaks to the bigger issues because we expect Obama to to to solve all the issues we expect bid we expect kamla you know just to like maybe it's because we're taught from a western frame work and we're talk about all they Kings and stuff and we just assume that translated even though they revolted against that we just assume that's what it is but it's like you also got to have Congressional support and it's like I I've been trying to rephrase it too when I tell people like well Comm like you're voting for a team the cabinets you put in like the the judges like when I was becoming an educator y'all social SC I was even I wasn't even taught all this I wouldn't taught about all the different layers to how many judges I was taught teach about the nine justices teach about the 400 you know and that's pretty and I think that speaks to the miseducation we all have with and again the adolat Tre in America we talk like when we learn about black issues we learn about give yall the five uh Frederick Douglas Harriet Tubman Rosa Parks Dr King and Malcolm X we never for one what about 1865 to 1955 like what what happened idb Wells we learn about you know what I'm saying barely the Harlem rinda signs but we don't talk about the people that surrounded those folks Joanne Robinson with the Montgomery Bus Boycott and I try I always tried as best I could to let people know like there are there were people in every Community organized when Dr King went there he had to tap in with them it wasn't just one thing but America would exalt the one person so we would have to say well if that one person ain't doing it then it's they fault and I don't have to do anything no K ain't gonna solve your problems we just hope that she makes it easy of us to organize that's it that's yeah feel this pressure I I want the LBJ I want the FDR I want the Lincoln like feel this pressure that we going to bring yo as an IM especially like when I say like for me it's so it's so like there's nothing theoretical when I say make it like it is about making it easier to organize and to Advocate because Donald Trump like I don't I'm an immigrant like what immigrant like I'm an immigrant by status not like my parents are immigrants like I'm the Immigrant that came to America still an immigrant not a US citizen so I feel things differently see things differently I get a different angle right and during during Trump's Administration like I've talked about it multiple times about my Visa denial and stuff everybody knows like Trump tried to throw me out of here so that's that but beyond that Donald Trump had us fill out our forms like all of a sudden immigrants were obligated to turn over our social media there was a reason for that like oh we have to tell them what our social media accounts are because now they're going to check our social media and they're going you're G to be punished for that they could get you out of here so like it's real life like I can't Advocate the way and talk and do the things and say the things that you want like I always tell people there's a reason why you don't hear like I always say Americans talk about immigration they talk about immigrants all day long and Americans do not understand they don't know the first thing about their immigration system they don't know [ __ ] they literally don't know [ __ ] it's just constant just miss even from like the lawyers the journalists on TV they don't know anything about anything and I always say the people will be like oh why don't you like go and talk about immigration why don't you Advocate around immigrant like immigration why other immigrants aren't Advocate I'm like because immigrants are not in the position to tell our stories immigrants are not not in the position to be advocate for ourselves as as not citizens in the country and by the time an immigrant can they've been thrown out their back they're whatever you know so it's like that is a that is a very real thing that people don't take into consideration I'm like beyond the fact that there's no Republicans is a stone wall there is no there's no shaming Republicans there's no pushing Republicans there's no musling Republicans there's no condoling Republicans Republicans look at your hatred for them as an endorsement I was literally in Ronda sanz's campaign ad four times for calling in the devil he was like he was like raving endorsement this black woman says I am Satan vote for me like that's that's how they're thinking you know what I mean just like they're not they're not comfortable like whether or not you think like it's not about liking KLA or liking the Democrats is anything genuine but I do know that the Democrats can just for no other reason than they have to they have this as a part of their voter base they have to listen to somebody but they might not listen to everybody and they might not listen to everybody on everything but they got to listen to some people Republicans are not only not doing what we want they are listening to us so that they could do everything we don't want they listen to us intently so that they could be against and organize against us so trying to own the libs trying to own the libs and the problem is not only are they trying to own the libs but the laugh is trying to help them too trying to help them own like all in the LA too and I'm just like you know that's you know that's us too right boo look to what they did I was going through project 2025 and even the whole even the even summary on the on their website of project 2025 they put woke propaganda like and it's actually in the document like they they've used woke in official documents now and not only have they ruined that term it doesn't mean what they say it means of course but they've actually used it as a badge of Pride to fight against and Crush what they consider woke and in their eyes it's just black people in uh lgbtqia community and just everybody else that doesn't fit within their Paradigm which is right I've I've heard black people use their definition of woke and it made me want to jump off a [ __ ] Cliff yes right like I think it's one ad that the word is it's one thing to ad word believe you just did you don't even know what you just did maybe yeah it's one thing to admit that the word is like over with but to internalize it and start using it like I don't that that that and even when when somebody does that because it's part of the Lexicon right like that's just how people talk now but when some when a black person does that I like I check them still I'm like don't please don't play into that please don't talk like that I don't know them anymore if a black person does that to me I like know that this is not the kind and I swear I can't speak to them like we're not going to get along and they need peace in their life just like I do there's no point all right because I'm like that's too far gone like it it reminds me like my great aunt would like be like anytime I come around my great an is like and my niece is like oh here she go with this Blacky black stuff all the time you know what I like and I would prefer that I'm like no they really treat me like I come around in a whole T hat like they don't they don't like hearing it they just don't like hearing it you realize quickly when you're like when you are like the actual definition the woke you notice even your family is like I don't want to you know how crazy it is to be labeled Pro black by black people like right it's like what does that mean for you what are you an yes and it's and it's really real and you know and you not only know when you're that person you know all the other people that are that too like Jan and I got to call each other cuz the rest of our friends don't want to hear this [ __ ] exactly that's real that's 100% real that's 100% real oh this has been amazing y'all thank you for this amazing episode [Music] [Music] w
