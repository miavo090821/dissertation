ladies and gentlemen boys and girls children all ages i sean fitzgerald here at the actual justice warrior i'm so proud to announce to you guys that jesse small that former empire actor has now been officially convicted found guilty on five of six counts or six of six counts i should have looked it up into it before i did this video but who cares for orchestrating the subway sandwich fiasco hate crime against himself and i am so happy that he is done i will never be the man that this did not happen to i am forever changed turns out you will always be the person that this did not happen to jesse but before we get into all the news all the stuff the potential sentences that jesse smallett may end up facing we've got something golden and noble noble go transition not even gonna try to play it off because we got so much to talk about right now something is just not adding up in the economy stocks are at all time highs but the government just borrowed five trillion dollars we're being told that inflation is just transitory but it just went up 6.8 percent this isn't making any sense people how much did your wages go up during this transitory time and compare that to the transitory nature of gas prices and electricity prices and you'll know that something's going on and the best way to hedge against this is to put some of your money in precious metals right now if you call noble gold investments and open up a precious metals ira you can get this amazing gift and america the beautiful five ounce silver coin it's really cool it's a giant quarter i like it i promote it on the pass i keep it near me at all times because i think it's awesome and you can get one of them and talk to a specialist if you go to nobleworldinvestments.com using my affiliate link ping comment and top of the description or you call them at 877-646-5347 again that's four 877-646-5347 on january 29th 2019 we received the third in a single month hate crime hoax that was perpetuated on trump and his supporters and this one was perpetuated by justice smallett now if you don't remember if you don't recall even though i've covered it multiple different times on this channel jesse smallett alleged that during a polar vortex at around two in the morning he decided to go out and get himself a subway sandwich you know it's two o'clock in the morning you're going to subway subscribers open 24 hours like people kill me when they say things like that because it's like subway is open 24 hours for a reason so that when you hungry at night and you ain't got no food you go to subway and by the way kudos to subway for involving themselves in this story this is the best crime related story subway has ever been involved with and if you want to know about the other one just look into the guy that used to be famous for losing weight on the subway it's not very good but that is neither here nor there or as the professionals like to say and i've waited to say throughout this entire case that is neither yah nor nyah what we're here to talk about today is that apparently jesse was attacked by evil white racist evil white racist trump supporters that were both evil white and racist and trump supporters and homophobic and they didn't like justice smallett's character arc on empire because when they went up to attack mr jesse smallhead at two in the morning during this polar vortex with bleach and a noose that they had prepared for this racist sexist homophobic erotic attack on him they yelled out i could only go off of their words i mean who says empire this maga country ties a noose around your neck and pours bleach on you empire and as i like to say because we gotta clean it up for this show friendly neighbor this is mega country and then they proceeded to clobber jesse smallett according to his story now jesse is not weak and he wants you to know that as a gay man he ain't not weak know how you know there's a level of pride there we live in a society where as a gay man you are considered somehow to be weak and i'm not weak i'm not weak and we are as a people are not weak i want them to see that i fought back and i want a little gay boy who might watch this to see that i fall back and it does not take anything away from people that are not able to do that but i fought back they ran off i didn't not only that jesse fought back and they ran off those evil white racist trump supporters who were both evil white racist homophobic and trump supporters and carried a bleach and carried a noose and also at the same time did not like jesse smallett's role on empire at the moment because they mentioned his tv show where the weak ones they ran away they ran off they got scared they wussed out and that's the long and short of it but it turns out that these evil white racist trump supporters were actually two nigerians and instead of people who hated jesse smallett it turns out these were his close friends that he had actually hired to do you know keep him in training personal training work yeah that's the phrase that i'm looking for so this left things a little bit awkward when jesse clearly described white slash pale skin to the police when referring to this instance because obviously these two dudes unlikely to have white skin did you get any kind of description of the attack i gave a body description and i you know because i saw this but and you know right here or whatever oh you said that it was a white guy what happened it feels like if i had said it was a muslim or a mexican or someone black i feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more a lot more oh you said that it was a white guy what happened and that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now the fact that we have these fear mongols these people that are trying to separate us and it's just not okay oh you said there was a white guy what happened yes anna they did say it was a white guy what did happen is the question or was the question on all of our minds but the thing is is that they had an explanation for this and i love this clip and that's why i play this in almost every single jessie small live video of his lawyer saying maybe they were wearing white face underneath the ski mask according to the court records he smelled that was very clear with police on the night of the attack that his attackers were white he said they had masks on and gloves but he saw their eyes that he saw the skin surrounding their eyes was that a false statement so he just to be clear he only saw one of the attackers one of them he didn't see he saw one through a ski mask again he could not see their body everything was covered and he had a full ski mask on except the area around the eyes he did tell police that he from what he saw he thought it was pale skin or white or pale skin was i think what he said and that was what he and that's why he initially did have a hard time um why did he say that he could have said i don't know he could have but this again he's the ocean what are the chances that that's the case that he saw somebody with light skin well you know i mean i think there's obviously you can disguise that you could put makeup on there is actually interestingly enough a video you know i think police did minimal investigation in this case it was it took me all of five minutes to google you know i was looking up the brothers and one of the first videos that showed up actually was one of the brothers in white face doing a joker monologue with white makeup on and so it's not it's not that it impossible a white guy what happened this was the hoax it was ridiculous it was obvious on its face trump people don't call out intersectional identity groups this is how people on the left think also jesse including his empire show his role on the show was a dead giveaway that this attack was not likely to have happened because that would lead you to believe that the perpetrators were attacking him personally but also for him being black and also for him being gay but that would have meant they would have been waiting around for him to return from new york even though his flight was delayed for four hours none of this made sense it did not add up crossing the intersection i heard empire and i don't answer to empire on the empire and it just goes to show you the power that ego will have when you're constructing a narrative about yourself had jesse just let go of the empire thing had he just made it seem like it was possible for people to attack him on the street to not know who he is in the specific show that he works on he might have actually been able to get away with it it might have made it more believable on initial reaction and maybe just maybe he would have got away with it but he couldn't let it go he had to include that they knew who he was because he's jesse smallett he's not just a regular gay in the gay district of chicago he is a famous gay and he needs to be attacked for being famous and for being gay and for being black and for going really really hard at 45. why do you think you were targeted i can just assume i mean i come really really hard against 45 i come really really hard against his administration and i don't hold my tongue also if you don't believe jesse if you didn't think that his story was true if you made fun of him by calling him juicy sommelier or as chris rock said calling him jesse because the eu is respect and he lost all that that makes you an evil fear mongrel that doesn't believe him because he didn't say with somebody black or somebody muslim and that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now the fact that we have these fear mongols fear mongrels now look the reason i'm having so much fun with this story is because it is in fact such a joke in fact the jury deliberated for nine hours to determine whether or not jesse was guilty and i can only imagine that 8 hours and 45 minutes of it was them laughing at the case so much before they could start deliberations and then 10 minutes of it was them going to the bathroom 5 minutes of it was them finding him guilty and then walking back to the courtroom and reading the verdict that's how obvious his guilt was from the jump related to this case however jesse did a strange thing he actually took the stand in his own defense which was crazy considering he is obviously guilty and obviously has not been telling the truth throughout this whole process and this is where the real story is now we covered jessie smallett's own attorney melting down crying and leaving the courtroom with her mother i've obviously made fun of that clip of jesse's attorney on tv talking about white face underneath the ski mask in order to full jesse into thinking that trump supporters were attacking him but jesse's testimony just shows you how little character this man actually has because you know what jesse tried to do in order to defend himself from this case because obviously the facts are stacked against him obviously beyond a reasonable doubt jesse smallett was in fact guilty of orchestrating this hate hoax jesse actually tried to play the gay panic card which just goes to show you the level of character that this man actually has he talked about non-stop on the stand how he was doing drugs and hooking up with one of these nigerian brothers now you might think this is a little bit odd this is a little bit unusual why was he talking about this so much on the stand when he was testifying and that is because this is actually something called a gay panic strategy let me give you a perfect example of this so you can understand what jesse was doing and why it was so nasty especially for somebody who considers himself an advocate of the lgbtq double x i i z j k x x 4 27 community so a couple years back there was a guy and his name was not sean and he used to date a girl named danielle and danielle used to have a brother named damian that was supposed to be bestest friends with this guy sean however damien and danielle were keeping a secret from this guy not sean i said sean earlier but it's totally not sean and that secret was danielle was cheating on not sean with somebody that will call tommy and this made not sean really angry this made not sean really really upset so not sean planned a homicide against all the parties involved in order to punish them for their sins of wronging me personally now this was a little bit you know fantasyland and all that because eventually when he processed everything through his mind he realized that there was no way to get around getting caught for this homicide but then it dawned on him he should stage it as a double murder suicide and the way that he would prevent the cops from looking into it too much was to actually have damien be the perpetrator and have this happen because damien was hooking up with tommy and he was mad at his sister for keeping his true love in the closet so not sean decided to take out his weapon of sorts which we won't describe because of legal reasons fifth amendment privilege make damien write out a note detailing all these things and then executed the triple murder but set it up like a double murder and a suicide and this is how not sean is a successful youtuber on this platform today because the disgust factor is real and when people hear this crazy mixed up homosexual relationship cheating no process thing it makes them not want to look too closely and the reason this worked for not sean is the same reason that jesse tried to use it on the stand he was trying to use the disgust surrounding homophobia to kind of like fart in the room so nobody would want to breathe in and take in what was going on in order to get himself out of this case and i found this absolutely amazing and ridiculous to read about for somebody who was trying to be an advocate for little black gay boys out there everywhere to talk about the power that they have in their little itty bitty pinky i just want young people young members of the lgbtq community young black children to know how strong that they are to know the power that they hold in their little pinky seriously think about it these people call betraying your own community the worst possible thing that you could do and here you have jesse smallett juicy smelly a jesse smallette because the you is respect using a tired past homophobic trope in order to defend himself at trial in order to discuss the jury to the point where they don't look into it so much and they might give him a not guilty verdict that's how valuable jesse feels that the gay community is to him in that when they help him when they support him they have value and then when it hurts them when he has to support them maybe not so much that's the whole point of being a part of these identity groups it's all about power that's why jesse called himself the gay tupac not because he was trying to uplift the gay community but because he was trying to use his identity status to uplift himself because it was always all about jesse not about helping anybody else and not about those little gay boys with all that power in their pinky now i knew this wasn't gonna work i knew that jesse was too far gone and one of the reasons i knew for sure that jesse was gonna get convicted is even anna kasparian of the young turks didn't buy into jesse's story i mean think about it anna kasparian of the young turks was skeptical for them to drop all the charges that means at a bare minimum they would have had enormous difficulty getting a conviction at a bare minimum okay right so that's just a fact so at least i said that was their interpretation of the case they had them dropping the charges saying we had a super weak case it doesn't mean he didn't do it but it means that would it they would have had enormous challenges in convicting him why would two nigerian brothers one of whom is allegedly his trainer attack him and yell racial epithets at him i have no idea were they running a scam i don't know okay was he running a scam i don't know now jenk bought in of course proving in this instance he is definitely the dumber member of that panel but anna was super skeptical of the idea that these two nigerians would be throwing racial epithets at jessie smallett and jesse wouldn't be able to recognize their voices you know how major that is you know how devastating that is for your case ever in the united states of america it took anna kasparian about 15 months to realize that joseph rosenbaum chased kyle rittenhouse despite every single video showing that since day one of the written house case and even this was too far for anna to believe even this was clear enough for her to understand what went on that's how bad jesse's story was and he got shredded in cross-examination they got under his skin he showed his attitude he looked terrible there was a point where he attacked and snapped at the prosecutor because the prosecutor suggested that he look perfectly fine in his interviews post that because he was talking about scars and bruises and all that and he was like you don't know what it's like to be famous and covered in makeup in hollywood it makes you look better on the stand or on tv during your interviews and jesse obviously a total buffoon made himself look terrible in front of the jury completely unsympathetic exactly what you don't want to go through but again when you subject somebody who's obviously lying to cross-examination you can't expect him to perform well so not only is jesse smallett a stupid person who wrote out the most ridiculous plot line ever that any even today tv show would have rejected as absurd he's also a terrible person not only did he try to personally profit off of sowing the seeds of division in this nation not only did he try to smear half the country because they disagreed with him politically but he also when push came to shove through his own gay community that he's supposedly an advocate for right under the bus and played into some dark homophobic stereotypes in order to create disgust amongst the jurors so that he can get acquitted which in the end it didn't even work jesse smallett will do absolutely anything to benefit justice smallett he's all about him he's the me guy i'm an advocate i respect too much the people who i am now one of those people who have been attacked in any way you do such a disservice when you lie about things like this and it was that ego that idea that he was above everybody else who isn't famous the idea that everybody should be paying attention to him that led to his ultimate undoing jesse right now is facing about a 25 000 fine i'm not sure if that's per charge or total or three years in prison based on the felony convictions that he received now he's a first-time offender and typically first-time offenders get lighter sentences but since jesse testified in the court of law and the jury rebuked him in every possible way by finding him guilty on count after count jesse might actually serve some jail time and he probably should serve some jail time he probably should face up that he isn't all that and see the consequences of his actions i saw a lot of prison scenes from that show empire that jesse was involved in the osindora brothers were cast as prisoners in a few of those maybe justin needs to see what it's like on the inside of a real prison protective custody obviously he is a high-profile inmate wouldn't want him to get hurt but maybe he needs to see how the lowest in society live because he acted and he has the personality of somebody who belongs in the lowest of our society but hey those are just my thoughts let me know your thoughts down in the comments below if you liked the video you can show them by leaving a like you can subscribe for more content you can follow me on all
