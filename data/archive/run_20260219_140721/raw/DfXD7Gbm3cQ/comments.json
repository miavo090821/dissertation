Yes she’s a mean girl and yes she’s got issues, but if ppl were still rocking with her music they wouldn’t care about none of that. Kanye lost his whole mind but had to flop a buncha albums before ppl REALLY started calling him out. And by that point it was too late.

We’re so used to Capitalism dehumanizing those involved that decency and dignity can be treated as a luxury if we label an arrangement with capitalist terms. Their “transaction” was still an interaction between two ppl, and when interacting with another person it is not right to be degrading towards them. So Ice Spice was wrong to be a terrible host. She was wrong to be a nasty person. Cleo was right to be upset that she was mistreated by the host with whom she made an arrangement with.",

Because Ice was the headliner and everyone was there working for her, she could be particularly nasty to Cleo.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that there probably was a lot of ignorance on Cleo’s part. Ice Spice offered for her to join a tour that had budgets locked in long before she extended that invite, so Cleo shouldn’t even have accepted without both of their managers having a conversation to iron out details and understand expectations.\n\nCleo probably thought it’s last minute but theyve had a solid relationship thus far so when Ice says “I got you,” she assumed Ice’s perks and comforts would extend to her. Cleo, in my view, assumed the best of Ice and was unfortunately given a dose of reality.",

I also think Ice Spice has too much ego because she should have gone to Cleo immediately once her crew/manager started complaining about having to serve/budget an extra person and told her \"I effed up.

She said she was going for exposure but she said Ice told her she was going to be part of the budget and she wouldn't have to pay for anything. That's the only reason she went because she wouldn't have to pay out of pocket and get things together in one day. She went on tour and in the middle they told her she wasn't part of the budget leaving her stranded. She didn't expect to be paid but she expected to have housing, food, etc because that's what she was told. For continuing the tour, she said she had invited her fans and Ice convinced her to not quit for her fans. Both Cleo and Ice identified each other as friends. Cleo gave Ice her clothes and I don't think on it's face Cleo 100 percent knew that she was being used for her blackness. She knew she was being used for her the cuteness of their closeness but not her blackness. \n\nYou guys saying she isn't a victim is doing the \"perfect victim\" thing in my opinion. Because she \"knew what would happen\" and \"well I wouldn't have if someone did this\" type of thing is something people always say when it comes to victims. \"Well they knew this was going to happen da da da\" so that part didn't sit right with me.",

So I think in terms of that it wasn't much. Another thing about her exposing her I think is the fact that a lot of the things that happened were down right seem illegal but I guess technically isn't like her starving her or  leaving her bag outside and having her card get ran up with 700 dollars gone (which we don't know who did it but...). So I think it if it were na argument like Cleo said they got into about the jealousy thing and resolved it. She didn't take it to the internet but I think those things are like criminally evil for sure and within reason. That's not a slight difference in an argument between friends. That's some whole other ish in my opinion.",

    "text": "57:47 this part when Rebecca talked about colorism and romantic experience growing up made me reflect a bit about my situation. Having a black family in my dad side and a white family in my mom side; a lightskin dad with a serious antiblackness problem; being racially ambiguous and being in majorly unambiguously white spaces where I was looked down upon and had comments about my features (hair, nose): I always found more comfort and acceptance in black people. Not only among my dad family (even though my dad actively tried to prevent it), but my best friends have mostly been black women, so it's not a surprise that my romantic interests since I was a pre-teenager have been black men. Mind you, I'm brazilian, so the racial experience of my people vary way more from the denial of being white than the claim to blackness ( due mainly to the myth of racial democracy in case someone is curious about it ), but I digress. It makes total sense to me when Rebecca talks about being romantically attracted in relation to perceiving your reality in an attempt to love yourself or at least accept yourself. That being said, another portion of my experience where maybe other people can relate but I don't see talked about often is the confrotation of race to racially ambiguous people ( including lightskin black people, from what I've been told ). In my house, race was never a conversation, probably due to my dad's self hatred and my mom's lack of racial consciousness. I just started thinking about it in university, when I was 18 years old, when people started assuming I was parda (light-skinned in Brasil) and I started making sense of some of my experience. But this where the catch is about the tragic mulatto BS and colorism,  that  were never a thing to me: if I took 18 years to be confronted about race, meaning my experiences \"passed\" in a way I didn't confront it myself, it is literally obvious that I benefit from my light skin. It's nothing to accept or disagree about, it's an objective fact. Dark-skinned people don't have that priviledge, period! I've seen my besties in multiple situations of racism that I never was and now I see my husband as well. It just baffles me that some people seek validation about themselves on behalf of something so gut-wrenching like racism. That's also where I fail to give grace to arguments such as \"oh they were raised by this white parents that's why they feel left out\",  dude I was raised by an antiblack light-skinned man and a very white woman. Understanding privileges is not that difficult when you don't place yourself in the center of the universe. All it takes is to sit down and LISTEN to a dark-skin person about their issues with colorism. It's not about you!!!",

If there's this glass ceiling for dark skin girls, especially in hip-hop i think there's a power imbalance, she was expecting exposure and opportunities for her likeness. She was minimized and harmed in hopes of furthering her career. Ice knew this position and privilege - she didn't expect backlash because society doesnt defend black women especially dark skinned black women. There's no perfect victims BUT i think Cleo is a victim.\n\nLike she kept minimizing, humiliating, and demeaning this woman every chance in public. I don't get how we're framing the conversation with Ice Spice feelings as the center. Yes she's a human, and she invited her to the tour. I still think professionally she owed that girl better treatment and as a fellow black woman should have been kinder. Transaction or not doesn't give you the right to treat people anyway you want to and they just have to take it. Cleo put up with a lot of micro aggressions that were unacceptable. Cleo asked Ice about the finances and ICE SAID SHE GOT HER. \n\nI don't want to extend a courtesy to someone who took pleasure in perpetuating the pain she got onto others.",

However, I don't know if *this* was the right time or conversation to get into that. At times, it came across as minimizing the harm that had been done to Cleo, even though I know that was not the intent. \n\nOn the transactional thing, i totally agree. I mean, my boss and I have a transactional relationship. Does that mean she gets to deny me a lunch break or spit in my face? I have a transactional relationship with a waiter, yet no one would tell them to chin up if I called them a name.

I feel that hip hop especially certain segments of hip hop are cutthroat, dog eat dog world, but from the musicians that i know in rock/jazz, this drama would have not gone down like this. I think there is something to say that hip hop cultivates this type of competition in the music, especially at the higher levels of fame. I am not going to say that I don't have a list of favorite diss tracks, but there is not much of a we-in-this-together type of vibe in the hip hop game, unless its performative. That's really sad.",

Someone would say fatphobia and then people would be like \"but shes not talentless\" or fatphobia and then \"we're framing this as friendship\".

    "text": "My real issue with the \"not nice\" critique is like. When are men ever held to that standard. No one looks at like any single male rapper and goes \"well hes mean\". Not that they shouldnt! We probably should point out whos mean and who isnt. But i only ever see this directed at women as a thing. And this happens cross racially (altho black women and darker skinned women get MORE heat for being perceived as mean)- like i saw people poining out like Blake Lively as being mean during an interview like it was her greatest goddamn crime and i can think of several white men who are mean in interviews and everyone fuckin laughs and calls them cool. \n\nLike. Ice Spice obvs has some colorism and fatphobia that make her fucked up. Nicki Minaj has. So many internalized sexism issues. But people have this tendency to get drawn to their meanness and spend so much time critiquing that. Meanwhile like. Fucking Dr. Dre gets everything he fuckin wants. People are by and large quiet about his horrid fuckin behavior. They invite him onstage to pretend unity with him against Drake is some kind of win.\n\nBut everybodys fixated on calling women mean, cant focus on that other behavior.

    "text": "I know that we never really know anything about celebrities, but intuition is a very powerful thing. And you don't need to tap into your intuition to see that Ice spice the deals with self hatred. You just have to have a basic understanding of psychology. Hurt people hurt people, it's not an assumption that was made from no evidence. The rebuttal she has given and the behaviors she has exhibited is not the behavior of someone who loves themselves or cares about love. I'm not trying to drag the creator who said it's an assumption to say that she has self hatred. Psychology is not everybody's thing and not everybody can see the deeper mechanisms of other people's behavior. We all have areas of our intuition that are stronger than others, mean behavior and self-love do not coexist. As human beings we will always have an edge about us, there will always be some sort of imperfection. But consistently self-love and being terrible to people does not coexist. If you expect your friend to portray you as something you are not, big sign of self-hatred. If you try to torture your friend over some small situation, big sign of self-hatred. If you care about money more than integrity big sign of self hatred. I used to be the type of person who would say we don't know if someone is in pain or not or if someone is self-hating or not, but after studying human behavior for a long while and having a passion for it, everyone has trauma and levels of self-hatred that they're working through. And it would be naive of me, to think that mean nasty people do not have a level of self-hatred happening. Why would she steal her friends style if she liked herself? She's allowed to be defensive, she's in an impossible situation. Many decisions she made do not display self-love. I was taught from my family that people are allowed to have whatever beliefs they want. I agree somewhat, I don't think beliefs should be forced upon people, that is not loving at all. But it's strange to say that some beliefs aren't negative and don't have a negative impact. If you display negativity to people outside of you, that is mirrored within. The meanness started within, it has an origin. People are kind of afraid to call out what they feel with their intuition, probably because they don't want to offend anybody or they feel like they don't have the authority to say what everybody is picking up on. It's okay to accept that mean people aren't happy. That mean people have not mastered self-love, it's not an assumption. We have evidence as human beings for this, and if you don't know what I'm talking about go look. Go spend time with it Go think about it. You just have to have a logical understanding not even tapped into the creative side of the brain to see it's impossible for a mean person to be mean if it didn't start from the core of the person. I cannot wait until the mainstream knows how important it is for your parents to instill in you self-love, and how important it is for them to teach you emotional intelligence because if you don't have that, your ability to feel joy is severely impacted",

Count her Granmy's. The point I was trying to make is that when you pick this specific path of music, you HAVE to make catchy music, or else it won't work. As you pointed out, a lot of musicians struggle to make hits, but not every musician is trying to be a star, making music to go on the radio. Ice spice, picking this path of music while having the ability to ride a beat, does not make her talented. Especially with her lyrcism, it's not a good display of talent at all. Also, where would she be if we actually kept a high standard to music? Back in the day, a lot of her music would not lead to a record deal yet alone be considered good. The standard has lowered, and so has our opinion, which is why ice spice can thrive in this musical climate.",

You’d think she almost got off on the breakup and the breakup often becomes content for her other podcast appearances.\n\nAnd she never once wonders if she’s the issue. But no one ever asks. But that’s if we’re both talking about M****",

    "text": "I agree with the point that this feels a little like a pile-on. Not everyone comes up with a radical analysis and framework from which to see the world AND while shabby as hell to do to someone you claim as a friend everything Cleotrapa went through sounds like what most up and coming rappers came through back in the carrying crates tradition of hiphop where artists would have to thug it out for a year or two for no money until their moment came. It's an industry built on luck and hookups and relationships and doesn't have HR or operations like a traditional workplace might. Yes, ice spice should've either handled the business better or the friendship better because the blend is what makes this salacious but Cleo could've helped herself as well. Also the stuff with the other girl feels like a betrayal. Like I can't vent in text messages with my friend? Not everything is a press release, sometimes I'm sharing thoughts that might be ugly or incomplete or relevant in that exact moment. The idea I gotta be saying the right thing all the time might be a reason people go crazy.",
