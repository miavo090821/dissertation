there's a pattern reoccurring where people are like no she's not nice you basically had what I see a social sanction we now critical of her Point has been driv home that that's not her home girl when you're working in a field as competitive as music ain't no friends in the game once someone is a lotted the the position or the role of public Target people will take advantage of that and anything that a person does is going to be wrong you're mad because people are questioning who you are your Blackness they're not questioning Cleo's blackness [Music] hello beautiful black people it's not a setup I'm like what are we talking about but let's get talking about ice spice and Cleo tropo maybe I will hand it off to for and let for and give the background because I feel like Rebecca I was just explaining before we started recording Rebecca that normally I was like I feel like ice spice is almost like for my niece and them like I feel removed and I know Rebecca feel like that so explain what the backstory is and then we'll get into it that's a Madness y all having the the the the sisters of head right here on I feel like yeah the sister is aead on the stream right the sister aead [ __ ] on the stream right now talking about um black women business wow thank you already made a video about it on his channel my I knew you was going to start that you know okay because and the reason being I already prepared for this the reason being is this is about dark this is about us people that are darker than blue it's transcends but is very much involved with misog of course the antiblackness specifically reserved for dark skinned women however as I can begin to um reconcile with it essentially ice spice um the lightskin uh G has been stretching that 15 minutes of fame far longer than it was supposed to basically um you know stretch arm strong the thing dead far right and then like G must BR a dark skinn also rapper named Cleo tropper who I unfortunately refer to as Cleopatra because of ADHD and just like I don't know maybe all of so I was calling her that so please you all in the comments if I call her Cleopatra noted it isn't because I was you know it's it's a real thing but yeah he a very good name honestly is beautiful and yeah so she apparently went on she is ice spice's friend apparently ice spice out of the um magnomy of ice spice heart she brought this dark skinned girl you know this arh dark skinn girl to her to her she's saying that right she she brought her on to tour with her you know to go and give her a leg up in her career all the while at every step it has been shown that ice spice has dogged out at every step of the way if it wasn't simply for just like sneaking out to get food behind the G back to to things like basically making her pay for her lodging pay for her food Lord G probably had to go and pay for all of the stuff the transportation and everything and it has finally come out um as Cleo tropper has a medle of different accounts and story times actually amazing story times that that is a great career for her right there like story Times Detailing not only what ice spice has done to her the heinous things that ice SP ice spice has done to her but it's also a tangental commentary on being the dark skinn friend and what that space of being a dark skinn woman in particular in proximity to a light-skinned woman what that means what role that is to play and how exactly um you occupy space inside their narrative because to them you are an NPC you are the position point to better yourself to look charitable or to look better than um and I think that as a sis Blackman the way that I was able to explain it to myself and reconcile with the fact that why am I talking about this is because I had to own up to the fact that like colorism being from a black nation is something that I have participated in I have in some ways benefited from because it operates a little bit different for dark skinned black men dark skinned black men are seen as more powerful light-skinned black men shout out to Drake looks softer so colorism kind of works in that way for us but for women women and fam it works in the reverse yeah um when it comes to desirability light-skinned women are often seen as softer they're seen as more desirable and dark skinned women are seen as more yeah um permissible and not worthy of protecting um and things like that that's was a long bamian answer of it but hey and the only thing I add to that um cuz that's that's spot on with with Cleo Trapper she serves as a little bit more extra for for um ice spice and just seeming like charitable or like you know being the friend Cleo tropper was was had a platform it was relevant Before ice spice like I follow Cleo trappa before I even knew Cleo trappa was raer Cleo trappa is funny like she's a personality online yeah I was I think she already Cleo trop already had a million followers Before ice spice was anybody and so let's get the build thing yeah right and so like the friendship with Cleo trappa like helped ice spice seem more like New York like Cleo trappa is like authentically nobody questions Cleo tra so like creating the appearance that it like people were led to believe kind of that they have a friendship that go way back so it made ice spice seem more legitimate and also Cleo Trapper if you go look at Cleo Trapper's aesthetic like Cleo Trapper how she dresses all that the next thing ice spice is very clearly taken from that image and aesthetic real Nigerian yes my good sis which in you know the whole like I spice is Nigerian thing you get you getting into something different right there I don't know if you know what you top on right there so she very much there there's a whole bunch that she actively is like Cleo Cho hasn't just been to like serve as the DAR skin FR she brought up it's been like who she's like gotten credibility from and like more attention and a look and yada yada ya while it's not been benefiting Cleo trao in the same way so I'll give it to the room well also go oh sorry I just going to say like we could sing together right but we cannot talk together okay I'm g go um just because I feel like um I feel like there's a little bit more context just because I stay in um well all of the Dolls business um when it's made public um I feel like two the reason why I approach this conversation with a little bit more like I Spice Girl please you're already talentless I think that's to to me sorry there no shade um the O in the background is so funny but but yeah you're already L and then the the context that makes me approach her with a little bit of like I don't know if I live for you and I'm ready to be on your ass about this particular situation um is because like what four or five months ago another dark skinn friend of hers named stormmy exposed her for not like anyim Minaj and a bunch of other stuff that really I don't care about but the context of that conversation that I did care about is when she exposed her for basically I forget the actual like verbatim text about about DOI um who's another darkn artist right um right so she said that she said something so good no I was just saying so good she's so good given Grace Jones I just I just love it sorry the house yeah she said that um DOI always feels like she has to work harder because she's dark skinned with like a gun to the head emoji as if like I'm exhausted by that storyline and then the person that she was texting her dark skinn friend was like this is true but only partially to which I want to hear her argument around partially but then she responds to her dark skinned friend who says that's true um by saying which I understand but she also benefit she's one of the chosen dark skins that was her now that's a verb that's a direct quote she's one of the chosen dark skins um who also benefits from pretty privilege because she's skinny and then she referenced her song Booty Drop um because DOI does have a a SI figure um so I walked into this conversation feeling like um yeah you have a pattern of bringing being in proximity to dark skinned women and then talking [ __ ] about them behind their back um or trying to like like to to um foreign point be in proximity to them to utilize them as a prop so it never also not even just because they're dark skinned but just because they are unambiguously black and there's been a lot of questions around her trying to her claiming that she's black and also Cleo trappa said her dad is not Nigerian that he is um some sort of ltin as if he can't be both but she said that he's Latino um so I don't know if he's Niger I've never seen the dad but he could he could be both things he could be Nigerian and Latin looks like Raven Baxter's father um you're talking about um you're talking about ice spice's father he actually tweeted out um in response to people questioning where he came from and they're like so are you Nigerian you know they went to find him on on Twitter and he responded he's like he took An ancestry test everybody right here who take it we are Nigerian okay if we all take it we going to be 2% 5% 3% 55 we know you Nigerian Olay and like we just know this right but he said because he took the ancestry test that he was Nigerian and mean meanwhile Cleo Trapper so I want to add this tidbit for those two people and I know a lot of us um if we had people around us who um want to make you feel small because they kind of envy that about you um she wants that a lot of people question she's ambiguous a lot of people question is she black is she this is she whatever we know Dominicans I know black not all of them but they be the ones to say I know black I know black they don't want to say that they're black majority I'm Haitian I got my family who does live in the Dr some of them live in the Dr I got Dominican family and FRS all the things and I know black over there they don't they they not right that's what they say and so um she's like with Dominican or whatever and she and she presents as something else we don't know she nobody knew but she says she does like a lot of people question that about her so I think her attaching herself to Cleo trappa a real girls girl a girl that everybody can relate to she's funny she's beautiful she's built her platform Cleo trappa didn't ask her to go on her tour she didn't ask ice spice to go on the tour um ice spice asked her to come on the tour and it was as Cleo Trapper stated in her um monologue or storytelling on Tik Tok you know it was almost as if it was to save face because of her Fallout with her friend I spices fall out with her dark skinned friend but I feel like it just gave more so the how you see people will attach to you because they want to be those things you're mad because people are questioning who you are your Blackness they're not questioning Cleo's Blackness you're mad because a lot of people are questioning like are you a mean girl or are you this and how you talk about friends nobody questions that about Cleo trappa uh Cleo trappa is actually Nigerian and all of the sudden you wanted to tap in and say you somewhat some you Nigerian too sis it has to she has to be stopped those are those friends uh and then then invited her onto yes and then invited her to the the the you know saying that she would take care of her this is a few days and she thought it was going to be like a my friend is inviting me on tour let me go support she'll support me she said I'll hold you down and what I see here is more of somebody who wanted to sabotage and break this person down more and as Cleo traa um had stated in her video it felt like it's because she challenged her on when she she did um mess up and um fall out with her friend she actually challenged uh ice spice Cleo trapa challenged ice spice and questioned her about that ice spice didn't care about it but then they got back you know she said they reh they rehashed and got back together and then she invited her to out to the the tour and it was almost like to sabotage her to make her feel bad just for her to have the audacity to say can he take my bags too she wanted her to make her feel like I'm better than you I'm better than you uh you didn't answer that Nigerian question on that podast for me you didn't have my back um you know you didn't tell them that I was Nigerian too or at least you could have said I was black I was something you know so she wanted the reinforcement for her Blackness Cleo traa didn't have to do that baby I present well I come in this is me I'm me I'm very I love myself and you don't love yourself and then you invited me on here to break me down in front of people to embarrass me and that's what we saw here and it has a lot to do with colorism and then I spice not loving who she is she you know she didn't like who she was with the little baby fat on her she young she's to me she's an adorable girl I think she she's beautiful she has an a unique look but she doesn't love herself and that's what I assume and then for her to attach herself to somebody who is who loves themselves who loves who they are and is very likable this is a person that walks around ice spice walks around because she people don't like her in real life her friends don't like her how she talks about Legends people that put her on I'm not a huge fan of Nicki Minaj I'm not mad at Nicki Minaj I listen to her music you know especially my old young self you know the early 2000 mid 2000s I listen to Nikki right but H H having ice spice who a lot of people believe as you say hery is talentless being on a track um for a huge movie with Nicki Minaj but also Ice by sending out text message saying that Nicki Minaj is entitled baby you just got here yeser but it was Ice track it was Ice track and she brought it to Nikki but that's but Nikki is the one that made it pop nobody was going to be like like Nikki really made that that that that song pop of course my children my niece absolutely loved it she said she said who's that lady on there and I'm like what lady she's like who's the lady on the song she talking about Nicki Minaj because she's like I hear I spice but who's that lady you know so you know it it it transcends the music you know Nicki Minaj being on the track allowed it to be bigger than and added for for ice spice it was Ice spice's track but they got Nikki for a reason um so yeah so so real quick streets streets is saying also that like her downfall ice spice's downfall is very much uh due or in part due to her descent against you know Nikki and The Bobs them I ain't into none of that this is a stress signal I ain't want none of that what I'm saying also too you touched on it a little bit right um and this is from the so the TM um speak like basically from our from our standpoint right from our Vantage Point how we was seeing the thing right because when everybody was start to talk about oh what is ice spice oh we got a problem with us say TM wasn't saying that so TM was just saying that like she had that one drop rule with the with the booty shorts and couple cheeks was hanging out was in was in alignment for that was all for that so wasn't very critical of ice spice yet because because yet again PM we we we didn't we didn't care about that we just saw I forget what music video it was I don't even remember the song we just saw and was hanging out it was she was feel like she no there was like a minor inside that video and didn't even care that's them though that's ANM a a not over here though not like us so basically um now this is the interesting part that I would love you all take on because yet again terminally say ter fatally H um you basically had I what I see kind of like a social sanction or whatever type of things that we did not reserve for ice spices a pain the criticism we now critical of us and the only thing now is the fact that she's lost weight in a particular amount of period you know I want to say isic weight because there's something wrong with that man but the thing is because like they assigned like a moral thing to to losing weight quickly and they begin to get into that so like that's a part of it that I want you all to take on but essentially how now began to get little you know they were just like she looked tired you know she looked like she a want thr ass no more we can start being critical us started to retaliate against her do lost weight go she shave off the hair and all that yeah as the resident chubby girl here I would like to say that well a few things going back to the point that Rebecca brought up I think me I was never like I never had any particular opinion of ice spice I do perceive her as talentless um but you know I feel like there's plenty of talentless white people that be going around so I don't you know I feel like closer in a way to equality for us to be mediocre and still get farther but um but with that said uh I started perceiving a lot of her insecurities in relation to not being perceived as black as well as being Perce and be within that in the communities that she's trying to pop off with which also includes a lot of white people that she was perceived as chubby in those circles like really because because I remember distinctly like really early in her career she was talking about how she liked this one rock dude and he had a podcast where he was calling her a chubby Chinese woman oh Taylor Swift Taylor Swift's EX and then she did music with Taylor Swift to save her face and that's a whole other conversation but to save a Nazi boyfriend yeah yeah to save her Nazi boyfriend but it it does go to show though that a sizable number of ice spice constituents would perceive her as overweight at the time and then I think on top of that she already had her own insecurities about her body and about her perceived black or not perceived Blackness then on top of that you don't have no Talent allegedly um and so you combine all those things together and now we're at a situation where the things that will kind of uh protect someone else um like there's a lot of people that'll ride to the death for like a Kanye or a Nikki or any of these a drake even to some degree um but people that they at least like their product or perceive them as being talented in some way or another now we're left with someone who is mean mean to either people behind the scenes and then there were certain situations where I just happen to see tangentially like okay that's not great I was going to talk about it right before um going into like the fat phobia that seems to also permeate a lot of her comments she was saying to to Cleo trap TR that is hard to say tra Cleo good name I can't just say Cleo say Cleo CLE there we go which is odd because Cleo like to bring in fat phobia with two thin people is is like where did that come from but um essentially I had noticed several months ago like she was trying to pop off with a fan that had said something to her that was you know in the grand scheme of criticisms pretty mild it was something like I need her to do something else like I need her to switch it up iagree with that being M she they said need do you like that was not mild what okay I mean as an artist when I think of when I think of like a criticism like that I think of like expand your art form like that's okay like she does this and I think that's a criticism that is kind of expected with making though she said that she need they need to throw her back into the Bronx telling her to go back to the hood that's a different thing than like saying like her music sucks like or like maybe I didn't maybe I'm TW I remember it I remember disrespect okay okay so I'll I'll amend that but her response to that was to show a picture of the girl and maybe that's why I'm leaving that conversation like I'm confused because it was just a plus-size person standing there so I'm like what do you want me to take from this like how is this the the get back I have personal opinion okay now this is probably gonna get me dragged I'm fine with that this this wouldn't be my first rodeo I think there's a lot of context that is just like not being considered when it comes to her first I agree that colorist like she has shown her ass too many times the DOI uh text that was already a step too far for me um but then like the treatment of Cleo like I just want to acknowledge like I believe that ice spice has displayed colorism like multiple times and there's no beating that right I do believe also one thing that people aren't considering is that she's from the Bronx I'm sorry I worked in the Bronx for a year and a half and let me tell you those are some of the meanest people I've ever met in my life I think very much so uh embodies that part of Bronx culture um because I do think she's mean I'm not even going to like I can't like my sister didn't burn too many bridges um as someone who is an ice spice fan or who was at least like I used to like her music a lot it's to the point where we are mutuals on Twitter I don't know how long we will be that after this conversation um I can acknowledge that I don't think she's talentless because making songs that are listenable like that AB Bops is a talent do I think she's a lyricist no do I think she's the most talented MC no do I think she's the most talented perform no I do agree that in many ways she's mediocre um and we are allowed to have medor people on our side but I don't say that a shade because I do think she makes like really like she makes pops and I think another thing that people are not uh considering is that there is this thing that frequently happens in the digital space where once someone is allotted the the position or the role of public Target and people can just exercise cruelty on them without any um limitation people will take advantage of that and anything that a person does is going to be wrong I think she's also acting from a defense that does not justify her being colorless because she is that does not justify her being mean to Cleo because she was that does not justify her being a terrible friend or using her friends like pawns because she did and I think another uh aspect of the conversation that is important to take into account is that people are just like no matter what the girl does or did or what she said didn't say whether she responds to somebody like getting at her or not like it's just going to be um it's none none of it is gonna be enough and I think it's okay to say that people just weren't going to like her from jump they don't like her now they don't like people will find a reason not to like a person that they were already set out not to like as far as even the conversation that you just mentioned Kenny like like I was I remember that night specifically and as someone who was also on the receiving of that frequently I I know how people on TW specifically are like that girl unprovoked said that they needed to send that girl back to the hood like that girl comes from poverty and she was she was performing and somebody imagine somebody while you're in the middle of putting out your artwork things that you're working on whether you like it or not and somebody is like you need to send this [ __ ] back to the hood like I think it's like a little unfair to just dismiss like the level of scrutiny that she's worked under because she has that does not justify the [ __ ] that she's done the colorism all of the things like I'll be the first to acknowledge that because I think it's weird especially that DOI text that [ __ ] did not make sense because last time I checked DOI don't B nobody um and not DOI is extremely talented um but I say that to say that is an important thing to consider too like and there are so many assumptions that are being made about the girl like uh respectfully Rebecca even you you're like she's insecure her friends hate her like we don't know that like we just genuinely do not know that and I do believe like what she's displaying a many like because we don't know all of her friends all of her connections like like I think it's just important to talk about the [ __ ] that we do know which is that she has displayed colorism her comment about DOI is fued up how she treated Cleo is fued up we do not have to speculate we do not have to play make believe we don't have to play pretend we don't have to strip away cont context where people have disrespected her what we can acknowledge and what we should acknowledge is that she was being color and I agree with that but we're having this conversation because Cleo had that whole storyline that she gave with her experience so what I do know is just what Cleo stated Cleo talked about these different instances she went in and talked about how her friends don't her friends being ispice we don't know these people we don't know these celebrities we don't know nothing about them but we're having this conversation because of Cleo's experience and then we're taking from the other things that have been questionable that I spice has done and we're adding that and also in the sense that I do get the sense that I spice doesn't necessarily negate any of the claims made by Cleo unless I've missed something there but ultimately what response has been stated from her which at that point you know you might as well not give one but I understand why she would because she feels like she needs to defend herself but essentially it was well we went what do you mean we didn't have fun what do you mean you didn't tell us about you didn't talk about the time you ate a lot and it's like what the and she and then she said a waiter and the waiter was like saying you ate the whole Ro you f yeah and that's where and that's where down that's where I think like in connection with the like attacks outward about colorism I do think that there's something there about fat phobia internally that is all like combined together and I and it's sure like um I also this also got me thinking when we were bringing up like you know the contant constant barrage of criticism that she may be receiving and it goes into question like how you know an audience should engage or shouldn't engage and how a artist should or shouldn't engage and I have wrestled with this thought a bit because there's a part of me that just says if you want to clap you got to be able to get clapped at regardless of who you are but then there's also a certain level of responsibility to your audience or or even responsibility to your own wellbe being to stay kind of detached away from certain aspects of social media I don't even know how possible that is nowadays because that's such a big part of people's like their branding and their your externalizing but I'm just I guess I'll just kind of open that up like how do y'all think that artists should or shouldn't engage with viewers criticism I have a I have a lot of thoughts like I have a long line of of thoughts that I think like are different Nuance I think a lot of different things can be true and whenever like the internet gets a hold of something in public discourse like it has to be binary binary somebody has to if you're if you find somebody guilty of a thing then they're all bad you know what I mean or they other ones all good and I and I don't think that's the case one I think with just generally since Kenny was just talking about it I think there is this massive tendency for people to act as though fame or visibility or building platforms changes a human being from just being a regular person like they are they have no more like they have no stronger an army of mental defense or any of that [ __ ] like like I can only imagine they don't become super like at the end of the day people do this thing where when they think it's objective when we all have a consensus about a person we think that that makes it like that person should then just like have to live with that and be immune to that like they're like a not a regular person if I'm ice spice and the consensus is that I am everybody on the panel felt very comfortable being like talentless talentless Talent that's a indictment you know like imagine somebody everybody thinking your talent lintless and they say it and they get it off and they repeat it Non-Stop and that's a thing everybody feels comfortable because they think that about you everyone feels comfortable on just [ __ ] on you you're a person she's a 20s something year old girl like I don't know who's not been famous that long I'm not sure how or why like at all the things anytime I see people like talking like ice spice is the meanest girl for some clap back online I'm just like as a person who gets [ __ ] on online and I know all these things feel in these comments and these constant like it's you're not seeing you you think you see all the love she experienced but you're not seeing she's seeing all the hate she and all the things that people are saying and she's seeing that all F day imagine you're just getting ready to put out your first album you already have everybody talking about you talentless you only this get 50 minutes of fame yada y y y y y you feeling all that pressure whatever have you like you have habitu was friends we're trying to bring you down uh one of the biggest artists in the game or whatever matter your whole fan base trying to tear you up y you put out your album cover that you're excited about it and immediately the people who are your fans you know what I mean who are supposed to support you all getting like oh this sucks let me show you how it could be better you would feel sensitive about that like she's a regular person but we have this like dismissal to it it's always like we have such an emphasis on the on the feelings of the people who develop the parasocial relationships and it's because we relate to them like there's always this need to like always oh Center OH the audience feels this way and why was a fair or objective criticism with no recognition that that could be true and this person can still just be one F person seeing thousands of complaints and criticisms and they feel all that in Mass it's not like you read one criticism and then you reset and you're not mad anymore you feel all these and you start lashing out you know what I mean you feel sensitive to the next thing so I think that's the thing I'll say in general second obviously I spice is a colorist right like the I think it's important to say to zum I'm say the entire hip-hop game in our communities and [ __ ] are generally colorist like colorism in the game that she's in rap and hip hop is a colorist industry so I I will I will say that it'd be interesting to me when like an spice gets a label as a colorist and it's like less like she should be done meanwhile every two short rapper of all my great Lil Wayne every one of them is a colorist on display right like give me a break like you know what I mean like not for nothing like who she's in a in um in a rap beef with uh Lotto lotto otherwise known as m l like seriously okay so you know what I mean they're all colorist yes so that's true I recognized that I spice was colorist ages ago I feel like when she a she had a Teen Vogue interview um they asked or something and it just it was clear to me which is clear to me about a lot of black people they do not understand or do not want to understand or accept like what colorism is like period And I think that's because people they feel they then feel vilified or they feel like their accomplishments are taken from it's the same way white people carry on when you try to tell them about white privilege you know what I mean it's the same way so go yes um because I one just like o thank yes everything you said um I think that ice spice still should be held accountable for her colorist ways she has them there is no denying that anybody in denial about that you need to please like tap in with reality and I think like there's a conversation to be had about like cruelty and how comfortable we feel being cruel to other people on especially in the digital space where we don't have have to say it to their face she is ultimately and maybe it's because I'm 30 but when I was 24 she came into like popularity or fame when she was 22 she did not have any prep work she didn't have uh like the supports or like the the background she didn't have like she was skyrocketed to that and I feel like that's part of why she is still developing as an artist she should not be she should not have made it I'm not GNA say she shouldn't have made it I'm going to say that the level to which she reached in such a quick amount of time is a lot of pressure and stress and I can only imagine what that's like um and like to have so many people comfortable being cruel like non stop to to you as hard as a young 20s something I could not well I don't have to imagine because I'm quite familiar with what that was like but I could only imagine it on that scale and I want to say like people like Chris Brown can say like that women right like darkin women don't belong in their sections Kodak Black Kodak Black and these men still have like very like mind you AR but as much as like the heat that these men do get like from the the sub subsets of the the internet that do talk about colorism and who actually give a [ __ ] about colorism like they do not get anywhere near the same heat as somebody who would like say ain't ice spice nck Minaj just even colorist I was gonna say that that's in my monologue it's on my monologue of my things of the multiple things that can be true look at for and scared of The Bobs you even FL Milly like and anybody who knows me knows like that is like you about to say all this [ __ ] and then leave that's what I said now you done right cuz I wanted to respond to the talentless allegations while you were present hold on hold on hold on let me say this before you even get out that because I do want to hear what you have to say like when I say like I think it's unfair one she she was put into the game like she was skyrocketed to a place that many people worked 10 years you know they say it takes 10 years to be an overnight success she did not have that 10 years she got into music as soon as she got into music probably like a year or a couple months really later yeah she was skyro into the position she did not have like the the room to grow and I do believe she deserves the room to grow as an artist she's not there yet and I will say like it is a talent to make a song that sounds good she has Bops Deli is a Bop I don't care what nobody says that [ __ ] goes catch but like and that is a talent like that in in and of itself is a talent and I believe that people are yeah yeah it is I'm not going to I'm not who make shitty music that does not sound good like we can all acknowledge that I won't name names the point is that end and up itself is a talent and I believe that people are so unnecessarily and this is just m I mainly want to talk about the internet culture that comes behind it because there's this like weird like which is why I don't use Twitter as much these days because there's this weird like just like comfort with just being unnecessarily outraged and cruel and harsh towards people and using like a if a person is selected as a public punching bag people will like go off on that person without any like it doesn't matter what ice spice did and she is colorist once it became okay to like jump jump on herp yes my things oh here we go here we respond yeah because okay so first of all I agree with everything with with respect to Cruelty online I feel like everybody here creates stuff on the internet so I think we have a personal attachment to that but also I think from what I've gathered from you all you all just seem to be good people so nobody wants any especially when it's an onslaught right Public Work comes with public criticism or public engagement but it doesn't mean you first of all it doesn't mean that I have to give a [ __ ] about what you're saying and it doesn't mean that I have to adjust my work according to millions in in the case of ice spices people's of op people's opinions now specifically to the point of talentless like Talent has a definition and I feel like she's definition definitionally untalented in the arena that she does her work right Talent is a natural aptitude or skill for a thing right and rap is rhythm and poetry to create a song first of all you can be I think you can be entertaining right um and still not have the talent to work in the arena in which you work right rap is rhythm and poetry to make to make a song There's an engineer there's a producer there's a team and even before she got her team um there's an aesthetic beauty is an asset to entertaining the masses and I think that if there was a dark skinned plus-sized woman doing making the songs that she was making I don't know if they would be as successful one two I think if you stripped everything down the talent of rap right because that's what she is right she's a rapper the talent of Rhythm and poetry is absent what makes the Bops and I think Deli is a Bob I think like is a I I'll stream that as soon as we get off this call and shake my ass until next week um but I don't think that that's necessarily her talent I think that that's Community talent I think that she as an individual is not a good rapper well yes I think she's not a good rapper I think that she is maybe she's talented in other Arenas but as a rapper Rhythm and poetry I don't see I don't see the talent I think it's less about seeing as a rapper and more so just seeing her as a I guess I see everybody at this point in my life I see everybody as a Creator you know what I mean like like I and like even in in being a a music artist being a pop artist whatever the hell she is right like I see it as I guess in the same way I know that when I make a video like it's not just what y'all are seeing like that I had a R in right but like how I even who I even chose to be my editor the like the who how this team came about is my own talent in curating this how I decided this video should be y y y i spice met Riot like they met in college you know what I mean like realized like oh we work together we work together this would be a mutually good relationship like you figure out the kind of thing that would do whatever for me I think that in and of itself like building on that doing all of that she has picking out the songs and the Bops and what works for her I think that is all a part of of her of yeah yeah look how you go I don't like ice spice music I'm not even like y'all who would say like it was a B I don't got a single motherfu ice spice song on my thing but I also am 31 I'm also like and like it a really for me there's lots of people in things and M like music is incredibly subjective right like so but I will say I've always not liked when successful which is hard to do like and that's why I never like one hit wonder like when people call someone a one hit wonder to dismiss them as though it's as though it's easy to get one hit that doesn't count like I always feel like it's just a way that you dismiss accomplishments and what they've done so I just don't you know subscribe to it necessarily but nonetheless whether you think she's talented or talentless I just think if I'm ice spice I understand how I come to a position where I start to feel upset and defensive and yada yada y that's all I was saying there that being said I think um I love Cleo trappa I think like I when the stormy when the when the baby storm storm stff text messages and stuff start coming out the part we didn't y'all out stormmy is mentally unwell I like mentally un like in in the highest form so when I saw those I didn't know there was I couldn't trust what was happening like you know what I mean I was I honestly I have seen that that that girl I've watched a video of her talking about H the world is gonna end H husband gonna send you on flight have you seen it I know all right go buy that no no me I can bring the bring the facts to the table Donald Trump is going to be assassinated this year before the upcoming 2024 election his death is what is ultimately going to cause a Civil War in the United States if you want

mission here our family will relocate to Italy I watched a video of that [ __ ] talking about the whole world she have flyed in some unknown location and saved the world from the rap John husband that [ __ ] is unwell yeah unwell it was given a little Jones town so I had to click off 190 th% so when that person woke up and decided I hate ice spice I need to bring ice spice down I apologize if that's just not a that's not a that's not a mission I was ready to follow like I what is the agenda there you know what I mean and listen people be [ __ ] all the time everybody have like I'm sure like people have in all their Arenas of all their creator You' have falling outs with people people be a [ __ ] you be mad at somebody you be talking [ __ ] about them yada y if everybody could just have all my text messages oh my God like i' I've talk mad [ __ ] on right so I'm like that's one two seeing um on the on the Nicki Minaj stuff Nicki Minaj is a notoriously mean and nasty person I'm so sorry I the barbs everybody fight whatever she's a mean and nasty person like even if I had we have more than 10 years of Nicki Minaj being a mean and nasty person and bullying and having problems with multiple girls like multiple rapper you could just pick pick the year pick a year and you could pick a girl rapper Nicki Minaj had a problem with right like pick an error she like she she has problems with errors of rap Rel before her after her do and you see what I'm saying so did to me two multiple things could be true ice spice could be a nasty person and it could also be like reading those messages like yeah I get it Nicki Minaj is notoriously nasty and hard to work with you went and brought her a song trying to have a relationship with her you've had falling outs with a bunch of other rap girles on behalf of trying to you know like ingratiate yourself to Nikki and do this and da D and Nikki can not give a [ __ ] about any of that she still trying to take all the off on the song like I understand someone texting to their personal friend who they believe is their best friend being mad about that that didn't nothing about that was thingy to me like nothing about that blew my mind at all that being said now I didn't see the DOI [ __ ] I didn't see that at all if I had seen the do the DOI stuff that's nuts and also it's inaccurate too because I literally just saw a video yesterday a DOI talking about you know getting a BBL or whatever so DOI very much so this idea that DOI is the chosen dark like as though that would change anything like that would negate colorism like that isn't in and of itself the idea that you think there are a chosen dark SKS allowed to be a couple of them that are successful is is the problem like even if that it is the problem right and like you see an unlimited amount of spaces for [ __ ] like you are who are cons like whether you think she's talented or talentless she's way less talented than DOI like can I get a clarification on something um when she said when she was talking about DOI um is th like is this in reference to I'm just confused first of all like did she think that um damn it I'm done lost my train of thought I done got thrown off somebody go first and it'll come back to me damn so they were um just they were on tour so I don't know if you're like why was she talking about her they were on tour together opening up for doic cat um and so they shared space and I guess she was lamenting about like conversations they had in private where was telling her as a dark skinned woman I have to work harder in the industry and so that's what she was but we again that if anybody's ever known a lightskin yal the app like like Kenny is our resident exception you know what I mean like there there are exceptions to the rule but like like I mean like so what I like want notice it's like getting offended about like an objective truth like there are and she's she's offended by it because that truth is a reflection do you truth is a like doi's truth illuminates ice spice's privilege you know what I mean she feels offended by because that's exactly what everybody's always pointing out the fact that the fles the dois the jts even you know what I mean all of these like dark skinned black women like do not get like think about like I remember when ice spice was at the um macala her first like she just became relevant she was at the first ma Gala meanwhile like kishan had to get their on didy arm the gires magn don't be the M Gala you know what I mean like the Met Galla she has she yeah okay good all right good excellent forign dog excellent no like I I wanted to I wanted to like just note how much of the conversation and rightfully so warranted Le so but still I think the objective holds um the the observation holds that a lot of the discussion around colorism is through a lens and a vantage point of the light-skinned person being the fixture and the Jos point for it so like I understand the utility in breaking down ice spice we've also humanized ice spice we've looked at ice Spice from every different angle defying redeeming angles and flattering vantages of ice spice and understandably so still holding accountable to the colorism but yet again still using her as the frame of reference and the focal point to discuss that colorism I think that's I know get that's why I saying so like that's why I want go to essentially because that my my reason of talking about it and like the way that I talked about it in the videos especially especially how dark skin as an antiblackness as a concept is is so Universal that it not only transcends like different cultures and whatnot like you got you got fcking places homogeneous like Japan still colorist or or still anti you know and they ain't even got there um you know what I mean like so like anti-blackness as it pertains and as it permeates it's something that transcends not only of course gender and sex and whatnot but of course just people in general as a concept Bible ecclesiastical antiblackness if you talk about like the way that like you look in the Bible and when they discussing evil they talking about slavery in the Bible you know what I mean so like I want to get to like how even then the way that we discuss colorism and just like the occupation of dark skin friend especially I want to know what you're dealing with in pertains to that because the mogy W angle is something that I wasn't able to speak to I know how I've done it to dark skinned women like I've been around it took me some time and this is because of like growing up in the bombers and as aami knows very colorist very anti-l despite being fully block for the most part just sprinkles of white but like we've had instances where I had to realize even in a group of GS when you when we going out to the club we going out to AA and thing like that and it's a group of GS and you like the as we yet again TM we talking and we trying to figure out who could take the fall and talk to the in the group um I agree it is you and that's why like I want to like speak about exactly like how like one thing about like the way I go about it is I'm not going to like speak about it in a purest terms like most leftist will and say that yeah I never clutch pearls no like this is someone has perpetrated it and then had to realize looked at it and ordered it how difficult it is and how disgusting and repugnant it was to be in a position where you allow yourself to only have empathy for people that you have desire for and when you don't or when that person does not fit that mold of desirability how do you engage with them as a person and then a lot of and I speak this to in the audience like how do you treat the dark skinn G of the bodega how do you treat the dark skinn G that serve you a CVS how do you treat the majority of them and also as like people who are darker and blue on this call um how have you all seen it operate because that's great value I know I've dealt with it but I want to just circle back and I and I wish shahim was here I want to go back to it being a mental thing right this to me mirrors people who don't like themselves back then I know that being light light-skinned was considered the thing the lighter you were the better right um I have a family that is super Blended when it comes to SK skin color my immediate family were mostly dark my mom's um Dad is like half Cambodian and from like a mistress type it's a whole thing with that but we all have like mixed my uncle has like blue eyes from that side it's just the whole thing but I saw them treat him with a different kind of respect and when the Haitians would talk about him they would say glead gimo you know which means light lightskinned person and they would be like you know when you say that you know that stature it comes with that and I remember my first experience with it as a child and now as an adult I'm 34 so I might be the the grown grown women in in this in on this call here but um so with the with me as a child I remember being in kindergarten I never forget this day I went home um I naturally have like long thick hair and so my mom would com she would do her best job her bestest and you know parted with the fours with the boo and the little things in them you know s me with my um yeah Barat I'm saying all these words in cre because I don't even know them mean English but I would go to school like that and I would be so upset because then there was like the girl who was supposed to be black too but her hair is Curly she light skinned um and her the teacher who was white Miss Morris wherever you at helpful um this lady she was my kindergarten teacher and she used to to pinch me for speaking Creo which was my first language and um she would just put me in the corner and I'm a really good kid um but she would just like there was a whole thing and then send me to do work at the same time for her for the other Haitian kids but I would look and I would see how she would treat the Little Mix baby and the white kids and it I'll be like okay at least this girl is black I can relate to this girl at least but it wasn't like that she would treat that little girl like here do you need something and I'm like Miss Morris can I have a pencil and she would treat me terrible I went home and I told my mom mom can you make my hair curly can you make my hair curly like the girls because the kids at school you know and the teacher she doesn't like me my mom had to sit me down and tell me how beautiful my skin color was she's like no you have my dad is super dark and that's where I get my skin color from and she's like um you know you have beautiful dark skinn you have beautiful black gums I got to middle school and my teacher who was a light-skinned man Mr Alfred wasn't even a teacher he was a sub teacher he told me did all the shaming I had a light-skinned friend who was thicker and he told he called her the Hamburglar I had a friend that was in between who was a little were you about to laugh for oh no that's M like this is she was thicker and she was a beautiful girl and he called her the Hamburglar um I had another friend we were all standing in front of him at this time in chorus class he called the the friend my other friend he says she got a big old forehead a five head he looked at me U he's short he's lightskinned and he ain't ain't even attractive in this day and age baby he wouldn't even make the list the roster for nobody um and he aged like a banana okay I seen him on Facebook all that hat he looked at me and he said to me he said uh this is when they used say he was like you you're black as toast he literally said that to me that was middle school now we get to high school and you know you start getting cute or whatever you know and um I they started to say you're be you're I mean you're beautiful for a dark- skinned girl you got your is that your real hair like your hair is really long for a dark skinned girl like because I'm dark skinned my hair can't grow that was that kind of whole conversation um and I had to deal with that a lot I used to say this I used to say I'm going to and this was this was me doing it to myself so this is when I go back to say sometimes you don't even realize it the hate that you're giving yourself like people are giving you you start to give to yourself too um and sometimes you that out to people so I started to tell myself I need to have I remember the who was Indian um uh was she Indian yeah she was Native American she literally told me as I was walking down the street with my friends in our little Haitian neighborhood she said um you guys should try taking colder showers so that your skin can get lighter so she had that issue with herself she was a darker woman too um she was Native American and she said you should try to take colder showers so that your skin could get lighter but I remember um I used to tell myself when I get married and if if I have kids this before I wrote that off cuz I like you know I don't want to mess up my body but I was like if I if I end up having kids or if I end up getting married I will marry somebody light skinn or white all my crushes before then were white I didn't have any black crushes or anything like that and um I said I will marry lightskin or white so that I can have a mixed child and they will not go as a young person and thinking that is crazy so they will not go through what I went through was a common and I literally made that my whole thing but then when I went to the number one HBCU in the nation sitting on the highest of Seven Hills in Tallahassee Florida Florida A&M University baby they shifted my mindset my mom did what she needed to do my dad did what they needed to do to help me carry through Rebeca this is who you are but when I got to FAMU they instilled in me how beautiful Blackness is and how it is not a monolith how it is strong how like all just just and it's it's all different shades all of the things um and even there we had some colorism right but I was never told you're beautiful for a dark- skinn girl you're just I never heard that rhetoric on the hill at that school I really went in hard on my blackness oh black Brothers now the darker you were the more I wanted you that's where I was with it but I do know when um and I want to go back to the conversation about how I feel like ice spice you have to not like yourself to be perceiv that this mean girl um and again we're having this conversation on the account that um uh Cleo trapa had she was saying because of her how she treated her friends I watched her treat her friends like this on tour people said she was just boring she wasn't friendly she wasn't she didn't receive people well even her hair stylist was saying you know I this atmosphere was not fun until you came on if you're a nasty person and I get we we on this conversation we've humanized her which is fine but we do got to call her thing a thing if you're a nasty person you're a nasty person the hate that you receive the hate that you receive is going to be um like you Olay you say that people come at you and all there's these negative these negative conversations I don't think you've put out hate for you to get it um you're just being yourself you're you haven't got on there and just started attacking people just because do I think I got the type of heart do I think everybody should be attacked no but it's online space you online you stuff comes out about you you show stuff that's showing that you're being mean people are going to choose who they want whose side they want to be on and who they don't want to be on um um her fan are going to go after Cleo trappa Cleo trappa F fans are going to go after her um I think if you're a nasty person though uh and you go around and do bad things to people then I mean what do you expect in my opinion I I I saw to to because foreign wanted our experiences I mean listen I obviously I grew up in naso to an incredibly colorist place like my my mommy is like that's my mommy my mommy is incredibly light like so ready um yeah my mommy R like and so my mommy um told me and I'm I'm I'm not only dark skinned I am I have a Nigerian name so like that adds a certain level of of undesirability and Blackness when people get into the anti-blackness and their colorism and their xenophobia I have a I had a special cocktail of all the ways that they consider you undesirable you know um growing up that being said my mommy was quick on the game like my mummy my mommy is I think one I one of my mommy's greatest credits I will give her is like my mommy was is a lightskinned woman who was always like not only got colorism like she jumped on it like she let me know these people are ignorant they have an inferiority complex like before anyone did it or said it my mommy had already educate like as a little girl like this how these people go they have an inferiority complex they stupid they this this this and the next thing so my mom had already told me that combined with my big sister had always like made it very clear to me one we my big sister looks just all me and my sisters look just alike so my big sisters like we are all God just first of all but second of all my big sister let me know like beauty standards are things that are in style that are determined by these other things like people will not see you as as attractive not because you aren't attractive but because they they they buy into these other things so I was always aware like they just don't know I look good you know what I mean so I was always like highly aware of that and so that like my whole life may like I could tell you countless times like people like oh you'd be pretty you'd be pretty if you was your mother color oh blah blah blah blah blah this is and the next thing like I've always known that like and I've always been surrounded by like especially in college I was surrounded by light-skinned gals who who deeply deeply deeply bought into colorism and blah blah blah I've known that my whole life like in the bombas everything is Boho mango skin this this and the next thing y y y so there's that that being um so absolutely like I I 100,000% we obviously know that's supposed to happen into Cleo traad that's what it's happened in all of them but I think there's also more to it than that I think there is an aspect of this is a transactional relationship Cleo traa and I spice are not friends like that is what is very clear like they like let's be clear and like like like I said the world the universe likes to be binary when one when something is bad and you want to indict a person for that like one one is bad one is good and there's no Nuance given to the situation right they agreed to a transactional relationship they said the day before they did that Kai andat stream they had just met and they decided to then go and present as best friends and sell this like um story to the public I didn't buy Cleo Trapper agreed to something that she thought would benefit her too like that like that is she knows that ice spice she was to come be her dark skinn prop and Y yada y she thought that this would benefit her too she bought into this transactional relationship that now that does not in any way like justify ice spice deciding to go be a tyrant and go be a colorist demon and go mistreat her and go actively bring her on a thing to go um like bring her and tear her down but it does add how this happened in this transactional relationship where y are under the impression that y'all are supposed to be serving each other and trying to like help each other's image you see how an ice spice becomes resentful that she feels like you're supposed to jump in and help her with her like fake you know what I mean oh I'm trying to do Nigerian now and you're my friend my prop I've gotten or whatever and how Cleo traa also feels like look at this fake stinking [ __ ] texting talking [ __ ] about me I'm talentless all this [ __ ] she talking to this gal meanwhile she needed me in this transactional relationship in order to help her to give her image and y y y y so there's also like a big aspect of that and then what you have now is two people who engage in a transactional relationship that was supposed to benefit their careers they they intentionally wanted to field perceptions of a friendship and like help help sell the public on the idea that either one of them or mutually or this and when that personally and professionally devolved now you're coming to the internet you're coming to the internet to give it to the internet to try to tear that person that person down because of how this transaction relationship didn't go so I think there are a lot of things to be discussed it's obviously colorism it's obviously these different things but I but Cleo trappa is not an unknowing like a friend who was just like used as a prop out of the brand like like out of the blue she agreed to be that prop when she thought it would benefit in server in a a particular way and now this is like the consequences to a you know what I mean her coming now and letting people know about oh this about her character and this and the next thing which also by the way I don't think you can even truly speak to if you've informed me that you and this person are not friends friends y'all have never been friends y'all agreed in yall are yall have a transactional relationship and now it has gone like this but then like now speaking on their like it's funny because in the same breath that Cleo traa is letting us know she was never her friend she can't speak to anything about her da d da she's also like still asserting herself in some way as like someone who is a friend and close enough to her to be able to speak to her character and all that she deserves doesn't deserve so there's a lot of nuance here that is like I think like blinded by the need to we need to like we need to absolutely like critique dissect and understand and also I think like we need to start making like General indictments of how colorist our hip-hop industry is and the fact that this is normal because something I was going to say earlier and I forgot when we were talking about ice spice being ethnically ambiguous and using uh uh Cleo tra as a prop and all that that is a tale as all as time of them doing hip hop the Rita oras the the um you know all these gals that that are ethnically Kalan all these gals that what are they are they black do they look like what we think do they look like black women no one us to distinguish of me Rebecca Kenny or black but we take these ethnically ambiguous sometimes but it's it's stupid it's dumb but sometimes the right day I really see it it's dumb but yeah but that being said right like that has that has always been a thing of like them them trying to get women who are who who are not really black but they get to be like now it's this whole big question and they hide their you know their ancestry and all this to try to like milk it to see how what it could do for them that is a that is a thing so ice spice is playing like I want the criticisms of ice spice are absolutely valid but we need to zoom out and recognize that iceice is doing what all of her forefathers before her have done and what they're doing this is an industry you know what I mean they're all agreeing to this and playing this game but they're presenting they're taking when when when it's not going well in the business it's being presented to us the public for internet F fod to talk about it in the same way as though it's our same social dynamics but this is the industry like and there's also something to be said about the commodification of the idea of friendships I find that very interesting and very weird because like like sure like I'm I'm I'm on this uh podcast with but I actually like oi as a person if I didn't like her I wouldn't be here so I'm trying to understand like even in like a conversation of like working together in this in like a creative space this idea like oh we can get something both out of it and it's like way honey I don't know if you you haven't seen 2024 everybody is no I understand I understand it's a thing that happens my thing is it just seems in many ways like unsustainable I know about y but if I don't if I don't like a mother I can't keep acting like I like a mother it's very difficult we've seen so many breakups in this in spaces that are podcast related or you know people what we saw ice spice first of all with um Taylor Swift but we know as you guys were saying earlier that was a relationship that was built because she was saving face for um her Nazi boyfriend at the time uh and then we don't see them together for real anymore because that was an unlikely pair but things are just to same face or but I know a girl who I'm not gonna say her name but she's popular and she done did so many shows and podcasts and stuff but she always leaves because of the bad relationships in the shows or podcast that she's in there's always a story about her breaking up or whatever because a lot of it times you get to these places you work along somebody but like you said Kenny if you don't people are not I think Cleo trappa actually liked ice spice and thought there was going to it it was going to be transactional but there would actually be a relationship there but when she and also maybe there's some assumption that somebody just ain't gonna do you like that maybe that's myship that's what I'm naive I was going to say the way I'm that's a lot of be you could have just stayed home if i' seen the [ __ ] if I if I go on Twitter if one of one of let's say I have like a a transactionally kind of relationship like a friendly relationship with some Creator and I go on Twitter and some other mentally unwell Creator I starts posting screenshots of that person talking about how I'm got [ __ ] of my own the next time that mother asks me to do something I'm expecting I don't trust that no more like you know what I mean like imagine Herby if you saw a bunch of text and I was like Herby ain't even really [ __ ] for real people will still show up and go on the shows with people and do all that stuff but this day and age friendship look because I'm 34 I can say this this day and age friendship is not what it used to be you used to break up with your friend and try to make up with your friend and if and then you either grew apart from them or whatever now it's so nasty you take it to the internet you take it after you about you throw out everything you can you send your if you have a big platform all of those people on to go uh this is the way it is you send them on to um to go attack this person and then they vice versa if they have a big one big um platform it gets real nasty the friendships aren't true to their Court to the to the point where people are using online space to people are using online space to beg for friends every time I get online they like I'm looking for friends in Houston Texas I'm looking for friends in Atlanta because my last friend group five days ago they did this to me and and crazy yeah girl you are the problem but I do want to say that um even though we are talking about to um 's point of like obviously the colorism piece is important I feel like we've talked about that and we can continue to talk about that if that's what you guys want to do I never correct on how to say my name and I'm only be making life harder for y'all like y like and it only be harder for like the version yall say I don't never say nothing I like and it only just occurred to me like why did you tell them correct corre if I say olay that's incorrect Olay is so here's the thing it's my fault my name is oami but I say y'all can call me Olay so I used I see how it gets everybody fued up they go Olay it must be Olay no it's oami okay say oay cause girl I don't want to keep up like o a little too earlier but um I feel like between the two of these two characters here in this story cleopetra definitely benefits a lot more this person that we just mentioned ice spice has collabed with um obviously Nicki Minaj she's worked with the Barbie movie which was a billion dollar film she's collabed with Taylor Swift and she was on tour in a way that Cleo Cleo traa not the mic going flying in a way that Cleo Trapper um who what had 10,000 monthly listeners and now has I think about 60,000 monthly listeners would not have been able to tour the United States without um ice spice but also I want to Circle back to the original point about um I just want to say like it's okay to identify as multi-racial like and I know that there are people who I'm not I'm not of the belief that you have to be monoracial in order to be black I do believe that Barack Obama is black and Naomi Osaka is black but then there are other people like Sophia Richie I always bring her up who is a white woman even though she has a black dad like some of you girls are afro descendant leave this [ __ ] alone the up it's very much okay to just say like like you can have and I think you can have a black parent and not be a black person you can be afrod descendant and that's fine so I think I be it would be a lot easier for me to engage with these girls if they just didn't say and if they identified as multiracial and then one last point to what foren said earlier today um when he was like wasn't really critical about her because they saw a fat ass and you know the baby specifically but my question was when are ever critical of a like a multiracial racially ambiguous bad [ __ ] with a fat ass and a black sand like never the answer is never I you said something else for you said that people choose to empathize with because she's lighter and I feel like that even in this conversation like I feel like we just kind of like Cleo can hold her own naturally but we're just I don't like the humanization of ice spice to be honest she's human but okay I was all right will same I will say you know because if you to me again I just got put out there if you were nasty if you were girl you just that if you want to go out there and your your [ __ ] gets aired out it's not people are going to because you are a superstar I'm not saying that she's not a a human if I were her friend or if I were in her friend group if I knew her like that I tend to because if I'm a a fan of an artist I tend to be like damn she just messed up this one time you know what I'm saying like you know I mean I think that but right people like people do beyon but I'm like it's I don't really care for her and that's probably why I don't in an in a real world in my real Circle people make mistakes and I forgive right I don't know ice spice but I do know you have this big platform and this is not the only time we've heard stories like this from you you did and right after this incident she got on is the little look I basically was like I'm about to get you know it's not even that serious like why is she making it a big deal like and that's what she said so she didn't even give a and why is it why is it not humanization to call her a mean human like [ __ ] you're you're mean so that's I'm humanizing you I'm just saying I think also I I I I think also we're using the example of like Internet Hate versus like real life interactions she's having with people and as far as like real like people who work with her there's a pattern reoccurring where people are like no she's not nice and I can't speak on that other than to say that other people that to be around her say she not nice and if that's the case I mean I do think it's strange one who is mentally unwell and the other who entered a transactional relationship with her said she's not this this is what I'm saying not a whole industry of people like that's the truth like well okay but like they both of them had text messages that revealed her not nice behavior and the not nice behavior with the pattern was the colorist angle hon if you get into a space right after you uh accused of denigrating a person that like you supposedly have a friendship or a transaction relationship the only thing that we could go off of appealing to the um appealing to the Esquire in you the only thing we could go off of is the fact that right after she got those accusations shorty came up inside circles very boldly very blazingly not Dem at all and she not mindful not de she tear into the girl call her what whatever the waiters say she snor like like yeah a vacuum said this oh it was raw and shorty say like she displayed like a level of entitlement and like like just a total disregard for the fact that this y just bear the sunry everything she G through call her a vacuum um I think yeah listen I love I love Cleo tro like I want to be clear I'm a Cleo trappa fan I really really am I love Cleo trappa and I don't I'm not a ice spice fan I don't listen to not a damn ice spice music but at the end of the day I think there is like colorism is true that has happened I spice did something wrong to her yes but I think there is because the internet when we get emboldened as people like we get like colorism is something that angry you like is angering like the this whole reality that Cleo trap is in this situation all these other different things like upset you so much that I just think there is a way that we are seeing that we're discussing this as though like as though I like Cleo traa is like a random like a like a like a Vic there's a way that ice spice is being like vilified like a demon and and Cleo trap is a super victim and I think it's not that far like this it's not quite what it is being like presented to me I I don't think it's quite that like I understand in a world where like listen Cleo tropper it's crazy for I spice to be talking about about CLE Trapper like she ain't nobody Cleo Trapper was somebody before her she had a platform first she's obviously benefiting from her that being said in terms of what they do in terms of Music Cleo trop has not been successful at all at music she does not half the people who know CLE does not know that she makes music and a lot of who go to go look at it listen to it not my cup of tea you know what I mean like that's not where she's doing well so she has entered this relationship with with ice spice to be way more known and to get a lot from it and to get benefit from it Leo trappa would not be on nobody's tour certainly not no ice spice toour or that size or whatever if she's not doing um this with with with ice spice right but the no contract where she say okay I can give you Cloud if you give me block like i a i a see that though like I mean like the thing is though what I do what we have seen right is the fact that g is wrong not only wrong but she wrong and strong she wrong say like if I showed you this Al me you would be like you and I both know you know a conversation we just had yesterday you know bigger you know good and well if I went online right now to go air such and such out you all allow me to go take it to the internet even though you know wrong you would say that so don't act like this just because listen listen to what I'm saying I like when you don't there's something I understand a [ __ ] being mad if y'all have a transactional relationship y'all have a fraudulent friendship y'all decided to agree and have this transactional friendship in order assum that she that and in somebody I spice listen I spice for her own personal I spice wanting clearly I do agree with Rebecca that re that ice spice is probably insecure about her own Blackness and being perceived that way or whatever that's that Cleo Trapper is there to help her with a perception that bothers her own insecurity but in terms of ice spice success ice spice being ethnically ambiguous and being able to like charade quietly she black will always benefit her she didn't need Cleo tropper to be successful she needed Cleo trer to help her create a a a a like a a perception that that would assade her own insecurities right but for Cleo tropper ice spice is exposing her to a much bigger platform ice spice is is is is putting her you know on this tour yada yada y this is the next I still maintain ice price is dead wrong I don't think ice spice is in any way right but what I'm saying is when did this transactional [ __ ] friendship y'all you voluntarily decided to go be a prop so that you could get something out of it and what have benefited you when that did not go right you then came to the internet the internet to to uh completely the intention I don't think she's wrong I don't think she's wrong and feeling that way but the intention is to try to bring her down is like between stormy doing this this next one the intention is to try to destroy the public perception of her and uh uh end her career or whatever that's how she feels that's how she perceives it if I just put a [ __ ] on my tour who had an opening for me or whatever I'm a [ __ ] if I'm a [ __ ] like ice spice clearly is she clearly does not understand colorism or what's wrong or any of those things she perceives herself as having we engaged in this transactional relationship in which you were supposed to get a benefit I put you on my tour that you wouldn't have been able to get on helped you increase your audience and you came on the internet to try to end me have everybody [ __ ] on me and mask at a time when my album just flopped I'm already going [ __ ] it makes sense to me that the [ __ ] got on Twitter space and talk crazy that's not that I'm not going to sit here and act like it's unfuckingbelievable to me like we do these things the internet we oh what a me you try to get me I'mma try to get you you try to play me and I kept taking it I understand Cleo Trapper doing it but I also understand ice spice being mad too I understand what I mean is what I mean is though a as as explained by Cleo that ice spice invited her to the tour and then treated her like [ __ ] on the tour so in an effort to like use Blackness but even if it was supposed to be this transactional experience even if they weren't friends at all Cleo still didn't get what she wanted out of it because she didn't put her on the marker she didn't put any like she didn't pay her she was telling her to pay for everything along the way so in that transactional experience but I think what she's trying to say Cleo is that I thought I thought it was going to be like a friendly thing where you put me on because there is such thing as friends putting each other on but and maybe that's where she's getting confused like it's entirely transactional or it's it's friends working with each other this what I'm saying about when the internet like when we start discussing things with no respect to like the industry in the if you go listen to 50 Cent any of these [ __ ] talk about who they go put on tour who they put on or whatever y y go listen to all the artists Cleo Trapper like it it's been and if you go listen to the other hip-hop podcast and all the who will work in that industry C Trapper wouldn't have been paid that's not like abnormal you know what I mean like that's not some abnormal thing in in in their industry but we are looking at it we're going well if I'm your friend if they're friends then ice spice should have done this but they're not friends ask okay maybe this is my ignorant showing you asking to follow you around the world and I'm not getting a dime do you know how many of all these artists going onour with them and that's a regular thing of these artists bringing all they friends and they homies with them and D that is like a normal no not coming with you performing I'm telling you it's a bunch of that's not abnormal wild and but they go because it's an opportunity where they would have never got it's exposure half of the people think about it in media do you think I get paid for the majority of anything I do political commentating wise or anything you do it to try to create the next opportunity and exposure yeah exposure is currency as well and so if her if her she dumped tens of thousands of monthly listeners into um ol's Orin origal Point people weren't checking for her music like that she's not successful successful in that space so it offer her it offered her an opportunity to shift her social media content to I'm on tour right could I spice have lended her celebrity as a friend yeah but it's been D the point has been driven home that that's not her home girl that is your networking partner and honestly when you're working in a field as competitive as music you really don't have ain't no friends in the game right so it's everybody is a competitor or an a strategic Ally until you can get to the next step because music is a dog eat dog industry so I think it's very ni and I also think Cleo Chapel was very aware of that which is why she didn't say anything until the end of the tour she did send her a text message and Ice spice did blow that blow that out of proportion and didn't handle that correctly and so I think that she said okay well how can I leverage this even further let me take this beef to the internet and get people to now people are engaged in this drama I'm going to drop a diss track now people are going to listen to this diss track and so it's all about she Dr she benefited so much I didn't know that or she dropped another song um that the girls are I guess it's her honestly I don't get into CLE treer for the music I get and it's okay like honestly that's another thing the pressure to be a multi-if in it when you're not talented in every Arena like you have to understand the length like the you're you may be stretching a little bit too far and she may have an audience just like I don't think ice spice is talented it doesn't think that doesn't mean that she's not a good Entertainer well she's not a good Entertainer either but doesn't mean her music it doesn't mean that her music doesn't entertain people right and it doesn't mean that you cannot be successful in Arena that Herby reist doesn't think that you're talented in so I think that if she wants to do it do it but I think the pressure to be a multi-if in it uh is working at some people's detriment this is kind of like a tangential point because she's so good in the comedy Lane she's so good in the entertainment Lane I would if I I would have said girl let's go to acting let's go to let's go on a comedy tour I think you'll make so much more money there yeah she should be hosting red carpet she should be but I mean if if music is where her heart is she could try it listen I'm not knocking nobody if it like I didn't think ice spice was Talent but she did make Bops right she made songs the kids could vibe to she's showing her panty right but I feel like she you know she's bored with what she got going on right now too I feel like when she started she was super young I don't think I don't think it's any everybody got problems I don't care about the um how she started then she came out the game young everybody has problems Cleo Trapper probably got problems I'm pretty sure her growing up in New York um being Nigerian there's a lot of stress going on there right I'm pretty sure if she gave y'all her life story Cleo Trapper came to the internet we heard the story um didn't see any tears I'm not sure if she was pissed or but she said she was sad she said she was hurt she said I wasn't really your friend like that we we made it look like that and I was trying to actually build a friendship with you um she she gave us all of the ins and outs of that we know it was transactional but I do know that if you know it just goes back to there was was once she realized hey like why you ain't get my bags from there from that moment on the like a girls who be like oh no this girl tried to check me and I put her on this tour and now she's really going to know I'm G make it I'm gonna make it real bad for you could Cleo have left the tour I'm not sure if there was her sign paperwork that was signed where she didn't because for me I would have left you ain't gonna try you got about one more time to try me I got my own coin I'm not about to be sleeping on this bus sitting I'm leaving okay and I'm going but she didn't she knew it was more beneficial for her St and so whether or not she got that chicken salad she was going to stay on that toured um she wanted that really bad that so she isn't a victim she wanted that really bad the whole not entirely like rapper credit she wanted that but when I listen to her music it ain't bad it's just not something I would follow right like I wouldn't follow Isis spices Isis spices I can't even say the kid's name right but I do know that when you it goes back to this is not something I can humanize the situation here two people didn't they not really clicking they not really friends it got bad it got to the internet um and it just highlighted how terrible one person is and I think Cleo definitely knew that this was already the rhetoric about ice spice so let me double down on it let me give you what really happened and let me let y'all know this is truly who she is um and that we all heard it and I believe you know this may be what it is but if ice spice is this type of person I'm not shocked that she's receiving it back she doesn't give a damn she cares but she has to present on the internet like she don't give a damn and that's but go ahead sorry also this is the year of rap beavs I just thought about that like the currency around that and of itself is like if I'm if I'm her and I'm not saying that she is this nefarious right when I say her I mean Cleo but if I'm her I'm like oh this [ __ ] is giving me cause this [ __ ] is giving me reason okay so when all this is said and done and I do take it to the internet I understand that his became number one because of a rap be that Drake and you know not to say that this is even near the scale of either one of those things but I'm just saying rap beats have always been lucrative um a lucrative Endeavor for um hip-hop artists so I just feel like the more we talk about this subject and I talk about this over on my channel like a couple days ago but the more I was talking about the subject I'm like of course colorism is wrong ice spice is probably a nasty girl but Cleo Trapper is just very smart for handling it the way that she handled it um so I feel like she still come at the end of all of this even though she experienced color what what we are interpreting as colorism because that's what it is she came up that's what I'm saying like like I don't think I want to be clear because don't interpret this as me saying ice spice is in any way like right or the victim or Y yada Y no ice spice is like ice spice the CLE trop of mad dirty everything that we think is true that's operating colorism yada yada y all of that is happening and that's the function of how that industry in the space that they're in exists at all all I'm saying is the way that it it is intentionally and it's smart on Cleo's part and how it's working it's being frame to us and the way that we're like feeding off of it is a Discord that's about friendship and colorism and that's not quite what the Dynamics here are is what I'm saying I'm just saying this is more the music industry transactional relationships than colorism you know what I mean that's all I'm trying to do I'm only just trying to zoom out in the framing I think Cleo chop is right I think Cleo trop is absolutely right I think she has every right to be like [ __ ] this [ __ ] Express you know what I mean Express that tell us whatever have you I'm just saying that's what's actually happening this isn't the fult of her friendship this is this you know what I mean this music industry is this is transactional and she's letting us know but that's what it really is but the way we're anchoring it in is because we're seeing it as like friendship I think there's a different way that we're even like ice spice is wrong and up but there's a different level of there's a different analysis that we're having on how what kind of person she is because we're perceiving it as a friendship rather than business and all these things but she's definitely [ __ ] up she's wrong as and I love Cleo drop C yeah like you said Cleo definitely came up um she she knew where to go for it she knew that once you know I put this on the internet yeah it it worked for her but she said I'm leaving here with something you tried to play me and I stayed talking about you know God made her one of the strongest shoulders she's so soldiers she's gonna you know God wouldn't have her be in this place like that she said she said ice spice was evil you know um so she got on you know playing with her heart she made sure that she said I'm leaving here with something for said you attack The Bobs you humanized this like listen I about to go to my I about to go to my one J now you all could go and crucify crucify The Bobs and go for the be while you out go for [ __ ] not me it was never me will always be my girl never me and Herby no that's that's y cut his mic off like listen someone had to do it people people people accuse us of never considering like both if we've been our whole plan a little bit how they thought we was just jumping on Drake's neck and Kenny could do it she's lightskinned she could do can you speak anything it's gonna be aggressive it's gonna be angry and y'all know me and I usually give a lot of um you know what it maybe they were're having and maybe but no I do not have that in this in this particular situation but it ain't only for her like you were saying Olay a lot of the people who um we see in these bigger spaces in music but it's actually going into the podcast spaces that's why I don't not I want to have more relationships like when I first met you o I'm like I don't I'm in this space and I don't have relationships with a lot of women in the space um so that's why the the the number one thing that I did with o was you know like love on her and that's really because I'm like this is a good relationship and I love Rea we've been years I love you back I love you mean it like it's real no that's real um you know and with other people I just couldn't get that there was a lot of um side conversations in one space I caught people talking about you know she just she just here to look pretty um she's just you know regurgitating the news even though I am a journalist um all those type of things and it's just like I don't what else is my job it was like you know if you people don't like people created and this is what I don't like for and I would say black women to do in the space I don't black women to get in the spaces and some people take the bait where you know you in the space one space that I was in and I was working under that man that we said his name earlier that I said it's white we're working in his space and they made it so that there was only two black girls it was I'm the only dark skinned one and they made it so that they would be like you know how did you like how she did it did you like how she did it and I don't give a damn she I went to school with that one she's a great journalist this one I don't know but she's really good at her job we all do it different and stop trying to P us against each other um and they would try to put us in rooms and offer us different things and you know make it so that we were fighting for different positions or TV time and so I didn't play that I didn't play that so that's why you know you got to choose where you know you gotta people take the bait and the the old ladies are fighting on their podcast what's the girl's name um the old ladies not um yes yes they're fighting on Zeus Network yeah they're arguing with podcast I I think the reason why I have like like the reason why I had the take or the thoughts I had today is because I watch um y'all know Julie y'all watch Julie content watch cont her most recent video essay the Mana one you seen that boom I just yesterday she made I gotta go she made an ex I can send youall the link she made like a general excellent point about the problem of taking these personal Grievances and these professional grievance in real life to the internet hoping for the internet to validate your feelings and the problem it causes I think that specifically that's what I watched right before I went to bed last night which is why I had the like Outlook I had about Cleo troper bringing it you know what I mean and now us all discussing it because it puts you in this position you know what I like in in real life I know for a fact it's like I know in my own even my personal working relationships or and stuff how many like creators I've like felt like oh like you a snake or you did this or you or they they they try to like jux suppose himself to you for a particular kind of relationship like you know when your mentor that role when they bring you on to the show or this thing or this for that Ro and then they don't do you quite right and I know I've always known it does not serve me to come bring it to the internet because I bring it to the internet and then now it becomes the internet fod for them to like pick apart pick sides make binary reframe it the way they want and Y yada y because it becomes like dialogue so I was thinking I was thinking about it from that lens of like like you know what I mean this business this this thing that we did not need to know about you could have been like you know what this did not work well I don't think she's wrong I don't think she's wrong I don't think you're ever wrong to express your feelings there's nothing wrong with that like someone did something wrong what if she chooses to speak on it that's her right but I think in terms of just her own like and it worked out for her I think the internet is and people are seem to be mostly on Cleo drer side I don't know how that works in their business in the actual business and the real on the ground of the people of power probably not so much you know what I mean um I don't know I just don't think it's worth the energy and the pain like because it's GNA happen it's gonna happen repeatedly in your career you realize these people aren't what they say they are the deal and work this way it shouldn't is not conducive I think in the long term to come to the internet be like let me tell you all this this this this this this the next thing or whatever because the way what it overcome and what the internet might take and do with it in the public that's why I don't make story story times no more back when I was back when I was just getting back when I first started making like any traction I used to go out and do story times and I'm like y y Yad this that and together and I was feeling real like oh this is about to be my thing like I'm going to talk about [ __ ] that happens in my life and I was like y'all don't need to know me like that like you need to know every I I uh privated so many videos I'm like y' don't need to know it's cringy any vide that had I feel likey sorry I don't want to keep with you I know that was so sweet I felt C in that moment I definitely felt hell but no I wanted to say that I feel like with the internet yeah Cleo Trapper is winning today but the internet is very e easily irritated so it's like yeah you won the the battle but you bring one more issue up to the Internet it's like so she has a pattern of running you blah blah blah blah blah these two incidences were five years apart 10 years apart it doesn't matter because the internet has very short memory because it it takes one retweet for something to be back in people's faces as if it happened remember when you and and darkin black women have a particularly short and that honestly that's thing that I was I've been thinking like I'm like because not for nothing I think there's a reason why anytime this come we've always talked about this the way colorism affects the careers of Kiki Palmer of kooko Jones of DOI of everybody right and anytime you bring it to those women they always do their Endeavor best to get the away from that dialogue and it's not because and I remember sometimes we'd be mad because we'll think it's like you'll perceive it as them not wanting to acknowledge colorism being real which we we know it is and they know it is what they also know I believe is how the public perceived dark skinned black women like speaking up about the very real barriers and prejudices that prevent them from achieving what they're supposed to achieve and so I'm like listen they with Cleo tropper today because they because they're a gangst ice spice you know and may be like you know they not a fan of you they're anti me you know what I mean yes so I'm like bro I'm scared that's why I've been saying this whole time I I rather us see it as like a business thing than a friendship thing because then they'll perceive her they'll like start to seeing her as the friend the victim and whatever like sympathy hair but then not go support her in the future and anytime she ever next goes to talk about the impediments in her career they going to have their foot to her neck so that's why I'm saying like I love Cleo Trapper I'm scared about the framing of this narrative long term and it's also like in real life friendships dissolve right and that's just the nature of things it's like and they end often right the same friends you had in high school or not the college friends the college friends are maybe not postgrad postgrad is not maybe when you get in a long-term relationship most friends are seasonal most relationships are seasonal and not most but many I'll say many relationships are seasonal there are very few people who are like oh we were friends when I was in grammar school or grade school and now we're still friends and I'm and I'm in my 50s those relationships are a dime a dozen um and so I I feel like because so many relationships just naturally like we just evolve different maybe you move it's maybe it's not always beef but when you say like oh this relationship dissolve for this specific reason and another business relationship dissolves for another reason the girls GNA be like you're the problem you're the messy one and it could just be that no these relationships NE we were actually not as compatible as we thought we were or we grew in different directions and that caused contention if every that's what I was saying earlier it technically every one of us if we all brought our problems to the internet or every time we fell out with somebody or yada yada y or like oh they could see our taxs you would have a lot of evidence of us seeming like some [ __ ] who are always in problems like I have mad people I'm not school with no more like mad people like if you mad people if two [ __ ] who didn't like me got on live and tried to bring me down I'd crashed the out [Music]
