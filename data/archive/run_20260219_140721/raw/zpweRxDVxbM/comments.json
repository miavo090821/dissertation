What was Riley's response? \"even if that reason is \"you're disgusting and vile because you're trans and i think you'd be better off dead\" lol bye after ellen\"\nUhh, Riles, does that mean that a woman doesn not have the right to turn down a transman/woman down for sex? Gee. Riles... that... that sounds a bit rapey to me. Don't you think?",

    "text": "I notice that the word _discriminatory_ doesn't really have a definition to some people. It's not really used like a normal word, with a logical, defined meaning that is being referenced; rather, it's used _emotionally._ The word _discriminatory_ immediately makes people feel icky because it's been associated with negative things, specifically morally dubious discrimination. \n\nWhen he says, \"That's pretty discriminatory\" if I don't date a transsexual person, he's actually correct in the words he's using: I discriminate in my dating preferences. I only date chicks, and I don't date obese chicks, for instance, or I don't date at all since I'm already dating a chick. I'm \"discriminating\" or, to use the more \"nice\" word, though one with an admittedly different denotation (and connotation), I'm _discerning._  \n\nI don't date people with penises, even if that penis has been mutilated or never grew in properly. That is me discriminating. \n\nWhat this person _means_ to say is, \"That's mean,\" and on that we disagree.",
