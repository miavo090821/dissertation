all right let's see what else um we can discuss let's go into the topic of Shan feain and the uaw's discussion of Martin Luther King Jr um who uh we celebrate on the 15th so in five days I'm going to read this short thread from the UAW which comes from aan feain article it says the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr was one of the greatest labor leaders in our country's history you know right off the bat this is extremely important because people tend to think of uh M and and the black Freedom Movement that he headed and that gave us the Civil Rights revolution of 1964 forever changing the Constitution and the social consciousness of the American people people tend to think about those things in a very race reductive um fashion and that's not to say that you know the struggle Against Racism isn't a determinant form of class struggles but um it was you know very clearly a class struggle when you see the uh rootedness it had in the workingclass movement how it changed a sort of outright fascism that that existed specifically in in in the US South um and how it improved the lives of of working people How Deeply it was rooted in uh major unions uh which backed it um and and labor struggles which uh which they participated in and and specifically in the US South which was the part of the country that was most hostile to labor um so it's a workingclass movement through and through don't let anyone fool you yes it has some bour elements but those were secondary the heart and soul of the Civil Rights Movement was working class through and through and it was led as was the second American Revolution in 1865 by the black proletariat you know the section of the proletariat that has historically been the most Progressive for the reasons we enunciated earlier uh from Marx you know it's been the the section of the proletaria that has bared the most debt it's basically Universal in the working class you look at the inability of of people to pay the basic necessities that they need at the end of the month again it's basically Universal in the working class so in many ways the white proletariat in terms of material conditions is uh as similar um as it's been with the black proletariat as ever you know and and that creates along with this transformation of social Consciousness brought forth by the Civil Rights Revolution the most fertile conditions for a United class struggle because the public and psychological wages that Deo uh talked about as the material Foundation that allows for racist false consciousness they've been completely um or not completely but largely uh removed and if you're interested in that I'll link a a paper that I did for the Journal of Labor and Society peer reviewed academic article where I described that in the process of talking about the importance of WB de Bo's black reconstruction as the foundational Tex for American Marxism but we'll keep this going he was not uh president of any Union but the struggle for economic Justice on and off the job was a core undeniable part of historian Vision I see King again this is Sean Fain the leader of the UAW as a direct inspiration and Guiding Light of the 21st century union movement that's huge you know um there it it's so easy for many on the left specifically the the ultra life to just downgrade King if you're if you're not seeing the immensity of King in American history and for today the relevance of King's thought for today his ability to connect you know the international situation to the National situation the black Freedom Movement to the general struggle of the working class um his ability to root it in a way that's um you know centered in the traditions of the United States and the various struggles and Progressive uh um fights and and and thought that has been created over the course of our history of of the process of the American people becoming a people if you can't see that you're going to have a very hard time succeeding in a revolutionary struggle and winning your people over in the us but as We Gather next week to commemorate his life mission and Legacy I'm am struck by how intertwined his movement and the labor movement remain decades later that's beautifully said I see The Echoes of King everywhere I go not just in the UAW solidarity house where he penned an early draft of his I Have a Dream speech but across the country and particularly in the South where he called home my mind is on the south a lot these days as thousands of non-union Auto Workers concentrated in South Carolina Alabama Tennessee and Kentucky have just launched uh their own movement for economic Justice these workers are taking action siging Union cards and launching public campaigns to win the economic Justice they've just seen Auto Workers win in DET in the Detroit 3 in other ways I'd like to think of think king would find this deeply uh this movement deeply familiar he was no stranger to the fight for workers rights in fact it was him who said all labor has dignity I think it was also Abraham Lincoln by the way and he was no stranger to the strike as his final campaign was the Memphis sanitation worker strike that's you know what got him killed uh it is the process of learning from one another and marching side by side that marks the meaning of Martin Luther King Jr day for our Union and our movement I don't think it's a coincidence that our 21st century movement for southern workers rights has found its first home in Tennessee the same state where King's fight left off it is also not a coincidence that our new Auto industry has migrated to Alabama where thousands of workers are standing up at Mercedes Hyundai Toyota Honda and Mazda by the way this is an extremely important uh point because it sees you know that which uh Benjamin called the angel of History the way in which people's struggles are here's why I disagree with Benjamin they are yes of course looking at the future but they're also looking at the past they're looking at those who weighed struggles and and and and fought and died as in the case of king um lost job opportunities you know were tortured ex you know a million things happened to them a million sacrifices were made in order to push the struggle forward and we can't let those die in vain you know how can we live with ourselves if we don't Advance the class struggle if we don't redeem those that came before us we're Redeeming the struggles of oppressed and exploited people in this movement and when the UAW raises the struggles that it's doing uh in these various parts of the country as a continuation of uh Dr King's Legacy it's doing precisely that act of redeeming and carrying forth the struggle in many ways it is allowing King to constantly resurrect King and and with King the civil rights movement and the black Freedom Movement that you know really that he he was the head of for a period of time and now the soul of um the state was in some ways King's most iconic Battlefield from Montgomery the Montgomery boy bus boycott to Selma's Bloody Sunday it is the same domain of anti-worker politicians and those who would Stoke racial division that America's 21st century aut workers must struggle on to achieve their fair share of economic justice so again you know very clear understanding here of the class and how racism is a tool of the capitalist class to divide working people as we approaching a century since King's birth and 90 years since the uaw's birth it is no coincidence that our struggles remain inter intertwined this is historic man one of the the flaws that the labor movement has had has been that it's often been divided from from the general uh struggle of the black Freedom Movement which has been you know as we often say here following the boys and Winston the the nucleus of the class struggle the form the the determinant form that the class struggle has taken here in the US led by the the black proletariat but now we have a UAW that is seeing itself as being in the legacy of king and the black Freedom Movement and that when it speaks about um international issues it connects it deeply to the struggle of working people here at home as it's done in its uh you know more than a month long now call for ceasefire and as far as I know I haven't seen them endorse the Democrats yet which is sort of the archetype of of of the labor movement way to go in politics just tail the Democrats uh who claim that they'll give them you know some crumbs uh so it's again you know the more I see sha feain the more excited I get and you know if there was a New Year's wish that I can uh hope to to have realized is that you know there's some effort at turning this uh currently economic struggle into a political one I'd love to see you know a a labor party a People's Party grow out of these movements and they're going to have to realize that with what we have at the level of politics right now these two Bard parties we're going to get nothing done we need a people's party and it has to be situated in the labor movement it has to be situated in the struggle uh of of of the black Freedom Movement and in these Progressive struggles that um only can only realize the things that they're aiming for in a radically new Society so you know something like a Shan feain Chris Smalls ticket for maybe not 2024 it's too uh soon but uh for 2028 would be pretty darn cool but again you know local politics is also essential so getting a labor party up and and running for various positions uh around the country would be pretty badass in connection to that I also wanted to pull up a quote from M that they uh shared they're they're also calling as as Nico mentions here for a general strike by I believe 2027 2028 um uh to have all of the unions align the ending of their contract uh in May 1 so that they can uh do a general strike that lines up with um uh Labor Day not Labor Day International workers day um here's a quote from uh M that the UAW shared the labor movement was the principal force that transformed misery and despair into hope and progress that is again so essential you know so many people uh say well capitalism has given us this capitalism has given us that capitalists haven't given us [ __ ] everything the small bits of [ __ ] Joy enjoyment that we have it's been won by working people's struggles often led by by Communists and socialists as as M was so um beautiful beautiful quote and this other one I wanted to pull up as well here uh is from a uh speech that uh M gave quoted by the New York Times many many years ago um the security we profess to seek and foreign Adventures we will lose in our decaying cities the bombs in Vietnam explode at home they destroy the dream and possibility of a decent America you know that couldn't be more important to blast to proliferate in today's world a world in which the Republic is falling apart and it's getting sucked dry by the Empire as parenti would say we have no money to clean up our streets to raise the living standards of our people to have wages that allow us to not be concerned with whether we'll be able to pay for the bills at the end of the month we have no money for removing the crippling debt that people have for wanting to get an education for wanting to have a house for wanting to have an automobile that they're able to get to work in safely we have no money for rebuilding our infrastructure we have no money for you know guaranteeing a nationalized uh Health Service for people so that 45,000 don't die a year from the lack of insurance we have no money for anything that has to do with the American people but we have all the money in the world so that the small Monopoly capitalist class that governs our uh State uh that makes our state be a committee for its interest for its class interest we always have money so that the Affairs that that class wants to excite around the world the wars that it wants to produce and and carry forth um threatening millions of lives of of our brothers and sisters abroad but also of our brothers and sisters at home we always have money for that there's always money for war there's always money for drone strikes there's always money to give billions and billions to neo-nazis in Ukraine to give billions and billions to Nazis in Israel we always have money for that there's always money for war um and the reality is as as is very eloquently uh and poetically said here by King those bombs that we drop abroad they drop at home our cities are crumbling and it is not a disconnected set of facts you know what we're doing abroad is deeply connected to the misery that our people are suffering at home and the only way to end both the ex extreme evil that we uh produce around the world and the misery that our people have at home is with people's movements rising up and taking power taking power away from this Paras iic big Monopoly capitalist class and putting power in the hands of working people so that the state the economy civil society and all the institutions in it education media Etc so it all works for the sake of human beings and not for the sake of the capital accumulation of the small parasitic class
