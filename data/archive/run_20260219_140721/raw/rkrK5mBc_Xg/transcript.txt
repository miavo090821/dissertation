hello everyone Eddie Smith here from Midwestern marks had this idea for a video um for the Bernie campaign when we were working for Bernie they would have us um prepare a personal story of why we worked for Bernie right why we came to the radical left so that when we were talking to people while door knocking we could explain our story um a little bit corny but I thought it would actually make a good idea for a video CU a lot of people ask me you know you don't look like a leftist you look like a trump supporter what brought you to the left you know a lot of athletes or whatever aren't on the left so what happened um so I want to explain my story because everyone has their own story of what of what brought them to leftist politics or radical politics so what happened was in 2011 um I lived in Wisconsin and my dad was a teacher and the governor Scott Walker Republican Governor um who I now know has um deep deep ties to the Republican establishment tons of coch Brothers money and money from other us oligarchs but anyways um Walker passed Act 10 I think it was called or um yes Act 10 and what it did was it destroyed teachers collective bargaining rights so unionization you know so um teachers ability to to strike or to fight for for better wages um organized labor right what what um the capitalists kind of always do is um destroy use the government to destroy organized Labor uh stop teachers from collective bargaining and made a huge cut to the teachers paycheck which the teachers agreed to you know they said cut our paycheck but don't take our unions um but that's never what it was about you know they they wanted to to do both of those things so they did and and what wer said was this is to stop the debt right we have all this debt that's piling up and being naive at the time my family kind of fell for it like oh there must be all this debt you know what are we going to do we got to take care of the debt and then a handful of years later Walker turned around and gave $4.1 billion in subsidies to foxcon multi National company and Wisconsin's debt is currently something like 2020 billion so we're like so you had to cut the salary of the teachers the people who take care of the kids but you could find $4.1 billion dollar for the corporation and right there it was pretty apparent to me um even in middle school and high school at the time I'm like all right this system is definitely wrong like there's something to be upset about here there's this is not right um and at that same time Bernie was running right and of course I was scared of the word socialist um but but my friend um who happened to be a girl who I had a crush on started telling me about Bernie which softened my stance to socialism you know anytime she was talking I was like interesting so I actually listen um and I heard Le Bernie was talking about I'm like this is common sense right like you know um this is not this doesn't seem radical you know the current system seems broken what this guy's proposing seems to be common sense so whatever got into politics you know I was still at the time kind of flirting with like Ben Shapiro and like anti-feminist you know anti- um BLM weird stuff I grew up in like a really conservative town you know conservative high school so there was a lot of those influences on me went to college um in college I had no idea what I wanted to major in they asked uh what you're interested in um on like one of the intro surveys and I said politics um they threw me in some politics classes and then I was like this is amazing I love studying politics um actually it took about a year or two before I really got into it um but yeah uh while I was in college another thing happened a hurricane hit Puerto Rico um and Puerto Rico was a place where I had done um some work in high school we built a house um for a woman in Puerto Rico who didn't have one she was living in poverty we went over there with the church you know people are critical of missions trips um including myself but this was actually really cool we went over there and we built a house for a lady who didn't have a home um and then when Puerto Rico got hit by a hurricane of course Trump didn't do anything about it he went down there um denied how many people had been killed by the hurricane and there was that famous video of him throwing out um paper towels and I was like this is disgusting and then not only that um but Desh duza uh one of Trump's sycophant tweeted out uh colonies usually give the countries that own them resources and labor blah blah blah what does Puerto Rico do for the US basically saying we shouldn't help them with with a hurricane cuz they don't give us enough despite the fact that Puerto Ricans serve in the US military um us corporations make tons of money in Puerto Rico you know Puerto Rican labor goes to keeping the country going like any territory territory it's really a colony um so that was just disgusting and at the same time that that happened I was really um learning about imperialism um I had a professor who uh was a Marxist got his PhD in China um had studied in China a lot and and he wasn't biased in any way he just made really comprehensive Arguments for why things happen in the world um and they're arguments kind of based in Marxism so he didn't push Marxism on me um someone I knew through the Bernie campaign um got me to start reading Marx which really started to inform my worldview another book I read was the divide by Jason hickle which is basically how the US underdeveloped the global South right how um why the global South is poor um and how the the neocolonialism and imperialism happens in the modern era how the US has purposefully kept the US in Western Capital has purposefully kept the global South poor um and and that's basically brought me to where I was today another um a big phase that I went through in college was a Social Democrat phase I was watching Kyle kolinsky who basically just lays out you know we need health care raise the minimum wage and the wars um not really based in theory uh which I agree with all those in sentiment but then and you know a really good quote that um a buddy of mine I don't know where it originates from but it's his Tik Tock bio the communard is his Tik Tok it says to be radical is to grasp things by the root and and that's what Marxism does right it looks at the mode of production um how humans spend their time and how humans organize um production within Society um and then how the contradictions within our mode of production lead to all these ills and these things that we don't like within our society so that's how I came to the left and that's how I came to Marxism gave you the personal side um and then also how I started to develop intellectually uh it doesn't really matter as long as you know your heart's in the right place and you're doing your best um to keep fighting for the right stuff yeah that's all I got to say so I hope you guys enjoyed this video um peace out [Music]
