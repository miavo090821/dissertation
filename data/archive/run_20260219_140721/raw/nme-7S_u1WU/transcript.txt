hey we're live good is that going to load up on youtube all right we're good we're good i um yeah we're live now so what's up everyone welcome to a debate between me and ben versus matt and eddie the debate topic is economics and ethics of um communism versus capitalism me and ben will be arguing favor of capitalism and that and eddie will be arguing favor of communism that should be a great debate thank you all for coming and we'll get into opening statements um i don't really care who goes first you want me to go first go for it sure all right all right so i apologize this is a little long but and also you know i have trouble uh reading long things out loud sometimes so just bear with me on this all right so i'm starting with the ethics opening statement logic is completely objective there's no my logic or your logic there's just logic so if you have a logical position then it's an objective argument that stems from first principles first principles are foundational propositions and axioms that do not have to be defended a few examples of first principles are as follows number one principle of non-contradiction this first principle is a foundational principle of all logic and reason something cannot be a and not a at the same time also if something is a it cannot be b if a and b are mutually exclusive it may be possible for something that is a to turn into b but once it does it cannot be a anymore directly from this we get number two the consistency principle and logic consistency means that there aren't any contradictions so as long as the principle of non-contradiction holds the consistency principle does as well while there are proofs of consistency for purpose for purposes here we'll just look at falsifiability if we can find an inconsistency in deposit then the posit must be rejected if so if a and b are mutually exclusive and a true dichotomy then falsifying a is all you need to do to support b and vice versa it's a consistency principle that leads us to establish burden of proof number three burning of proof is on the active side not the passive side there are a lot of things you are not doing right right now there are infinity of things you are not doing right now imagine if someone said you had to justify every single one of them there's no way you could do it it would be inconsistent for someone to insist that you had to justify one or some of the things you are not doing since you can't possibly justify them all the only principle consistent with the consistency principle is that you are not doing something you don't have to justify it to anybody the burden of proof is never on the passive side which means the burden of proof must be on the active side when the active side conflicts with a passive side everything so far is absolutely consistent with established logic and you cannot doubt any of this without running afoul of the basic principles of logic and rational thought they are the basis of the basis of all science and reason now going from nothing more than these first principles let's see how it works in the libertarian versus status debate number four force is active ergo those who want to use force have the burden of proof those who do not have those who do not have no such burden at all there's no way around this if someone's just sitting there not doing anything the burden of proof is on you to justify any action taking a taken against them like let's say taking some money and you can't worm your way out of this by just calling yourself a government that is a blatant violation of the consistency principle you can't have different rules for government that you do for the rest of us even if the person is taking an action if everyone affected by the action agrees to it the burden of proof is on you if you want to interfere so if one person hires another person and that person agrees to work for wages of seven dollars an hour and you think that's too low and that should be fifteen dollars an hour the burden of proof is on you to justify your intrusion into this voluntary private peaceful exchange number five the initiation of force cannot be defended person a hires person b at seven dollars an hour person c thinking person b should be paid at least ten dollars an hour wants to point a gun at person a and make him pay person b more money is he justified in this think about it if person a then points a gun back at person c because he doesn't want to be forced to do something he doesn't want to do what's person c going to do say that person a doesn't get to use force even though person c is doing what he's is doing what he's doing through force how does person c have any legitimacy here at this point and it gets worse let's say if person d disagrees with person c's interference and points a gun at him if the initiation of force is defensible then who's acting in the wrong here the only way with the the only compatib the only way compatible with the consistency principle is that the initiation of force is never justified which means that the non-ish initiation of force principle also known as the non-aggression principle the basis for all libertarianism is the only principle compatible with consistent logic and systems insist since this argument was made in an unbreakable an unbroken chain from the first principles you cannot refute it your only recourse is to try to find a flaw in my logic up to this point some link in the chain that was skipped or doesn't work for some reason that the only option open to you if you want to that's the only option open to you if you want to deny the non-aggression principle number six self-ownership it's now time to turn for the basis of all libertarian political policy property rights while non-initiation of force is the guiding principle property rights is the logical structure we use to determine who is initiating force and when this isn't a pragmatic idea it too is based on first principles we start with the principle of self-ownership basically you own yourself you own your body your time your mind and the fruits of your labor why well what would it mean if you didn't who else would own you if someone else can own you that would make you their slave but slavery completely violates the consistency principle who gets to own slaves and who is subject to being enslaved you would be making different roles for different people which you get what you don't get to do the mere fact that an individual argues presupposes that he owns himself and has a right to his own life and property if there's a dispute over your body say someone wants to rape you or enslave you then either they are willing to try to justify it or not if not then they are criminals and you have to deal with them with force or whatever if they try to justify then they have to do so in a peaceful context and remember all justification is necessarily argumentation argumentative justification that means any conceivable justification that is any any possible norm that could conceivably be justified has to be compatible with the norms of argumentation and those include peace the presumption that there's no that there is value to cooperation the presumption that there is desire that it is desirable that people have the ability to control their own bodies not only to are you during this i am sorry at this part i think i uh missed a sentence my bad hold on one second not only to are you during the argument but to have survived in the world to the point of making argument which requires the use of scarce means etc the point is that you can never justify a socialist or criminal ethic how could you do so you would have to make an argument in the course of peaceful argumentation that peace is bad this cannot be done it is a contradiction so if you want to commit aggression you either have to just do it and give up the idea that you can justify it or you can try to justify it you have to and you have to recognize that it cannot be done by examining the structure of this from the outside we can recognize that no socialist ethic can ever in practice be argumentatively justified and to say you do not own yourself outside of an argument is simply to say some form of socialism is justified how can two supposedly civilized mutually rights respecting peace desiring people ever argue that it's okay to hit people who have done nothing wrong if you make this argument then you have no grounds for refusing to coerce the other guy into accepting your argument which is contrary to the nature of argumentation which presupposes that each side has the right to disagree with the other and is not being coerced and that's it right who's so matt do you just read your statement next or do we respond to that or or what read your uh read your statement then we'll go until that back and forth and so i'll read the ethics of socialism argument that i created um so basically i want to start off by saying socialism has been misconstrued throughout history and is often conflated with things like authoritarianism big government and the loss of freedom very simply however socialism is the expansion of democracy to more areas of life from your workplace to your community to your local and state governments and even the country as a whole socialism seeks to work in the interests of the majority of the workforce the workers as opposed to working in the interests of the few in the owning class which is the primary goal of capitalism currently capitalists make up a smart smaller part of the workforce but have far greater power we have socialists who want to direct power back to the hands of the workers by giving workers to say in how the company they work for is run how they say in the working conditions how the profits created largely by the workers gets distributed and above all how to protect every person's basic human needs capitalists believe that every exchange should be voluntary free from coercion but they neglect the fact that all the power is in the capitalist hands and there isn't really a voluntary exchange between the worker and the capitalist with this unequal balance of power capitalists also believe that once workers sign a contract to work they have to consent to everything that goes on and if they don't like their job they can leave but this leaves the problem with the worker just to go be exploited by another capitalist free market capitalism reinforces the power already in the hands of the capitalists in our society today capitalists have an affinity to protect private property rights but these rights only benefit those with property socialists aren't coming to like take your toothbrush your car your house or even your small business to an extent because this is what we consider personal property and something that a person has absolutely every right to however private property is that property which is controlled by a few or one owner that requires the labor of others to generate a profit examples of this include owning multiple homes as a landlord in order to extract rent from your tenants owning warehouses or factories in which laborers work hard in heart conditions which they have little to no say in their treatment and even natural resources like private and private gas and oil companies if you think about it it's really weird where people own multiple homes while there's over a half a million people who are homeless and capitalism also doesn't allow for the exchange of goods so that everybody can have something for instance we have 17 million homes that are currently empty and still have over half a million people that are homeless it's also strange that one person or company can own a natural resource that comes from the land that is you know comes from the land it's natural so we should all as a country have a say in what happens with these natural resources we should nationalize our industries starting with the energy sector so the oil and gas um and then have the citizens enjoy the profits and the roots of the country in which we live capitalism seeks no justice or reparations for the countless marginalized groups that have already been left out of our economy capitalists want to get rid of welfare programs which will harm countless people especially lower income people who are disproportionately people of color and these marginalized groups another group that would be hurt by this are disabled people who on top of not necessarily being able to provide a lot of value to a company and are hired at lower rates it would cut over 10 million people off of their primary source of income social security disability now this hardly touches on the other ethical problems of capitalism from the unequal exchange of goods that leave some with too much and some with too little like in sectors like food or housing this also doesn't touch on capitalism's horrible record when it comes to imperialism which i'm sure we'll get into later tonight um all right that's it uh now we can go into uh back and forth i have some contentions with your um opening statement and um mainly in the power structure that you were operating based on the capitalist support capitalists compared to the working class uh if you're looking analysis and now analyzing that so you guys in the opening statement made the made the proposition that under capitalism all the capitalists have power and the workers don't so you guys will so you guys say we ought to have um the workers own uh have more power in that so how do you normally how do you normally justify that claim that was it um so i guess the reason that i believe that capitalists have too much power um again you say that there's a voluntary exchange going on but the alternative to working in a capitalist society is death or starvation or other um you know bad um i guess realities um and so you're either forced to work or you know starve essentially i can oh sorry yeah you can go eddie okay so the capitalist ownership of the means of production and their ownership of private property is reinforced by the state um so ben said you can't justify violence but violence has been used for years in order to maintain the capitalist mode of production um so as capitalism develops and as the wealth as wealth and equality grows and and these companies start to monopolize they also become tied in closer and closer with the state um and as we've seen the development of capitalism for you know however many years now we've we've gotten to the point where in the us where basically every member of the state department is a weapons manufacturer so you're seeing you know incredibly close ties between um private industry and and put you know what's supposed to be public what's supposed to be the government because the state is not actually a mediator between the classes it is for um the maintenance of the system so in in the 1940s you had the largest wildcat strikes in history right this is workers rising up and demanding different wages and and this is when you start to see union busting laws and right to work laws implemented which you know for the last 40 years under reagan have gotten even worse um because when you allow capitalists to own the means of production um they're essentially going to be what marx said warring tribes between each other and i'm kind of giving away part of what my opening statement is here so i don't want to go for too long um but my basic point is that without the state itself this institution the government which has a monopoly on violence and exists above society you wouldn't have capitalism at all because the classes would have gone to war with each other and we would have had socialism already they need the capitalists to one bust unions and bus strikes and two go around the world and and do warfare and cia coups on any proletarian movements who attempt to vet to develop an alternative system to capitalism all right so i have many i have many contentions with that uh we'll go across the line the first thing i want to talk about is the volunteers involuntary nature of labor under capitalism so you say if you don't work you die but this is the worker dichotomy but the problem here is is that in order to be forced it requires an enforcer so which individual is acting to force you to work under capitalism because under a capitalist system or is that under my ideal capitalist system which would be a capitalism without a state the workers are free workers and overall citizens are free to go work for whoever they want it doesn't matter there's a work of that economy which is presenting but there's still no one forcing them to work as a direct action because enforcing requires action can i go or do you want to go are we going across the board uh you however you two can go yeah i just don't understand how you're gonna create capitalism without a state because like i said i mean the way marx and lenin conceptualize this is you either have dictatorship of the bourgeoisie or you have dictatorship of the proletariat because there's no you know kind of capitalism that just exists where everybody's happy and there's free exchange and no capitalists meet up with the bankers and say hey let's form a cartel or a monopoly and dominate this market um like if um if we didn't have the state to enforce union busting laws and to crush every proletarian movement that's risen out of the global south in the past few years they would have already established socialism um and in in britain in the 1800s they developed capitalism and they developed this industry and and they developed banks without this giant state bureaucracy and without this giant military but then as the country started going to war and doing these um imperialism in the global south which eventually would lead to world war one britain started developing this huge bureaucracy and military state apparatus in order to make sure their capitalist profits didn't fall behind the capitalist profits of the other countries and this is what where you have lenin talking about great powers fighting for the division of the world um and as capitalism develops we've only seen the capitalists gain a stronger stranglehold on the state i think in the united states it's 93 percent of elections now are decided by who raises the most money so clearly whoever controls the means of production and whoever controls industry most importantly also controls the state so you don't have a choice of just let's get rid of the state and everybody live in this happy capitalist free market society because the capitalists are just going to monopolize we already have blackwater this this private security firm who does wars you know they'll just privatize the military and do it that way all right so because it is needed for the maintenance of this system all right can i say something real quick sure yeah so i would say our system is more like the detai the dictatorship of the consumer because ultimately the capitalist can't just do whatever he wants like i mean he can do what he wants with his own property but that's not really sustainable what you have to do is to provide people what they want if you don't provide to people what they want you're not going to have people buying your product or voluntary trading with voluntarily trading with you i mean at a at a point of monopoly though it becomes that they're not even even making what people want anymore so i agree with you that there's some um there's some validity to a market system and that it creates competition if you have a free market if you have apple who dominates the phone market they're gonna make a dongle um so that you you have to buy an extra little piece of plastic to plug your phone into the headphone jack because they completely control this market you know um and in china now you're seeing huawei is crushing apple nobody wants to buy apple phones anymore because now their market actually has some competitiveness to it not and i'm not against you know under socialism or communism or you know having some form of market sector where innovation is is encouraged but if you just let the capitalists run amok and do whatever they want in the market they're always going to monopolize all right well if we're talking about monopolies let's go into some entrepreneurship theory uh the way that entrepreneurship happens in a capitalist economy is based in market disequilibriums right so this equilibrium will always happen more when when when companies tend to monopolize so when companies tend to monopolize we'll see further disequilibrium as monopolies inherently become more and more inefficient at making their planning making their planning more like um inefficient causing more disequilibrium so what happens then is new entrepreneurs realize that there is a disease living in the market realizing they have profit motives to make plans better so then entrepreneurs will see this and invest their money into the market and that's what's going to create the new competition in the market causing the cycle so if companies trying to monopolize this equilibrium happens when this when further equilibrium happens that's when entrepreneurs see that they think that they see a profitable opportunity a distributor happens to make it better causing some form of tendency towards equilibrium which caused competition to re-enter to happen more in the market so we wouldn't see the not monopolization happen on top of that let's go back to my original point of that of that claim was that so if you guys presented the worker dichotomy and i'm saying that there is no actor forcing you to work inside a capitalist system in order to be coercion coercion or involuntary exchange it requires someone going on to like directly onto you feeling work for me or i'm going to kill you but there's no actor saying work for me i'm going to kill you it's you want to agree nature cannot coerce you nature's not an actor it requires an action so i'm going to ask my original question who forces you to work because me and bean have already outlined our ethical framework in regards to property rights so if so if you're saying claiming this is an involuntary exchange you have to further substantiate upon that because if we prove it it is it is voluntary then that flame runs down runs away right um alex i do want to get into that but i do want to also go back to what you were saying about monopolies first you were saying that monopolies due to disequilibrium um will eventually fall out and entrepreneurs will eventually rise up because investors will put more money into the market when they see this disequilibrium um but that's a historic if we look into the 1890s when we had um you know some of the most unregulated periods uh or the period in america um you see the monopolization of the railroad you see the monopolization of the bank you see the monopolization of oil companies um and these monopolies actually colluded together with each other so standard oil would um collude with the railroad industries saying hey if you don't give us preference when shipping your oil um we're not going to work with you and you're going to miss out on our business so what they did was they colluded with the railroad companies charging smaller businesses higher prices and actually forcing small businesses out of the market and the only way that these monopolies were broken up was anti-trust laws were formed and the government basically had to come in and say okay we're going to break standard oil up into five different companies but you can't say that monopolies will just magically go away especially when again during this 30-year period um of the rabbit robber baron age you know that's just that's not what happened yeah this is more like how do you brought up the the gilded age in standard oil i'm very happy because i have a lot of stuff to say on that but my argument is the theory of entrepreneurship but we can go into the history of it because if companies find ways to produce at cheaper prices and provide people pressure for consumers while still getting or still being able to maintain that sustainably sure yeah but if we looked about history standard oil i said it was a positive thing one and i'd say two was unsustainable as we saw its market share decrease the third oil was performed in 1970 and it dissolved in in 1911 over the 40 over 41 year old period it reduced the kerosene from one dollar a gallon to 10 cents a gallon and increased output by over 100 percent so what we saw in this company is they were able to decrease prices causing and higher and increase outputs so when this happens that realized that the company was simply more efficient so nothing necessarily bad about that efficient company as they're providing the best products for the consumers now they go down to it um the from from 1870 to 1879 standard oils companies market share fluctuated from 30 to 90 other companies formed for the sole purpose of being brought by rockefeller right um competing companies also brought rockefeller's cheap oil and sold it back sold it back it makes sense competition is dynamic at all after 1950 market share was at a steep decline after 1906 um center o's market share never went over 25 percent so as i was saying before as monopolies form we'll see entrepreneurship because this equilibrium happens which will come back to this equipment markets with the monopolies right so this is the empirical evidence of standard oil proves my point that eventually monopolies are unsustainable and entrepreneurship will come combat that as even before the standard oils the the thing was like 25 market share right again but they were colluding with the railroad companies and forcing other small businesses to pay higher prices when it came to shipping their oil so because they had a monopoly on the oil industry especially in the 1890s that dis discouraged entrepreneurship and again the government had to step in because this company was getting so big and another thing is just because oil prices got cheaper just because the consumer benefited doesn't mean that the worker benefited necessarily and that's again where me and eddie are coming from we're talking about the labor side so what happens when you have a monopoly is that this monopoly is basically a monopsony right so they're the single buyer and they have multiple um sellers in this case the workers are the sellers selling their labor to standard oil so what happens in a monopsony is the monopsony the one company gets to decide where the price um goes so what happens is they drive the wages down when they're the only company especially in some areas that people are able to work at and so workers in this case often got jobs that were low wages to horrible conditions and had no say in how their company was run and how um this very profitable company was distributing the profits that they were helping to generate throughout this whole time through an over 100 year period before we had any minimum wage laws wages were increasing by one an average of 1.4 per year which isn't bad at all and of course uh there were many horrible conditions at that time but that's just because we're going through industrialization that's just a natural thing that happens that happens with any country it would happen with any system going through industrialization but even then uh work worker conditions were drastically improving wages were not going down wages were going up people were getting paid much more than what they were getting paid uh working on farms and was also significantly safer going and working in these factories like i mean yes looking back now we see the factories and we're like oh that's that's dangerous and that's dirty but compared to the times people moving to the city it was significantly safer their uh their life spans increased children didn't have to work anymore like at some point in any country's history before industrialization you're going to have to have children working because if they don't if they aren't working then they're they're going to die you know it's happened with every country of course we don't want children to work but that's just something that has to happen before you have enough resources to actually be able to sustain everyone so children had uh were able to stop working um women were able to stay home with their children and take care of them um they didn't weren't forced to have to go and work so i i don't really know what you mean by people being paid so little like uh during this time worker conditions were drastically improving i mean i would argue though that people were unionizing at the time and they were fighting um for these conditions and and then um post great depression you see an even bigger surge in that you know where workers are saying all right you know capitalism not only does it kind of leave the workers in a crappy situation compared to the owners but it also breaks every six to ten years you know the whole system collapses so we need to fight for some things and we need to um we need to organize ourselves and start demanding um a greater piece of the pie or or protections right so almost everything that um you know as lenin described that sometimes the state appears as a mediator between the classes rather than an oppressor of one class and that's because unions demand things from the state um because you know the labor theory of value if the labor stops the money stops for the capitalists so if the laborers are in a union and they say we're going to withhold our labor until you give us x y and z they have to and even the state has to because the workers have the power to grind the entire economy to a halt so here we have this this principle of non-violence right in in the in the early 1900s you had a million card-carrying communists in the u.s and you had all these labor strikes that were going on and these wildcat strikes more in history um in the 40s than than at any other time and this is when the government starts cracking down because this this is a system capitalism that pretends like it's voluntary right but as soon as the workers organize themselves and they say oh um we don't like private property that's when the state comes with a gun and that's when they shut you down when the venezuelan workers who have had um who by the way standard oil that monopoly was extracting insane amounts of oil for venezuela which left their um economy 100 dependent on oil and then when hugo chavez says we're gonna take this oil and turn it into social programs for the people bam 155 economic sanctions and that's where you see the state enforcing private property rights because the system wouldn't be able to maintain itself without that state and even though sometimes the state appears as a mediator as matt was saying and you guys were talking about where where it does things for the workers that that are fought for um in the end it is um a tool of oppression of the proletariat that that maintains property rights that's the stinks state's function to maintain private property which at this point is you know you have elon musk and and jeff bezos with 180 billion dollars assets fighting for over who the richest person in the world is well 78 of americans live paycheck to paycheck you know if there wasn't a state keeping the system going you know 100 years ago those workers would have been like hey this does not work out for us and we would have changed it all right so a lot of this one is the economics part but like we'll get to economics more later specifically i'll just everything here but in this specific part of the debate would have been the ethicality of it and we're mentioning we're mentioning the ethic of the system being bent outline of property rights to the actual system uh so we argue that all we all everything ought to be voluntary uh and my main question to you matt and eddie is how is work involuntary if the workers are going to work voluntarily there is no one acting to force them to work and also to clarify me and ben both don't believe in union busting we believe it's inherently unjust and we we're both fine with unions okay i mean well if you if unions were allowed in the state just stayed out of a worker's business that's what i'm saying the workers would have organized a while ago but like hey every time the system crashes the state just seems to bail out the rich and all they do is seem to you know and and all the money seems to go to the top and they're just monopolizing while we work in these factories and they would have they would have demanded socialism so i'm saying you can't even maintain this system without the state um so i had something else i was going to say you go for a second well me and bean first off don't believe in the current system i believe that what you guys are talking about in the capitalists in bed of the state they are all part of the political class i'm gonna outline the two ways you can acquire wealth there's one to production and exchange through people homesteading property acquiring property producing things and selling it voluntarily that is the first way to require wealth the second one is what is called economic means or political means and that is through expropriating property or stealing from people right these capitalists in the current state are part of the political class i would say so they were against the prince that mean and being are talking about but i'd like you to address the main the main way i'd like to address the main point of my argument which is how is work how is work involuntarily terribly if there's no one directly acting to force you to work oh that's what i was gonna say yeah so if i tomorrow i decide to not get up and go to work and i stop working i'll run out of money and i'll die and my other option then is to meet up with my fellow workers and say hey private property's dumb let's take over the organization and run it for ourselves and if we did that we would be killed by the government so you either have the choice of work die or organize and have the state come down on you with an iron fist okay which is something that that the state has mostly been able to do in the global south here in america because our workers have become so subservient to the current system we're brainwashed into into thinking this is a voluntary system so our government can go elsewhere and put down you know workers rebellions in the middle east or in latin america or wherever else because they don't even have to focus here at home anymore they've so sufficiently crushed our unions and crushed the hope of any any kind of better system i mean i would argue that any system is ultimately work or die like uh right here we've got um five people right so comparing it to like a capitalist system you know we can say like i'm a capitalist uh you four are workers so you work and if you don't work you don't get money and then eventually you die well i mean let's say we have a communist system all of us are communists and we're working to get resources what happens when one of us isn't working i mean maybe the others could help sustain him but ultimately the others are working in order for him to survive like you can say okay there's some people who aren't working to survive but ultimately there still has to be other people who are working to survive you're just taking the burden and shifting it on to them and even under capitalism under the system we support uh volunteerism we still support things like private charity uh so i mean if there's people who can't work um for whatever reason they can't work at all can't work for a certain period uh something that happens we believe in charity we believe in mutual aid people helping each other so we don't believe in like an ultimate ultimatum like you must work or you will die and that's not how it happens in practice either in the uh early 1900s we saw great rises of mutual aid societies and even things like poverty insurance and just people coming together and helping each other even uh throughout like the great depression um so like i i don't think that's uh really in practice what actually happens yeah so can i hand into that quickly yeah yeah yeah i was gonna add on to that and the idea of the work of that economy you can say that these things are work or die but that does not make something um involuntary by nature um so basically i can have the option to work or die but if there's no one forcing me to die or to work and it's still um it still would be voluntary if there's no one forcing me so there has to be an enforcer to you to decide you to work second you mentioned how workers can't just go and like try to like take over people's property yeah property property property ownership is normative but it's a negative right to something so no one else can take it away and me and bean have already presented in our opening statement on how the principle of non-aggression is um largely consistent with very with logical principles meaning that you cannot actually go and take away other people's property despite whatever you please to do okay um so i wanted to talk about the labor thing so you said labor is existent in every society right so that's the one thing marx observed you know people talk about marx failed to observe human nature actually the one thing he noticed that humans do throughout society or throughout any mode of production is we labor collectively so you had um tribal society where they you know hunter gather whatever and and and then eventually you had feudalism where you labor for the lord and the lord essentially serves as the state and the army is there to protect the nobility and protect the ruling class kind of the same as it works in capitalism and then you have the development of capitalism where labor is organized in a way where the masses work while a small minority owned and that minority becomes smaller and smaller because the system isn't static right it develops and it develops itself into monopoly capitalism and imperialist capitalism so you know as feudalism turned into capitalism there's a better way to organize capitalism which is what i mean there's a better way to organize labor which is socialism not to say that capitalism's worse than slave society not to say that feudalism but it's much worse than socialism due to the anarchy of market production um so i'm kind of going off into my economics argument um but um so let me just go back to original point because the bottom line is if a lot of these consequentialist takes you guys say even if we presuppose to be true we have outlined that our ethical justification is not based on consequentialism or consequences of actions we do not believe that and just by the means what me and bean have outlined so far it's a is a logic it's a logical chain that leads to the conclusion of the right to property and the non-aggression principle right so you want to have a system con like based on that you are also like equivocating the current american system the ideal system me and bean advocate for which should be one based upon a non-aggression principle meaning no one can aggress on another person and you have still yet to present to me who is forcing you to work under a system because if the work is still voluntary then there's nothing going against our ethical framework because our ethical framework is based on this logical chain that we presented earlier which what we view as just and unjust being what is voluntary involuntary i'm saying your non-aggression principle is wrong because every time there's some kind of workers movement or socialist movement the state comes and puts it down with violence that is aggression anytime the masses of society look to um create a new site new society where it's not production organized by the minority the state comes and beats them down if the masses of society wish to move to something else and and the state doing that is violence so there's already violence um in the current system this is why the united states and i know you guys don't defend the united states but this is what capitalism becomes it becomes a system where these capitalists need to expand elsewhere and now the us has 1 000 military bases um around the world because capitalists need to constantly expand their profit and keep the world's proletariat violence which is imposed by violence and the state has a monopoly on violence i mean say pointing out that the uh that the government has utilized violence and violating the non-aggression principle in order to preserve you know certain uh cronies that's in their pockets um i don't think that that doesn't necessarily refute the non-aggression principle that just points out some people violate it like we don't support anyone doing any of those violations okay but how do you how do you expect to get to a better system then if yeah i want to say something first alex answer your question i think that you're saying that it's a voluntary exchange do you think that the power balance is equal are you saying that the capitalist and the worker have equal power balances because balance of power in our current system or in my ideal system i mean i guess i think there's in our current system there's terms of the power within the political class and the different property owners i have to say a famous quote an expropriating property protector is a contradiction in terms of the state is antithetical to mining beans conception of what we advocate for so but you guys equivocating um our ideal system of capitalism and the modern day system of crony capitalism does not mean that our system of capital is going to be the same today our system the capitals would be one truly or something for the exchange in august in principle right okay so life okay but i i don't think that capitalism will ever get to a point where there's an equal a balance of power between the worker and the the capitalist the owner because the capitalist has all this money they have a pool of um unemployed people from which to get their labor giving them an upper hand in setting the wages giving them an upper hand in paying for private security um i think that's something you guys advocate for like can i ask you a question quick i don't understand how you guys expect to get to this system so matt and i say the workers need to organize themselves getting to the side sees major industry and banks and put it into our own hands you guys are just like well fingers crossed they don't monopolize in the government deregulation so so so so but the but the real the real like the if if my society is achievable or not it's kind of irrelevant right i could tell both of our systems are almost impossible to be achieved at this point so just because my ideas will not be complete this is a debate on which system is better my ideal system or your system in this in this regards right so my system would have this certain method of operating you are equivocating it to the current system which me and then wholeheartedly reject the current system so i'm arguing from the basis of if you're already in my system which system is better strategy and actually achieving is a completely different thing as i presented before we can use a personality and theory of entrepreneurship to show that monopolies of the unsustainable and the only way they can actually get big at certain point is through providing cheaper cheaper goods and giving laborers higher wages different things but this actual relevance of the entrepreneurial strategic of based on monopolies will still have entrepreneurship come and combat that but the thing the whole point is irrelevant if you can't establish why um why are our system somehow involuntary because we justified we have an open statement we outline a line of logic right and we say that arson has no state we want a society free of involuntary exchanges well we want to evolve and have respect private property and from there then we can say that our system is more ethical and as we've outlined before but you still haven't reviewed the actual ethical justification provided before well i'm not here to see who can come up with the greatest utopian society i'm here to promote scientific socialism which is the idea that out of the ashes of capitalism we can create a new and better system because that's how the world works we don't get to say oh tomorrow i hope we go to a free market capitalist system where the government monopolies go away you need to take the current system and you need to build something better and the only way to do that is is to wrestle wrestle state power from the capitalist and put it into the hands of the workers and eventually put production themselves into the hands of the workers which is a process it doesn't happen overnight you know did you have something to say matt sorry yeah and again this presupposes that the balance of power you can't presuppose that the balance of power between capitalists and workers is equal and again if ben said earlier that the the capitalism is the dictatorship of the consumer right so you're going to be working towards the interest of the consumer at the behest at the neglect of the workers well i mean i think the argument you made kind of workers workers are the ones who are doing consumers right um okay wait so it doesn't really matter what kind of power balance trying to analyze in the system right the bottom line is that there's no one forcing you to work and that work is voluntary and if you go further than that point you guys are saying oh scientific social is the most established because it's better but in order to how much better you must have some sort of normative ethical framework to determine what we ought to do and we ought not do so what is good what is bad we have presented our framework of ethics of the non-negotiable principle and the logical consistencies we presented earlier and we have still yet to hear a bundle on how that because if that holds true so if if our ethical work is true then capitalism is more ethical so so then but r is true therefore capitalism is more ethical if p p then therefore q right so we need a response to the actual ethical framework that we proposed you can't just say a state has by the director for violating the nap we agree we don't believe in a state yeah i mean certain we want i mean and that's the thing we both have the same goal kind of you guys want this society with no violence where everybody flourishes we're able to exchange freely and there's no state extracting violence the only thing is you don't have any way to get there right i agree that that's where we want to get i agree that we want to get to a prosperous society where nobody's exploiting anyone and everything's voluntary and there's no violent state but the only way to get to that is through scientific socialism you can't just you know everyone become libertarian one day and just hope the and eventually the government will go away and companies will stop monopolizing because that's not how the system works which is exactly what marxists have been saying for hundreds of years right luxembourg wrote this book saying that capital was going to accumulate at the top and i mean what has happened and you can say um i don't agree with that i wish we would go back to you know the wild west or whatever your ideal system is but we have to deal with the conditions that we actually live in and and as capitalism develops as a system power and and um control of the means of production become concentrated at the top and then go or use it through or to do imperialism so i guess you know technically your utopian society that you believe in is kind of the same as ours but but i just have an actual path to get there and i mean alex and i think it also actually is important if your society is achievable and how you get there right we can be talking about this um but if it's not achievable if there you know you can have this ideal ethical framework right but if there's no way to get there if there's no way to achieve this pure free market capitalism then the i mean the power will still be in the owning class and it will still be not as voluntary of an exchange as you wish it would be under your free market system yeah all right so again i'm going to retake this debate the point of this debate to prove what system is better is more ethical and which one is better consequences better like economically so the question i'm asking to you which is still not been addressed properly i completely reject the idea of socialism about my principles right my principles really is like self-ownership homesteading people homestead property and their own property socialism and handling is antithetical to the idea of property rights as it prevents certain people from owning certain things and doing certain things with their own property which is a prerequisite of the right to property so the idea that you can have a socialist or communist system which would be a lot of my views and my ethics is completely incompatible with the nap the logical conclusion of the non-negotiation principle which we have presented before is an anarcho-capitalist society which is what we advocate for yeah i mean not to mention alex already alex already brought up uh he already talked about monopolies so i i'm not really sure why you can keep going back to the monopoly report uh point without actually refuting his argument and also as to what matt was saying uh this situation you describe assumes like a static economy where you have uh i mean the way you described it it's like there's only one business you only have one option in reality businesses have to compete for workers that's just what happens right that's why we that's why we don't have everyone getting paid minimum wage in america that's why in the past year we saw target hobby lobby amazon um bank of america several companies raising their wages to 15 20 an hour um and i'll completely concede that some of these companies did this to kind of uh encourage higher minimum wages in order to hurt their competitors but even then we still see uh companies raising their wages in order specifically to compete for workers and our monopoly point having i presented the theory of entrepreneurship which is debunked i'm saying these equilibriums happen as mormon opposition happens and from disequilibriums that's what entrepreneurship provides to combat that this equilibrium putting it closer to equilibrium having more better planning that means that it'll always be more inefficient compared to ones that are closer to equilibrium so entrepreneurship is a way to go to equilibrium causing more competition and causing overall nominal opposition to happen so why hasn't that happened in in the the dr washer and dryer market if you ask any software engineer they'll tell you for the past 40 years they've been designing products or they've been designing their parts to break on purpose you know i have a washing machine for 40 years ago and this is subjective evidence but you can ask anyone once you have a monopoly who controls this market you have planned obsolescence everyone knows this and it's not like there are you know what example can you point to where a monopoly completely controls a market and then like some guy enters the market some entrepreneur and just destroys it i mean maybe the my pillow guy who's always going on fox news but i mean it's oil with an example they were busted up by the government yeah they were anti-trust laws ultimately ultimately standard oil couldn't couldn't keep going because people went from lamps to electric lights like it wouldn't have lasted am i arguing with the standard oil i literally presented the case it started off because the company founded in 1870 dissolved in 1911 right over the 41-year period they dropped the price of kerosene from a gallon by like 90 percent it went from a dollar to 10 cents for overall benefit and increased output by over 100 percent but the biggest point is rockefeller's market share dropped from 90 percent to 25 before being broken up by the government okay so now you're making the technological advancements though that doesn't prove that an entrepreneur entered the market you're saying that um what they were producing was was overtaken by technology which that would happen under socialism or capitalism that doesn't prove that entrepreneurs are entering the market and beating monopolies i mean i don't think does anyone see that happening you know everywhere there's a monopoly controlling the market there's just entrepreneurs dying to come up with something better i mean and even what would they like but you mentioned apple right case of it happening in history with more negative markets today it's not like the same because today we have massive regulated markets we have like over a hundred fifty thousand pages and regulations um which is like which is it hurts actual competition from having the market in my ideal system which is a free market system then we'd have these entrepreneurs coming to combat this i even showed it historically i started theoretically so i don't know who the problem with monopoly is also you're saying that oh new technology but in order to create that new technology we needed entrepreneurship in the first place that's why the market share went down from rockefeller right and you literally mentioned apple earlier in this debate this is actually a good example of our side right apple uh they invented the smartphone they had a monopoly on the smartphone because it was an innovative monopoly then other companies began making their own smartphones now most companies have better smartphones than apple not only that but like the thing you mentioned some companies like to make the products where they break so they make more money once that comes out about apple apple loses thousands and thousands of customers they go to the other companies because other companies treat people better pretty much everything you're saying is like proving our point so i mean smartphones didn't come about i mean they did come about from entrepreneurship but they also came about from billions of dollars of government research put into nasa um for you know space exploration new technological advancements came from government spending and and here's how this came the internet out of that came smartphones and i'm not rejecting as i said the idea that markets don't stimulate some kind of you know um trying to create consumer goods some kind of you know innovativity between apple and android or or whoever else um what i'm saying is that doesn't take into account labor at all so there's a famous story about steve jobs when they were making the first iphone the iphone was a big block and the engineer gave it to him and steve jobs said it's too big and the engineer said we can't make it smaller and he drops it in a in a fish tank and bubbles come up and he goes you can make it smaller go back and make it smaller and they tell you that story you know in business class and marketing class in college like oh look at what a genius steve jobs is but he's not the one doing the innovating it's the engineers you know and you can have a market system without steve jobs even existing um but i guess that that was a little bit of a tangent it didn't prove the monopolization thing um totally but but yeah there's still some competition that exists like i mentioned apple and huawei but it's not like you have competition between entrepreneurs it's not like you know me or matt who were born to teachers with uh you know hundred thousand dollars in debt from school or whatever it's not like we can just enter these markets if i had the greatest idea for a smartphone ever i couldn't enter the market and i think the kind of system that you guys want and we want is one where people have more equal power you know and technically if you had a good idea you could spend your time making it and you could be innovative but right now you know the vast majority of society work as wage slaves all day um and 78 of them are living paycheck to paycheck which you know and i know you guys say that's not your ideal system but again this is what capitalism becomes i mean uh monopolies will take over and fight with each other to take over the market but it's still monopolies at the end of the day you have multiple monopolies that's a bit of a contradiction but like um but again i have presented my case of entrepreneurship like a train of logic saying why monopolistic happen if it does happen it will go down immediately right you're saying oh we have an idea then we won't be able to like do it why not uh under this system maybe but undermine a deal for something like a free banking and your private banks will issue currency if you have a good idea people invest in that idea to get returns back to them to make profits right so there's no reason that monopoly doesn't happen you're saying oh monopoly's monopoly's monopoly without substantiating why it will happen i present a case of why it won't happen you said you want to privatize all the banks that's exactly how it happens and that's how it happened in the early 1800s and grew um to the point where now you know essentially monopolies dominate the entire economy is because of the banks so you have um the industrial capitalists and the banks start to tie themselves together because they realize as if they have you know if they ally with each other they can more thoroughly dominate the markets and then you see those capitalists and banks go to the state and they say state help us out help us to dominate these markets and then you see state monopoly capitalism develop um so if you leave the banks these institutions of finance capital to do whatever they want they're going to team up with the capitalists and they're going to dominate every market with what we have now with you know goldman sachs and all these giant financial institutions they're cartels um and there's no way to prevent that unless you nationalize them unless you put those banks and industry into the hands of the masses as long as you protect their private property rights with the state they're always going to monopolize and yes those monopolies might die out over time but they're still controlling the market right your system of free trade is impossible as long as you allow for private property so can i can i say like two things real quick um so going back to what you said you gave your little story about you know steve jobs um you know they they present to him the phone they created and he says go back fix this issue right so i think like i i don't really see the issue with that um organizers are very important like uh certainly engineers are vital right but okay let's say you're building cars right and you have the engineers building cars and they want to build the best car they can and this is their thing their their thing is engineering right so let's say they want to make uh titanium bumpers because a titanium bumper is nice and strong it'll protect the car right but that's not efficient in any way you can't spend all that money all those resources titanium is a very important resource you can't spend all those resources just on car bumpers it's much more valuable being used in other areas right so you have to have some sort of organizer pointing out no we need to there's other things we have to take care of other than this these specific ones that you want as an engineer like i mean the job of the engineer again is very important but without the organizer like okay do you what do you want the block phones you know i mean or do you want the organizer to go to the engineer and point out there's uh other things are more important other things are less important and let me just guide you through this because i'm trying to give the people what they want whereas the engineer is usually designing what they want right and then the other thing is you keep you know uh pointing to our current system and saying well capitalism goes into this well i would argue america was never even capitalist uh with the founding of america we had some very capitalist uh founding fathers like thomas edison and um he wanted to do things like ban slavery right which i think is a very capitalist thing to do but we did not ban slavery we still had slavery being forced i would say that's very anti-capitalist not only that but one of the first laws passed by continental congress was tariffs tariffs that led to a recession that's not capitalist at all we were never a capitalist country we were never meant to be a capitalist country yes we were very close because it was a pretty free market but again we weren't founded as a capitalist country so i would say america does not prove that capitalism will uh go into crony capitalism or whatever you want to call it oh well i've walked into that it seems you guys have a fundamental fundamental misunderstanding how the market economy works and specifically in a free market you guys are saying that older people are just monopolizing this but you have to understand what dictates profits and what dictates losses right under a free market the only way you can make a profit is through consumer purchasing things from you right so the only way to do stuff is for consumers to buy from you right monopolies in itself are inefficient by nature as they have worse prices price um price establishing they have you know for the distance of this equilibrium compared to what would have like an entrepreneurial and uh market economy but the fundamental thing is consumers dick in the market economy entrepreneurs base their investment on what they think consumers are going to demand and they're going to use that demand to produce things that they want to participate for them and if they do good they're going to make a profit because they're going to buy from them if they're doing bad they're going to take a loss and they're going to be out of the market which is the good thing so not doing good jobs for the consumers yeah so to i guess i'll take it one by one unless you wanted to go really bad man did you have something to say um yeah but i forgot you can go ahead i'll remember it okay so going back to the apple thing i mean nobody's saying we're not going to have managers right it's just what what um what does tim cook do for is that the apple ceo you know or what do apple shareholders the people who own a lot of stock and apple have to do with the production process you know nothing we want managers and engineers and workers involved with the process anybody who's involved you know with the actual production um and and we see what the shareholders are taking home from apple is just shareholder profits that is that is exploitation and surplus value um and we say that if workers own the means of production um you can reinvest that money and things that help humanity and you can make sure the workers are living are living more comfortable lives themselves um but then uh what was the next point um yeah i mean you guys i think the main point of distinction here and this is definitely what i noticed when i was reading the libertarian manifesto it seems like you guys have this ideal system cooked up in your head where they're you know you're like america's never been capitalist it's like okay so how do we get to your system you know it's like what if libertarians took over the government what would they do tomorrow other than you know abolish medicare and medicaid and sell private utilities off to private corporations right whereas our system scientific socialism looks at the material conditions as they are now and we could give you a b and c very specific things that we want to do in order to transfer the means of the production into the hands of the workers so i almost respect the idea that i need to debate against your utopian society that you've imagined in your head like i could imagine the greatest utopian society ever and you know if you say oh but socialism and and i'll call my utopian society socialism and then you go oh but look at what happened with socialism in the soviet union i say no no no no not real socialism which is kind of the tactic that a lot of leftists use that doesn't make any sense you know why what is the point of debating politics if your system your ideal system has no basis in the real world because when we discuss systems right there must be ethical prescriptions prescribed with it there is what is right and what is wrong and there's normative ethics which is what we ought to do and then and are not not do right so in this debate mean being it's literally irrelevant if your system is achievable or not if it's more ethical right i will still advocate for the most ethical system that exists even if it won't be achieved that i still believe that it's the most just and it's probable i still believe that ancap has a chance to exist in some certain ways um and cap in a sense exists today not really though because like each voluntary exchange that that happens in a in today's society is i'd say a voluntarious transaction there's no government in that exchange happening right there i just want that for every exchange to be so everything changes voluntary right so the whole point of this debate of me and ben is proving that is more ethical to your system and that's what we have presented so far we found the line of logic of pleading to the non-aggression principle more than based on non-equation principle your system is inherently anti-motivation principle because your anti the right to property which is what was based on yeah i mean if you want to debate in the future about how you can uh achieve your system you know that's something we could do but that just wasn't really the point of this you know there's there's plenty of libertarian theory it's not like libertarians completely ignore that there's lots of libertarian theories on how to achieve libertarianism there's agaris there's people who are more into electoral politics and you know i could like what you said libertarians aren't for you know getting someone in the presidency and just like flipping everything the next day like i mean we know how the world works like i mean if you look at any of the uh platforms of libertarians who ran for president i mean even joe jorgensen supported uh going towards a system like a health care system more like uh singapore which isn't at all the free market system but it the way she was doing it was freeing up the market in many different ways but also making sure you take care of poor people because i mean we know we can't just uh flip to private charity overnight like that's just not possible but it is important to go towards that area but again like th this isn't really something me and alex were expecting to debate so we didn't prepare for this debate and i don't think it's really relevant just like alex said i mean if you want to talk about ethics too i mean that's the point is as as mark said uh capitalism is a system that works in movement it's not just stagnant and as it increases its wealth as it creates more things as human labor um creates more things that we see around us in society the misery i'm pretty sure we have more things sure we have more consumer goods but you know in the richest country in the world 78 of people have paycheck to paycheck and if you read the study recently conducted by uh uh cyresta whiteskin uh which is capitalism socialism and the physical quality of life which you know our ethics is to create the best system for the masses right capitalism is a system which you know gives maximum freedom to those who own private property what we would like to do is create a system uh that works for the benefit of the masses by destroying the anarchy of market production um to a certain degree um and then by abolishing private property rights and making things publicly owned and in this study they found that physical qualities of life when you compare um socialist countries to what they had before versus what was accomplished after going towards socialism um so those countries be capitalist countries because as we said as long as you have um this minority of people who own the means of production and then the rest of society works for them it's going to be a [ __ ] deal for the the masses of society and that's exactly what we've seen um and and i'm i know like um maybe i'm i'm basing my uh my analysis and in the material reality of what we've seen but i guess that's just marxism right it's not let's imagine some kind of society um but i mean if you want the ethics of my ideal society yeah it's a society of no coercion where things are publicly owned where human labor power is used for the development of the masses rather than the enrichment of a few i i know what study you are referring to i think that's a very bad study for people to use like methodologically um like first of all of course the capitalist countries like none of them they certainly aren't the type of capitalists me and alex uh support but even then um most of these countries like okay for example somalia was under a marxist-leninist military dictatorship and several other countries um let me see here like like literally half the countries honestly like half the countries on the capitalist list were run by socialists and left-wing governments some of the countries on the capitalist list uh had just recently switched to you know capitalism and there's there's just so many issues with this it doesn't account for anything like uh how long the the how long they were into this system not only that but i have issues with some of the measurements they used like infant mortality rate which is measured differently from country to country uh and specifically uh one of the countries that used cuba um there was a a study done it was published in oxford where they examined the infant mortality rate and life expectancy and stuff like that and if you want me to send this to you later i can absolutely do that i don't have it right in front of me right now because i wasn't expecting you to use this um but i do have a ton of sources on this like first of all i have like four studies that counter this one that uh go into much greater detail and have completely opposite conclusions but uh this this paper published in oxford they found that the uh infant mortality rate and the uh life expectancy in cuba didn't mathematically add up like there was major issues with it and they found that um the government was enforcing certain um uh certain like outcomes like they said these you doctors have to have these outcomes or else you're going to jail right so encourage people to lie not only that but you know as far as like infant mortality rate um in cuba uh i think it's like 40 of pregnancies ended in abortion so especially um any any situation where a fetus has any sort of uh physical disability or anything like that where they might die as an infant they're already dead right and those aren't counted as deaths miscarriages aren't counted as infant deaths in cuba whereas in those capitalist countries they are so like and we can go into like every other country and they all have these issues so just comparing those countries like that absolutely isn't valid at all in my opinion and again i can i can give you like four other studies on this very subject that completely disagree with this and they go into much greater detail and have much better methodology i mean that's true in this portion of the debate this was supposed to be tailored towards ethics the ethicality of other systems we presented a logical case of why the non-version principle comes to me right so we want something cryptological case that creates a normative ethics which would be we ought to do this and our system is occasional non-aggression principle right having a system based on that and from there we want to have that system based on pressing property rights that's what the nap is based off of so if your system at its core rejects the principle of a property right then it goes very against the ethical framework we prescribed you'd have to justify why your consequentialist or utilitarian ethical framework um is justified in violating individual rights or the individuals at the property it's uh yeah so at the beginning in my opening statement i said that there is a distinction between private property and uh personal property so again nobody's advocating that they're gonna come take your house um and even small businesses like there's a difference between this personal property and private property private property rights only benefit those that have private property and this is again a minority of people because again the majority of the workforce is made up of workers so when you have a system that protects such a slight few um at the expense of the majority for example in the housing market right now people own multiple houses um this is decreasing the supply of houses jacking up the the prices of the housing market you know a bunch of foreign capital is currently in our um housing market again jacking up the price of um uh house the housing market because the supply is decreased i don't know how you guys feel about um people owning more than one house but uh that is you know and tonight that's the prediction property rights i'm saying that private property is violently enforced by the state that's not just some natural thing that occurs in order to maintain private property rates you need a violent a state with a monopoly on violence in order to enforce those private property rights right there that's your violence if not you know in the 40s and early 1900s socially we would have had socialism already but we but the capitalists have used the state to oppress every proletarian movement all right right let me continue so do you have to stick between private and personal property i don't care there's property rights the right to own property there's no real distinction between private and personal property as both are acquired through two ways episode four one so the way to acquire property is two ways one is to either first appropriating the property through homesteading or voluntarily contractually transferring ownership someone else or truth to political means which would be expropriating that property right those are two ways to actually acquire a property so under my system i don't believe in any expropriation of property i believe in abolishing the political means so i only want to have homesteading and then voluntary exchange the way that property is acquired is through homesteading and voluntary exchange everything else would be anti it's the idea of property rights there was always the property rights are relevant between the decision-making personnel and private that they're really the same thing they homestead property they use that property to employ they'll turn into a capital good they'll employ the production process to produce another good and that's so you'll see like production happen but having like like you're saying a state will print property as i said before an expropriating property protector is a contradiction in terms because a state is a is um as an organization which maintains itself through political means making it very antithetical to the idea of property rights aren't aren't you pro police or i know i know bean is pro police like as as a menarches right okay and the police so you're not anymore being uh so that pro police is like a very uh arbitrary statement um oh i'm not an anarchist anymore i'm a volunteerist um i i don't know what you mean specifically by propolis so i can't say i what am mean is i remember when i first became aware of you i think that you said that you support the idea of taxes funding military courts and police do you still hold that view oh no that was just me saying like as an anarchist i supported the existence of a state that was just the military courts and police not not through taxes but through voluntary taxes so me and bean both believe in voluntarily voluntary contracts with your own so we believe everyone should be self-governed and they're based on self-ownership and just oh it's not ownership then your own products your homestead right so you own property that way right a state by very nature is one that goes against property rights as it is an organization of political means that explodes property we see this to stuff like taxation today um not like um being against free markets against all these different things that well the antithetical is the idea of property rights my system and me being arguably the case and the overall ethicality of our systems is we believe in the protection of property rights through uh through voluntary policing right so this is what i'm saying though if you take the state away so if the state goes away the workers would just rise up and do socialism i mean like take nicaragua for example when you had the sandinistas uh come to power they started what okay let me fish so when the san denises came to power in nicaragua um they were going to give all the factories back to the workers immediately right it had been essentially exploited by multinational corporations like the united fruit company for years and years and years and years the workers rose up they said we're gonna do something um their only option then um they they a lot of them wanted to do socialism right away let's immediately give all the land back to the workers and then some of them said no the us is going to come kill us soon we need to create a state to protect ourselves a worker state and then you had the u.s funding paramilitary death squads in the contras so i'm saying without the the cia to send the contras in to protect the property rights of the multinationals who are exploiting nicaragua you would have had socialism same thing goes for the u.s you had a million card-carrying communists um in the u.s in the early 1900s and the largest wildcat strikes in history and the state came and broke them up you know the workers by now because we are the majority would have demanded socialism if it weren't for the oppressive nature of the state which maintains the system so so i just i completely disagree that people demand socialism socialism is an economically very inefficient system which i'll substantiate in a bit if you want to get to the economic more economic factor of it but if you're like a voluntary society i wouldn't be against like voluntary communist foreign i'd be perfectly fine if everyone agrees voluntarily whatever but the very core principle you guys believe in abolishing all forms of capitalism all forms of private property which would be antithetical to the idea of property rights as property rights imply that i'm allowed to do what i want with my property as long as it infringes the right to other people and it does yeah we don't believe in company rights we reject private property private property is the stem of all the evils of capitalism property it'll always evolve into particularly private property is used to infringe upon people's rights all the time today i mean capitalism especially in today's system and i know you guys don't like that but it seeks short-term profits and it does not account for negative externalities like climate change which negatively affects lower income communities so i mean capitalism which again doesn't care about these negative externalities so this private property is going to be used to harm other people we can go into the economics part of the debate if you guys want like obviously me and alex yeah how long did you guys go i actually got to work at six a.m but i'm down to like eight minutes statement prepared we i mean i okay wait so this part is going nowhere the actual ethical parts he presented our escalation to the start of the debate because of the idea of the non-aggression principle uh and why uh ethical property rights you're gonna try to draw the things between private and personal property which is there's no real distinction in regards to what i view my an idea of rights as humans homestead property they have to own that property property is property it's not going to be private and personal in my view so from that i'll just say that so we should ought to have we are not typically properties that would be antithetical the idea of property rights which comes upon through homesteading and the homestead process to deny one's right to deny one exclusive control for oneself and deny one's own self-ownership you would still be followed to perform the contradiction under on our ethics or argumentation well private there's a there's a big difference between a house and an oil rig right like a private company owning an oil field versus a house that's a huge difference private is used one is used to exploit workers the other is used as a as a house the strict definition in marxist economics is private property is uh property which is used to make more either expand that capital or to make money personal property is your toothbrush i don't use my money and if i own an oil rig that would be private property and my toothbrush would be personal property we're against private property we think everybody should have toothbrushes in fact we should produce them for people who are for homeless people but we don't think people should have private property that the system of production should be publicly owned because that'll work better for the masses and people like you know and socialism is not an ideology for everyone i'm sure this doesn't sound great if your dad owns a business but if you wake up and work for 10 bucks an hour like me um wouldn't you want to create a system um where the private property is owned by the masses rather than a few people who you've never met in your life all right so okay i'm saying that properties in general the house and the factory are both examples of property rights they both have ownership claims to them based in homestead property that has not come through homesteading or voluntary agreement would be um illegitimately owned property through expropriation of property which means you know against we're saying that all these normal normal like normal famous property rights is the idea that we're going by the the idea and my view of rights is irrelevant to the idea because they both want ownership there's nothing in personal property versus private property that makes one of them more interesting to each other so you're you're saying that uh you can't draw the difference between an oil rig and a toothbrush because they both got their basis in homesteading well yeah that's how property is acquired that's the basis of property rights and we said before we still have completely different functions in reality in reality i can own a phone and own a wallet right they're two different things right they're both they're both my property though they're both personal i think you guys are just misunderstanding alex's position he's not trying to say like he we both know the marxist definition of personal and private property he's not trying to say oh it's just the same thing he's talking about our justification for the existence of property applies to both and you guys haven't really provided an actual argument as to why um why it's okay to violate property in one in the one part but it's not okay to violate property in the other because that property was received through uh um a primitive accumulation at first and and then now is maintained like i said by the violent state who protects the property rights of you know mostly people who inherited mostly folks like wyatt ingram coke who was handed an oil empire by his fathers right this is how how private property works and it's passed down through generations and that private property can only make money through the exploitation of the working masses right uh a capitalist can own all the oil rigs he wants if nobody goes and works on him he makes zero money right he needs to have a way to get people to work um which is why you need the state to enforce those property rights otherwise their workers would say let's just take the oil rig for ourselves okay so you want to talk about exploitation theory i'll talk about equalization through yeah we're going to let's get to that but um how long how long are we going to go oh for real i really got to work at 6am you guys for real we can do it again i'll address that's what you have to work the idea of exploitation one in the marxian conception uh i still believe all work is voluntary as there is no one forcing you to work which i have presented multiple times throughout this debate and still got an answer to who is forcing you to work you guys keep drawing these false equivalencies between my ideal system and the current state apparatus of america which is insanely different than what i advocate for in my system there's no one forcing you to live under a state apparatus right um and from this point we will go into exploitation right so if so if work is volunteer which happens instead of case for as there's known forcing you to work that means that the exploitative nature if you call it exploitation or what that still wouldn't be inherently unjust and unethical you want to talk with surplus the offspring of time preference as entrepreneurs input properties first produce goods to get it to get a higher return um no there will be no investment if capitalism entrepreneurs wouldn't get a return higher in the future so it's not a phenomenon of surplus value it's a phenomenal time preference happening in the rate of current with future goods and i don't reject your your idea that work is voluntary it's just like work or die isn't the system that i think is best especially if you know a capitalist is incentivized to get his labors to work as much as possible in order to maximize his profits that's going to be extremely expensive for the laborers even in theory and of course that's what we've seen it be in practice right so not necessarily saying it's involuntary i'm just saying there's a better system all right but but but with the when we're looking at better systems we must look at the ethics ethicality of which is much better versus what is what is good what is bad we have established our frame of logic that property rights is what we or we ought to protect through that train of logic being sent to the start of the debate right so i believe all property should be protected it's not like we'll just think i don't really believe there's distinctions in regard to the property we should protect so it goes to exploitation if you literally concede the idea that work is voluntary then that means that exploitations are relevant in debating the ethics of private property so i mean it's not irrelevant if your voluntary choice choices are work or starve to death i mean you can say technically you know nobody's forcing you to go do it but you have the choice to die i mean sure technically by your your choice of verbiage there it is voluntary but it's still the choice of have your labor exploited for somebody who's going to be making insane profits or die right also you literally agree with my point that so we are we so again we established our idea of property rights that probably aren't about to be protected right so and that's where i guess which it should be publicly owned because that would be better for the masses if the masses own the means of production it's funny because at the beginning uh ben said that we'll be into that workers will address that in two minutes right or get into the private republican ownership and meet the production i'll be happy to debate that right so now when talking about the ethicality of it the property you have said yourself that work is voluntary now so it doesn't go against their ethical framework other that um that a voluntary exchanges right so now we want to get into the problems of a publicly public ownership means production we can't and in problems with communism we definitely can um i just think it was funny at the beginning of the debate uh ben said that under capitalism you get to own the fruits of your labor but you're literally paid a set wage um to work or a set salary um under socialism the profits that you create that you helped create for this public company get redistributed back to you where you quite literally get to own the fruits of your labor i said you own the fruit you own the fruits of your labor and you own your labor so we believe in the labor theory of property or homesteading that we hold some property to get our labor but we're talking about working in terms of like companies when we go to work we voluntarily correctly agree and we use the the employers capital goods to create consumer goods right we're not the sole producers of labor we are part of the production process using our own labor in there return for a wage but also the capital goods national resources going into the production process on input to create an output the idea that labor is like the sole determinant of this value is insane but they also voluntarily agreed to work for it so they are voluntarily giving even if that's presupposed surplus value you are voluntarily giving your value to the person who's employing you yeah with the with the choice of death but i you mentioned theory of value have you seen um paul cockshot's recent video where he takes the input and output tables from all the major industry um in all the major western countries and then he tracks how much they're producing to how much their labor and they find that the equilibrium equilibrium on the supply and demand chart essentially is 94 to 98 percent uh correlated with how much labor is put in so even that that marxist idea that price is determined by labor which isn't even that important to our argument um the labor theory of value holds up and like i said um here's a question i i actually have i have a big question for you is price different than value um price different value um it depends on what kind of value you're talking about so like the overall value of a commodity is it different than price because markets and prices separate from each other right like the use value is different if price and value are different from each other then how can we determine the labor theory of value from a price phenomenon because labor theater value is based on social media social security labor time the individual inputs of labor applied to the outputs this actually doesn't go along with mercenary argument since the price is different than valuable you can't use the price to consume the value of something as marks himself said that value is different than price yeah there's actually a ton of contentions you can have with this argument like a correlation doesn't equal causation also like uh it seems pretty natural that there would be a correlation between a valuable resource and price right i mean if you looked at gold right you would obviously see a correlation between higher prices and higher amounts of gold labor is an important and valuable resource also um okay so these empirical studies do not use actual labor time data to estimate labor content but instead use monetary data from the input output tables so i i have like actually have like a whole thing you know i'm not even gonna bother reading through all this because i think like the things me and alex already said kind of like refutes that point um but like i i had like a whole thing a whole section in our document prepared just specifically for this argument but like i don't even see how that proves anything that that labor is correlated to price that doesn't prove anything about that it doesn't prove it it doesn't bring the labor theory about it through your value it talks about in equilibrium social events related to turning exchange values right but we're not in equilibrium right now we're never going to be in equilibrium first off secondly you just think the difference between value and price right so your input outputs the tables are measuring the input labor in relation to the prices but not in regards to the value based on the s and this and socially necessary labor time which is like you can't quantify as a heterodon it's a heterogeneous it's heterogeneous in nature so socially labor time then you can't aggregate it all into one input so when you talk about the input to outputs with some prices one you're knowing the difference in price and value which makes them self-distinguished and two you're ignoring the social necessary labor time factor the ltv so the most important part about the ltv though is that the capital does not maintain itself without labor right you can have all these discussions about um labor's correlation to price sure and in the modern economy um there's there's a lot of contention about that you know subjective theory of value and whatnot but if the workers withhold their labor the capitalist stop makes stops making money if jeff bezos decides to take the day off and go golfing for the day amazon keeps functioning so then you have a system where the capitalist is reliant on the workers but the workers aren't reliant on the capitalist this is private property in essence well it is because and if the workers themselves or the workers would have organized and said let's take this for ourselves unless you had a violent state to maintain maintain private property rights um so so you can have all these discussions about the labor theory of value and how it can be used to trace price but but the fact remains that labor is what what creates everything we have in society right um hedge fund managers and and stockholders do zero labor if they went away i mean they're essentially parasitic despite the fact that they have an insanely disproportionate amount of power and this is private property you know uh this is this is the current system i'm happy to bring this up in regards to like all right let's talk about this actually in regards to this idea that like the capitalist means workers but workers only capitalist well we have all these different facts in production being land labor capital right the production process is not solely made of labor there's natural resources and capital goods involved in the production process but the thing that puts all these capital goods together is entrepreneurship arch people use the entrepreneurs predict future conditions to market the capital structures to invest and then do this on that the entrepreneurs it puts us all together yeah if you take the labor out of the equation sure there won't be a commodity you need to produce things if you think certain capital goes out of the equation the ultimate will get messed up you take natural resources you get messed up these are necessities the actual value of commodity is based upon actual human actions and individual actors in an economy so individuals will see what they value and entrepreneurs will try to predict that value on people's value and base price is based off of that right so we can't use these like cog shot input output tables to determine labor for your value when it's an antithetic it doesn't like go along with the labor theory of value being through snlt and through the actual situation between value and price you you mentioned that the entrepreneurs the stockholders and shareholders are essential because they determine production but that's part of our argument is that if you allow private property and you allow these people to determine how uh human labor power is used to create what society needs it's going to leave a lot of things wanting which is why we produce enough food for everyone but nine million people starve to death every year because we don't want public ownership of of what we produce so we can't say ah let's feed everyone we can't say ah let's build hospitals actually i mean that's what china did they built hospitals in a matter of days but i mean i mean during the pandemic we've really seen the failure of private property determining production right um we've seen an inability to um i'm happy to talk about private versus public ownership right now one of my favorite things of this is in order to establish a price system you need private property to do so right without prices you have no common unit of measurement to compare different facts of production to determine which facts of production you should employ as inputs in the production process right so that what mechanism can you employ um how can you establish a quantitative relationship based on these different facts of production depending on which is the point which you employ in the production process itself you're saying oh but capitalism production is different things workers are on the means of production but does not address the main problem with it in your system you don't have a price system so you have no mechanism in comparing parts to production to determine which ones go in the which ones go in the production process um so i mean in the soviet union um for example they had they used linear programming basically to to calculate the inputs that they had you know the amount of resources that they had they would determine output based on previous year's demand if it was a little low they would increase output if it was high they would decrease output um they would use constraints they would use how much land they had they would use how much resources they had they would use how much labor they had they would be able to distribute um resources effectively to create um these these goods so in the soviet union uh they they were able to create their 10 000 best um selling commodities using linear programming um which i will admit you know they had hundreds of thousands of commodities that they they were not able to use they also did this with pen and paper um and were still able to very accurately guess the price equilibrium um that these um goods would be selling him so in the soviet union and other soviet bloc countries first of all they utilized uh western prices they looked at other western countries for prices so i mean there is that but also uh allocation losses in the soviet union were three to ten percent right they weren't efficient they weren't productively efficient at all in fact they were very bad in productive efficiency all right let me see the use of raw materials and energy production a lot of this is also due to corruption um where the owners of factories would lobby the government to keep their factory open even if they weren't being productive um like eddie said we're not gonna shy away and say like oh this isn't real socialism like the soviet union was a socialist experiment it didn't work because again the corruption um you know and it was the first socialist experiment and right um right so and this idea that you can't allocate resources correctly i mean one we're going to need a team of scientists and engineers if we're going to create any kind of mode of production that's sustainable with the environment in the 21st century and then two the only country who um increased their production in gdp during the pandemic was china who has the um vast majority of their banks in their major industry are nationalized are centrally planned and yes they use western prices sure but like we're saying we're we aren't trying to jump to socialism this system with no money or i mean communism the system with no money and private property rights tomorrow right it's a transition and the first step in that transition is to seize the oil industry and put a team of scientists behind the production of the energy sector which you can determine you know how do we get energy to places who need it through linear programming and computers as as paul cockshot again has talked about in his uh in his uh lecture on on social on whatever it's called cyber socialism um and then uh i guess that's all i had to say oh yeah and and then eventually you want to get to a system you know where where you you know uh there's no money at all i mean that's the communist goal but it happened slowly and and to act like nationalizing these these major banks and industry which is what matt and i advocate for all of a sudden you're going to be totally unable to to handle production and and determine how to do production i mean china proves that false they kicked the us's ass during covet uh as far as the ussr like i i think it's do you want to go alex or do you want me to finish my points on the ussr when it talks about covid like by what metric and kova deaths or what you know to usually what capital is measured china's the only country you had their gdp increase i mean gdp is relevant to me i don't care gdp okay well well they had very few deaths and they alleviated poverty the year we had you know they they brought their 1.4 billion person out of poverty the year we had a global pandemic as the u.s is in the tank you know letting letting these billionaires and financial oligarchs determine how production's carried out instead of building hospitals we [ __ ] just have let our people die all right so one uh tron has prices two count of the market three trying to have pirate property right there's three conditions that i that like china has that would that these uh by my argument would like be irrelevant too plus that's one thing secondly we're talking about like um what this and the other things linear linear universal linear programming linear programming is a thing that uses that only works in static economies those are linear but economies are ever changing ever they're ever in this equilibrium they're always going to change they're never going to be static they're in a dynamic economy we're always living in a dynamic economy and on top of that linear programming it could tell us how much linear programming could tell us um how using so much more of x instead of y would affect the output but it cannot tell us whether we should use x or y which is the point of which is the point of my argument how do we determine which facts of production to import in the production process there's so many there's so many different types of production we could use in the production process uh and there's so many different things that we are going to use and then from this um we encap and on a capital system we have entrepreneurs who use the private system and facts of the production to to employ facts of production in the production process right so in socialism you are in communism you have no money you have no private property so you have the way of establishing a common unit of measurement between these facts of production to determine which ones to employ in the production process i mean that's never existed before a moneyless stateless classless society so like worse it comes back to this argument we want to transition out of the current system into the next one so so all your preconditions that you say are needed for production yeah that's what exists right now maybe the price is not production but um in regards to pricing we need to have a prices that we'll finish so in particular prices we need a price system to create a quantitative relationship with a common unit of measurement between factors of production we don't have that we can't determine what to input in the production process and i can even empirically prove this the soviet union in 1920 abolish their currency and immediately flaunt they have to go right back with money right because they're trying to build socialism in in a world economy that's dominated by you know production related to prices did you have something to say matt nah i mean i in like eddie keeps saying we're talking about like a transition from capitalism to socialism to communism so again we wouldn't get rid of prices right away we wouldn't get rid of money right away it's a transition to get to this um once it happens right economies are ever changing so you can't use previous conditions from years ago to use in modern economies right you're eventually going to run into that point where you're going to get messed up you won't be able to properly like produce the right things because you want any common denominator to compare production we're saying who determines how production should change and develop is the masses right you have a team of scientists and engineers and programmers who are deciding how production is carried out so you have a global pandemic and they go oh we need to put more production into masks and hospitals um rather than you know allowing whoever owns the means of production to determine to determine production which in the us we've seen them say you know don't stay home from work you can't stay home from work you've got working to make sure the system maintains itself and eventually you could totally move out of a system you know where prices are irrelevant yeah well i mean um you have vast material abundance eddie i've i have several points on what you've brought up about china now first of all i don't think covet deaths actually reflect on whether or not a country is good at allocating productive resources also as alex pointed out china isn't a communist country of course they do utilize central planning as does the us especially like as you mentioned hospitals in the us essentially is uh done through central planning you can't just go and plant a hospital you can't just go and plant a medical center wherever you want you have to go through the government to do that and it's often very difficult so if anything that right there kind of proves our point also as even if uh china china's covet deaths proved anything i don't think i can even remotely trust uh the numbers coming out of china and i've got several notes on this like first of all there were several times when china had to change numbers of cities uh covet deaths like in wuhan at one point they increa they added 50 percent a 50 increase in deaths in one day once some american scientists pointed out that their numbers weren't accurate um also if you go through uh data on cr crematories uh crematories and wuhan and other cities you can see that it completely doesn't add up with how many deaths they said there was you can uh look at the data on how long they were running and how many bodies they actually burn and you can see there was way more dead bodies than they reported and i can send you this stuff later if you want okay also as far as the actual allocation of productive resources china failed miserably on kovid they sent out masks and other equipment which were defective or infected already they were infecting people in other countries with the with the with the resources they were sending out whereas in the us you had you had companies like tesla ford uh gm etc etc you had uh you had breweries making um making hand sanitizer you had all these companies making masks sending them all over the place the productive allocation in the u.s was immaculate in the production of the allocation of productive resources in china was absolutely horrible so you bringing up this point like i mean if you actually look at the facts like i mean this entirely backs up our point and then you even mentioned poverty china utilized the liberalization of their of their economy to attack poverty it is insane to me in the u.s that you know we can look at a country that had 4 600 cova deaths and they have a large much larger population than ours and we have 400 000 cova deaths and our economies in the tanks while their gdp they were the only country in the world whose gdp increased and there's still people in the u.s who just go oh no they are the ones who had it all wrong they must just be lying about the numbers i mean you can prove they lied about the numbers like i can give you the data do you want me to go i mean do you want me to go over it right now and show do the math right in front of you the other the other thing is like this this point was irrelevant to eddie's earlier point he was talking about the economy not kova deaths but the other thing is it doesn't really matter how great our productive resources were allocated because it didn't help right we didn't get masks to people who needed it trump scratched a plan to send three coped masks to every single person in the country um effectively um increasing non-mass wearage yeah yeah the government greatly interfered in the in the allocation of resources like i mean that's i'm not going to argue with that and i'm completely against that the government all the government saying you can't build a hospital in a certain place is not um an example of central planning that would you know if the government had full control over the medical industry and then they decided where you know the resources from the medical industry are allocated that's central planning it's not central planning when the u.s says don't build hospitals in rural areas because you know that's a failure of the profit motive of capitalism you know what you know what the problem is in that scenario that u.s government didn't allow people to build hospitals it's a problem of not respecting property rights if property retros respected would people would be allowed to build hospitals whenever they please long those on their own property well when you had that in cuba when when property rights were respected and it was essentially um everything was a lot there were no hospitals in the escond bride in the areas where the rural presents were living there were no hospitals and there were full private property rights the police had full control um and and they didn't you know and and you can read about it and chase motorcycle diaries he's traveling across latin america and watching people die um because there's no hospitals built for the peasants in the rural areas and that's a problem in america too is you know that because it's not profitable so if you have this market system the idea that capitalists out of the goodness of their own heart are just going to build hospitals everywhere where people need them is ridiculous they're going to put them in the cities where there's people who are going to pay to use the hospital okay right and things so one when in cuban history did they have the protection of property rights under batista i was staying under the wait batista the person who had slavery under his regime the plantation owners had slaves right that was their do you think capitalists are going to put hospitals in rural areas where there's nobody who's going to go but they still need them entrepreneur even in like a small relationship entrepreneurs will do it okay this is this is also the problem of investing in lower income areas too lower income areas that are mostly occupied by people of color in lower income areas there's not as much investment because entrepreneurs know they're not going to get as much business there that's a problem of entrepreneurship that's a problem of not putting hospitals in these areas that's a problem of um again just a lack of investment in lower income communities okay let me let me explain it like this okay what happens when people are stuck at home when people are dying when people are getting sick and they can't go to work and our economy fails what happens to the rich people they fail too everyone fails because in an economy everyone is connected right so it is completely in the entrepreneur's best interest to help people and exactly i just i gave you several examples earlier of companies producing these resources and giving them out for free in order to help people right and there are so many companies like uh my own bank right they called me several times and they're like are you having any trouble with paying your car insurance bills will help you if you have any trouble they weren't required to do that by law but they do that because number one i mean people help people out the goodness of their own hearts number two that helps you keep consumers for the future number three that helps you keep the economy going and not failing because if it fails then you are going to fail too and yes right people will put out medical resources people will help people but that was greatly restricted by our own us government but even then we still saw a lot of great successes like i already pointed out right the us took the dumbest way possible they shut people down and then they also didn't give people economic help to to you know spend money in small businesses in their communities they didn't issue a mass mandate to keep people safe in order to you know frequent businesses within the area and and you're pointing out how businesses gave stuff away for free i mean that's a great addition i mean i mean 400 000 people died even though businesses were trying to give people stuff for free because they still needed those people in the workplaces to continue their profit because of private property to continue expanding their profits so people died because they caught covet at work and now we have the most coveted deaths of any country business doesn't work look at tyson chicken in our in my home state of iowa we had 1300 workers at tyson chicken tyson not wanting to lose out on profit kept their workers coming in they had 1100 workers out of their 1300 workers get infected with covet they had something like 70 deaths because this private company didn't want to shut down didn't want to make sure that these people were saved they'd rather work at the profit mode if that again shows that you know not everybody's going to do stuff out of the goodness of their heart some people are motivated by greed some people are motivated by money um and do you guys want to respond to that and then can we table this i mean for later i really gotta i i'm sorry i got to work but yeah if you want me to respond to that if you want me to respond to that exact point then i i don't see how you're saying the company kept people coming i mean people went to work because they wanted to keep working because i mean that alternative is deaf yeah not wages they did that in germany you keep people home because we're in a global pandemic you keep people home because we're not a global pandemic okay number one uh paying people from the government doesn't actually keep the economy going so that doesn't really make sense that's why that's why consumer um spending went up 17 percent even assuming you're right right there right there's still many other issues you have to deal with but you have to deal with the excess deaths from uh depression and just being at home even if you are being paid being unemployed increases your chance of death by 80 percent just like as a as a human being by 80 percent right um and it greatly decreases your uh your lifespan also people weren't able to go to important doctors meetings like there was you have to realize covet deaths aren't the only deaths we're dealing with in the pandemic there are tons of excess deaths just in the united kingdom they were going to have as many deaths just from heart attacks as they had from covid just because they had to close out people from getting to vital uh vital uh doctors meetings right okay but that doesn't just prove that making people go to work caused them to catch covet at work i mean they yes i'm sorry i could have not gone to work the entire pandemic and i would be living on the streets that's a much more a much better option when you have a global pandemic eddie earlier in the debate you conceded that work is voluntary yes volunteer okay we're in a pandemic a system that gives you the choice between go to work and possibly die of deadly illness or go live on the streets is not a good system you should have a system of public ownership that takes care of you yeah i mean i mean cuba's economy failed even worse than ours so i mean deaths no they had they had significantly uh more coveted cases than that i actually have notes on cuba as well and how their numbers are inaccurate if you want me to go over that as well they're all inaccurate everyone that forcing people to go to work in a pandemic those are all inaccurate they all lied i mean yeah unironically unironically yes right and there's no western media hegemony either the western media is not trying to pitch any kind of narrative no i didn't go through western media i did my own like i mean western media doesn't agree with me and alex's points on this like i mean they supported lockdowns and stuff like that like i'm talking about you have to realize there's things like excess deaths there's things like economic ruin which ultimately can cause even worse conditions for people than a uh than a virus and the us is doing the worst and all those all those places where you where you would measure how people handled the pandemic the us has the most deaths and our economies in the tanks and and and your only refutation to that is every other country lied about their deaths i mean i didn't say that europe nationalized their wages they kept people at home they mitigated outside mandated masks all right one more please i'll let you guys have the last word please and then i really got to go to bed and we can do the economics argument in a week or something let me just go on like a two-minute thing on all the points please question originally started and my question has still not been answered on how can we establish an objective link between these different factors of production with a common denominator to determine inputs in the production process you guys immediately once said oh look at china with the cover look at the ussr again i showed 1920 ussr the lost money immediately failed and then if we establish it recently communism is moneyless even if you have money now when you achieve your cognitive society you get rid of money economies are economies are dynamic and then disequilibrium they are never in equilibrium if we hadn't if we had a static equilibrium for the whole time sure i'd agree with you that's irrelevant but since we're always in a disequilibrium and our economy is dynamic and every change right and it's inefficient capital value's ever changing then we can't use previous conditions from the price system and transition it over to the current system so once you abolish money you still need some way to establish an objective link between facts deducting to determine inputs and also you're saying how america's economy went down all these different things but that was because of the lockdowns right the defense policy in regard in response to kill and the government's overall economic response was not good you guys said right high fiscal spending we had small little bits but i disagree with the overall idea of fiscal stimulus i think it would i think it'd be like something like short-term gain for long-term pain and it's just not realistic to just stop a country's production i mean that's that's pretty vital to keep people alive as well i mean i i completely recognize the dangers of covet and the people who died from it but again i'm saying just focusing on one aspect of that is very dangerous like i mean again like like i pointed out as many deaths from heart attacks because of the lockdown that's just one cause one cause as many deaths as covet deaths in the uk because of lockdowns one more thing on top so you're saying oh we have to work during covet to like maintain ourselves so do you guys propose that everyone just stops working under communism under a pandemic or what because these people still need to produce different things people will still have to work even in a pandemic in your ideal system if you don't everyone's going to die for overdoses mass mandate mass mandate and we're saying it couldn't be like right so this this happened all over the place and there were multiple people who sued the fda because they were going to meet packing companies and they weren't catching kovid because their bosses weren't enforcing any protections you have people go to work but you have strict protections and force you got to be six feet away you got to have ppe and if your employer can't provide you with ppe you don't go to work and then when you manage production you build hospitals in the places where the breakout was the worst i mean that's what china did they built a series of hospitals in five days and that's what the u.s has the inability to do because you know a system of private ownership doesn't have anything to say when there's a pandemic right it's if it doesn't stop profits they don't care and and if they sell an extra you know body bag that that ups the gdp and that if you have things publicly owned you know they function like schools or whatever else you you can manage how production is carried out um including the production of your essential industries things like meat packing that being said can't go away um that you need to maintain society you know if it's publicly owned you can do it in a safe way if it's privately owned the capitalist is gonna pack you on the meat packing line because he doesn't give a [ __ ] if you get covet he'll just go hire someone else do you unders do you understand how profits work you're saying oh it's it's not going to do anything profitable what is profitable is what is at the demand of the consumers right this is like i see a lot of marxists do this in general in the debates like regards to markets and profit motives they argue that capitalists and entrepreneurs will produce different things and then from that um they're gonna like people are gonna have to buy from them and work for them no it's not how it works entrepreneurs have to judge the demand of the consumers and then adjust to those demands i'm not even talking i was talking about the laborers though who worked for them i wasn't even talking about consumers i was saying production is carried out so that they can make it profitable to consumers which means putting people side by side on on meat packing lines in a global pandemic also i mean yeah it's great for consumers but now people are dead yeah when labor happens people who do labor is also making some form of profit all all voluntary exchanges are mutually beneficial all action is to achieve a higher value end and to achieve a higher state of affairs than before so humans apply means to achieve ends and my means will be like oh i'll employ labor to make money my means is labor and my end is great so because you believe voluntary exchanges to be good in the abstract if i make the voluntary exchange to go to work on a meat plaquing plant and i catch covet and die that's just good because it was voluntary well in terms of wait but i'm saying that all if you're going to work at that point that is better than all the options you could do this isn't a priority true statement based on praxiology but in regards to normative ethics um we have earlier in the debate we established our idea of the nap the conclusion of the nap is to have non-aggression on people's property so from there we can deduce my system and my idea of voluntary exchanges all right all right and by the way having people having your workers catch covet is not profitable in fact it's quite the opposite yeah right that's why they hey why you need the reserve army of of unemployed people if the worker gets coveted papaya you're fired no union for you the state crushed your union laws i'll just go hire some other guy so i really gotta go to bed i don't um i know there's one day we'll have this world with no state and everyone will just get along um let's do uh you guys want to do the economics argument some other time yo we could do it on art no john shut up yeah i mean we kind of went into some of it that time but i mean there's plenty of more it's definitely a possibility yeah okay i i do appreciate talking to you guys i appreciate that you clarified some things for me because i was reading the what did i read i read the new libertarian manifesto um and i was a little confused at some points about what you guys actually believe so it's nice to clarify yeah and if you want i can send you some of the uh various sources i mentioned on you know cuba china whatever one more thing what so what are you like i know you're a voluntarist alex but ben what are you now yeah i'm the same thing volunteers voluntary is that different from agarist uh algorithm is a form of left market anarchy and which it has like specific like ways of achieving its society it is compatible with volunteers voluntarism it is someone who abides by the voluntary principle and through and the property rights that everything should be voluntary okay gotcha i read that i can't remember the guy's name but the yeah it was about agarism all right well i'm out i appreciate you guys thank you oh can i upload this on my youtube dude once it's up for sure all right we'll see you later
