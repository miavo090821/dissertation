like why are you so obsessed with me kids are confused enough when they're growing up I think to add gender confusion to that is going to destroy 15 people for everyone it's safe I'm not going to go along with the general societal willingness to rewrite basic facets of human nature and human biology and frankly mammalian biology [Music] first off yo mention the click I'm sorry I'm sorry let me chill first off Elon Musk no I'm serious he's a raggedy [ __ ] and it's important that we leave with disrespect boom he spent 44 billion dollars buying Twitter just to make himself the center of attention because he couldn't determine another way to keep us all locked in on the human manifestation of spoiled milk that is his person so he took over Twitter on October 27 2022 and since then baby Twitter has been crumbling like King's land and after Daenerys ran through there like the Tomb Raider baby elon's groupie hoes insisted he took over Twitter to Champion but they and everybody else knew he was only ever doing this to quad Progressive movements because the powerful resent the kind of mass mobilization Twitter has been used to create so on top of riddling the app with a million glitches he has neither the intention or ability to correct Elon has re-platform bigots like James Lindsay and Jordan Peterson he suspended leftist accounts like that of my own leftist Mafia co-host Matt Bender he's promoted right wing tweets and accounts all over everyone's feed he's had the Twitter Engineers go out of their way to game the algorithm to boost his own whack-ass tweets and most recently just the dad any idea did this ever gave a damn about Free Speech would have just rolled out an updated terms and services allowing them to suspend or ban anyone at any time for any reason you raggedy [ __ ] but wait there's more because there's always more he also quietly removed the policy against the targeted misgendering or dead naming of transgender individuals and that really brings me to the Crux of this video the mythical [ __ ] the nut ass right comes up with to harass the trans people and satiate their transphobic asses while distracting everyone from the serious issues the trans Community actually faces but serious issues you might ask oh I mean I don't know maybe the fact that there's been a 93 increase in track homicides of trans and gender non-conforming individuals in the United States in the last four years and that while only 13 of the transgender Community is estimated to be black black Trans women make up 75 percent of all trans victims but you wouldn't know that if you let the right tell it if you let the right tell it before Elon Musk Twitter was LG violating your goddamn American right to call people whatever the [ __ ] you want you bigot [ __ ] they strummed up that particular straw man argument back when Jordan Peterson got mad who's Jordan Peterson if you let Republicans tell it Jordan Peterson got banned because he merely dead named Elliot page here's what this Mr Crocker ass [ __ ] actually said foreign politics can be boiled down to this lion lion and lying like [ __ ] because it's about distraction and I cannot think of a place that's better Illustrated than in their obsession with the Trans Community Republicans are obsessed with feeding the public fictional controversies about the trans Community because while we the public are busy scratching our heads and feeling annoyed at why they're being waterboarded with seemingly irrelevant [ __ ] like the right to dead name people on Twitter you never come to learn that as of April 14th legislators have introduced more than 400 anti-trans bills thanks and it introduced 165 bills like it last year thanks and at least 29 of those anti-trans bills introduced in the past three and a half months have already become law thanks while they're busy distracting me with stupid Twitter [ __ ] Missouri attorney general Andrew Bailey hasn't just gone to the trouble of releasing an emergency regulation that says recommending or providing gender affirming care is an unfair deceptive fraudulent or otherwise unlawful practice under state law and that'll take effect April 27th and expire February 6 2024 the law will prevent transgender people of all ages from getting gender affirming Health Care without having exhibited three years of a quote medically documented long-lasting persistent and intense pattern of gender dysphoria in other words one of the requirements is that trans people have their doctors declare they're mentally ill it's an evil world we live in and let me be clear the intention is for no trans person to have access to gender affirming care the stated exceptions are Just an Illusion he says he's doing this to protect children I hope that y'all don't fall for this I hope y'all don't get brainwashed about this no this is criminalizing the existence and presence of trans people and I'm not being hyperbolic he's gone to the trouble of creating a complaint form on the Missouri government website where you can file a complaint if you see a trans person this has never been about protecting children and they know that even one of the kings of transphobia himself your boy Jordan Peterson knows good and well the population of trans kids are negligible and I just thought mathematically right away it's like the chance you have a trans kid is one in three thousand that's not a very high chance listen this ain't nothing more than good old-fashioned unabashed bigotry that's the reason now to protest in Bud Light because they saw a trans person drink a beer what what what's the protest what's the protest okay what's the protest really about they saw a trans person drink a beer and now they mad who they protected not children children not drinking Bud Light now are they whether it's fighting for their right to dead name trans people on Twitter pretending gender affirming care is the nightmare looming over the shoulders of children everywhere or most recently bemoaning about the post-traumatic stress disorder they're still recovering from since the last time they were forced to use a pronoun at gunpoint while the boogeyman call them a birthing person I am a woman do notice how I announce that silly [ __ ] to you and I neither burst into flames or got mauled down by a group of angry trans people with pitchforks that's because trans people and absolutely nobody on the left gives a flying flock whether CIS women refer to ourselves as women we are not being forced to refer to ourselves as birthing person by trans people or anyone else it is a non-existent controversy strummed up by Republicans and anti-trans folks so that a society that is already reluctant to change inclusion and just generally anything requiring a little bit of effort feels justified in lashing out at a community of people who are just trying to survive because they perceive them as a burden Republicans are not creating these fictional Arguments for shits and giggles listen the average person does not have the benefit of being tapped into every political issue social justice movement and the ongoing flights of communities they perhaps never come into contact with in their real lives so they are consumers they trust that they'll be presented with the major issues and realities from the news and their elected officials so if they're being waterboarded with fictional controversies meant to paint the trans Community is whiny premium Don is trying to torture us all with the hell on Earth that is inclusive language they'll believe it and then the trans Community is laughs with no support no allyship while Republicans run around passing all kind of anti-trans laws and make it impossible for them to exist believe me when I say to you trans people are just as annoyed if not more annoyed than you are by the wall-to-wall media coverage devoted to trivializing their community and their plight please trust that they are not trying to force anything on you trust that the least of the negativity they experience is having you their pronouns and that they could care less about what you or I choose to call ourselves as CIS people hang it up and be serious otherwise you look a lot like Elon Musk The Conch Shell of the [ __ ] week like okay everybody's heard of a whack-ass regular kangaroos but have you heard of tree can be kangaroos live in the Trees of New Guinea they are slow and clumsy on the ground but in the trees baby they Excel they've got thicker feet so they can walk about the trees and do little tree kangaroo [ __ ] they're endangered but we love them foreign
