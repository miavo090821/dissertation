what's up guys is the actual justice warrior here and god damn I've been gone a long time real quick the reason I thing on it because I've had a personal issue in my family that I've needed to attend to so these past three weeks I've been outside of my home state dealing with that since the world kind of set itself on fire since I've been gone I thought it would be a cool idea to recap the things that I've missed and haven't gotten to talk about Syrian dictator Bashar al-assad launched a horrible chemical weapons attack on innocent civilians using a deadly nerve agent Assad choked out the lives of helpless men women and children tonight i ordered a targeted military strike on the airfield in syrian from where the chemical attack was launched that's right the United States is now bombing Syria apparently Bashar al Assad used chemical weapons against his own people again just a few days after the trump administration signal that Assad should stay in power and Trump responded by bombing an airfield where the chemical weapons apparently departed from now this is just off a lot of people who voted for Trump on the idea that he is better on born peace then Hillary Clinton and since he made it clear during the campaign that he had no interest being involved in Syria this is a broken campaign promise however I be wrongheaded not to point out a few things first off I never believed that Donald Trump was as not an interventionist as I personally am I always believed that he was more prone to war than other candidates in the race and he did not embrace a non-interventionist foreign policy and when compared to Hillary Clinton who wanted to start bombing Syria and execute a no-fly zone on day one he was the better alternative it's unfortunate that when you vote for change especially in the foreign policy arena you get it for about two months and then it kind of revert back to the previous foreign policy this is also pissed off a bunch of you on the left because this is what they voted for Hillary Clinton and they've been saying that Donald Trump is Russian puppet and now that he's kind of pissed off Russia that narrative is kind of being thrown to the wayside now the less has been backed into a corner because essentially they are in alignment with Trump they had to come up with two stupid narratives not equally stupid narratives but too stupid narratives to counteract their obvious alignment with Donald Trump on the issue of Syria the first is about the refugees and basically this narrative goes like this if you bombed Syria but don't take in refugees then your policy is hypocritical this of course is ridiculous because it's akin to saying that if you don't want to see a homeless person getting murdered then you have to have them live in your house I'm sorry go no a policy on Syria and a policy about refugees from Syria may be related but they don't necessarily need to go hand-in-hand if the bombing in Syria is done in such a way that would prevent a thought from targeting his people that would in fact create less refugees and then you wouldn't have to take them in the second way the left is dealing with this it's full blown Alex Jones conspiracy theories it's perfect just perfect I wish it wasn't if Vladimir Putin if if if Vladimir Putin masterminded the last week in Syria he has gotten everything he could have asked left Larry Putin said I have an idea go ahead do a small chemical attack nothing nothing like the big ones you've done in the past just big enough to attract media attention so that my friend in the White House will see it on TV and then Donald Trump can fire some missiles at Syria that'll do no real damage and then the American news media will change the subject from Russian influence in the Trump campaign and the Trump transition and the Trump White House oh yeah oh boy yeah you heard that right MSNBC not some fringe left the [ __ ] blog or something like that it's actually promoting the idea that Trump and Russia coordinated the 10 weapons attack jet so Trump to bomb Syria and look good and not aligned with Russia I really have nothing to say about this other than the fact that if the right was doing something like this and the right does do stuff like this the left would be covering it non-stop here we have the mainstream media promoting the idea that Trump was involved in the coordination of a false flag operation next up in foreign policy news we have the mother of all bombs being dropped breaking news out of Afghanistan according to a pentagon spokesman the United States has dropped a massive bomb on an Isis cave it is the largest non-nuclear bomb it's ever used in combat and we about 21,000 pounds it was dropped on a mountainous area in Afghanistan said to be an Isis stronghold the reason the bomb wait so much is because it hasn't penetrate and collapse underground tunnels within the mountain the mom also had a blast radius of about a mile it's actually the largest conventional which shift means non-nuclear weapons ever dropped by the United States this of course has led to cheers from Trump supporters cawing a strong national defense and criticism from liberal saying that he's a madman who just dropped this bomb like a crazy person of course both of these reactions are inaccurate and then sanely partisan the ball is actually brought into Afghanistan under the Obama administration and considering the bomb is designed specifically to target mountainous regions like the one that it's hard it is I have to believe that Hillary Clinton we're in losses this bottom would have been dropped by her it's important to realize that most foreign policy actions taken in the first hundred days or even the first year of a new presidential administration have more to do with continuity than the actual person in charge a lot of these plans were set up by Obama and it's not like Trump is going to redo all these plans in an instant there are some instances like Syria where it was a reaction to a specific event but that's the exception to the rule not the rule itself most of the time it's going to be like this Afghanistan bomb something that was either already planned out or just started under the Obama administration that was finished by the Trump administration while the current President does have to okay the strike you have to understand that this comes from planning from the previous administration anyway so that's just a quick recap on the foreign policy issues that miss would I like the theme Donald Trump turned into a more non-interventionist direction yes did I expect him to become a Rand Paul non-interventionist hell the [ __ ] no so if you're surprised by this then maybe you're not paying attention if you're saying he's just as bad as Hillary that actually has not been proven to be true yet and remember she wanted to start bombing Syria immediately she wanted to remove Assad immediately so this chemical attack persuades Trump to pursue that course of action then voting for him really did only by this country about two months of not getting involved in the Syrian war anyway I just want to say thanks for watching I really appreciate the nice comments that you guys have been leaving me on my videos while I was gone I did look at them every now and again even though

actual justice warrior until next time
