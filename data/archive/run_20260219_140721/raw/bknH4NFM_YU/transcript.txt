[Music] e e Noah Noah can you hear me you're muted I am so sorry everybody uh I'm very stupid um Daniel just told me I've been muted this whole time uh this guy says just let me find out yeah apparently I didn't know I was m muted um but oh Jesus all right you change that to say Bozo for apparently I I am a bu all right so let's let's talk about something something very important right let's talk about Wizards screw what I was going to do we're gonna talk about wizards they are everywhere these days right they're at our schools uh they're on our social media in our churches all right maybe they're not in our churches as I'm pretty sure they're you know not allowed to because of Satan or or whatever but still you guys have to have noticed this too right that Wizards are seemingly around every corner these days and they're all like hanging out on street corners singing doo-wop like a like a parents idea of a bad crowd in the 50s you know in those big long dresses they wear with the Stars and the moons all over them right I just I don't trust them man there's something that's just Shifty about them you know it's something off you never know what they're hiding under those big floppy hats and long white beards right it could be anything it could be a knife it could be a magic spell or or or anything even another wizard probably you guys know what I'm talking about right there's just something weird about him just o and people wonder why I talk about needing a sword you got to have a sword if you want to slay Wizards right like that's common knowledge you don't even need to know anything about Marxism anyway um Carlos is probably going to be very angry about this grinds my gears he told me a while ago that the wizard jokes weren't funny but I can't help it man they they grind my gears look for real like for real for real it's a problem of the fake left right and I know that sounds stupid but hear me out they seem to think that just by uttering the right you know magic words or wishing hard enough or casting the right magic spells that they can change reality and that just ain't how it works son it ain't I'm also very skeptical of mind reading have you ever noticed how much Wizards always try to read your mind and I mean it wouldn't matter much I guess if they got they're like they're like their their eyes of noes and mushroom bruise or or whatever it makes it takes to make their spells right if they got that right because they do it very poorly you know uh this this sort of is like the area that online wizards live in right uh you'll say something like I like dogs and then they'll go into a tpost thread just ranting about how they can't believe you hate cats and it's possibly the dumbest thing that I have ever ever seen and I see a lot of dumb things believe me everything you say they try to twist it right and turn it into something else all through a very silly attempt at reading your mind it's like brother I'm right here you can literally just ask me whatever you want you know like you don't have to go through all all this nonsense and I bet getting eyes of NES is probably difficult not to mention gross right I I had one of these Wizards earlier today trying to tell me that the fact that my personal heroes are all male is actually because I don't know about female Communists and it actually means I'm also a misogynist oh and in case I didn't mention it yet you got it all wizards are wokes it's part of the initiation I think you know in order to get inducted into the guild or whatever you need extensive de I training that's a fact but look I don't I don't think it's unreasonable for a man to have male Ro models right just as a majority as a general rule just like I don't think it's unreasonable for a woman to have female role models I mean don't get me wrong there's room for anything and everything there you know but these Wizards trying to cast their magic spells at me right and tell me that I need to you know disrespect and tokenize women by inorganically adding a woman to my list of Heroes just because she's a woman is never going to work I think I might be magic proof in that way it doesn't matter how many magic words you you lob at me during your rent right it doesn't change reality because at the end of the day your spells they just kind of suck um and they no longer work on people really is what I'm getting at the people the American people gave the woke Wizards a giant chance we heard you out we sympathized and you blew it with all this scolding and trying to force people to patronize entire genders like you do sorry wizards not going to work not on this Barbarian so I'm going to make you guys a promise along with being a 100% Bozo free show we are going to Institute a zero tolerance policy for wizards and Magic on Noah's show from now on you will never have to put up with some Shifty dude sitting in the back of the chat with a Long White Beard telling you that liking pancakes means you're sexist against waffles or whatever the Dei manual says but I don't know am I crazy seriously am I crazy Wizards are a Scourge right who carries around a stick for no reason right oh sure it's a wand right I believe you that's a stick you you you can't fool me that's all there is to [Music] it and we're back and I I didn't put the right background on but that's okay the Wizards are still grinding my gears and the fact that you know I screwed up the intro without audio uh that also grinds my gears so I don't know um maybe there is one magic spell I could use in that like you know get rid of that like three minutes of quiet at the beginning of the stream anyway yeah I'm Noah what's up everybody it's my show and this is the guy who actually runs the show Daniel Gutierrez our producer how you doing tonight Daniel yeah not bad not bad um it's a new Showtime we're going live at 6 p.m. Eastern Standard Time so it's it's a beautiful sunset uh you know happening right now now in New York City um yeah it's a beautiful day it's uh beautiful weather I got some exercise in right before the show um we had an amazing anti-war event in the city yesterday so yeah and just like busy working on stuff ACP just like all the time it's great it it's it's uh crazy how many millions of little things there are to do in regards to any project for the party I I have been nonstop uh moving for months I think over the last two months I've gotten maybe like three hours overall just to relax like everything else has been constant movement um I I right before this I was trying my best to finish up a paper that was due days ago for the journal and that I'm just so behind on it's just like everything's pouring out at once but it's Monday and we always make time for the show because your calls are very important to us well I want to hear about the anti-war rally um I heard there was some drama with some possible Wizards yeah there was some um yeah there was some annoying leftist Wizards apparently that that decided to interfere with our uh our first uh event location so yeah um we announced the event a few days ago and um pretty quickly the uh uh the owner of the event space uh was deluged with uh with I guess annoying phone calls about how we were Nazis and how they you know like we were not to be trusted and blah blah blah so so they said yeah like we're going to pass or we're not gonna we we you know we have some people that are telling us some pretty ridiculous things so we ended up finding another location and ended up working out just fine let me let me interrupt you real quick Daniel so basically what you're saying is that some Wizards called in and tried to cast a magic spell to turn us into to turn a a an anti-war rally put on by the Communist Party into somehow something to do with Nazis yeah yeah that's a lot of uh there's a lot of really annoying uh Angry uh you know sort of wizards with way too much time on their hands that apparently uh can't do anything productive their magical powers and just decided to waste everybody's time no kidding if I had magical powers I'd be helping put the anti-war rally on I mean stopping War like look we all know that Wizards are bloodthirsty monsters right they literally drink baby's blood that's how they survive but like I mean come on it let's say like one of you either you or I accidentally um got turned into a wizard somehow right I would use my power uh like like the old saying goes like for good or for awesome right I would say I would use it for awesome but I I don't get it like why would you want to shut down a rally that is against War what kind of weirdo does that well I've been reading I've been studying uh a book that we that I've come across before through the midwestern marks Institute which is Hans York mohler's you and your profile and it's an interesting book uh that kind of there's an example there um about it's it related to the Jesse Smet incident which was really interesting moment where you actually had people who were like quote unquote Progressive who were like upset that Jesse Smet I guess potentially lied about being attacked by White supremacists and and you know sort of anti-gay bigots um and they would have they preferred the reality of of him being like attacked by violent you know neo-nazis I guess to a reality where they weren't neo-nazis and that's just a contradiction that a lot of leftists deal with because their whole identity is based on their opposition to these like you know quote unquote Neo-Nazi forces that um that we represent because we threaten their Identity or their profile as like the real left I suppose I think uh I I said something earlier that the the left is dead long live the left and I think what it is is look the middle classes are dying and their their hold over what activism means is going away whether they like it or not right and I mean honestly we would love to have nothing to do with them I I would be fine just Live and Let Live I would be fine if they're actually against war or or for the class struggle and the working class like the actual working class let's do some stuff together e right but because their like sort of position is fading away and like it's becoming clear as the legitimacy of the institutions of the ruling class crumble that they're kind of one of them you know that this Outlet of activism for its own sake you know how many people can we get to attend a rally that changes nothing that kind of thing right um is is being revealed as something of an illusion right that uh at least in the eyes of its participants but on the level of understanding how the the complex of of American culture worked in the late 20th century and going into the early 21st that it was actually part of what propped up the the the sort of uh superstructure in our society that they could you know go to a protest feel like they've done something and go home feeling good about themselves which is a natural human need we need to feel good about our ourselves and if something's bad it's good to feel like we've we we've made a difference but as we sorry about the ramble I'll be brief um as we go and continue on and see like things are just getting worse like there's no way to deny that right the the the ruling class is literally marching is towards nuclear destruction right now which is insane they're literally carrying out a genocide right now which is also insane so people like their their illusion of that breaking has to search for some sort of controllable element they can blame it on right and if the Resurgence of the communist movement like a real Marxism leninism that that's you know that that uh claims partisanship on behalf of the proletariat the the the working class as it exists as this forms it becomes sort of a focal point of trying to fill the void that they couldn't and I can understand that resentment develops out of that um I just genuinely wish that they could put the things they say they care about and believe in before their own egos right because at the end of the day that's ego and I'm not saying that to be dismissive but to genuinely try to understand where it comes from no 100% And it's not like everybody doesn't have like an ego to contend with I mean that's like we all have an ego but I certainly do certainly and I do too but that's not really what we're talking about is we're talking about someone we're talking about people who are actually just like are are very uh specifically like refusing to like just look at what they say they believe and like and actually living up to that and we're also looking at people who are like not willing to just like have an honest uh yeah case in point we're looking at people that just like just aren't open to to discussion or yeah and and we're open to discussion we're here we're open to critique look we have a show can call in critique us that's what it's for I think it's funny that like no one's actually done that so far um they all see look I think maybe what it is is that magic doesn't work through live stream right maybe there's something about live stream or the sword that my wife just got for me that you know combats it right that they can only do it on X uh or maybe they're they they their sticks that they carry everywhere don't work I don't know I'm stupid don't listen to me Daniel why do you ever listen to me um look look I think that like it's what what really is sad about it is if you look at historically how communist movements have developed out of the uh the the failed attempts at revolutionaries preceding them right like the the Bolsheviks coming out of the the failures of the SRS and the nck and and every and splitting from the menix right um what you see is these people that genuinely want to be revolutionaries ending up on the side of the ruling class now enough left SRS joined the bulvik right but look what happened to all the menik they ended up siding with the ruling class and being left in the Dustbin of history and I feel like a lot of these and a lot of it is like old people praying on younger people and their lack of knowledge right which really grinds my gears but I feel like a lot of these younger people they're getting radicalized because of the conditions they find themselves in their middle class life that they got promised ain't an option they're repr proletarianized so if they could actually like somehow find a way to break out of these liberal dogmas that they've all been told are Marxism or communism and simply begin educating themselves they could join us they could one day be good Communists in the party if that's the route they want to go down or at least support the class struggle as it sort of concretizes into what it'll become in the 21st century going forward yeah no uh 100% um and I think that that's that's that's one of the big things that's being exposed right now is that you know we're calling for we're calling for Unity we're calling for like a broad class Coalition um we're not saying everybody has to be like a like a hardcore Marxist list like you know like ACP members are but um we're not going out there picking fights with people we're not going out there starting stuff um you know uh with other parties and stuff that the other other parties and people from different organizations and a lot of people without any organizational affiliation are starting stuff with us and we're just trying to defend ourselves um you know yeah and that's pretty all it is I think that's like one of those dogmas I was just talking about is this notion that class struggle happens when you can get everyone to agree with what you say that ain't how it works you know like uh the the Communist party now is built on results we all don't agree on everything we don't need to right we agree on the premises of Marxism leninism and from there it takes creativity right um and and that's what's important I will also say though that the other thing it takes is a a strong aversion to Magic and a ruthless ruthless struggle waged against wizards of all types and we will talk about that and so much more after this aser is a hard man to be high Shar is his only plan he digs through Pockets takes what he can for he's high sh haard he caught me one and here what he said you look like a russan and you look like a red and if you're fond of your skin and your head bew the high share the h [Music] [Music] the answer is simple the answer is clear we all get together ain't got nothing to fear we throw the old bastard right out on his earwell to her [Music] Sher all right welcome back everybody uh I'm excited for tonight's show we got some good calls lined up uh we're going to get to it in just a minute here but uh before that Jaden it's a Callin show dum dum you got something to say call in and say it it ain't hard unless you're afraid which most Wizards are just saying I got my eye on you Jaden I got my eye on you anyway allow me to share my screen real quick because we don't want to screw up again so there we go Daniel why don't you tell us who our first caller is please brother hey Noah uh we got our old friend neot the p is that actually how it's pronounced is it NE [ __ ] I apologize the swear is it neot neot nalot did I get it yep so Noah I have some very important questions for you I bet you do so how did the uh witch get a new familiar um I don't know orders it through the black catalog all right all right I don't I don't usually I get those I don't even know if I get that one right but well I'm here for it either way what's up brother what do you what do you got for us tonight well the more serious question is I know that there's some historians of Technology like to say that there was three prior industrial revolutions the first one with steam second with electricity and the third one with uh Information Age and the fourth one depends on who you ask AI automation all the All That Jazz but in each case what were what were the most important trades and professions and if prior experience of say the pret the proletariat in each era and it TR and its transformation was any indication what lessons might we draw from the past and apply in the present with repolarization that's a really really good question um all right let me so a lot of marxists put quite a lot of emphasis on the spinning journey and the steam engine right as a sort of backbone of what drove Industrial Development forward right but I go a little further a little deeper than that um the spinning jenny W was a transformative invention don't get me wrong it was but what did that spinning jenny require in order for the the British Empire's textile mills which were like the the backbone of uh international trade of the day uh which created global capitalism right um what were those what did those require right and that is cotton and so this is actually one of the reasons that marks and Engles Focus so much on the importance of the Bourgeois American Revolution which is actually uh I just wrote a paper for red America in defense of it as a progressive an anti-colonial Revolution now the the the uh specific form that the Surplus value uh embedded within the sale of cotton takes is is that of creating the social relations of what we call the color L right through chatt slavery the institution of chatt slavery and so I I think it's when we look at it from that angle it is very very uh obvious why it was the enslaved black proletariat this section of the wider proletariat that led and won the second American Revolution that began establishing the first ever dictatorship of the proletariat in modern his in human history because it's you know the proletariat uh there was nothing before that yes the the Paris commune was great and Progressive but the the but reconstruction of democracy in the American South happened first and it lasted longer um so you know USA USA or or or whatever I think that this has to be the sort of foundation of any any sort of analysis of American history and the history of capitalism and America's role within the wider process of development of of of of the history of society itself right because when we a lot of people do this thing that I call counting characteristics right where what they do is they'll look at one thing and then look at another right and they'll abstract away from these two things the characteristics that they find in common between them but what that does is leaves us in this realm of abstract characteristics we can't tell how they arrive there what necessarily led to their development but if we take this more Marxist view in this um developmental dialectical logic then we see that it's the black proletariat that becomes the foundation not just for the development of industrial capitalism but the American people as we are today where the possibility of unity across the color line is possible and this coincides with proletarianization right that after our third Revolution the the political revolution we call the the Civil Rights Movement full B full bouris right for all was established and it becomes evident only after this point and after the middle classes are opened up to people not on the white side of the color line that um the entire thing being a hollow facade is began to be self-evident to the entire proletariat which sort of smashes the thing that du boy called the American assumption right which was this notion that develops out of the the social relations revolving around the color line that um that a worker could because of their own hard work and thriftiness someday become Bourgeois now obviously that gets sort of like torn to shreds um as industrial capitalism comes about but during the middle of the 20th century it gets reinvigorated in a version of it that I call the 20th century assumption that maybe we can't become bour but through our own hard work and thriftiness and saving and being good with money or whatever you want to say we can become middle class we can have you know one adult working for a family and support a stable comfortable life this uh illusion is popped as DET repr proletarianization goes on right that 78% of Americans right now struggle paycheck to paycheck and the vast majority of us over 90% have a zero or less than zero net worth that even the things that we sort of um rely on as what we considered property Beyond just our ability to sell our labor well those Got ransomed To Us by the actual owners of that property which is you know the financial cartels we can't live without making them Rich we can't get an education without making them Rich we can't even buy things we need without making them Rich that everything is set up so they have to do nothing and we work for everything and I think that this is the main lesson that all that prior stuff can teach us for the modern day that repr proletarianization is the impetus for the unity of the American people if that helps well kind of building on that what might be some I guess Publications or writings or notes that might be helpful that we could take to help improve our our current status our current Mission and how to build upon that not just uh say Theory or or or reading list or stuff like that but what about things like trade journals or research notes and stuff along those lines yeah um look the like I I'm not sure which direction you're kind of going with this um but I I mean it's always good to read trade journals of the trade you're in right uh and even guys I I keep one of my favorite books about finish carpentry literally on my Marxism bookshelf right behind me it's uh right here hold on right here the finish carpenters manual brilliant book and they the these uh this publishing company has an entire Journal about it but that's just me and it it I'm sort of obsessed with working with my hands that's what I well would you say that uh Finnish Carpenters really nailed it or are they too hammered um well I will I would say that we're all screwed but but there there there is some sort of material we can read to get an idea of the data we need in order to understand repr proletarianization even if it comes from sources that we don't agree with we should never ever ever limit oursel to to just Marxist sources you know um I read Libertarians I read anarchists I read liberals I mean I read everything right now I'm groaning my way through Thomas Pi's capital in the 2st century a book in which he doesn't even understand what capital is um specifically because it has the data you're talking about though right that there is mounds and mounds of uh of economic data in that book that is really useful for my book on repr proletarianization and I'm I'm citing it pretty heavily um regarding uh oh zlock thank you for that yes um [ __ ] shot's picky against picky absolutely fantastic and [ __ ] shot's a great friend writer for The Institute um he also wrote wrote a really good one against the so-called econom IC calculation problem that's pretty good but if we're looking for Marxist um one of the only sort of marxist economics that focuses on financialization because so many people sort of focus on you know industrial capital and try to force modern Financial capitalism to be you know like 1894 or something um which it's not but uh one of the only ones to do it is Michael Hudson and his book uh killing the host is a really really really good basic explanation of how financialization uh happens how it how it functions on an empirical level I remember reading some of Michael Hudson's works like about the Bronze Age collapse so the thing is the ancient Egyptians actually invented financial fraud because they invented the pyramid scheme yeah they're deep in denial oof oof I thought I told Danny to limit you to one pun sir one pun um yeah like actually what's really funny is that like uh the the ancient empires did have a a financial system right and that's one of the the ways money begins to develop right because people would uh you know Farmers would go to a Tavern and they would start a tab because it's not like they had money back then yes and that's where the ition of the Jubilee comes from precisely to balance the econom Jesus announced was coming back uh in his first sermon correct 100% Jesus was a radical revolutionary against the financial class he was uh which otherwise it would be too taxing all right that's enough from you sir get out of here too much Roman charges thank you so much for your call Brother it it's always great talking to you but uh this is actually really important to understand if we really want to develop a comprehensive view of how our system functions is what is money right where does it come from and how has it changed from when it became became what it was which was as Marx describes the universal equivalent that can function to let us exchange Commodities and how has it changed from that into what we have now which is money that's no longer even a com a commodity right our money now is uh debt it's based in debt and politics it's a marker on value that hasn't even been created yet and in a society where we don't really create much value anymore and everything's been financialized that's a a goddamn disaster is what it is anyway let's keep moving along who do we have next Daniel hey so we've got um default TMC default has some uh sort of foundational questions about Marxism that they'd like to discuss perfect let's go for it what's up defa good to talk to you again yo no I know good to talk to you too so I I I want to get clarification on what idealism and materialism mean for marks and angles because I I think there is a lot of confusion on this issue among so-called marxists self self-styled marxists yes there is um and a lot of it comes from oversimplifications uh and and sort of forms of like vulgar subjective idealism right uh which is basically the notion that that you're a wizard right that your thoughts create reality and that's all there is to it but um the distinction is a lot a lot more subtle when we begin getting into philosophy uh and what the idealist schools actually say especially in their their uh most coherent forms like in Hegel right so uh the notion the the difference between materialism and idealism is the difference between is an argument between what is primary the realm within our mind of an idea of of the thought that I'm cognizing and then putting into words right now and the material world outside of that right so Angels talks about you know which is primary the material or the or or or the ideal um the subjective idealist and lenon goes into this and goes all the way back to the best of them like Bishop borley right um that believe that you know a little bit like the the conent thing in itself because there is that disconnect between what is in our mind and the world outside that the thought must therefore happen first and then look at what is out there and create a reflection that is always in some way not that pure thing in the real world right um that is sort of how like most schools of idealism form at their Foundation now with Hegel we get something way more more uh realistic where um the the real world and the realm of thought interact and interpenetrate with each other right that um the the the sort of process of history is the process of getting more and more coherent in our thought and the development of our ideas which give us the ability to create a more and more perfect or Perfect's a bad word but advanced form of society right um for Hegel this begins at the level of spirit and everything in the real world is us uh manifesting that and creating it right but forars and Engles they say that that thought is only that thought because it is necting something that already exists in reality that before we even get to cognizing this thought there's an entire history that has built right where we are in that thought that is given character and determinate characteristics of what that thought is that the reason I'm explaining materialism right now is because of the history of every moment living up to this point and that's necessarily outside of that realm of thought that's the material right um now it's obviously a back and forth uh relationship and this is a really complicated topic but I hope that gives like a a good overview and and gist of it for people can the material and ideal be mapped on or like equated with base and super structure a little bit yeah um I also want to say that like even as early as in Marx's writing on the the Holy Family he's talking about uh proving this materialist perspective because I mean if you think about it like what happens to our thoughts if the material of the brain gets smashed apart or a wizard cast a magic spell on it and it blows up it goes away right and so thought becomes nothing but the actual process of advanced matter performing its function so it's already part of the material and our thoughts themselves are within that material world now in regards to the Bas and super structure yeah that's sort of like what's the world around us and like the way Society is reproduced forms the sort of uh uh things that that like get um what that are outcomes of this so the way we have laws for example and the way our politicians work are all products of you know the way Society itself is reproduced based on what used to be generalized commodity production right but is now full financialization uh that's why we get you know like people becoming Brands these days rather than just uh what it used to be in the era of uh commodity production that's how we get to hyper individualism and all these like you know wocus ideological traits because of that advance and that development into a new a higher stage of social reproduction and so that that sort of I know I'm rambling and I apologize but what I'm trying to get at here is that um the Bas and superstructure are always in motion and they interpenetrate within themselves the way the super structure works also affects uh the way the bass looks going forward that's what I was trying to get at so yeah uh I hope that helps and um do you think like the the Notions and like um and like psychoanalysis of the unconscious or subconscious do they would they be considered as part of the ideal realm or could we even say that within our individual subjectivity there is is the uh let's say intrusion of the material I think at the end of the day uh the ideal realm is already part of the material um but I I don't know a lot about psychoanalysis so like I couldn't give you like a a lonian view I think maybe H would be a better guy to answer that question but I like from the the the School of Creative Marxism which is where my Foundation is um IL enov specifically was talking about how modern science in the 70s was already revealing that it's actually the material affecting even our subconscious right and characterizing that uh in how Neuroscience works and these days even further right so uh there have been uh DNA experts right who have been telling us lately that the way taught DNA functions is wrong like that it writes who we are right this is true that it does write who we are but it's a dialectical relationship where effect becomes cause going forward so as this is writing who we are in characterizing our the way we view things we are through our actions writing our DNA and changeing yeah yeah this is very yeah um yeah this is like epigenetics and this is about L yeah like like the the idea that DNA is some sort of some something akin to programming code right where you just like like you just press start and then everything is automatic right like this is this is this is a totally well this is a very misleading view of DNA because there's essentially no you know in programming code and computer code you have conditional statements if then statements right yep but there's nothing like that in and DNA is much more like a a recipe book or or a template that a chef would would refer to when the chef chooses to make a particular recipe but the choice that the Chef makes is not in the recipe book it's it's in the chef and the chef in this analogy of the chef would be like the cell itself so like DN like entire sections of DNA that code for for protein can be switched on and off by the cell 100% so the C yeah the cell can decide okay I I I don't want this these kinds of protein so I'm just going to switch off this part of the DNA that codes for this kind of protein but I want more of this other kind of protein so I'll switch on switch on the relevant section of the DNA not only that um entire new Pathways can be created right so let's say there's no history of addiction or alcoholism or whatever in my family if I take it upon myself to become a drug addict that writes it into my DNA and I can pass it down to my kids right like it's an ongoing uh relationship a spiral and it's funny because way back in the day lenko was talking about this right that the dialectic is within nature already and applies to everything and uh Western Cold War propaganda was so thick and so intense on politically repressing uh the working class that it sort of never looked into this and just sort of dismissed it and you even hear it from uh like the the sort of pseudo intellectual anti-communist today that like you know lenko was just trying to apply his his ideology to places it shouldn't be which is nonsense the the the Marxist worldview is a sort of obs serving the entire universe and how it functions like like like Engle said right that more and more each day modern science is proving that the world works dialectically and not metaphysically uh yeah modern science today proves that even more and we shouldn't even like this is even without talking about quantum mechanics and all that and and Einstein and the theory of relativity and all that kind of thing you know yeah all right well I thought those were awesome questions you got anything else for us before uh we move on no I know you got a A bunch of other callers so I won't uh I won't take up any more time well thank you so much defa always a pleasure when you call brother all right take care take care man all right you know what's funny like I today I like it's getting cold in Cleveland right it's October um I turned out my AC uh today to make sure it wasn't too hot in my office during the stream and I swear to God it has to be broken I don't know what's going on with this but it's crazy hot up in here anyway who we got next Daniel hey no we've got Coulson has some yeah cson what's up cson what are you out for us tonight cson are you there or or are you silently casting a spell on me wait a minute no you're not a wizard he just said wait a minute and then you are silently casting a spell on me I'm on to you Coulson wait oh are you back oh I can hear you now I'm so sorry no problem at all you may like sometimes people have the Discord uh muted it's okay what's up well you know I just want to say uh I uh see your uh criticism of wizards uh being a wizard myself you know I cast spells where I can and you know I do it on behalf of ACP so we're not all bad I knew it I knew you were casting a spell on me it a good spell it's a good spell it's for your uh for your protection and your health sir I really appreciate all the uh iy turn into a frog I'm coming after you brother I'd turned you into a cat first probably no all serious I really apprciate who cares about this husband guy I got a new cat [Laughter] whatever Daniel I'm sorry I'm sorry Daniel Daniel just types in the chat not all wizards that's right hashtag notall all right all right so so all right let me compose myself here what what do you got for us tonight brother well um I'm a musician and I want to uh to make agitation to make propaganda for the party to convince people you know to uh to revolutionize people radicalize people um I was wondering I mean i' I've been listening to you know Pete Seager um Joe Hill you know old old commi artists good stuff uh yeah yeah really um listening to the new stuff too you know like um like M lore's Hines Hall uh and Hines Hall to um something I did not want to like mamore I really didn't all right but I can't help it man he's good and look if you're standing against a genocide you're a friend of mine you know what I mean seriously hell yeah I was so surprised by that I mean I know he's done some some political stuff in the past but it was just like wow uh really inspiring yeah so I guess I'm just I'm just asking to see if there's any uh no it's okay there's a delay I keep interrupting you and I I just want to let you know it's because I'm very worried you're going to cast a magic spell on me so I don't want you know your incantations to complete or whatever I'm sorry don't why are youen just go on I was just gonna ask if you have any any resources you could recommend for somebody who wants to uh to create agitation create agitative art yes um so uh it depends on what kind of music you're doing uh I assume you have instruments obviously right like guitars and stuff like that um the programs that I used uh are still pretty good there's one called Cakewalk and that's free and one called audacity and both of these will let you record tracks and mix them together um now it helps to get a a an engineer to do that like I still know people from back in the day when I was in the music industry that helped me with that stuff uh because I'm a mess at it and our super produc producer U Mr Daniel Gutierrez happens to be a really good soundman um so I'm just saying maybe if you ask nicely he'll do that uh but for me um the best route is always to make sure your music has a solid hook first uh Eddie and I have been trying to get together and write a song together forever uh and every time I come up with them one I have I get like a good you know burst a solid burst down but no hook to it I I I'm apparently hookless I don't know um but yeah so I would recommend doing that uh if you ever want to sort of send music back and forth and see what we can collaborate on by all means contact me on my email it's noahic MMI gmail.com uh and we'll work something out because I think that uh agitational music is something that really really hooked people in back in the day and we don't have that right now and I think it's really important to create it I really do yeah 100% yeah I mean it was uh it was it seemed to be a center a centerpiece of the movement like really helping move things along um but think about it this way do you know how many messages I've gotten about our our cover version of high Sheriff hazard that's in our new intro I can't even count them anymore if we have original stuff along those lines people will go for it you know it's so powerful absolutely I love it um I was actually gonna ask you do you know what the name of the artist is that did the cover I don't I apologize but um the legendary Jesus motorcycle put the video together so if if you look for him on on Twitter I'm sure he'll he'll let you know or Daniel will um he might know uh he's a lot smarter than I am at most of that kind of stuff so you got time for another question sure let's do one more quick one okay so I am in a town where there is no uh chapter of ACP currently and I don't have any uh any comrades I've I had comrades that I've reached out to about starting an ACP chapter but uh they think that ACP is fascist so that didn't really didn't really go anywhere unfortunately so they weren't comrades yeah exactly no at the end of the day they weren't no so I guess I'm my question is like what uh what can I do to start preparing myself for eventually being a member of ACP and being a good communist it's a good question you know um get involved like here's what here's what I think honestly forget all about the last period of History's so-called left right there's a real left in this country again and what we're going to do excuse me I'm sorry I'm I'm drinking Seltzer and I had to uh uh pause for a moment there um so so what what we what we are attempting to do here and what I think we will be very successful at doing because we already seen success is stopping the the sort of uh radlib uh obsession with people we think agree with us politically right that they had to have everyone agree with their every opinion on X and Y and Z um what we should do is go to people who care about their communities and rather than start immediately sort of saying I'm a communist you should be a communist too just get involved in helping together and it'll organically come up you know like why are you doing this uh uh I forget your name or you you're what you didn't have your a real name but um they'll say why are you doing this you go oh I'm a communist it's just what we do right um we help our communities and so in that way you build sort of more organic relationships there's a million things going on in every neighborhood um and there every sort of uh Community organization is looking for volunteers so I say just get involved meet people um and it doesn't need to be political because at the end of the day communism is about the people you know what I mean yeah yeah 100 per. excellent well I'm glad I could help brother um and I'm looking forward to hearing from you about music that should be fun all right sounds good man we'll look I'll talk to you in the future thanks again for doing this it's awesome you have people call in man it makes it so much more uh personable thank you I'm I'm glad you enjoy it look everybody I think that um too often we sort of uh uh assume that the people watching aren't a vital part of this thing we're doing and that ain't true the midwestern marks Institute ain't just me it ain't just Carlos and Eddie and Danny and everybody it ain't just Daniel it's all of you guys for real we depend on your help we depend on your participation right this we consider you a vital part of our institution right um every time you click like on a stream that matters every time you share it that matters all of your super chats matter and speaking of super chats we got a couple earlier I don't want to forget them so let's go to him right now Stalin's mustache thank you so much for the five bucks brother says he has an idea pitch for the ACP free and affordable snow removal in rural areas especially for Midwestern and Canada chapters that's a great idea so many of us drive trucks and I don't like getting a plow is not that expensive by the way I'm just saying if you're in a Midwestern or or or a rural area uh especially in Canada or like in the northern W Midwest maybe look into it good idea thank you Sal Stalin's mustache he's always got great stuff to say and our boy battle coac thank you for the 200 Argentinian dollars I know you guys are experiencing uh quite an economic downturn so we appreciate that uh thank you he asks will ACP take part on International collaboration like Aid in solidarity with other communist countries like right now Cuba is having a difficult time with its energy Supply uh in fact hash Cuba failed state was trending on X which is absurd yes we are already involved in all kinds of international organizations and actions uh um we're part of the world Anti-Imperialist platform uh all kinds of good stuff we're we're hooked up with the free Koreans and and their solidarity I mean there's too many to list um I'm not sure if they're going to uh uh release the the videos of anything from the convention probably not um but the presentations will be in the second volume of red America so read Chris halali our International secretary's presentation and he he goes over greetings from so many communist parties and our Affiliated organizations all over the world um internationalism is absolutely uh a primary in the era of imperialism right these Communists in other countries share a common cause an enemy in the ruling class here which is our enemy right so uh anyway let's keep moving who do we have next Daniel hey no we've got pxc from ACP Ohio what's up pxe it's Iowa actually oh shoot I was gonna say I'm in oh and I don't know that name all right uh my name is Sean I'm the executive of the Iowa chapter nice to meet you Sean nice to meet you as well uh I just had a quick question regarding uh the ACP and how we sort of fit in uh to the culture war in America um I see a lot with like the the anti-ac fascist collaborators all of their criticisms of us revolve around the culture war and like it's necessary that we respond to these people but how how should we do be going about that because like if we take the opposite side it's just like this contradiction that can't go on forever so where where do you see that ending it's a great question brother uh I think it's funny that the fascist collaborating fake left call us too conservative and the fascists themselves and the neo-nazis uh they call us too liberal I think uh that the reason for that is that the party genuinely believes in what we call the golden stalinist Center or what my my pops used to always call walking the Stalin line right which is a a very difficult thing to walk between two poles but um practically speaking we should explain what the culture War actually is and what it stems from how it's used to turn Working Class People uh who have the same exact condition the same exact uh material interests the same exact uh sort of historical role against each other right back in the day the the early bisi called it faction right that they uh exacerbate these existing divisions within society and they've continued to do that turning us against each other by Race by gender by religion and everything else so the Communist job must be to overcome this and um uh uh uh sort of unify the working people which means that taking a side doesn't do anything really but subsume us to the dominant social aspect uh that that wants that side proliferated whether it's conservative or liberal doesn't matter right it's always always going to be uh by default um sort of getting us to be on the side of the ruling class which is this side of division so that's how I look at it there's always going to be Communists who have more conservative personal opinions there's always going to be Communists who have more liberal personal opinions what marks a communist is that we are disciplined and and um oriented enough to not fall to pieces the the minute someone doesn't share every uh opinion we have there's no such thing um as social conservatism or social liberalism um you know what I mean yeah the way I see it I I agree with like everything that you said but it just like when we when we react to these like these more like social claims about the ACP it's sort of just like dignifying all the things that these idiots are saying yeah I think there is some truth in that um I think that like look they most of them are in a position where that can be everything they care about because they don't have any class struggle to them right uh so they can take this middle class position where disagreeing on say um the the current form of the Bourgeois family and whether we should hate our families and rebel or love our families um is a privilege that most workingclass people just don't have like there's not that's not even something people think of or that it occurs to them naturally it has to get sort of implanted within them by institutions of the ruling class and then proliferated by and through that middle class so for example uh I like to talk about the the Netflix walk out a couple years ago do you remember that I do so this is a perfect example of middle class chauvinism right that the middle class Netflix uh workers right they believed that Dave Chappelle was the height of evil and they staged an entire walk out uh based around this and what were their demands their demands were we demand control of the company right um we we control we demand our views not your views uh are what is is front and center at the company Etc it was all this sort of uh unnecessary chauvinistic we want our opinions to be the dominant ones that is possible for a middle class to do I'm sure there were even trans like it was around trans stuff right I'm sure there were even some trans people working for the company but was there anything in there about you know ending discrimination and employment was there anything in there that would give the working people of Netflix the various coders the janitors whatever a better life and actually give them the breathing space where they could develop a social opinion like the middle class uh walk outters of course not right because they couldn't care less about that stuff they just want to feel uh sort of self-righteous at the end of the day you know what I mean like I hate to make it that petty but a lot of the time it's that petty I'm sorry to like I know I just signal that I was done talking but I watched that Dave Chappelle thing and I'm sorry if you're offended by that grow a thicker skin I don't know what to else to tell you it's the real world some people wasn't that bad aren't gonna like tiptoe around your feelings that are all weird that get offended for no reason go ahead yeah it's it's something that I've noticed it goes back to just like the idea of people like it's performative activism like they just want to feel good about themselves and you can see this with like all the other fake communist parties as well how they like only show up and make their presence known at times of like protest or something they're not actually out doing things to benefit their communities precisely and and even when they do like think about the like drag shows to try to raise money for Palestinian relief right yeah this to me is the height of egotism these people are suffering from a goddamn genocide and they make it about them and their drag queens or whatever they want to do look if you want to be a drag queen be my guest right but you're insulting the people that you claim you care about if you know anything about their culture they ain't really for that kind of thing and even if they weren't like insulted by that kind of thing you're still making it about you right and that's just the sort of way these middle class like this atmosphere is is very common in their organizations and again it's why we say you know like uh uh the quote unquote left is dead but long live the left because there's a left now now and this kind of thing is being revealed as silly yeah it's it's very interesting it is I wish I had more time we got a couple more calls to get through though do you have anything else for us before we go uh one last thing about the snow plows um I know that snow plowing is uh taken care of by like City and local governments so just make sure you check into that before you try to do anything yourself yes it depending on like where you are the the city streets never ever plow something like that what I thought it was was like talking about driveways right yeah yeah yeah that's yeah that's what I was saying excellent excellent point to add thank you for that uh Sean of course good to talk to you yeah you too great to meet you and wish you all the best over there in Iowa brother thank you you too have a great rest of your night thanks all right um look I I mean it's it's I complain about all the time right the middle class the fake left all of that you guys have heard me yapping on and on about it forever now I want to get to one more Super Chat before we get to the next call which is from Battle coac with another 50 thank you so much that's awesome by the way brother he asked if I've seen the show for all mad kind the Apple TV show where the Soviet Union uh rematches the moon first I think you're talking about the sort of space raced show uh I haven't seen it personally but I think my wife saw it and liked it um regarding Soviet shows one of my favorites to deal with with the Soviet Union was the Americans do you guys remember that one it was a spy show right and it was based on a real uh intelligence program that um that that that the Soviet Union had uh under the the organization they called directorate s right and directorate S was implanting uh Soviet agents in America As Americans right having them live their lives As Americans have kids who are American Kids Etc and over the generations could uh you know become senators and fight for communism as an American right uh that kind of thing was and and so like it didn't get all of the actual theory behind what they wanted to do with director at s uh correct but it was really actually fair to the Soviet Union in it uh until the end where you know it was extremely poor Pro gorbachov uh which you know whatever but great show highly recommended the Americans who do we got next Daniel hey no we've got dito from Costa Rica uh they could they called in a few weeks ago or a couple weeks ago after the the hurricane nen uh event and uh yeah they remember chat a little bit about Latin American politics how you doing dito good to hear from you again hey all all good awesome great to hear great to hear so what's up what do you got for us tonight well I wanted to propose to you an interesting conversation in this sense okay uh the impact and the reality of the last 200 years of the construction of republics democracy versus the impacts of Communism implementation of Communism long as well as the Implement of conservative uh uh conservatism in the cultural political scenario of Latin America I don't know if if that that is a giant topic um oh yeah but anert okay let's maybe not like uh uh let's not make it too expansive because we're we're rounding our on our time limit soon but um uh so yeah go ahead what what let me give you what you thinking yeah one I'm uh I I'm born in Costa Rica from the age of zero up to the age of 16 I had lived in six different countries including United States Venezuela Colombia Costa Rica um Ecuador so my experience in that sense was very near uh I was born in 81 so the 90s was that period of of uh political formation um I was also born in 81 by the way welcome to being old with me 43 H Y3 so um to make it very simple I've lived through several um several of the political he upheavals that were happening during that period that gave me a lot of the political formation that I have and and the work that I do so in in a very concise way I am an ample critic against U Chavez as a Venezuelan and living through what happened in Venezuela particularly 92 with the I was there in karakas when Chavez attempted his Coupe against Carlos Andres Perez I lived through that um and then when he was released from jail and pardoned by the subsequent government of Caldera who was the last Democratic president of the bipartisan model uh in venez I'm extremely critic uh on the neighbor on the North Danielle Ortega who has become a complete monster in every sense of the word hold on hold on be before we move outside of Venezuela um because I I don't want to get like too expansive okay I I want to say like I I want to say this one I'm not the expert on uh Venezuela or south or Latin America uh within the Institute uh that would be Eddie and Danny respect uh respectively however I will say this that I think it is uh evident within the numbers that a life has gotten better within Venezuela since the Revolution and B that people overwhelmingly like it I mean uh ACP members were invited as election overseers at the last election that Maduro won um and experien this for themselves I think it's often uh sort of we get these very personalized views uh as we grew up like I grew up in the ghetto right in America uh on the east side of Cleveland and my parents blamed everything on capitalism as you know they would but um so so like I got this very like narrow view growing up and I saw what I saw and it could have it would have been easy for me to sort of take a very ultr left route but I tried to like look around and look at sort of what others were saying what others were thinking and the actual stats and this is what led me to my study of the death of the middle class actually like what happened right and so I think we have to take into account that bigger view than a personal experience I'm not saying you're lying or that your experience wasn't negative or whatever uh it very well could have been what I'm saying is that what we have to look at instead is the general trajectory of how things develop and why so like how did the the the bolivarian revolution actually come about in Venezuela is because the the previous social relations could not continue on in that old way right something needed to change and yes that can create a a period of intense struggle but building we see things uh get better for more and more people right and and we can look at the cause and effect relations of this happening and that happening Etc so let me put it this way and I'm gonna do an interesting uh a point of analysis one in the in the situation and I'm going to do it this way in a comparison between Costa Rica and Venezuela in in the period where the bipartisan model um was executed in Venezuela after 58 after the breakage of of what was on happening on the Fourth Republic uh with the uh Koop gimenez and the installation of the trimat with uh jalut uh and uh p gimenez and the other [ __ ] the military uh on that same period 10 years prior Costa Rica had undergone a Civil War which the furistas which were a technical Social Democrat liberal uh inclination won and when we see the comparison on those two points Costa Rica the decided heck we're going to abolish the military the military is a anti-democratic terrorist organization that needs to die that was the fundamental essence of why fetes said Hey listen we have to abolish and we established through the um uh the second Republic Constitution a very solid social uh Mark with errors that are are are still being tried to be changed one of those erors article 75 that establishes the official religion of the state is the apostolic Roman in Costa Rica versus Venezuela where the breakage of that type of of Revolution that happened uh 10 years after the end of the second world war we see that it was the military who took the power at that moment when when um when the it was actually in 53 I'm sorry on 58 when that ended and bipartisan model and democracy representative de democracy went back again uh into the model of Venezuela you had that period from uh 58 to uh 98 which is that period of 40 years where two main political parties governed which were go uh which was the social Christians and uh AC Dem democratica which was the social Democrats um on that on that aspect the the the problems of deterioration especially with the mishandling of petroleum in Venezuela uh which did gain a lot of uh of explosion of of infrastructure of development comparable to the United States in many ways and comparable to many of the Nations uh it's still the biggest reserve of that type of oil in the entire world but go ahead go ahead so so that being one factor but the other factor is that you had a Christian Catholic uh control over the powers to be so this conservative social democracy or social Christianity that was imposed was uncapable of responding to the eventual um changes that new generation were demanding that uh in fact interestingly enough Venezuela being a not only a signature but a uh ratified member of the interamerican convention on human rights on that time frame many violations were happen look can I can I interrupt real quick I I hate to rush you but we're like we're approaching time tonight so um I want to say I I want to say something uh real quick as regards the bolivarian revolution right and how social change actually like happens every time in in um in in actual Society right because I think there's there's uh this might be the the issue uh one I know nothing about Costa Rican uh history and I I apologize for that uh two again I'm not the Venezuela guy I call Ed when I have a question on Venezuela uh and they come up frequently but what happens a leading up to the the bolivarian revolution in Venezuela isn't that uh the the former government couldn't handle the changing demands it's that the contradiction between the ruling class and the working classes got to a point where it couldn't continue on in the old way it became impossible where there is massive deterioration IM miseration corruption Etc the revolution happens and it starts contradictions on a whole new level with new forces such as against you know the the US who immediately are are going to put in sanctions and and and try to uh you know assassinate leaders and kidnap leaders and I mean how many times did they try to kidnap Chavez how many did they uh try to assassinate Maduro I think it set like uh like hundreds on the assassinations on Maduro and he's still alive and kicking I think that it is massively important for the development of any developing Nation to have sovereignty and this is what Venezuela established you have to start at a baseline from somewhere right you can't be under the thumb of the IMF and the World Bank or you end up literally giving your money to the Federal Reserve like M did in Argentina you end up selling your country to the giant Financial cartels and what Venezuela's been able to do while under all of these guns from the biggest imperialist power in the entire world is miraculous because the standard of living has improved right and they've been forcing them eles onto the world stage they're now like I mean look at the if I me interrupt you there for a second um I know you're short in time I really want to voice this and perhaps in the future we can have a more in-depth conversation I myself as a political operator as a political activist in Latin America 14 years ago I started a movement of of legalizing Med or canavis and drug policy reform here with influences throughout many countries in Latin America alongside many groups that are doing the same things um here I was told you're wasting your time we're never going to get get the we legalized Etc I did my work and we got Canabis legalized three years ago uh medic and there that was just initial part of the project of drug policy reform of a of a of a ground under scale where the intention is we have to end the war on drugs as a uh imperialist United States Russian Chinese European uh control for the past 60 years through the United Nations that that uh whole sense of the uh of the drug war has been a continuous imposition uh that has aggravated the problems that are internally in each of our countries in Latin America Asia Africa AK what is been the go so look I could I'm sorry to interrupt again I couldn't agree more on the necessity of ending the so-called War on Drugs it also includes by the way the American ruling class um propping up drug cartels let's not forget about that that's the primary point I mean look what they did to Nicaragua right you were talking about Ortega as anything but a hero I don't see it when the US was propping up the contras right and using them to uh like reinforce drug dealers in the rest of Latin America and send crack cocaine well cocaine that gets turned into crack into American neighborhoods uh fighting against workingclass people on all sides right and setting up these drug cartels so like on this we are in 100% agreement uh we could maybe quibble about the uses of medical marijuana but I'm super open to that I it's just that it's a very um libertarian notion so I can see why you'd get some push back against it that's all I mean my work my work is uh one of my major political works uh the last 14 years has been drug policy reform to change the impact of the three international conventions that drive through the United Nations the one policy fits all uh that has initiated through United States uh backed up by China Russia and uh some areas in in Europe but what I not pinpointing that another day we can have that particular discussion but what I wanted to say is also my work in the matters of Afro indigenous realities in the communities uh mainly focused yes in Costa Rica Panama uh somewhere in Colombia and Venezuela um one thing that I've I've come to conclude and this sense is that if we graph and make a clear distinction between the invasion and the genocide committed by the Europeans when they invaded the Western Hemisphere versus the last 200 to 250 years uh of the process of Independence that kick started here in the Western Hemisphere uh particularly the construction of modern democracy um and and that's another conversation yeah that's a whole big conversation that's where I'd like to go actually on what is democracy because maybe we agree maybe we don't agree and that would be interesting to talk about you know what I mean being said that and me as a 43 yearold activist what I stand for is the defense of Independence the the defense I'm a p americanist I'm a p la americanist in the sense that I take the the words of bolivard uh I take the words of of Faro Marti or I take the words of uh of many other things that that we can go on and mention but anyhow and I say look Latin America as this as this um base of modern democracy the modern republics as this base that we showed the world we can kick the ass of the Europeans and become free and and we were the ones to continuously during the process of invention with the bakam with I gotta interrupt you again and I'm so sorry but we are getting very very short on time now I understand sorry like I would love to like have like an in-depth conversation but we got like a back and forth and and like uh and we make room for the uh the last calls so we're going to have to it there but please call back next uh next week and we will we will continue this I would like to focus in on the question of democracy and what that means I think we could get a lot out of that thank you so much for your time I'm gonna bring Daniel back up uh because I means walk with your eyes opens in the language of the B that's how we say goodbye thank you I like it I like it brother thank you very much we'll talk to you next time I'm G to bring Daniel back up here because I have to run outside of my office for two

one part of a larger problem for rbn uh they do great work and and we love everything about them um thank you so much for the midwestern marks membersip ship Michelle Von corbo if I'm pronouncing that cor correctly uh I am not obviously French but someone scoop that up because it'll go quick all right back to it who do we have next Daniel probably our last one huh yeah we got we got uh Michael uh lionhart Michael just um I think he came across us on Twitter doesn't know too much about the Institute but just wanted to get a general take on uh the election the upcoming election perfect what's up Michael how you doing tonight hey Noah how's it going buddy I'm decent uh it's getting late because I'm an old man but what are you gonna do [Laughter] happens to the best of us man it happens to the best of us so are you are are you are you for Camala or Trump neither I am for neither I yeah I like that I am for boycotting this election and I am for boycotting this election as a specific political program um okay I think look Camala Harris is evil incarnate I mean there ain't no other way to put it right uh Trump had some potential at the beginning you know uh he had some some great rhetoric he was talking about training the swamp and bringing production back um but he was either unwilling or unable to do that so yeah in my eyes that's a dead end and the lesson we should be learning from that is not to put our faith in these politicians who come from the elites I mean look Trump may talk in a way that makes uh uh like makes what's it called um workingclass people kind of like him but he ain't working class right the guy's a billionaire uh he's funny but is he really in this for us it seems like even if we could say he was it wouldn't matter because he's not able to get much accomplished you know what I I agree with what you're saying um you know in the beginning Trump did seem like he was uh you know was really America First do would you consider yourself America First are you you know no um I think I think that the the slogan America First is odd to me right because what it means is um let's stop giving all this money to other people let's care about America but the the reason that we give this money to other people is because there are people in America who make money off of it they don't just give out free cash like that it that don't happen what they do is they give credit right and they deut trap people and they got a a fish on the line for the rest of until they bankrupt that that fish right um yeah I amfo and World Bank uh like political ramifications and all that so I think that what we should do is yes take care of America but that means that we must As Americans uh turn our sights on the people who are doing that which is our own ruling class right it's our it's the financial cartels and not even just them but you know the insurance conglomerates the military industrial complex um from Bezos to Gates and and the Silicone Valley cartels all of this it interacts and affects uh each other right and these are the real enemies of the American people you don't so you don't think it's the Jews no no I think you don't think it's the Jews no I think what's it all what's it all go back to what's it all go back to That All Leads back hold on I think that of course there are are Jewish people in the ruling class you'd have to be silly to think that it isn't or that they aren't but that the ruling class in the USA is anglosaxon first of all right so there there's a reason that the word wasp developed right the white Anglo-Saxon prod always hold on hold on that our you're being a dude don't be stupid uh the our has always been dominated by uh what's it called by uh the Rockefellers right the DuPont the Vanderbilts the uh let's see um I I mean there's a thousand of them the carnegies the Fords the Morgans we could go on and on and on and on and on down the list of how they've been the Anglo sex and Protestants but even that doesn't matter because it's sort of like a child's uh understanding of how problems in society are created it's just a guess like oh their skin color their religion that doesn't matter there is actual causal links on what creates problems we can go through and see how financialization happens and how it causes the am miseration of the people right we can go through and uh you know we look at cause and effect relationships and how that creates a new way of uh of doing things going forward so the idea that it's like based on skin color or or religion is just it's like not even just a child's way of understanding it but a particularly stupid child's way of understanding it um let's go on to the last actually let's not even take we're so far over time let's just get rid of this guy and we will he probably didn't notice that I muted him yet but that's okay he wasn't altogether a quick guy um that's going to be it for us for the night so thank you to everyone who called in except the very silly stupid guy at the end uh who didn't understand how thought Works uh we will be here next week like we always are have a great week everybody we'll see you next time
