sley go ahead so I just want to know like how you guys think that this isn't brism what you're doing explain who it is well don't you're [ __ ] kidding me you're not going to get on here and insult people and not know what brism is like how are you we're doing brism not explain what it is yeah how are you doing how are you not doing it how is this not brism what you guys are doing in your own words please tell me what Browder ism is no I I'm not giving you in my own words when you've just flippantly answered people left and all right so if you want me to educate you on what brism is brism was a form of liquidation ISM in which they basically wanted to turn the Communist Party USA into a literal appendage of the Democrats as like the CPA the Communist political Association which would have acted as a lobbying and interest group to basically be like a think tank for the Democrats or something so broism was associated with a for of extreme liquidation ISM that was based in too much of a naive faith and trust in Roosevelt's New Deal coalition and the institutions the political institutions of the Bourgeois in general now if I had to guess I think you're an illiterate and uneducated online Internet leftist who looked at rallies of the Communist Party USA during the 1930s where they had a lot of of patriotic symbolism and they had a lot of enthusiasm for you know uh for the country they lived in which was just the Orthodox Marxist leninist position shared by all Marxist leninist parties and say that's brism because for some reason it's surreal to you that communist parties are patriotic but that wasn't what broism is because even under the leadership of William Z Foster or even later under Gus hall or who whatever leadership the cpusa had up until the liquidation after the 1990s I would argue the cpusa CED the Orthodox Marxist leninist line of socialist patriotism and it did whether that was Browder or Williams Z Foster that was not a decisive point of contention the decisive point of contention concerned the liquidation of the party into the CPA which became that is what solidified the notion of Brower uh finally and fully so you're asking us how we why we are browers I think it's incredibly bizarre to put the onus on us as far as disproving how we're brist when we are an independent party which is not independent of any other kind of party we're maintaining proletarian political Independence even more so than the party has historically historically the party was much more receptive Ive to having coalitions with Democrats and we don't have any coalitions with any party we're that fiercely independent so what is Browder is about our party that's very baffling the onus is on you to demonstrate what is brow rist about our party so sir don't get angry and start you know um I know I just told gave you an education lesson that contradicted your entire Reddit curriculum but you're going to have to uh calmly respond to this or we're just going to remove you go ahead dude for one you're the you go on this boring rant that doesn't discuss anything that I said you're telling people oh my good Lord you just said I went on a boring rant that didn't address anything you said when you said why are we brist I very thoroughly explained to you what broism actually was and how we have nothing to do with it and you're saying it has nothing to do with what you said do I hear you corly or do my do my ears deceive me I can't you got you got to quit muting me buddy so here's the deal like you just said why why does it take why did it take you three minutes to describe something I can describe in 30 seconds a because when I asked you to describe it you said you weren't going to do it and that we have to describe it because we're being mean to people that's why I educated you very muting me again dude quit [ __ ] muting me like [ __ ] take stop yelling stop yelling calm down make an AR what do you mean oh deorum is a tool of Oppression I can speak as loud as I want you [ __ ] [ __ ] like Jesus Christ oh my God address address the actual I can I can make an actual argument if you quit muting me like and like you Ed making the distinction like oh need to dis you are so annoying please sub sure yeah shut the [ __ ] up so you said you make this distinguishing that you know we don't think Mega Communists need to support trans rights and things like that when and so you're doing brism you're doing identity politics you're doing neoliberal politics is this real is this a real person it's just a troll what about us has anything to do with broism go ahead you can unmute yourself bro okay yeah I can I'm not going to just continue to unmute myself dude like if you guys can't handle having an honest conversation and take some valid critiques you just want to get [ __ ] softballs all [ __ ] day long then that's up to you I don't care you do all softballs you're soing out like a free CRA yeah because you just [ __ ] keep muting me look at you you guys do the same [ __ ] to every single person who comes up no you came in here asking us about brism so talk about brism you asked you asked for a debate and now you're getting it and you can't [ __ ] handle you just the debate I already told you it's communism wrapped in an American flag and I didn't need three [ __ ] minutes to ramble on about can you address the point I made about how it was still wrapped in an American flag under William Z Foster and every other leader of the CP USA not just Earl Browder he was not exceptional for that and therefore it's not brism brism is more specifically about the liquidation of the party into the CPA no you're just deflecting going on some ideological tangent about no I think it is important to defend how dimitrov established the norm of socialist patriotism and clarified it for every com of course you think it's important because you've actually met someone who can critique you and you're not willing to but you can't do that you're just sowing out about the because I'm doing what you're doing you're you're not giving me any space to give you about critique if you're just going to sit there and [ __ ] talk so am I [ __ ] respond to my argument respond to the point I made then go ahead respond to it you respond to my point and tell me how okay if my definition is rism is communism wrapped in the American flag how are you guys not that because how am I wrong because it's aong it's a wrong definition that's why how so because it was wrapped on in an American flag under all the other leaders of the CP okay so is there Foster ISM yeah is there a term Foster ISM yeah sure we're Foster yeah we're just American Communist you could just call us American Communists so so you are a brist you'll admit it no no no we're not because brism something very specific okay okay so anyway let let's carry on then so if you guys aren't these things then why do you need to make that distinction like it's not trans people who are centering themselves and saying we need to have I think you need to go to the hospital and get some Antics because it's like we went from Browder to trans people and I don't know what you're you're just angry about something and you need to go get some antis psychotics from the hospital right I tried to your your your so-called critique calling us Broadus I carefully explain to you that you don't know what broism is you seem to have conceded on that point and then you pivoted to trans people is what does that have to do with brism for that matter [Laughter] he's like you're wrapped in an American flag and then it's like okay can you uh what what does this guy think that in Yemen and Afghanistan and Palestine for that matter and all these places where the American flag has a really bad rap that that's like a trans Paradise what is he trying to say that anti-americanism is somehow proportional to trans rights because it's really not and the opposite is in fact true right um oh boy Ley wants to come back all right sley you heard my terms and conditions go ahead oh you guys are you guys are bringing me back let's go okay so here we'll uh we'll keep it simple for you so why do we feel the need to go after Mega and turn them into Communists how many uh how many Bolsheviks were there at the start of the revolution uh a lot less than there were peasants sure yeah I mean what percentage of a population does it typically take for a revolution um the bulvik couldn't have won without the peasants yeah absolutely not that that doesn't matter it what I'm saying is the starting point so so no you don't have to go get in bed without fascist to achieve communism and everybody knows that Breezy's got it 14 % it takes approximately 14% of the population to start a revolution so you don't need to go after you don't need to go it it is true what it's not true you can't just have 14% you're missing the context of the 90% peasant majority that were extremely Agri to the point where they were setting up Alternative forms of governance called the Soviets and the 14% that you're talking about that took power came to power on the back of a slogan called all power to the Soviets won and the second peace land in bread so absolutely you need the majority we're we're talking about all revolutions across all history is the 14% number that's not just a specific to the Soviet Revolution number but so it was 24,000 Bolsheviks at the start of the Revolution approximately by September there was 200,000 so yeah you're you're can you respond to what I just told you about how the situation had to be such that they connected you're asking me to come to you then you're constantly deflecting do you want to hear my point or do you want to I don't want to hear you anymore because sufferable it's not possible it's like I I just raised a point like no it wasn't just a small minority because it was a revolutionary context for the great majority and then had they not connected with that great majority the minority would not have been able to take power Carlos is always saying we have a crisis of argumentation in this country where like people don't actually even understand understand what an argument is and sleazy is uh example number one of that I'm just going to start sending invite man the only one who wants to debate is sleazy because he doesn't understand argument so he can just come up here and scream we got siif he's an infrared guy though righty um just is waiting to scream all right go ahead hey we there we go all right so like right there you just failed there's a very simple like retort to that argument obviously that guy is just willing to uphold a monopoly on violence for his own selfservice right that's that's what what happened what was that even about what was he saying so did did you not just admit out so you agree with that critique then right that that's the critique of of his position on MAR that you said that's what you were saying I was saying that he supports a strong State you know when a state has the Monopoly on violence we should support communism instead of monarchism right so if you think that monarchism is less than communism then that's only because you are it's a self- serving position because you're not feeling the violence perpetrated by that monarchy right cuz if you're if you're one of the what do you mean what so like say when the Dutch are Conquering the Congo so sure it's very easy for someone who's under King Leopold to say oh yeah monarchism is much less violent than communism because now because Stalin and whatever bad argument they want to use but the reality of that is is because they're not facing the violence under that monarchy right that's pretty simple you guys should be able to agree with that one I mean that's like communism 101 if you guys don't got that one where we at the guy was defending the Middle Ages so well I'm not the one who called monarchist the easiest ones to convert to Communism I mean if that's not the most bouis [ __ ] champagne socialist thing I've ever heard in my life like come on dude like the guy was talking about premodern monarchy wasn't talking about well well capitalism has I'm converting people sorry I'm actually a whoever whoever you done in your life okay sure and in fact I know there's people in this live that I've converted but anyway um you can laugh all you want you can you can you can laugh all you want but it didn't happen picture it didn't happen okay here here's the thing though so if you guys so that again like your targets are wrong it's fine if you can make a connection with those sort of people but like you were talking about intersectionality earlier Hans right so you know what that is Hans sure he German I don't know who who cares um anyway so intersectionality that's they came for first they came for the Communist right so that's why you guys don't have to make this distinction that you don't care about trans rights and things like that because you shouldn't be centering them but neoliberal politics do because capitalism has the ultimate ability to co-opt right all right that's enough of that
