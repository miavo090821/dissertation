  "title": "Probably Cancelled | Burning Man is an Inside Job: Psychedelic Culture as Bio-Warfare w/John Potash",
  "description": "Author of \"Drugs As Weapons Against Us\" John Potash joins again to share his research for his newest documentary \"CIA Drugs R Us\", a dive into how the CIA has used illicit substances against the masses for decades all while framing it as \"sticking it to The Man\". We talk about how the hippie movement was essentially baked in a lab and used as dedicated MKULTRA test subjects, as well as avenues the MKULTRA may still be operating today through government sanctioned programs such as MAPS (The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies) and cultural arenas such as Burning Man. John's research reveals that many \"alternative\" subcultures are not as the appear at first glance.\n\nWatch CIA Drugs R Us: https://tubitv.com/movies/100027087/cia-drugs-r-us-a-drugs-as-weapons-sequel\n\nCheck out John's website to read and watch more of his work: https://www.johnpotash.com/\n\nListen to previous PC Pod episodes with John Potash:\n\nThe CIA, LSD, and McCarthyism: https://open.spotify.com/episode/0I5NKhkXOMujNnIcZwIM6y?si=alt70ZzuSdW-InOrfZnP-w\n\nBlack Liberation & COINTELPRO: https://open.spotify.com/episode/28UI2R35eqnGvzXK6klUAQ?si=394oyNlZQzmeIObBoAzDXA\n\nSHOTS: Eugenics to Pandemics: https://open.spotify.com/episode/3dJnlcD2HcEhdlDI3LcGsf?si=UoK5guDVSmyCYCAEoYjzAA \n\nCheck out our Publishing Press books and journals here: https://www.midwesternmarx.com/books.html \n\nIf you enjoyed our video please consider checking our website out : \nhttps://www.midwesternmarx.com/\n\nAlso, if you are interested in helping us fund our project become a Patron : \nhttps://www.patreon.com/MidwesternMarx\n\nCheck out our online library for FREE books on Socialism, Philosophy, History, and more:\nhttps://www.midwesternmarx.com/online-library.html\n\nListen to our Podcast on Spotify:\nhttps://open.spotify.com/show/3Dv6DvcOuSXQ5LhmA1YCPa \n\nFollow us on Instagram: @midwesternmarx\nFollow us on Twitter: @MarxMidwest\nLike us on Facebook: @Midwestern Marx",
