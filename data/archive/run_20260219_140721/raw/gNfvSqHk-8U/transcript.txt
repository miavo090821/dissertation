hello everyone and welcome back to the probably cancelled podcast in association with the midwestern marks Institute my name is Bridget and I am your host and today I am back again with friend of the Pod John podes he's an author a documentarian and is known for his books including drugs As Weapons against us as well as the FBI's war on Tupac Shakur and black leaders he's been on the podcast a few times in the past to talk about his work exposing the US government's involvement with coel Pro as well as their dabbling in biological warfare by pushing drugs on various segments of the population and today he is back to talk about his newest documentary titled CIA drugs R Us which is a sequel to his previous documentary drugs As Weapons against us so I'm super happy to have you back John how are you doing good thanks for having me on again Bridget good yeah always happy to have you uh I watched your most recent documentary and it was super super great you added on a lot of new information that hadn't been previously explored before in your previous works all about government influence and how they're really messing us up with these drugs so I'm excited to have you go even deeper into this subject uh during this interview today so just to start because some of my listeners have heard your previous episodes that you were on which I'll I'll link in the show notes so people can find those easily but for those who are new and new to your work can you just explain uh like an overview of your research and what you've dedicated your life to doing sure so my day job is as a psychotherapist and I started out uh 1989 in Baltimore city after getting a psychology degree started out in addictions counseling I I further did addictions counseling over the next say 10 years in Washington DC and New York City and then started uh after graduate school in New York I started transitioning more to uh mental health counseling along with addictions counseling and for the last 10 years I've been um more of a trauma therapist uh most exclusively in the last five years as a trauma therapist using EMDR iov desensitization reprocessing and along the way uh from around 1990 onwards I was researching the subject of this book drugs As Weapons against us um I only the CIA war on musicians and activists and I only took a tangent from that to first publish the book the FBI war on txor and black leaders and made a film on that um and then uh worked then published drugs As Weapons against us then made a film on that in 2019 I published the book in 2015 the film in 2019 and took a tangent from that to uh because of the you know pandemic situation I uh put out the film shots genics the pandemics and then came back to the original subject of I while I was filming that I actually had originally been uh working on the the sequel CIA drugs are us um and so I finished the sequel after that and after you know uh the first film that came out with the 2019 I came to find uh Tom O'Neal a author um award-winning author had uh published a book on the Manson family and found that um this CIA basically used project chaos and MK Ultra uh to create Manson and his family and I show all the evidence of that I have him talking in the film and showing the evidence of that in the film of how he uh he basically found the letters that went back and forth between the CIA um director CIA project MK ulture director Dr Sydney gotle and the doc Dr Lewis jolian West who was in the H asbery free medical clinic at an office there while Manson and his family were visiting there regularly and he was giving them according to a CIA whistleblower he was giving them uh LSD regularly and um and using what he professed in his own documents to be hypnosis and drugs to um to to gain to gain control of their minds to turn these young runaway women as young as 13 sadly enough into uh mind controlled you know like assassins which is what they you know end up doing is committing murder so um and so this was you know a CIA project and that's a large part of of the film in the middle of the film um and I show how that was used used also against the Black Panthers because originally these murders were to try to frame the Black Panthers because the murders took place in a key part of um of Hollywood uh at a woman named Sharon Tate's house who was a it was a top actress at the time Roman pansy's wife she also was an activist organizer and had loads of top uh actors meeting at her house like Donald suwin Jane Fonda and many others who considered them who called themselves the white panthers in their um you solidarity with the Black Panthers and support of the Black Panthers they also were very anti-war and doing some great anti-war activism there and so the murders at that house was to scare away that all these actors from that that continued activism as well as killing the one of the top you know activists uh actor organizers Sharon Tate along with others in the house at the time and so um this was you know a major new finding I had to put on film um I review the uh first film a bit in the first part of of my of CI drugs R Us because I wanted to put in a little more of a comic light also and I wanted to to show the New Evidence I found about uh the murder of John Lenin you know the uh manipulation of John lennin and and his murder along with the manipulation of Kurt Cobain and I found was his murder and um and so that's you know rounds out the uh kind of encapsulation of that of the original film but um then the last third of this film I um I basically uh had uncovered the fact that um the the subject of the keepers uh award-winning Emmy you know War nominated I'm sorry documentary series on Netflix um actually he worked I mean he worked and lived in a neighborhood adjacent to mine literally within five miles of me and uh Gemma Hoskins uh the star of the of the keepers um lived in my lives in my neighborhood and so I basically just sent her information about why I believed that what uh this was all about was something was connection to M Ci's MK ulture program and uh sent her a bunch of docu doents and papers and so she reinterviewed a lot of the victims that were in the keepers and for a podcast she had and found that they were saying that yes we think we were programmed we thought that he hyp Joseph mascal hypnotized us he um you know he gave us drugs and we were worried that we were had you know might have killed someone you one woman said uh other women said that they felt like uh they they never touched a gun before and all of a sudden they were marksmen and shooting and you know presented a lot of other evidence that they in fact were uh possibly hypnotized and when drugs were used on them along with the trauma they were created into dissociative um kind of assets for the CIA and so um I personally also counsel someone who was a victim of Father Joseph mascal and I've counseled others have been victims of this church sex abuse Scandal so I just have some inside knowledge on some of this stuff and um some you know expertise knowledge one dissociation and dissociative identity disorder dissociative disorder and for those who don't know uh dissociative identity disorder is the uh new term new kind of a name for what used to be called multiple personality disorder and um so trauma um Can itself split with the mind and cause split personality but that kind of trauma plus hypnosis and drugs can cause uh you know someone to be controlled in that way it's so crazy and I want to get more into the the keepers related stuff later but going back to the subject of the 1960s it's so interesting because I always growing up my parents listen to the music that came out of the 60s some really amazing music and I like a lot of it I love the fashion I I always thought like what a crazy time you like what a crazy time and how how was it possible that that even came out of nowhere and happened I always looked at it like that like what an anomaly bizarre like Fantastical time and uh then in my 20s when I realized when I learned about how the CIA had basically created that subculture and kind of pushed it onto the masses and um pushed drugs onto the masses especially the youth particularly the the politically aware youth uh during the Vietnam War I was like oh [ __ ] that's how something that Fantastical and crazy can come about is because it was largely socially engineered right and when I bring this up to people on the left they have a huge resistance towards this area of study you know your your particular expertise there's a huge push back because people are like no these drug they take the drugs really personally and like the personal experiences they've had through psychedelics and um just something that appears to be organic I think a lot of people cannot fathom how much of our culture is inorganic and is socially engineered so could you talk a little bit about the amount of experimentation that was going on um particularly in that era and why like why why did that why were they pushing this on us at that time right so this so my film is my film in the previous film the prequel uh were was the majority was about you know operation MK Ultra now um the oligarchs and drugs started way back when with the uh wealthiest families being involved with the British East India Company the British company involved in you know uh in opium trading and they I tell in the beginning of the film how they founded the Ivy League colleges with with their opium fortunes and then um you bring it up to the current times like after World War II and and they brought in from World War II they brought in these German science SST to help out with mkra and uh in 1953 they brought a bunch of projects that they were working on uh some of them brought in from the you know the op the experiments on um Jewish uh and other you know Gypsy and gay and all victims and communist victims uh of the you know Nazi experiments these Nazi scientists had these different experiments going on under the CIA U umbrella and uh they brought them all together in this MK Ultra in 1953 and MK Ultra had 1 about 149 actually sub projects and so these uh were they were using that these sub projects and they were funding uh colleges and hospitals and prisons around the country um through uh a group called the human ecology fund and I showed an through an anthropology today article about that how human ecology fund was this front company CH you know channeling this uh CIA money through from M MK Ultra into all these groups and when when Government funding was cut at any point the Rockefeller Foundation Ford foundation and all them would step in the carnegies would step in and and provide funds but um so these these this money going to these colleges went to Harvard Stanford John's Hopkins Columbia Etc and you know one of the most famous uh professors involved in that was Timothy ly who was the biggest Pusher of acid and Timothy lry in an art in an interview later in life admitted that he knew he was working for the CIA since 1962 and so um this MK was trying in their own documents say they were using drugs for unconventional warfare and we think of that as Warfare overseas with soldiers and all that but what I found is that the best evidence shows that they were using it uh against anyone who dissented from their racist proar agenda and so they're using on American and British and other activists you know worldwide and you know other Western countries activists that were involved in more you know that were you know involved in sorry anti-war protests and racial um you know uh civil rights protests and so that's why Paul Robison was a victim because he was a great civil rights leader um before he was the the um target of of MK Ultra sadly enough brilliant uh lawyer and uh incredible singer and you know all that could speak 20 different languages showed that more in my last film in this film I show how they they funded uh this this Timothy ly he got kicked out of Harvard and he brought his other professors working with him over to um this Mansion uh the milbrook Manion where Peggy and Billy Mel and Hitchcock of the uh Mel and Hitchcock's own golf oil and melon Bank Etc they were some of the wealthiest in the world family in the world who had major uh you know agents in US intelligence um you working for the CIA and OSS before that and so they they give uh their mansion to liri for pennies he lures um great artists and writers and other and political activists up from New York to this constant party meanwhile there's MK Ultra scientists just hang just stationed there experimenting on the people that came to these parties with all kinds of super psychedelics and different things like that and um and and and it it tried to lure a number of uh civil rights activists up to those parties they did the same thing and according to the top psychologist from K John gure in a legal testimony he said uh he was present at the same kind of parties that were happening in in Stanford on the west coast and they had this group they formed this group the Mary pranksters who were uh most many of them were Military Officers came out and uh had constant parties there The Grateful Dead were performing for parties they called acid tests some people knew they were they were taking acid when they uh D you know had a cup of punch um they call electri covid um and others didn't though many that attended their parties didn't know they were being dosed and those acid tests got larger and larger they became the beans and that were kind of made popularized by these fake underground newspapers around the country that um I call as part of an AST Turf campaign that's a public relations term for fake Grassroots and um and so the parties got bigger to be the trips festival and then the um and then to be some of the biggest concerts and um and so these undercover agents CI agents who were present at these concerts all over the country pushing acid pushing speed pushing all kinds of drugs experimenting these drugs on the people that didn't know what they were taking uh Timothy lry was on stage at these beings pushing you know the drugs to people think pretending like it's uh mind expanding they had you know cooperating journalists that that used you know that wrote books that the CI basically put out but where you know the CI also owns a lot of publishing companies and we get these books out you know about supposed mind expansion from acid and really what best studies found were that they were um however you felt about mind expansion at the moment you were tripping you were really hurting your mind in a big way and I found I show four um articles saying that there's some kind of cerebral damage going on from the acid and I say this after tripping about half a dozen times myself and sadly I mean at the time I was the first year of college you know it kind of spread from last year year of high school first year of college and um just saw my grades drop drastic ically after tripping you know college seemed so easy to me uh before tripping and after tripping I saw my grades dropped drastically everything got harder uh well you know what lry says is turn on tune in and drop out so right right yeah he spreads and it's like drop out of society but also drop out of activism yeah you know just it's just turned you know him and um other agents of the CIA would just say you turn your back on it all as if it would just go away as if it'll magically go away the war you know versus protesting the war and trying to stop it and so meanwhile there's there's great activists that are rising up that had nothing to do with drugs at the time and that was the students for Democratic Society and the Black Panthers um those are two you know great activist organizations are rising up for civil rights and and anti-war activism and um and they were doing great work but so they got infiltrated in a major way even the New York Times admitted that we had that the uh FBI and CIA boast of having an agent in every you know chapter in the country um and so I showed that in in my film uh but black panthers will he were heavily infiltrated also though they you know they tried to continue to do great work despite the infiltration and so did SDS but by the time I show the evidence that that by the time uh 1969 came around with a National Conference in SDS um you had basically a a a guy whose group whose SDS group had been completely infiltrated and controlled and his father was one of the wealthiest men in in America um and that that would be uh you know uh just skipped on his name all of a sudden but um the uh Bill SS whose father Tom SS owned Chicago Tribune he owned Sears he was a board of directors uh for um ener Dynamics one of the top defense contractors in the country um you know and uh Tribune's huge he also was on the board of uh the gas and electric for Chicago and most of Illinois and uh so he was incredibly wealthy and here is his son coming in and and being the leader of Michigan SS where SS started started at the University of Michigan his son becomes the leader of Michigan SDS and doesn't do any uh civil rights activism is his only civil rights activism is supposedly is uh creating a school that was um that was you know both black and white but the but black and white parents of of the kids that went to that school withdrew their kids because they said this this man this guy's making our kids racist and Uh something's wrong going wrong at the school and oppos any grants going to the school because it was a a bizarre situation there and so um and so he takes over SDS he you know the puls a prizewinning article about um a woman who was part of SDS at that time Diana Alton said that um that this bill SS and this other guy who they say most people suspected was a CIA undercover agent who they didn't know where he came from and what he was doing at Michigan um they said that he that those two you know brutalize anyone who opposed anything they wanted to say or do and that SDS had uh dozens of thugs inside uh you know inside SDS beating people who opposed them and created a really scary atmosphere in SDS and they took that to the National SDS and um they influenced I I show the evidence they influenced berine Dorne to start tripping uh often in her her best judgment berin Dorne was a law student in Chicago at the University of Chicago who I believe Was northwestern actually who was um who had become the leader one of the top two leaders top three I'm sorry leaders of SDS and um so he influence her to um at the National Convention to break up the con you know to just leave the convention with a lot of others you know just LED them out of the convention and officially you know in effect broke up STDs FBI you know just boasted of their success you know the fact that SDS was broken up at that point and so um you know and then he ends up becoming uh the new leader of the split SDS and so it's just a really real travesty what the CIA was able to do to this uh organization that went from a handful of organizers in 1960 to 100,000 members in 1969 and then these infiltrators um you know end up just doing away with it and um so it's um you know these are some of the stories that need be told in the way drugs were used to hurt the best and brightest minds of of Our Generation that we doing this great anti-war organizing and and they were doing life or death organizing obviously it was you know around the time of the Vietnam War when the draft was going one and you know young college students were college students were being drafted left and right and um you know dying in the Vietnam War not not to mention the million or so that were dying on the Viet Vietnamese side of of things and so these are just examples of what went on history that best evidence shows are still going on today because these operations The Counter Intelligence program and and MK Ultra still go on today best EV shows and whistleblowers say um they're just hidden under different names you know whistleblower Phil AG uh said that MKUltra continues just under different names and former um MK Ultra Agent Wes swearing came out with a memoir in the mid 90s saying you know it continues kelln telpro continues uh today according to his fellow agents but they just use different names for it and that's why I show I focused on the Shakur family uh because the fact that when Tupac Shakur went from being a 17-year-old leader of a group called the new African Panthers in 1989 and 90 um to being you know this this rap icon and and acting icon um the best evidence is that they of course with K and Tel Pro still going they would Target him and mously targeted him and I show the evidence of how they tried to kill him about four or five times before they were successful and show the evidence of police involvement in those attempted murders and um and how uh you know the FBI were watching when he was finally uh done away with when he was finally murdered and um failed to stop it according to award-winning Las Vegas reporter Kathy Scott so this is um the way they did things and they used that modus op brendi against um John Lenin because Johan lenon become so activist uh he was dosed the first time they you know uh introduced ass it to him they put in his coffee without his knowledge a dentist actually George Hon's dentist and then uh just like they did with berine Dorne to get um Bill Aris you know close to her and getting her tripping and then marrying her sadly enough um they did the same with Yoko Ono and John lenon I argue because a memoir came out in 2019 uh like just after my film came out a memoir came out of a journalist who was friends with John Len Yoko and who said that Yoko introduced him to heroin and had originally introduced he got him Tri again when he thought he was losing his mind on acid and stopped for a year a year and a half actually about two years he said from 1967 to 69 and um so this is the way they do things and um and you know at the end of his life he was getting more activists he was getting away from hard any hard drugs and they um used apparently a uh kind of mind controlled Mark David Chapman to shoot at him and either he killed him or the undercover CI agent want uh per San jares Perdomo who was the um working at John lenn's apartment house that night uh you know murdered John Lenin uh in 1980 and so these these are some of the stories that just need to be told sure it's so crazy How Deep The Rabbit Hole goes in so many different directions all these wormholes like the Grateful Dead people Bob Weir of the Grateful Dead is is a frequent Bohemian Grove attendee and he's been in interviews talking about how he sits down with the head of the CIA and they have like a great chat and their buddies and and then so you know you mentioned the Grateful Dead tours where people I mean there's a whole subculture of people who spend their entire life following the Grateful Dead on their tour and taking acid or mushrooms or whatever every night yeah and this is like another form of I swear to God it's some sort of MK Ultra experiment that these people are being observed and that brings me to what are your thoughts on burning man because I've been thinking about this regarding Burning Man for years now it's so suspicious and twisted I don't know what are your thoughts on burning man yeah so I have a section of my book on Burning Man and um so it's just you know they they're dosing I mean there's people going around I have an interview in my that you I quote in my book of uh someone just saying that people were going around with with water bottles that they spray spraying people with and you think they're just cooling you off with that water bottle but they're actually uh there's actually loads of hits of of psychedelics in there and so they're they're involuntarily making you trip because uh acid can be just absorbed through the skin to have you trip like that and um and so that's really ugly stuff that's you know the same thing that cia's assistant director Robert Lashbrook was doing back in the 60s coming he went to um you know England with loads of acid and and loads of money in agents and just instructed the agents to get asset in as many musicians hands as possible and that's when John lenon right a few months later John lenon was voluntarily dosed by George Harrison's dentist then but so at Burning Man that's what they were doing they're they're getting people tripping against their will and uh so yeah there's lots of evidence in my mind and I show right about my book about it's just this uh fake Grassroots situation again where there's people promoting it all over the world um this Burning Man and uh promoting psychedelics like crazy and trying to divert the uh youth movement to that as if that's some kind of um you know Revolution of itself it's just you know just to burn out your brain one ass and other psychedelics at this thing where um you know it's nice if you like the party and that's fine and um that's no no problem with that it's just hurting our minds at a time when the oligarchs can just so so much easier you know roll over us while we're burning our brains out and we just have to have our best wits about us to to uh oppose the oligarchs you know because they've got the money we've got the numbers but we also have to have the creativity to uh stop them yeah yeah and I mean the and I also have done my share of psychedelics probably I mean even the most obscure ones I've managed to get my hands on and do and I mean I have no problem with iasa or you I don't know as much I mean I've tried I I don't know you know know how bad shrooms are for you or not but I do think that when it comes to MDM it's clearcut that it's so many Studies have found that even just a little bit of MDMA use can hurt our memory in a big way I think it fried my brain I think MDMA totally fried my brain yeah it's just it's just bad news yeah I tried twice but it's like definitely found major memory problems after the acid and then the MDMA no didn't help either um and so you know I lost just some skills I used to be able to write a whole page of a paper in my head easily just see every word you know for a whole page and then I I just pick up the pen and write it out in the old days before computers were as big for writing papers but I just think that yeah these you know all these synthetic drugs like MDMA acid DMZ you know DMT and bz and all these things are really dangerous stuff um iasa might be more okay um I don't know enough about it but um you know shrooms I can't say a whole lot about it just the the concern is is that young people will you they try the shrooms and they'll think well I want to try something more you know I'll open the door to taking acid and messing up their head yeah and it's just a shame but yeah it's um we go we just got to uh do things in a more sober way just to uh do the best work we can you know toh stop what's going on well it's it's the perfect tool to ward off of materialism and like actual concrete analysis of reality and like a concrete way of fighting back against our overlords and the whole subculture revolves around personal self-improvement and turning in on oneself and focusing on yourself instead of like focusing on the people around you so it's the perfect it's a perfect anti-communist tool weapon in my opinion and I have been personally victimized by this by these drugs and uh I mean it's just crazy with Burning Man for example you know they they Pride themselves on personal self-responsibility that's the whole thing you have to bring all of your own supplies uh nothing's supposed to really be like shared in you're supposed to bring everything for yourself um and then you go to Black Rock City there the place where they bring you to is called Black Rock City like Black Rock I mean that's a little odd and then most people are unaware that it's now a corporate coration um Burning Man Corporation and they're making like a ton of money a ton of money off these people and another burning man's secret is that they don't publish it's never made public the amount of deaths that happen at Burning Man because if somebody overdoses or if they fall off of a art car and die what's done is they put you in an ambulance and take you to the nearest town in Nevada and declare you deceased at the Hospital in a nearby town so we'll never have the actual numbers of the amount of deaths that happen at Burning Man but I am absolutely certain that there's some federal agency doing experiments on people there I I swear to God it's like the prime site to do that right and then so okay another thing that I've been thinking about for years that you mentioned in this documentary and when I saw it I was like oh finally somebody is bringing this up is Maps Okay so it's I there are multiple uh it's not minor attracted persons Maps it's uh what is it called multipl multi it's the multidisciplinary association of psychedelic studies and there's multiple links between Rick doblin and maps and the human ecology fund of the 1960s and 70s you know where basically the 60s had the the human ecology fund and loads of people that were involved in that along with with um the Brotherhood of eternal love which was the group that the melon Hitchcock and Timothy ly created um some of the same scientists then uh helped out with maps and what is Maps can you tell our listeners who don't know so Maps is again the multi-disciplinary association of psychedelic studies is funded by The Rockefellers the billionaire Rockefeller family and and other billionaire families um and they Supply endless amounts of money to universities all over the world to uh to basically to promote use of psychedelics for therapy and all kinds of other things they say it's good for for in some way good for our health they say they drug legalization they're involved in like pushing for drug legalization they push for you know LSD uh legalization and use for for therapy again and you shrooms psychedelic mushrooms MD yeah MDMA uh you know XC or Molly is MDMA ketamine and we just saw you know that guy from that actor from Friends uh die Matthew Perry die after ecstasy use developing an ecstasy problem and I I mean yeah he died he he I mean I'm sorry from ketamin us he died while he was on ketamine therapy with a Maps funded uh you know experim a group of some sort some kind of group that was doing K supposed ketamine therapy he died oh God in the middle of that and um and so this is just some of what's going on there and so they're doing they're they're funding all these experiments with this stuff and places like Columbia University where I went to grad school and uh just show that these people are uh promoting this as if it's about to be legalized and it hasn't the FDA actually despite the massive money and that are going to trying to legalize it and uh they found it's just it just shouldn't be legalized uh because yeah it's causes for all kinds of reasons causing brain damage but also the experimenters having sex with experimental subjects and different things like that they they just said about you know in The Advisory panel turning it down and personally I don't care if drugs are legal or illegal I care about them promoting you the CIA pushing on everyone and acting like it's therapeutic and lying to people about it this sorry to interrupt you but okay I got an ad on Instagram last year and it was literally an ad for atome like virtual ketamine therapy for your PTSD or whatever that was an ad a targeted ad towards me on Instagram so now they're they're mail I don't know how it works but I'm assuming they're mailing people the ketamine so that they can sit on a webcam with a with a therapist and do this ketamine therapy over the computer like essentially unsupervised like no there's no medical assistance if you need it at your house like I I couldn't believe my eyes when that was marketed to me so that like that's the level that they're pushing this now is it's on Instagram ads yeah it's it's ridiculous and so they're they're joined by Maps is joined by another group called hefter which is the the same uh mission same donate donors like the Rockefellers and others and pritsker family and people like that and uh a third group is a British group um called the um Beckley Foundation which was found by a member of the royalty Amanda Fielding who was pushing I said my you know film Tre traning which is drilling a hole in your skull to expand your mind and it should be you know you think it'd be a sanate Liv skit or something but they they they're pushing that as normal and uh sadly enough they almost um convinced John Lennon to Chapan himself to drill hold in a score but he you thankfully thought better but he his taking acid again with yokono um made him think that maybe he he should try it so he was um you know hurting his mind at that time but this this Manda fielding's still around today and her Beckley Foundation has joined conferences with maps and hefter and they're the ones pushing the psychedelics all all over the world right now and it's it's sad it's uh sad fact that these you know IV Le schools all these schools uh just need the money and and they're being offered this huge amount of money to just do these experiments and you know schools have a hard time turning down money so sad but true it's crazy that they've taken they took MK Ultra told us that they we stopped doing that actually you guys but then they just continued it under like a woke NGO like hyper liberal cloak of these organization organizations such as Maps so Maps will like push like oh look we have trans people working for us we have indigenous people working for us we're so we're so great and open-minded and you should take these drugs it's just I mean I'm very impressed by how they're just continuing on under a completely new cloak and people are I mean I used to think Maps was good before I knew like the true history of all this yeah well I'm glad you you've uh seen seen their ugly background and yeah so it's it's incredible how they have they just have these think tanks that are getting paid to come up with all kinds of angles to convince us of these things and so we have to just really be independent minded thinkers and sort through all this propaganda they come up with to push it on us and and try to figure out what's best for us but uh keeping a a clear mind and a you know a sane mind is something that's not easy to do when when we're constantly being bombarded with try this drug try that drug whether it be the psychedelics or the pharmaceutical you know company's newest thing for you know relieving you of depression or anxiety or whatever else while you know things uh new techniques like eye movement desensitization and processing is just a completely non-invasive way of of of NE we call it neutralizing processing and neutralizing traumas in your life and these can be you know sexual or physical abuse kind of traumas or they could be uh just even emotional traumas and I've come to find and many therapists have come to find psychiatrists that or alternative psychiatrists have come to find that uh that these emotional tra AAS and other kinds of traumas is what tends to cause uh these you know depression anxiety and and other mental health issues that's that psychiatrist pushing drugs try to say is genetic Andor and you know and trying to get you to use their latest pharmaceutical for well they've uh well I always grew up hearing that it's a chemical imbalance in the brain and you have to IM they I mean it was just revealed this past year that there there's no such thing as a chemical imbalance in the brain and that was just something that they made up to sell the drugs so yeah I mean you know in England where they have National Health Care they've looked at the meta studies for these an depressants and they basically found that they in the long term they don't work better than Placebo and they they obviously work a lot worse because they have all kinds of side effects from major weight gain to uh Lexapro causing major sexual dysfunction to all kind permanent permanent sexual dysfunction and uh suicide yeah there's all kinds of horrible side effects like that so and you can see it in their um pharmac you know their pharmaceutical ads on TV here they just lists loads of these side effects uh that are just so ugly and scary and people you know I don't know how people take these drugs after hearing these side effects but um the advertisements I hear actually aren't even to sell the drugs they sell the drugs no matter what but they the advertisements are to control TV and control TV stations and control their content yeah and it's also interesting because I haven't I haven't really owned my own TV in many years and I remember a couple years ago visiting my parents house during the holidays and you know they have the TV on and I was shocked that almost every single commercial that I saw was for a pharmaceutical drug and I did not remember it being that way know 10 years ago but now I mean every other commercial is for drugs and it just struck me like wow that's that's a sign of the times I think that um yeah things have changed to that degree yeah yeah no doubt and so um that's why uh RFK Jr is onon this crusade to to get them off of TV because United States and New Zealand are the only Western countries in the world that allow pharmaceutical companies to advertise on TV wow and um so you know he um and it's you know I know people might be upset of course with him um be getting to be part of Trump's campaign uh but he RFK Jr did everything to try to run as a Democrat and tell the Democrats look you know then run is an independent but the Democrats sued him and everything State around the country that uh they they could and then he um he he offered just said look I'll I'll back you to Cal Harris if you just allow me to head you know Health and Human Services or be part of your cabinet she completely refused him and Trump said okay I'll let you be head of human you know Health and Human Services um if you if you back me and he just wanted to get in there to try to change things to try to take all these toxins out food you know that you he just shows that you know and just change things for the better and he's just he's very interesting for the fact that he's been studying the CIA all his life and um because his grandfather uh actually had had pushed hard against the CIA um in a big way in around 1955 or so and um and they attacked his grandfather then they of course killed his uncle and his father and and um of course they're now trying to smear him too but he's he's brilliant about MK Ultra he's brilliant about the cia's history and got all their nefarious um activities and so um we'll see I mean they probably won't let him you know be in Health and Human Services but at least he's getting the word out about about all these you know the danger of all these Cals and stuff yeah definitely we'll see what he's able to do because I mean he's up against the biggest industries in the world in trillions and trillions of dollars against him you know against our interests right we'll see yeah yeah so but um so I I appreciate you uh talking to me about all this Bridges good I think in Mexico it's very interesting because I heard from doctors in Mexico that that during the pandemic they actually had uh hydroxy chloroquin and Ivor mechon in all the airports just in you know when the shelves for every for the public to get gain access to whenever they wanted uh to cter yeah they it was really wild how Mexico did things completely differently and many countries did that um we're in our little bubble here in the United States and just don't where they where the media just vilify anything that's not um the you know the very expensive vaccines the very expensive other other kinds of drugs but yeah it's it's really crazy uh how expensive things are in the United States and yeah you know I appreciate uh RFK [Music] Jr I mean he I do think he's compromised with the whole Zionism thing that's a shame that's really unfortunate um I wonder and also the the Epstein like him being on Epstein's plane three times that's unfortunate but you know I think that he is at least enlightening people to the truth of how these industries work and I've come across just like just people that I meet especially older people like especially older people they really really like him and they they I feel like he has unveiled a lot of truths for a lot of people and he has a lot of popular support on both sides like Democrats and Republicans so I mean the other oh one more thing sure do you have any thoughts it's kind of related do you have any thoughts about the recent uh shooting of the United healthc Care CEO do you think that because people are claiming some people are speculating that Luigi mangion is uh mkl tread what what do you have to say about that yeah I just I just think that he um you know he he did Herald um Ted kazinski in in some kind of notes of his or something but um and in doing that he was you know he was uh promoting a guy who who was an MKUltra victim T kazinski at Harvard um kazinski apparently was you know they tortured him with uh psychologically while they gave him psychedelics at Harvard and um and that's why he was so intensely against you know the United States government um because of horrible things they did to him um so uh but with mangion my I don't think he's I don't think he's MK Ultra subject I think he just uh He did apparently some sources they're not good sources I haven't studied it carefully but but I hear that he was uh sending out um psychedelic mushrooms to people also I don't know if that's true or not but if so is a good chance he did a lot of psychedelics and maybe he just acted a little rashley about what were you know rightful concerns that he hates National Health Care I mean mean he hates the the Health Care System the United States and hates these you know guy making a head of a you CEO of uh Health Plan making $10 million when they're denying services for people all over the country that are you know going into poverty in order to try to pay for um you know a procedure a life- saving procedure and so he was just to me he was just acting more rash you know just more impetuously about in the way he he countered that and and you know in shooting the head of a you know insurance company but it's you know he's become a folk hero and I think for for pretty good reason I mean I don't agree with murder but I do think that he at least you know brought the issue to light in in a bigger way for everyone and said this is our systems out is just totally out of control and and is so um inhumane to people and we're the only industrialized country in the world that doesn't have National Health Care and it's absolutely inhumane so yeah yeah maybe you're right I mean I saw that his Goodreads account that was it's public and you could see all his reviews of the books that he's read cuz he's an Avid Reader and he was reviewing a lot of books about psychedelics particularly so I wonder if that did play a role in his kind of spiral if he actually was the shooter you know it's all alleged but yeah and and they say there was there was usually in these kinds of situation there is a group of people working with a guy they always you know claim it's a solo shooter and all but best intelligence agent um that that actually partnered with Naomi wolf who um is an interesting writer you know uh you know uh she wrote some uh letters some really interesting anti- U us fascist you know books um he he basically said that when when you have a situation like this where you shoot someone like this to to come upon them at the exact time you want to you need like a a team of people surveying the situation you can't just do it alone it's incredibly hard to do something like that alone now I'm not saying I I totally trust this intelligence agent who wrote this but it makes sense I mean why why would he you know write this in a way that you know what's his motive otherwise but so there's probably people helping n and I don't know why I don't know what it's all about but um it's interesting I I don't know enough more about the story than that but it's it's an interesting uh new development and I I just hope that something good comes of the fact that people are talking about how horrible um these insurance companies can be for for healthcare in the US yeah oh and oh I almost forgot the um another drug reference for him is that on his Twitter header the image that he chose to upload for his Twitter header it uh it was a picture of a Pokemon on and then the picture of his spinal X-ray with with the metal bolts put in his spine and then a picture of him like at his physical prime but the first image of the Pokemon was is specifically the mushroom Pokemon so I'm like okay he was into mushroom like he's into psychedelics like psychedelics signs are there but I really do wonder if people were helping him it also seems like he wanted to get caught because he I the whole thing I'm surprised he got away at all but then it seems like he wanted to get caught and was leaving like a trail and going into public and I'm curious to see what will happen with this case and what information will even be disclosed to us but yeah we'll see um do you want to wrap up now or do you have time for one more question what do you think I have time for another question sure okay going back to uh the SDS in your documentary you talk about the Weather Underground and their involvement in various uh sabotage sabotage operations of leftist movements can you just talk a little bit about the Weather Underground because when I used to be a drugged out Anarchist I thought Weather Underground was so cool and I wanted to be just like them not realizing um the true history of how they were created and what their purpose was so you want to just talk a little bit about that well to me they're they're a mixed bag I think overall though that they're that a lot of people involved in the Weather Underground that had sincere intentions did did very courageous work at fighting uh the fascist of the you know uh War mongers and the uh anti you know the anti-il rights uh people and all that like it the Weather Underground was just one grouping of many different uh groups from my readings of it all that were conducting these bombings to uh protest the you know Vietnam War and to protest the uh unfair incarceration of leading black panthers I mean they you know certain it's not known if it was the weather underground or if it was some other you know uh revolutionary faction that bombed the um the judges home at Le at least once if not twice of uh when they were put um Tupac's mother and the uh New York City black panthers on trial you know and um so there's just bombings all over for so many different reasons that it's you know but the weather on the ground was just one formation that was doing this and um even though they were infiltrated and even though they were split off from SDS I I do think you know and and they weren't you know maybe the uh most was clear-minded what they were doing I do think they were sobering up they put out some books when when um you know telling why they were doing what they were doing um I one of the books Prairie Fire it's not the best book but I think it's it's got some good essays on this kind of kind of work they were doing and I think they did help I mean they just used they tried every other tactic to stop the Vietnam War and to Pro protest for civil rights um that they could and then following they you know when nothing else worked they did go to bombings but they weren't the first to go to bombings uh other groups did it before them and they just merely took off from there with from what other groups had already started and so um there was there was a group for example uh led by a woman that went to my um undergrad at swore College um that also was involved in bombings before the Weather Underground even started it so um yeah know so I just think it was just a a tactic and I think I think they they did some good stuff there there were a lot of cells all around the country doing this so um not every cell could be you know was infiltrated I think it was just some some you know well-meaning folks that had enough of being of having so many Americans Vietnamese people killed for no reason for the oligarchs and so that's my take on it even though I say that um the splitting up of SDS was terrible um The Weather Underground you know it was say it was probably a mixed bag but overall I do think they were courageous and did some some good work despite some of the the bad stuff that that um happened with you know these uh I mean there's reports of their orgies weren't all voluntary necessarily and so some people you know some people might have been traumatized from from from some of the supposed free love and stuff and but but generally speaking I think it was a well you know like majority of the people in the group were more well-meaning yeah I think well I'm sure some of the people were well-meaning I have a different I have a different Outlook to groups like The Weather Underground and their like the Federal in infiltration yeah and being egged on by the feds to commit these bombings I view them similarly in their adventurism to uh Luigi Manion where you know you have you do these extreme acts of violence but what does it really get you like does does it actually get us anywhere to do things like that in that circumstance where you don't have mass popular support or like or a mass party or or any long-term plan of how you're going to you don't you don't have anybody on your side except your little click and there's a really good interview of Fred Hampton of the Black Panthers talking about his opposition to the Weather Underground and he's like these they they're committing Folly they're they're irresp responsible and the work that we're trying to get done yeah in that time yeah in that time in my film I have that that that Fred Hampton there saying they muddle heads and Scatter brains for sure at that time they were at their worst they were the most scatterbrain and muddlehead because they were tripping up a storm and that's what really hurt their best you know their presentation in the beginning and their planning in the beginning with this you know Chicago you know raid like they were going to just fight the police and Chicago uh and it was it makes the left look nuts it makes everybody turn against us you know it totally it totally does and at that time they were at their worst and they were just and they were a big turnoff and they and their promotion of acid was totally federally manipulated and Bill SS type of person manipulated and it hurt a lot of brains around the country when they did that promoted AET to to like loads of activists and that's horrible but later when they sober it up more I do think they they did better work than that but you know again it's just a an argument you know it's it's a healthy debate about tactics and um you know I think this was some of their last tactic and I don't think they were completely federally manipulated I think it was just partially federally manipulated to to split up SDS and that was terrible but then all the people that got involved um were i t I tend to think you know I think a majority not all of course because some were federal agents Undercover agents but a majority I think were well-meaning and just picked a the most uh violent tactic after all the other tactics didn't work anymore yeah it's crazy how the Black Panthers were fighting everybody off I mean everyone was coming at them even um Timothy liry was going after the Black Panthers trying to get them to take acid and he was getting kicked he got kicked out of their headquarters and they were like what the [ __ ] are you doing dude like why are you trying to get us on these drugs we don't want this what the hell are you doing and then later it came out why he was doing that but they had everybody com yeah I definitely detailed that my first film and then detailed that also in my book what what he how Timothy Larry uh tried to do that tried to push it on Aldridge Cleaver and the back black panthers in Exile and yeah yeah it's it's ugly yeah so crazy oh my God okay well I highly recommend everybody to watch this new documentary as well as your other documentaries and read your
