He has only been charged with the murder of the UHC CEO.\nIt's interesting how even the most well-meaning people are guilty of convicting the accused before he has had his day in court, or before all of the facts, about the murder, are known to the public.   In large publicly promoted cases, the accused is often tried in the media, and in the public eye, before there is any carriage of justice.\nFor all we know, Brian Thompson could have been targeted by anyone - a rival CEO, a rival member of the board, some guy whose girlfriend Brian Thompson was bangin,' I mean who knows?? 🤷‍♂",

Ruling class are just looking for a way how to easily control the masses and as long they play along a irrationality of human nature,they dont need to worry about them loosing their positions.On the other hand,they are just humans themselves,they are also are being caught up in a endless cycle of seeking pleasures and running after imaginary goals,in order to avoid reality of pain and boredom..They just happen to be more sociopathic part of human society, therefore stronger ,more vicious than others, therefore prone to rule ..",

    "text": "Interesting conversation  -- thank you for the contribution.  My 2-cents on the acid is it's a heterogenous sample, historically, programmatically:  There are many different manifestations, variations, batches, of LSD.  There are many other confounding factors, confusing the issue further.  I will say I've had immensely transformative positive experiences with LSD-25 in the previous millenium, that may have been some luck.  I don't think they harmed my brain -- could be wrong.  I suspect the very small amount of MDMA I've done did do some harm in that sense -- but even more I suspect covert chemical warfare of a subtle program -- but really just don't know.  My overall sense is that the mkultra controller people discovered a rather coarse instrumentalization of this chemical, without appreciating the (to them, adverse) genuinely positive aspects of these substances -- coexisting with coarse brutal instrumentalizations.  Feasibly, they have engineered successive batches of acid to denude them of all positive aspects.  Last time I did acid it felt like nothing in particular, some vagrant chemical disorienting me.  That's not an objective measurement, perhaps it was golden lsd-25 and my mind so fried by stress my pineal gland can't vibe any more, etc.  Lot's of speculation in the absence of good laboratories, taboo on natural healing really is the heart of the ignorance.",
