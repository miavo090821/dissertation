As a progressive \"old white dude\", the perspective and nuance that you all bring, not only to the topics that I'm aware of and engaged in, but also ones unique to the black and brown communities, are very informative and refreshing.  It really resonated with me when you were pointing out that change can be really slow sometimes, but we have to acknowledge our successes.  That we don't have to agree with the candidate completely, but we can all agree who we have the best chance to influence towards progressive change.  My opinion is to vote Harris in and then protest the shit out of her to continue to apply pressure towards meaningful change, because with Trump we most likely wouldn't have the right to protest any longer.  Finally, several of you pointed out, that the most important thing we can all do, is to get involved in our local communities and embody the change we want to see and spread that hope and love through direct interaction and conversation with those in our communities.  Thanks for what you are all doing!",

Black always meant Black Americans to me--Afro, James Brown, etc--a distinct 'type' of Black. Obviously we are all descendants of Africa.

    "text": "This was an excellent conversation as always, Olay! Thank you for facilitating it bc it gave me a lot to chew on.\n\nNot to be nitpicky because thats annoying lmao but this is important re: Gaza and Palestine. It was mentioned a couple of times, and I want to push back on the idea that Palestinian activists and advocates are not engaged in the political process, I mean that's really not accurate or fair to say. and it is telling that even only referring to their demand as \"ceasefire\" felt to me that there may not have been a whole lot of recent engagement with the movement from that particular guest, which is his right - clearly we all have things that we prioritize, there's so much to deal with that we can't all be engaged in all things all the time. I wanted to gently point out that Palestinian American activists, while not monolithic or in agreement 100% on electoral politics like all movements, have changed the language around calling for a ceasefire because the Biden administration is using a different definition of ceasefire than what that term has meant historically for Palestinian liberation. The reason why the uncommitted vote organizers have been asking Kamala to meet is because they would prefer to support her over Trump by a wide margin, but they are trying to use leverage to get at least some sort of commitment from her on US support for this genocide. They are very much involved in the process and are strategic in how they engage.",

        "text": "@whatsthetea9609  I mean I can tell you that certainly there is a wider problem with a lack of attention on the genocides in Sudan and Congo for instance. Sudanese people in particular because of being an Arabic-speaking country have to deal with anti-Black racist nonsense from the rest of the non-Black Arabic-speaking world, so you'll see people who came out the womb with a commitment to Palestinian liberation be anti-Black to Sudanese refugees who are experiencing genocide as well. So I think part of the issue is that the world is anti-Black and even though Afro Palestinians exist, the world sees Palestinians in a homogenized, racialized way (as a result of zionism) so we largely think of them as Arab, when the reality is that Palestinians are quite diverse.\n\nI can only speak to my own experiences in pro-Palestinian spaces but there is often a plethora of flags on signs and and lots of talk about the collective struggle against colonialism and how it has caused so many atrocities worldwide and unique experiences for different peoples. The struggle is different in Congo than it is in Palestine than it is in the US but all of these have  connections and Palestinians have spoken about that a lot and done a lot of work with other liberation movements.\n\nAs far as whether or not one atrocity is worse than another, what is happening in Gaza is not any less horrific than what is happening anywhere else. \n\nSorry to take up this much space on something that I misunderstood from the video, btw.",

    "text": "Hello Olay, \nI really appreciate your show.  It popped up in my feed and I saw that Clay and Reese were in it and I am huge fans of theirs (met them at Beyond The Mic).  I really have an issue with the comments of @prshakur, when he says he is being asked to \"choose for this Black and Asian Prosecutor....\"  He is freaking angry at THAT!  At THAT moment,  I really wanted to ask him MR OHIO, what has JD Vance done for Ohio in the areas of abolition, since affects what happens in Ohio more locally?  Nevermind I know since I have family and friends in Ohio.  Since he has been in office (2023), he has not sponsored or co-sponsored ONE damn bill. JD Vance has not done a freaking thing for Ohio.  SO as far as the protest that they were in, the opponents of VP Harris wants to have the police ARREST them or make protesting ILLEGAL.  What will his abolitionist movement do for that?  I find it VERY interesting that all of these detractors from VP Harris or any Democratic candidate, has ALL type of smoke for them and NONE of the same energy for the Republicans.  You wont find any of the Gaza protesters at their rallies because 45 has already told his supporters to shut down any protestors by beating them up and he'll pay for their fines (which is a damn lie, surprise).  I knew where @prshakur stood  during he first introduction.  He said Black woman prosecutor and used it as a pejorative. I agree with your sentiments about this slave patroller injustice system but there are only two options:  1:  Burn it down completely and start anew and if there is nothing ready to go, we're still screwed especially since these white nationalists still have have the power; or 2: vote on the ones we can work with & get change the laws we can until we can't (while creating the ones we want) and then tear it down.   These folks act as if we are picking life mates, ironically since many due less diligence in choosing a partner but want all the tangibles for someone to vote for...that for the most part, they'll never meet.  We are voting for ourselves, families, and futures.   Outside of this, great discussion.",

I believe that.\n\nBut in terms of interviews and debates? Nah.",

But I could be missing something, the thing is that independent media usually poses the reparations question not the msm. Biden was also asked about reparations but only once by the msm in the primaries. He claimed that he supported the study of it like all of the rest of the liars in the primaries. But he has done nothing to push hr40 the reparations study bill in his presidency. Although as vp he gave 12 5 mil to Jewish H survivors in 2015, Kamala also has not pushed for hr40 although the Biden admin gave 1.7 bil to Indian Americans under covid relief and 30 million in the Asian Hate Crime Bill.",

And it's hard to, on the one hand, feel like you're participating in systems that you know cause so much global harm, and on the other hand, to accept that substantial change isn't an option now. Revolution feels pressing when you see climate change, see people die, see people become disabled and unhoused, see almost everyone around you burned out and hopeless. But we need more time to do groundwork. We need more time to effectively organize. A Harris presidency won't fix anything, it mostly just won't hinder progress (or reverse it) as much as a Trump presidency would.\nVote, don't vote. But if you vote - don't silence or shut down legitimate criticism of the candidate or her policies, and if you don't vote - don't try to sour people on political activity (especially if they're otherwise politically apathetic). We don't have to agree on voting (or for whom) to still work together to create networks of mutual aid that will be essential regardless of what happens in the future.",

Of the two options, one of them will make the change that leftists want much harder and will actively try and reverse a lot of progressive wins in this country. \n\nSo, when I see leftists that are adamant about not voting I believe they have this misconception that in order to be a ~true~ leftist and stick to your beliefs you mustn’t vote for a democrat… when all that benefits is the Republican Party. \n\nIt’s more about their own view of themselves than seeing the bigger picture. That in order to make change we HAVE to make the correct choice between two futures: Trump or Harris. Either way it’s going to happen so don’t just throw your vote away like it doesn’t matter. We have the power to decide which landscape we want to try and make progress in, and that should matter to anyone who can vote regardless of how you feel about either candidate.",

What then? What specifically would you have them do? Not generalities like \"stop cop cities\", but specifics - how? With an executive order? Great! Now consider - that's a solution that lasts until a president decides they don't want it anymore. Plus, congress is not currently a majority Leftist, so most will work against it to make it ineffective. And they'll do this for every single thing that that president might try to force through via EO. \n\nThen next election cycle, the talking points will be about how ineffective that president has been and how bad for the country they are because congress has to \"waste time\" dealing with executive orders instead of their own stuff. The Perfect Leftist Candidate won't be any help in changing the legislation and systems, but they'd be a perfect target for every political commentator. \n\nIn my experience, if people are really in it for the change and not just for something to be mad about, conversations like that will help them to realize that they're trying to build a building from the top down without a foundation in place and wondering why they feel like they're fighting a losing battle.",

I hope that's not what you're referring to. I hope you're talking about building autonomous tenant unions with your neighbors, revolutionary worker unions with your coworkers, community assembies in your neighborhood, and actual fighters for real defensive action when faced with inevitable oppression.

Again the \"compromise\" doesn't need to end up as a concession, IF we are willing to seize the opportunity presented by Kamala not calling a hit on protestors and bragging on national TV after, as an example. We can agree that no presidential nominee would be nearly radical enough to even do something as symbolic as lend lip service to tenant unions, while also acknowledging the hell Trump would bring on said efforts in terms of empowering landlords & employers to squash any labor movements.",

        "text": "Kamala explained statistics which prove that kids who do not get foundational education by 3rd grade continue to fall behind, get discouraged and eventually drop out of school. Stats show that this group is more likely to commit crimes, thus jail/prison. Therefore, she put this policy in place in order to reduce this outcome. If parents do not feed their children or take them to the doctor for needed medical attention, then it is considered \"child neglect\" with possible charges. Therefore, why should a child's educational needs be any different?  This policy was for extreme truancy and I am apt to believe there would have been some discretion between a 6yr old being habitually truant vs a 16yr old who is ditching school.  10 yrs ago, my grandson was 6 yrs old, but his mother had not put him in school. I registered him in school near me and kept him during the week to make sure he went to school.  I did this because I did not want him to fall behind. He is currently an A student, plays violin and sings in his high school choir. He was also voted President one year.  Had he not been in school, as law requires, then his chances at avoiding the criminal justice system would have greatly diminished.",

I’m genuinely curious on what in your life makes you feel that way about black as a racial identity /pos. \n\nIt’s likely that I have my opinion because I’m multi racial ( one parent is a immigrant from the Caribbean ( they are around half black and around around half Chinese but there is one % of both French and Spanish that got there somehow. The other parent is half ashkenazi Jew and half African American (I’m in the 5th free generation on this side) both of my parents my whole life have identified as black. Being black is  big part of my culture, the way people have harassed/ treated me, and my racial identity (I tend to say I’m brown, black, blasian or multiracial all of which I where with pride) \n\n(btw both parents are biological I just left out which\n parent is which sense there is already so much info here)\n\nAll this to say that my opinion/ view is 100% a result of the family I’ve grown up in and the life I’ve lived. So I’m curious on how different views form.

I didn’t really think about the fact that black is an American term (or at least a “western” term). \n\nI don’t really know much about Kamala’s racial identity ( I still need to do research on her and her policies but reliable sources are hard to find) my comment wasn’t necessarily about her but more so people respecting that immigrants and/or bi/ multi racial people who identify as black (or brown even) as people in the black and brown community. Because Colorism can be very hurtful when instead of not feeling like part of the black/ brown community it feels like the community you’re in is pushing you away leaving you with no community or racial identity (we all know white people aren’t going to see black immigrants or bi/ multi racial people as white). \n\nI guess in the future I should maybe mention why I’m saying what I’m saying.",

His point about Drake is that, despite not living a hard life, despite being a middle class canadian, who grew up in whiteness and called black Toronto slang \"ignorant\", Drake uses the aesthetics, slang, and stereotypes of African American culture to portray himself as someone who he is not. As other people always point out, if it was about race Kendrick would not have called Adonis \"a black man\" and would have similarly come at J Cole. The song makes no reference to Drake's race at all, nor his skin color, and only talks about how he treats rappers in Atlanta who he allegedly uses to gain credibility. The song is not about race, and it's not good to try to use the language of \"gas lighting\" when talking about something this trivial and obviously unrelated.",

Ask them what they think and vote in their stead. \n\nI live in Texas and had friends who weren’t very politically inclined and fairly privileged and when they found out I couldn’t vote bc I wasn’t a citizen, they would do it for me. When 2016 was happening and Clinton and Trump were both PEAK unlikeable candidates, they asked me how I felt bc they thought both were both were weirdos. I said Clinton. It didn’t matter that they hated her, they voted in my stead anyway. And even tho 2016 still went down the way it went down, I’ll never forget that they did SOMETHING with their dissatisfaction with politics that wasn’t just throwing away their vote, and the thing they did wasn’t about them and their discomfort.",

Amongst other issues is the Supreme Court. Trump has already placed 3 judges on the Supreme court, all of whom were recommended by the folks behind Project 2025 (The Heritage Foundation). There are at least 2 justices who are near death or retirement. We CAN NOT allow Trump to replace them. Further, the President appoints Federal Judges. We can not allow Trump to continue rigging the court system. This is how his classified docs case got dismissed. He previously appointed the judge that ended up on that case.  The Supreme Court has been chipping away at the constitution and they are not finished.  They have ruled that Corporations are people, Presidents have absolute immunity, State officials can take bribes, They overturned the Chevron document, and they overturned part of the Civil Rights Act, which previously protected the Black vote. There was also a recent ruling that will result in some of the Jan 6  prisoners being freed. You may be aware of all of this already.  Therefore, we need  Kamala (Democrat) to win. The others can not win. The Supreme Court will shape this country for our children, grandchildren and generations to come. We can not let Republicans replace Supreme Court Justices and appoint federal judges. We need to crush Trumpism.",

Are there no crimes he thinks should be criminalised or punished?? Abolish the Police movement was always clearly a wedge issue to cause conflict in the community. I thought that would be obvious to you guys who can see the Divide and Conquer strategy at play.\n\nIt speaks to a bigotry of low expectation, like even basic accountability... And the fact that Americans are seemingly unable to see any possible solutions to problems which uniquely effects America. In other countries it isn't the nom to expect that a person might be killed if you call the police on them. And no other countries have such glorification and proliferation of gun violence.",

We both want justice system reform because we know there's not only the American way of doing things. \n\nAnd most importantly to my point; just like journalists, even though we know they don't often hold the powerful to account, rather them lie for them like they often do, it's still a good aspiration for journalists to be that, because we know they can.\n\nWe should also have similar aspirations for a reformed justice system, rather than looking like we want lawlessness.",
