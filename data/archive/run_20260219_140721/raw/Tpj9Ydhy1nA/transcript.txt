MIT official request to join bricks this is what we've been saying should happen and probably will happen for a long time now great to see Cuba forging stronger ties with China and the multipolar world according to T Cuba has has formerly requested to join brics as a partner country in a letter addressed to Russian President Vladimir Putin they addressed it straight to Putin very interesting the request submitted by Carlos Pereira director general of Cuba's foreign Ministry General division of bilateral Affairs emphasizes bricks role as a key player in global politics and a Beacon of Hope for the global South Russian ambassador to Cuba Victor corinelli confirmed the application and stated that Cuba's leader Miguel Diaz canel has been invited to Bricks uh plus Outreach meeting at the upcoming Summit in Kazan Cuba has submitted an official request to join brics as a partner country in a letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin um basically re res say the same thing there but fantastic to see what Cuba needs is economic development they have been prevented from developing economically at every single turn by the US Empire so hopefully this will be a new era a new chapter in Cuba's history yeah um Cuba sent a delegation to last year's uh bricks Summit in joerg Johannesburg South Africa um and we knew it was coming for quite a while Cuba and Venezuela both applied to join uh bricks or we're going to apply to join Bricks now it's been made official in the case of Cuba and look Cuba is a country that is so small that the Strangling illegal criminal um blockade of the US is extremely efficient in in in doing what it sets out to do which is uh most principally um destroying the material conditions and and the economic stability of Cubans and making their economy scream as uh was said about Chile in the 70s um but but you know it's it's so small as well in terms of uh it's its geography that with the help of the bricks plus it could also develop quite rapidly and I think that um with bricks and with the new development bank and with all of the different projects that are uh either connected to Bricks or adjacent to it perhaps the belt and Road initiative including Cuba into these projects could mean that within 5 to 10 years we have a whole different Cuba uh 90 miles away from the shores of the United States now of course it has that predicament that it's in the fact that it is 90 miles away from the United States um and the US is of course going to consider any solidarity that Cuba shows with this upand cominging multi-polar world and it's the institutions that are the skeleton of this new multi-polar world it's going to consider it a threat um but bricks unlike uh NATO is a economic institution an economic body through and through it's not a military Alliance of any sort so I don't see why Cuba wouldn't be able to use bricks and the uh again adjacent institutions or institutions within bricks uh to develop um and I think it's up to uh the comrades in China uh who have a lot of uh you know uh influence in what goes on in terms of bricks to recommend Cuba's joining of bricks I think uh it's the least they can do from the standpoint of prol Aran solidarity and socialist solidarity and once within bricks to do all within their means to help Cuba not be in the state that it is in currently which is a very desperate one unlike anything I think we've seen even worse than the uh special period of the uh early 1990s following the overthrow of Soviet socialism so um this couldn't have came at a more necessary time but now uh you know it's up to China and Russia Russia has of course a lot of respect for Cuba and you know as as Danny's fond of saying you go to you go to any Cuban in Cuba and you say that uh you ask them what country do you love the most and they say honestly it's it's probably Russia besides Cuba because it's without Russia we wouldn't be able to survive um so it's up to China and Russia um and Brazil I think as well because uh president Lula has had a lot of very good relations with Cuba historically to push for Cuba to join and then to help it wants it's in to develop economically which it so it so desperately needs absolutely and I mean it's just so it's so difficult like what is Cuba to do if if they're not throwing some kind of Lifeline I mean the Soviet Union I hear someone saying here that they understand bricks but they wish the common turn would come back I mean definitely that's we all wish that would happened we all wish Stalin wouldn't have stopped um he would have gone all the way through West Europe and you know there we can look back and and say you know this should have happened and that should have happened but it is what it is we got to do what we got to do going forward and you know when as Carlos said during the special period when the Soviet Union was gone and no longer there to buy Cuba's sugar it was a really destitute time economically for them and and even since it's been really hard for them to develop and I mean if you think about it it's so much different on an island like even the dprk they're also being strangled by sanctions but at least they have China there um that that borders them that they can use as a trade partner Cuba's completely isolated and right what and Russia and Russia right and and Cuba is completely isolated and right under the nose of the US Empire which is why the US has put so much effort into destroying them and it's truly incredible and heroic uh if you think about it you know um all of the unique difficulties that Cuba has even compared to other socialist projects so it's fantastic to see China and and Bricks you know hopefully throwing them a like LIF line here and hopefully we will see the the development that Cuba needs and it'll be interesting to see how the US reacts to this because um h huie g was saying earlier that he thinks maybe the US is pressuring uh China not to allow Cuba in bricks and I wouldn't be surprised you know they that the blockade I've said this often times that we think of economic sanctions as like not real Warfare right that's economic Warfare but not real Warfare no it's it's an economic Siege you they've surround Cuba with their military the US has a massive massive military presence in the Caribbean and that's how the trade sanctions are enforced that's how the blockades enforced is at the barrel of a gun um so will they continue to you know try and stop any trade as Chinese ships are coming in there Russian ships um I don't know it'll be it'll be interesting I'm sure the US won't be happy about this is what I'm saying yeah and um you know you have those instances of straight piracy and old school blockades um and it also works in many other ways you know most of the world knows that it's or at least was it's rapidly changing but still a reality dependent on American capital for its survival and if one of uh company in in Switzerland or something wants to send money to Cuba it very quickly gets Frozen and and bounces back if it's in somehow uh in some form connected uh or owned by a company that is at least 10% uh located in the US so um you know it's it's a blockade that doesn't just prevent the trade of Cuba and the us but because of the US's standing as a global emonic power it prevents the whole world that is engaged in active trade with the US from Trading with Cuba it quite literally isolates Cuba to only being able to trade with those people who also exist outside of the sphere of influence of us imperialism and uh when the Soviet Union was at its height and had the common turn it it was able to flourish because a significant portion of humanity was outside of that sphere of influence um but because of the unique characteristics of China's development that hasn't necessarily been the reality uh with China's growth it hasn't meant more aid for for Cuba so I mean hopefully now that uh it's become evident that American imperialism is decaying and the whole world is dependent on China as the new epicenter of the world economy hopefully now China feels like has more freedom to break uh some of these uh Draconian uh blockade uh policies and actually trade with Cuba although you know I wouldn't hold my breath uh there's there's uh Cuban students that I have seen vlogging who go to China as University students and then when they try to take out like a basic credit card so they can have some local currency to buy uh stuff with um they get rejected by the Banks because the banks have American Investments connected to them so socialist China Cuban students studying in universities in China uh do not have the ability to take out bunny from many banks because of its connection to the whole Swift system and the American blockade so it's very sad if in the past China has shown an unwillingness to break the blockade to help uh Cuba uh if if now the US pressures it to not help Cuba we'll see um we'll see what uh turns out they should respond by nuking Columbia just go all out the Israel of Latin America colum is now semi semi based with Pro super pro Palestine said some absolutely ridiculous uh low IQ about Venezuela but it is what it is for Colombia I I guess it's a step forward yeah it's better than nothing G what the f nuk in Columbia I'm just kidding I just uh was saying China if China were to go the exact opposite direction of where they've been going with their foreign policy currently which is we're going to help you develop but we're not going to get directly involved in your politics help socialism that
