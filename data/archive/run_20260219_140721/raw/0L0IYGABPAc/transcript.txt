so over the weekend there was a battle between good old Irish Patriots and perverse communist scumbags antifa I say a battle more a small Skirmish this is a neutral podcast yeah everything I said there was objectively correct all right a computer would have come to the same conclusion uh sorry for the interruption I'm father Calvin Robinson and you can watch my Common Sense Crusade 3:00 p.m. on Thursdays only on lotus.com where you can sign up for as little as £5 per month de's fault but anyway there was a small Skirmish and uh an if I lost as you can imagine and something very interesting was discovered as loot after the battle uh loot in the bodies yes they kind of yes there weren't any fatalities but um uh the the antifa guys are kind of like um NPCs in video game you punch them and uh loot comes out and uh I'm not advocating punching anyone obviously did you find gold coins what do you find uh is definitely gold we'll we'll get to it um before we do though uh let's just turn back the clock about a couple of weeks because people have been protesting in kulok which is just North of Dublin while in the Dublin metro area um and thousands of people have been coming out as you can see to uh protest the housing of 500 Asylum Seekers in the area uh the mixed use accommodation is going to be quote for families oh yeah couples yeah single adult males that's more like it yeah and single adult females oh yeah many of them I've seen any of those no no there are very few of those actually wonder what the ratio is yeah the the ratio is going to be like 90% single adult males and then technically those other things uh and the Irish Department of integration said that full engagement will take place with Republican Community leaders seems to have gone well doesn't it get thousands of people out I don't say which Community leaders though to be fair good Point Community leaders that's a good point um and so the Irish came out and started protesting and weirdly they had the same concerns as people have everywhere uh one resident Eileen Farley presumably a Nazi uh said we have an area that's already high in crime and deprived of resources we don't want men roaming the streets with nothing to do this community is full of kids we have a lot of children here as a concerned parent and grandmother I don't want my kids around this area why is it always concerned for kids it's really weird isn't it when like you know we took Ukrainian immigrants no one was like well I'm really worried about my kids you know because they were like women and children from Ukraine no no one was in any way concerned about kids but as soon as you get a load of middle eastern African men single men being dumped there like I'm a bit worried about my kids just weird isn't it um didn't have this problem when the belgians came over either first world war yeah it's almost something like cultural or something I don't know yeah it's really weird I can't put my finger on it but um youed kind of think yeah if it was like 500 English refugees get settled in Dublin they're not going be like well I'm really worried about what they're going to do to the children of course you're not going to be worried about that um but uh but anyway they're going to be uh doing this and what I liked about this was the Aesthetics of it had young Lads on Horseback uh leading the that's quite sound isn't it which yeah it's very awesome I like that a lot um what a what a great uh what a great image to have uh again very peaky blinders very old world I just like it um but as they point out in this article the Republic of irand appears to be in a position a period of transition as over a third of the electorate now expressing expressing a wish to vote for an anti-immigration party and the ruling party which I'm reliably told isn't pronounced fine gaale but uh if you spell it that way that's how I'm going to pronounce it uh also appears to be entering crisis mode they had a third of the uh parliamentary top brass have resigned recently it's very interesting do you know anything more about this I don't understand Island because the the politics out there has gone crazy the the parties that I used to think were like like hardcore nationalistic like shin right I've gone all anti- Catholic anti- Island Pro LGBT Pro immigration I don't understand this weird Ireland is for everyone Sean Fain except for the Irish well the British I guess it's so strange are shin ft still racist against the British probably I think yeah everyone is well they can't be racist not allowed to be racist what the S&P are it's going to be the rainbow Island they party are yeah the SMP are just racist against the English that's acceptable though you know that exactly but uh but anyway so there was another protest this weekend and uh another horse this time in a carriage the kulok Cavalry is out today which is fantastic fantastic uh but again good turnout on the uh the protest they actually come out on the streets and protest this is the way to do it man yeah I mean stand up just to just to be fair the the English did do this uh then they got beaten up and told they were evil Nazis then we stand up again yeah yeah um and this time antifa were there they weren't there the first time oh no sensitive content let's see if we can see it uh because there we go just some boys uh they don't there's nothing too much going on just push him over rough him up a little bit you'll probably have to censor this for YouTube but um so who's roughing up who the the the local Lads are roughing up uh some Communists okay uh and one of them what really is interesting dropped an unlocked phone oh hello who's who's this chat who's this chat should we listen to this now there's a lot of talking that's going on from The Lads but if you try and listen to to the the chap on the video speaking and see what he has to say can't hear it at [Music] all that guy is giving instruction one particular thing he says is quote you need to um be present but be invisible H to the people there okay that's interesting who is this guy what his name well it turns out he a a News Talk journalist called Paul connley from News Talk FM is another video of him preparing uh the the flags they they've I know written whatever on these Flags uh but here's him in a hotel room with the protesters who appear to be the protesters uh sorting out their flags and he's there in videos giving them instruction on how things are uh which is so is this because he's supporting this or is he set is this a false flag is he setting up a fake protest uh well I don't know it seems that he's instructing the antifa guys on what they're supposed to do when they're at the protest mental yeah uh News Talk for anyone who doesn't know is uh an Irish um commercial radio station the only one in Ireland that takes on exclusively a news and current affairs based format they've got about 500,000 people a week listening they're creating the news apparently so uh what's interesting as well is that the the guy like this was the the background this the guy's background is of an Irish television presenter and radio host are they weaponizing their gay Fanboys what I mean I would this is weird this is strange with them very very weird isn't it m um so it's just very I mean like how incompetent do you have to be to drop a bloody unlocked phone at this but what a what a great thing to find now this is RTE um again what a bizarre bizarre thing what do you think the end game is there well um I think the end game is obviously to portray the normal Irish people who don't want their children molested as being Nazis uh oh look the far right oh look how violent the far right are oh look at this look at that look at the other uh as you say create the news turn them into uh figures of hate you know so so send a bunch of gay commies out to get beat up and then cover the news as look at the far right beating up right yeah um again there's uh there's more just again it's that guy he's actively helping them do all of this and so you've got uh people pointing out hang on a second what's going on here why are you operating to like literally undertaking some kind of operation to support the government policy in the face of what the public actually want in this you know this seems to be a strange sort of hidden hand operating behind it's not so hidden now because these morons dropped an unlocked phone but this is like the actual Hidden Hand of a an operation going on so you got this chat from the idish Freedom Party who uh didn't interiew with Paul connley um but now he says see he appears to knowingly cooperate with antia agitated agitators seeking to disrupt anti-mass immigration protests in kulok written to him inquiring why uh but he hasn't had anything back yet and again it seems like they're actively coordinating and so and this is not the only time as well apparently Virgin Media news was seen offering lifts back to Dublin for Asylum Seekers uh which is just pretty weird why is the media in Ireland getting so directly involved in all of this uh and so the burin did a bit of an investigation into this um One phone which seems to belong to one of the mainstream journalists would appear to show a concerning level of cooperation between various media sources NGO workers and prominent antifire activists in both Ireland and the UK so we've got the British hand puppeteering over it and but I'm sure if you kept investiga You' find the American hand above that um but they spoke to some sources uh and who they didn't disclose and they say our sources explain uh and this appears to be corroborated by messages on the phone that the antifog group had planned to oppose the protest in the city center but ultimately went to kulok because they thought there would only be women and children there easy targets yeah yeah if you're going to if you're going to make anyone feel afraid but I mean I guess they didn't expect the the kulok Cavalry to turn out um but the videos of the phones content are now circulating r on social media and appear to hold a vast quantity of Insider information now probably not going to be that much in Insider information because of course these are just the grunts on the botom of the hierarchy they're the only ones they're just going to be told what they need to be told but um but they published a followup to this as well um and so as they say further connections seem to be made by um media organizations in Ireland and the UK including State broadcasters such as RT in the BBC uh hardcore anti anist leftwing politicians Nos and Islamic cleric and leftwing politicians uh the information posted online appears to indicate that attending leftists and media were accompanied by Muslim and or Asian security from the UK stranger and stranger yeah um it's also allegedly discovered uh was the fact that the journalists have been closely colluding with antifire buying materials the flags and disguises so the journalists bought them the things that they had while they were there um and there was footage of one high-profile Irish media personality apparently helping to make banners which is Paul Conn um the leak also appears to show how journalist and Anar help strategize and how to confront the protesters which is the first video for the sound is off and Anar appeared to have been daring immigration anti-immigration access show up to confront them uh this is uh a very strange occurrence what do you make of all this K okay so this is kind of just proving what we've all guessed being the case and all of the anglosphere you've got the ground level let's take a drug analogy right y you've got dealers buyers the very ground level people doing the basics and this operation you've got people who live in the local area who have set up their own protest and the very ground level on the antia side you've got your gay Fanboys who you radicalized into being communist THS but of course for the rightwing side that's sort of where it ends there there's no further apparatus orchestrating that it's completely Grassroots but obviously for the gay Fanboys that's the lower level like a drug cartel and then above them you've got the people flying to make sure they got everything they need ideologically motivated Jos all of the anglosphere has this problem and they've got lots of money because it's well a cabal at this point the entire media is completely captured and then on top of them you've got some more people who have got wider interests British Muslims in Ireland orchestrating is happening well I don't know just to be clear I don't know they're orchestrating assisting is correct yeah but why would they have an interest why do they have an interest in the UK why do they have an interest in France who's paying I mean let's assume they don't have an interest in they just pay who's paying them well there's a huge problem in pretty much every part of the Middle East but now increasing in Europe sure of organizations that want to massively increase Muslim influence the world and well they've got plenty of O money to do it so why not y things like the Muslim Brotherhood for example I mean there's a mosque in jalta that cost5 million us I don't know if we went to see we saw it yeah we we didn't go in it but we saw that it was basically deserted nobody goes there but why was it built purely so the expans of Muslim influence and power right okay that's a form of s power so those guys I mean I'm not saying that definitely they from the Muslim Brotherhood or something like this but if they did have some kind of backers that are helping them orchestrate this that's the structure why do you set up so you gay Fanboys getting beaten up by local ads because then you don't have to accept that the reality is the vast majority of the Irish public ha you and what you're doing to the country you have to make it seem like there's some kind of opposition that's Grassroots that defends the state's position because there isn't one so you've got to make it but this is the state position that's the problem in Times Gone by the intelligence Services would have would have clamped down on this foreign interference but the foreign interference is aiding the state position and that's why they're not doing anything about it the people at the top of that power group friendship all in bed with each other I I used to go to protest in Le against drag queen story time there were just a few of us Turning Point guys a few Christians busloads of counter protests used to turn up with professional signs you know to a drag queen event with anti-racism signs and anti for this and that and the other like there's a coordination there all professionally printed and boarded you thinking where are these first of all where they from they're not lean residents but secondly who's funding all of this all these resources there's there's a system behind it I don't know what it is but I'm just saying it's it's very similar to what we're seeing here no no you you're you're quite correct on this I mean the standup to racism signs they're all exactly the same signs in every single protest and suddenly they just turn up with stacks of these signs who who paid for all of that the same human beings the one turning up as well yeah you remember when voice of Wales came in and there's this place in Welsh it's like clani or something like this and they decided they would come out and block the entrance to the hotel and it all became a bit of a a well Morel boosting EP episode because what happened is that they literally couldn't get migrants in so the whole thing disintegrated but a group of people from standard to racism turned up and when they showed me them I recognized them the same human beings that go to events in London they're the same human beings who go to Every Tommy Robinson event in like tord right okay so you this is their job the same humans the same 50 human beings turn up to all of these wherever in the country whenever they're activating I don't do that no very very few people would have even the time to do that they've got jobs you'd have to be paid job like Steve Ray you it's his job to be annoying outside of parliament yeah but the thing is how do we not know who's doing this yeah and secondly why are we not doing this well because we we we don't have mysterious funders that's why you need money and power to set up that kind of structure so the conservatives used to do it they got in trouble with battle bus I don't remember that where they had a national bus I was one of the campaigners used get we used to get on the bus we'd go somewhere like South thanet campaign we' all get off the bus and campaign they got in trouble because it was centralized funds that were orchestrating it rather than locally directed campaigns but it's possible for the right to do this soorry who did they get in trouble with uh the Electoral commission oh right okay yeah all right um yeah it would be nice if we had funding to do that because we we could definitely find the activists to do it do we have a rightwing George Soros no trust me we don't um it would be nice if we did and if there was some right-wing billionaire who was like yeah I would kind of like to do something I'm sure that there are lots of people out there who could do a lot of things but for what purpose because as I mentioned you need power and money so that several layers of control is needed for this to even be worth your time because of course you need the media to be completely captured and working with their gay Fanboys to set this up because the whole point of even doing any of this is to spin a story that there's strong opposition to the far right who are rising up and we need to clamp down on them yeah obvious inverse of reality what's happening as the locals just don't want to be you know displaced but you need that counter thing so then you can report on that counter thing that you've just set up but it's all Optics and we can do this ourselves so at those lean protest there' be a small group of us saying we don't want grown men dressed scantly clad as women reading to Children And Then There Be mass of the counter protesters saying trans lives matter stop genociding trans people so the Optics are well we're the biggest and they are on the right side whereas we know that people all across the country don't want drag queens reading to children so if we had bigger numbers if we had those bus loads of people we put it out on Lotus seaters we put out on social media people see that it's all about the Optics isn't it yeah we don't need Channel 4 or BBC we just don't have the funding to create the infrastructure to make this sort of thing happen whereas they do are you rich would you like to win
