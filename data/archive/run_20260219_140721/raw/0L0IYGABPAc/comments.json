Hence we had the protest - NF, skinheads etc \nWe did fight but democracy reined. The difference this time round is that these immigrants that are coming here now are ‘economic migrants’ and breaking the law coming here. Back then it was legal immigration and they were already British citizens. More were coming from other countries and the English made a stand. So you can’t compare the Irish with the English as it’s completely different demographics. \nEngland is a multicultural and diverse country way in advance than the Irish. Ireland has only had diversity since the late 1990’s -2000’s (Celtic tiger)",

Just Google where all our poloticians, including our so called socialist politicians went to school. Ill give you a hint, the schools weren't free. They paint normal people with reasonable concerns as racist. Why? Because the government pays landlords to take refugees as tennants tax free while Irish people on social assistance are left homeless. Who are the landlords? You guessed it, the D4 heads and politicians 🤷‍♀️ Don't get me started on the under funded public services that have to cope with the influx of people, they are on their knees. Who does it affect? Not the political or \"affluent class\" just the ordinary Irish person working to keep a roof over their heads, hoping they don't need any assistance from the government. They don't care about the refugees or the Irish, they're just lining their pockets, as usual.",

I can’t even fathom the thought process behind “let’s let a bunch of people who won’t work into our welfare state and pay for them indefinitely”.

        "text": "@g-watson6213very true man! I’m American from Connecticut and you are so true. All our leaders of all nations are compromised and useful tools for the globalist/banking cabal. All of the wars going on are going exactly to plan. America is now being revealed as the next bad guy, the next Nazi Regime that must fall to usher in a new society… \n\nWorking overtime right now. \n\nI wish everyone in whatever country they are from, success and peace. It’s all going to collapse before we find peace however. \n\nImmigrants are not the cause, but they met for sure are tools used to usher in chaos and division. \n\nIt sucks, you can’t be mean and be anti immigrant, because it truly is unfounded, yet you can’t be pro immigrant because the issues presenting are too much to ignore at the same time… \n\nCurrently here in America we are flying and busing in THIUSANDS of immigrants a day, no background checks, we are giving them hotel rooms in NYC and 1k universal basic income  month of hike Americans starve and become homeless and lose their jobs and can’t afford medical procedure…. \n\nSoon the immigrant class will be shifted to the new citizens and they will already have been enslaved with UBI, brain chips, social credit systems, they will live in cubicals and relationships/birth will be illegal. \n\nThe elites are abusing these immigrants and trapping them to become the next slave labor force. Total control. \n\nThe citizens of these countries who still believe in the law and society of old will become extinct and our memories and history with us. \n\nWar fare will spread to world war once again and mass migrations and destruction are upon us. \n\nThe immigrants ARE our competition don’t get me wrong, but they aren’t the cause nor our real threat or enemy. They are (or are about to be) even worse victims than we are….. total human slavery is coming….. total mind control. \n\nThese people, they aren’t presidents or parliament or congress… those politicians are ONLY mouth pieces and money bags for larger corporations, ancient royal families, and those currently in charge of the central banking system which will pass on to their heirs. \n\nEver read 1984? What about played the fallout games? I just watched the new fallout TV season and it’s a very likely scenario of what is truly happening. \n\nWW2 all over again. \n\nAll the “bad guys” are just puppets, all the “good guys” are just useful idiots and puppets themselves. \n\nI would say re-study WW2 with the mindset that every faction (allies, Comintern, central powers) were ALL just as evil as eachother, AND just as righteous and noble as eachother. \n\nTry and view the Nazis as the “good” guys and vice versa. Then look at them as the “bad guys” again. Do it with the soviets, do it with all the allies. \n\nRead about the economic and social situations during that time and how they shaped the coming war and how they changed and dug in during the war. Read about how Europe was re-built and politically administered after WW2 by the “liberating” allies. \n\nThe truth of the matter is there is a ROT. A SICKNESS with total and absolute power and control (and the most advanced technology and most access to resources and most importantly…. NARRATIVE) trickling down through the pyramid scheme…. \n\nInstead we humans fight brother against brother without looking behind the curtain. \n\nDivision is the best tool used by the globalist elite to divide and destroy the human spirit. \n\n\nAfter all it’s not really about being in control or having the most or whatever, what it’s truly about is mortal humans infected with sin and evil due to the material and fiat systems we have worshipped for thousands and thousands of years. \n\nWe have no choice but to sin in order to survive in the hell that is modern society. \n\nI’m not particularly religious, however when the Christian’s explain that EARTH is SATANS realm, everything seems to make much more sense. \n\nLife is all about struggle. Well, really it’s about overcoming struggle/hardship. Life is about being presented with two paths, and staying on the righteous and orderly path. You may explore chaos in order to understand it and protect yourself…. But you cannot get lost in the chaos. Nor can you live solely in order. That is extremely oppressive and limiting. \n\nThe elites use cycles of order and chaos to steer the human civilization and future and society at the given time. Which ever suits them better for the moment, chaos or order. And they do not allow the balancing of chaos and order to be maintained…. \n\nOur enemies are those that control the access and direction of whichever world reserve currency is deemed “most valuable” \n\nAnd don’t belive for a second that the elite want to avoid nuclear war…. They have built bunkers and spaceships and have prepared for that exact scenario (and many more) for hundreds of years now. \n\nThese ruling shadow elite people have WET DREAMS of the world totally collapsing, and them emerging from the dust long after with their stored wealth and resources and re-starting/re-seeding the human race to mold society as THEIR VERY OWN god experiment.  \n\nThey would prefer a nuclear event, it would take out alot of their competition too. Only the deepest bunkers or best spaceships have a chance at surviving and these people GET HARD imaging that scenario…. \n\nThey will do anything and everything they can and make it look like it’s your fault, or natures fault. With technology and new holograms they may be able to convince most of us that it’s GODS fault or something (the coming world wide chaos) \n\nWe are just in another cycle of destruction/rebuilding…… \nAt the whim of whoever has the most influence in all the other evil controlling people/groups. \n\nDon’t forget, they in-fight constantly. Us human race/civilization can use that to our advantage and posture ourselves in a more favorable position for when the chaos starts to die down and shift in to total order.",

But, the old problem of \"where do we start?\" applies. I fantasise about beginning a march, crying out the call as we pass through each town, heading for London... It's absurd but so often my mind turns to these fantasies in the small  hours. Still I long for it, for that reckoning, everyday... but in the cold light of day, rule is so deeply dug in, so expansive, so all encompassing, and it has been for so long that it's very hard to hold onto any real sense of agency to effect change there beyond those daydreams that wander into the fantastical, which is their winning card, obviously, yet so effective. Still, how I long to heft my axe, it stares back at me, where it hangs above my door, waiting for the day. 🐉",

Probably due to many thousands of years of fending off various invaders, the Irish have it in their DNA to be more territorial and protective of their heritage, culture and indigenous people. Bear in mind that the Irish originally descend from a warrior tribe (the Tuatha De Danann, who were *real* and not mythological, like they try to bullsh*t us with), which was where all the Irish clans, Kings of Ireland and Gaelic/Irish surnames came from. Also, most Irish people have basically bred within their own communities for centuries. Take my father, for example, whose ancestral DNA analysis has deemed him to be 99 per cent genetically Irish (and he is Irish, born and bred). 😄That says it all.",

I lived in France for a while and found myself coming home to England and seeing a warrior people here, at least in comparison to those I had just left... and something occurred to me there, it is a bit of a stereotype but anger is expressed more readily over there, and yet, very rarely seemingly do they actually go at it. ...A few pints and we're swinging. ...And we have this obsession with politeness, which is quite unusually prominent. \n\nPoint being, I think we're so polite BECAUSE we are aware that there is warrior blood about us and all it takes is a slight nudge and all hell could break loose to see our please and thank you's replaced with battle cries... Now I might be wrong, but that is my sense of people here.

That being said it’s only really women that steal, women in general are more likely to be kleptomaniacs; Roma people generally turned to crime because it was hard to break into society and make money mainly due to generalisations. Which is ironic because certain other demographics that are statistically far worse are protected, celebrated and even given money for free. Most Roma people work harder than the average British person, they just don’t have access to any of the privileges of other ethnic groups because we are essentially white so it’s socially acceptable to actually be racist towards us. Tinkers do steal a lot though yea I’ll agree with you",
