how many times have You' been watching a true crime documentary and learned that the police allowed someone to continuously abuse their victim or repeatedly ignored the pleas of a victim before the person finally kills their victim too many when I graduated law school and became a public defender the question I was often asked was a question I know every defense attorney everywhere has been asked a thousand times and that's how do you sleep at night and as an abolitionist or someone who just generally opposes the prisons and policing the question you're most often asked is if we abolish police and or prisons what do we do with rapists and murderers neither of those questions evoke the internal dilemma that people asking them assume they do they're actually some of the first questions we ask and answer for ourselves to lay the foundation for what we believe the first question how do you sleep at night with my phone on sleep mode and the cat suffocating me the question implies that one's conscience would keep them up at night knowing they represent guilty people which would necessitate that I believe that what I'm doing is wrong and that people who are charged with crimes are guilty and thus deserving of the criminal system I'm wrongly helping them navigate but I don't believe that in the 1963 case Gideon versus Wayne Wright the Supreme Court determined that people have a right to legal representation in criminal proceedings against them and must be provide an attorney if they can't afford it thus establishing your right to a public defender I don't just believe that you have a right to representation but I believe that you have the right to the best representation possible further I believe that the system itself is designed to put the most in intentionally disadvantage populations on trial for the ways the system intended and expected that they would respond to the circumstances the government has left them in which is precisely why the vast majority of people in our criminal system are represented by public defenders and public defenders only represent people living well beneath the poverty line and the government then makes billions and billions of dollars via fines and fees they charge those poor people in their families with and make through their unpaid labor so again how do I sleep sleep mode second question if we abolish prison what do we do about rapists and murderers first that question implies that either the intention or the result of Prisons is to deal with rapist and murderers neither is true the police routinely choose to ignore cases of sexual violence domestic violence and murder when the victims are women or children or boys and they tell the public that they weren't able to make an arrest for one dishonest reason or another time and time again police have had far more than everything they've needed to make an arrest and simply chose not to how many times have you been watching a true crime documentary and learned that the police allowed someone to continuously abuse their victim or repeatedly ignored the pleas of a victim before the person finally kills their victim too many but instead of the True Crime documentary highlighting how the police willfully failed to prevent the very kinds of horrible crimes they Bamboozled the public into believing they're there to protect them from and that the dangerous criminal the police simply ignored was just some especially Advanced criminal who couldn't be stopped my mind goes to Rodney alala AKA The Dating Game Killer who was the subject of the Netflix movie woman of the hour starring Anna Kendrick the Netflix movie tells an incredibly truncated version of the horrific and prolific murdering spree of Rodney alala who is suspected of having killed more than a hundred women men and children for at least a decade the Netflix movie chooses to Center itself around a woman Rodney alala met when he appeared on a dating show for one episode in the midst of his Killing Spree the woman was played by Anna Kendrick and the movie treats her as a protagonist although in real life she and the dating show could not be less relevant to the horror story that was this Insidious evil man's narrative because although aala did win the dating show the woman played by Anna Kendrick told the studio that he seemed weird and she never actually went out with him or saw him again what the movie does do better than most True Crimes though is it attempted to highlight that the police fail to act in the movie A friend of one of alcala's victims tells us that she had gone to the police to report alala and she's shown both being ignored by the police and being ignored by The Dating Game Studio when she tried to make the dating game Studio aware that was dangerous and while I credit the movie with at least bothering to shine a little light on the negligence of the police in real life the truth was so so much worse there were so many horrific crimes the police willfully allowed alala to commit Andor get away with they had opportunity after opportunity to stop him knowing he was a rapist an abuser a child molester would you even believe me if I told you that in 1968 the police knew Alcala had literally lured an 8-year-old girl into his apartment brutally raped and beat her with a steel bar and left her in a pool of her own blood and she ended up spending 32 days in a coma police knew what happened because a man who' witness Al Calla luring the little girl into his apartment called the police so that's how the police were able to arrive and find the little girl in her pool of blood but somehow he managed to flee and then the police made no effort to pursue his arrest warrant allowing him to get all the way to New York City where he continued killing people in fact in 1977 after already having been arrested rearrested and convicted for sexually assaulting another 13-year-old girl and becoming a registered sex offender his parole officer just let him fly from LA to New York City where he immediately murdered several other women this went on repeatedly where police knew exactly what danger he posed and had every opportunity to protect the public but just shrug their shoulders but speaking of having the opportunity to protect yourself today's sponsor is Aura if you haven't been taking precautions with your

Aura now back to the video and it doesn't even have to be a scenario as dangerous or rare as The Dating Game Killer or serial killer the police fail to protect people from far less Insidious figures every day do remember Gabby Patito the 22-year-old woman who was killed by her fiance Brian laundry in 2021 probably but do you also remember that he had assaulted Gabby the night before he killed her and police responded to the scene and simply chose not to help her or to investigate and police don't even just fail to investigate or make arrests in case of abuse sometimes they become the abusers in 2020 a 14-year-old girl was raped by a 17-year-old and already traumatized this young girl didn't even want to report it she just wanted it to be over with but her mom called the police and officer Rodney vicnaire showed up he stood in this mother and young girl's living room and convinced them she needed to report it he said to the little girl if I'm a young man that has done something wrong to a young lady and she doesn't follow up and press the issue then I'm going to go out and do it to another young lady and it's going to be worse maybe the next time because I'm going to think in my head oh I got the power I can go further this time end quote so the little girl agreed to make the report and go with him he then proceeded to rape and groom that little girl for months I don't really need to drive home what kind of monster does this what I do need to drive home is just how common this is quote a Washington Post investigation has found that over the past two decades hundreds of police officers are prayed on children while agencies across the country have failed to take steps to prevent these crimes at least 1,800 state and local police officers were charged with crimes involving child sexual abuse from 2005 through to 2022 the postf found abusive officers were rarely related to the children they were accused of raping fondling and exploiting they most frequently targeted girls who were 13 to 15 years old and regularly met their victims through their jobs whenever you talk about abolition which is in and of itself a vision for the future but when you talk about abolishing police in prisons people always reply what about rape what do we do about the rapists and I'm always trying to explain to people that the criminal system we have is not about addressing rape Not only would most victims of rape and sexual assault be the first ones to tell you that they got everything but compassion and Justice when they tried to report what happened to them but the perpetrators are often the police themselves I say all that to say I think a better question I think people could ask defense attorneys and abolitionist types like myself if you really want to tussle and see a difference of opinion and it's the question I'm actually going to be exploring today because I think a lot of people and abolitionist actually do struggle with this and that's what do we do about killer cops or put simpler can people who believe prison should be abolished demand that police who commit police brutality and kill people be criminally charged and sent to the very prisons we want abolished my short answer is yes but I believe that the fruitlessness of that endeavor is precisely why we should be abolitionists allow me to talk your air off for a little while so that hopefully by the time I'm done that answer makes sense to you reasonable Minds can disagree though my guy Alex Vitali author of end of policing and who I consider an authority on abolition haven't seen exactly eye to eye on this topic although I do not disagree with him at all if you ask Alex this question he would probably say something along the lines of no you either can't be an abolitionist and call for the charging of killer cops or that you at least shouldn't be an abolitionist calling for the charging of killer cops because in one way or another you're enforcing and legitimizing the Very system you want abolished and you're playing into this idea that what Justice is is criminal charges and convictions and that underlying rationale enables the prison industrial complex to keep expanding and he is not wrong that is sound and I pretty much agree I just have a little bit more to say on it I believe that as an abolitionist you can one enjoy seeing killer cops prosecuted two join in on the people's protests or demands that killer cops be charged three draw attention to how infrequently killer cops are prosecuted by the criminal system or for which killer cops felt the weight of the criminal system they weaponize against people every day so long as you recognize and explicitly make clear in your advocacy that Prosecuting killer cops is not Justice that it does not do [ __ ] to save any lives to stop police brutality to root out injust Justice or to reform the criminal system in any way it does nothing to change the circumstances that led to the particular police killing or to prevent another one from happening again at most it allows people and communities who are grieving who live under the weight of the criminal system's cruelty to see the people who usually enact that cruelty get a little bit of their comeuppence once in a while and for black people living in a nation where police disproportionately brutalize our communities for Generations I cannot scold black people or anyone really abolitionists are not for wanting to see the system that oppresses them that very much so still exists just once in a while get the oppressors themselves for me I highlight when police kill people and I highlight when they haven't been charged and when they're charged but not convicted I don't highlight that because I believe Justice is charging or convicting killer cops I don't highlight that because I want it to happen I highlight that because it's proof of precisely why this system should be abolished because it functions to protect white supremacy the mere fact alone that police murder people daily but are seldom ever punished at work let alone by the legal system is it self-evidence of why we shouldn't trust in this system or expected to protect us so for me I point out that killer cops rarely get charged not because I think they should or shouldn't get away with murder but because I'm trying to help everyone else see that regardless of what you want the system is designed for police to get away with murder and general brutality because it's a system that enables it to happen in the first place it doesn't only Empower them to do it but it's what it expects to happen the violence is routine it's a part of the job it's how they control and beat specific populations into submission you wouldn't know it if you checked the news or the trending topics on your social media timelines but the police have killed 1,145 people so far this year that we know of I don't think this will come as a surprise to anyone but the media lies to us but more than that the media shapes what we think and how we see the world around us media does that through the stories they choose to cover how they choose to cover those stories what they fail to cover all together what they under report and what they over report the media sensationalizes crime by over reporting much rarer occurrences of violent crime and overreporting things like retail theft and outright manufacturing crime waves even when crime is at an all-time low but you probably knew all that I think most people are aware of how the media and social media alike can over represent some things as opposed to others but I'm betting that there was a significant amount of people who would disagree with me if I said said you know what the media does in fact under report police killing people and I want to intentionally distinguish between police brutality and police killing because it's important that we understand that it does not have to rise to the level of murder to be police brutality abuse or criminal conduct on behalf of the police murder is a form if not the height of police brutality but it's not the only thing that qualifies as police brutality because media has shaped our understanding of police brutality the everyday violence of police on our streets and within our criminal system doesn't get treated as though it's police brutality and I say within our criminal system because the abuse of incarcerated people has been completely left out of the police brutality narrative all together as so many people see the abuse of incarcerated people as permissible as an acceptable function and consequence of ending up in the system which is why people die in jails all around the country every day and the media doesn't even bother to report their names and no one makes them places like the New York State Department of Corrections have gone a step further and straight up will not tell the public about the deaths happening behind bars anymore altogether and they're able to do that through no true push back or mass outrage we've become so accustomed to media and entertainment that casually displays police routinely being aggressive and assaulting people during the course of arrests or interrogations without scrutiny that we often don't process that kind of behavior as improper or illegal or even brutality because we see it as acceptable policing which in and of itself demonstrates how inextricable brutality is from policing I know that the American public mostly the non-black American public right and the left believes that police brutality is covered at nauseum because whenever the media does cherry pick a single murder the police committed like was the case with George Floyd in 2020 the left complains about Ally fatigue and the right launches campaigns to end the woke mind virus by Banning books taking history out of the schools defunding education and ending affirmative action but despite how much either group may think they're being beat over the head with coverage about police killings there maybe being politely tapped on the back of their shoulder once in a while with the occasional chalkline reminder that no matter how modern and Progressive our world can look if you're busy staring at the Obamas and other examples of black Excellence people are being murdered by the police quite literally every single day in this country for every George Floyd or ban Taylor that you hear about there's a drean reed and a djon ky and a Dan Ro Henry you didn't we are 11 months into 2024 and the police have killed at least 1,14 people this year but how many of those cases have you heard about how many I don't wager very many my heart breaks for Sonia Massie the 36-year-old black woman who was killed this year because she called 911 for help only for Illinois police to arrive and shoot her to death in her own home my heart breaks for 43-year-old Kevin Durham who was in his home with his 15-year-old daughter in Vegas just nights ago when Intruders broke him with a gun Kevin tried to wrestle The Intruders off he tried to protect his daughter and he called the police for help only for the police to arrive and instead of stopping The Intruders the police shot Kevin to death in his own home they shot him five times last year police killed at least 1,243 people and that's just actually who they admit to killing cuz there's no telling how many they're not admitting to because understand that the police don't just defend themselves against the murders we watch them commit on video they cover murders up too in 2019 Louisiana police told Ronald Green's family that he died in a car accident immediately after hitting a tree it was more than 2 years later when the family obtained body camera footage revealing the police kicked dragged and tased him to death just last year bston Wade spent 172 days searching for her son Dexter Wade she reported him missing to the police and they told her that they could not find him whole time they had known that on March 5th 2023 less than an hour after Dexter left his mother's home a Jackson police officer hit him with his car and killed him as he walked across the road the police knew his name they knew his mother's name they knew she was looking for him but they told her nothing and allowed her son's body to sit in a county morg unclaimed until he was buried in an unmarked grave in a penal Farm what I'm trying to drive home is that there are only 365 days in a year and the lion ass police still admit to more killings than there our days every year every year and it's worth mentioning that of the 1,243 people that that police admit to killing in 2023 27% of them were black despite the fact that black people only make up 133% of the population but this conversation isn't even about the fact that police disproportionately kill black people it's bigger than that I'm sure you've heard someone say they don't want to become just another hashtag but the real [ __ ] up reality is that most people The Police Murder don't even get that much we only hear about police brutality if people are able to force it into the discourse and public outrage demands the police be charged and that's what I really want to talk about today 98.1% of police are not charged for the killings they commit and of the few that are only a third are convicted but I'm sure you didn't need the statistics to know that how many times have you seen that a prosecutor declined to charge officers who killed someone how many times have you seen grand juries choose not to indict or for the only consequence an officer who killed someone to experience is paid administrative leave and the issue on top of another issue is not only is it incredibly rare for killer cops to be charged or convicted the few times they are the media and the government try to convince the public that this is Justice and proof that the system is changing somehow when that could not be further from the truth my mind goes to the murder of George Floyd and the way this nation was plated by the conviction of Derek chovin the officer who snuffed his life out after kneeling on his neck and ignoring his pleas I remember people rejoicing when he was convicted either pretending or truly wanting to believe that this conviction the protest they witness that summer meant anything other than one officer was being discarded in order to protect the entire institution the whole purpose of cherry-picking and choosing some killer cops to punish once in a blue moon for things the entire institution of police do regularly is to further entrench this idea in people's minds that policing is not the problem just these specific police officers were the problem and all that needs to be done to correct the problem is to get rid of them the sacrificial lamb so to speak which is part of the reason why I don't think police and other agents of white supremacy should be the primary beneficiaries of our advocacy as abolitionists and why grieving communities calling for the prosecution of killer cops did not hurt our efforts as abolitionists because not only is our advocacy as abolitionists much better served anywhere else than in service of our oppressors the system will rarely prosecute killer cops regardless of the ones of the communities they've harmed and those that are prosecuted were not prosecuted because we wanted them prosecuted uted they were accounted for by the system that always planned to sacrifice a few to appease us the rare and deliberate prosecution of a handful of killer cops is not what's upholding our criminal system or preventing it from being abolished there are far bigger fish to fry but more than that who am I to tell black mothers grieving their children who've been murdered by the police that in the current world where the criminal system still exists and punishes them daily and harshly that they should not call for the police to be punished as they would have been had they done the same am I to tell grieving family they're legitimizing and enabling the prison industrial complex I don't think it's necessary we do that the system will ignore the many killer police and sacrifice a few regardless and that's what Derek chovin was just like it's with the five black officers who beat Tyrie Nichols to death were because at the exact moment the nation celebrated Derek chovin conviction and the LIE of a new America over in Columbus Ohio police officer Nicholas Ren was shooting a 16-year-old black girl to death her name was micaa Bryant and she was in foster care micaa was being attacked by two adult women and she was holding a knife to defend herself from these two adult women attacking her and the police the one so many believe protect and serve arrived on the scene and instead of helping that child he shot her four times and killed her and on March 11th 2022 a grand jury declined to charge that officer because one conviction means nothing it changes nothing and it does not save a single life so while I will never judge or oppose the people who seek charges for killer cops I want us to focus Less on how we respond to killer cops and focus more on what we can do to prevent them from killing people which will require us to tackle over policing starting with removing police from things they absolutely do not need to be handling like mental health crises traffic offenses schools abolition is a vision of the future a world where we've invested in people and communities and rid ourselves of the conditions that create crimes and and thus have done away with the need for prisons and policing but we know that prisons and police will not be abolished overnight so while it's here in spite of all our wishing and resistance in my mind I don't think there's any material reason why on the rare occasion the system intentionally chooses to sacrifice individual killer cops for the sole purpose of protecting the system at large an abolitionist a human being with emotion like everyone else someone a part of a community they're fighting with and for isn't allowed to rejoice in that with the rest of the community if they so choose or to Simply support their community in that Pursuit because it's how that Community is choosing to cope to grieve so long as they're clear about what those charges or convictions mean in the grand scheme of dismantling the system and saving future lives which isn't very much I oppose the criminal system precisely because it protects and upholds white supremacy so there's no reason why being an abolitionist would require me to oppose the rare instances when white supremacist who enforce and weaponize that criminal system are sacrificed by that system you can be an abolitionist and simply not give a [ __ ] what happens to killer cops [Music]
