    "text": "Interesting. Counterpoint, Blacks have been constantly utilized by the Pinkertons and Capitalists as both strike-breakers and scab labor to undermine the collective bargaining of the White Working Class. They were able to be utilized in such a fashion because, the reality is, they are not of the nation and frankly are forced into these roles as a means of protection within a nation they are very much alien to. This goes on well into today with the Democratic Party, the Arch Containment Organization of the bourgeoisie, utilizing Patronage networks with certain class traitors within Black Communities as a means of power accumulation. W.E.B. Du Bois *is* a comrade and his analysis is sincerely profound and worthy of any serious socialist to consider. However, the assessment that America is a Black Nation is nakedly false just as it’s not an Italian, Irish, Chinese, or Ulster Scot nation due to the deprivation and struggle of the underclasses of those communities. It is clear, at least to me, that W.E.B. Du Bois had come to understand this himself which is why he opted to emigrate to an actual Black Nation, that being Ghana wherein he resided until his death. I appreciate your content and I do think you’re sincere in your Marxist Analysis, however I must maintain that this take is flawed and reeks of Black Nationalism which is inherently as Marxist as White Nationalism. That being not at all.",
