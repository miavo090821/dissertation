    "text": "Thank you for this discussion.  You make great points.  I would like to focus more specifically on the hurdles at hand.  The biggest western problem right now for leftism is that the liberals have co-opted the left.  Even the neo liberals have done this.  Left has been redefined as standing for the erasing of the existence of women, the promotion of as many abortions as possible, the pitting of girls against biological boys in sports, dispensing irreversible medical treatment to children without their parent's knowledge or oversight, the bypassing of adult individual's medical bodily autonomy, the promotion of censorship, using corporations to stifle discussion and free speech, and derailing democracy in order to win elections.  If you look at ALL the communist and socialist countries, they are strong family values societies.  China is no friend of the queer community.  Cuba outlawed homosexuality.  I'm NOT saying it is good, but you get my point.  The hysterical cringe liberals and the corporate capitalists are in bed together, but the only ones getting screwed is the real left and the working class.  The CIA has been using USAID to promote the queer agenda in foreign countries AS A TOOL OF REGIME CHANGE.  Pride parades are funded by capitalist billionaires and corporations like Lockheed Martin.  At some point, the real left needs to have a reckoning with the liberals.",
