    "text": "I had a friend back in the day who got pregnant and her boyfriend put her through a month of hell. Told everyone she was trying to trap him, probably not his, the usual. After one particularly bad fight, she decided to abort. He was MIA during this time (rumoured to be dating someone new) which was fine with her. Fast forward to after the abortion, word reached him and this fool went ballistic! All of a sudden Mr. MIA had to see her NOW! We, her friends, took turns housing her till she could make the trip to her grandmother's. He was supposed to be so upset that he got drunk and hit someone's car. She moved on but years later, his flip/flop mindset on her pregnancy only makes sense in that HE didn't want to be a parent but he definately wanted HER to be one.",

        "text": "@charlieb1976It is ETERNALLY annoying, af. For anyone who wants to talk about friggin’ birth control…understand this…they made a birth control pill for men during the pandemic…and WHY might you ask did it never go to market? It gave the men headaches….\n\nYup….that’s it. Cardi may have some kids and a baby daddy (because you CANNOT turn a 304 into husband….no matter how big that wedding is. These knee-grows have a whole team roster of baby-mamas…\n\nBirth control can be very dangerous for women. It gives us cancer, I have seen women’s HAIR FALL OUT….my birth control made me INSANELY DEPRESSED, and my mother (a sonographer for 30 years plus) was NOT a proponent of birth control pills, shots, all of that. I ended up having fibroids from the age of 24…all the way into my 40’s…and it made my life HELLL…3 surgeries….one that almost killed me because Black women are NOT safe in hospitals! \n\nBut I never became a “baby mama”, right? So nobody can talk shit? I can’t stand this conversation. Why is all of the birth control responsibility on us, when all of that stuff is bad for our bodies? A man who KNOWS that he is a 304 should get a damn vasectomy like a grown up. Dudes and their 🥚🍆🥚  are a menace. If Cardi wasn’t famous, she would be stuck with that idiot, and I am pretty sure he would be a thousand times worse. Offset was out there spreading diseases, and coming home to his pregnant wife with a dirty 🍆….so even if she stayed her ass home, her v-jay would still think she was in them streets….because Offset is a medical hazard. Societies where women are SAFE are the most successful. Why people want to keep blaming women….is beyond me. Cognitive dissonance at its best.",

Even though men could easily prevent themselves from concieving children as well, those options are barely something men talk about or even consider. Reminiscent of how girls are taught from a young age to shoulder the responsibility of boys actions as early as dress codes in grade school instead of the boys being told to just not be little creeps.

If it was, women would be more quiet about the whole thing, and some actually try to keep things hush hush, some of them don’t. A lot of the time the hate is directed at the man at first. Like in Halle’s case folks started with dragging DVD. They start by dragging Offset. But then, these women then feel the need to defend these men and defend their relationship. A lot of these women think their man getting dragged for filth is a reflection on them. Like I’ve seen this happen so many times. People will call that man everything but a child of god and go on an on about how they deserve better and they are a great person. Everything wrong with the relationship is his fault. Then homegirl will start playing defense on his behalf.",
