        "text": "​@lemsip207 \n\"It's only children with a sibling or cousin of the opposite sex who play with toys marketed to children of the opposite sex.\"\nThat's just plainly wrong. I was an only child and I loved playing with Barbie dolls. My parents tried to dissuade me - but that's only because they knew other people would laugh at me(which they did and I didn't care). I also loved playing with toy guns(right up until they were banned) and army men(my favorite \"toy\" ever is a box of extra-small army men I got as a gift).\n\nI don't think \"gender expression\" is \"forced\" on children. I think people generally raise their children according to what they think would be best for them, and their sex obviously matters in that. Boys and girls are different, what they're suited to is different and how they'll be treated is different - so it makes sense to prepare them for all that.\nIn the same way, how people raise their kids is a direct reaction to how they were raised and what sit as \"right\" to them - so these traditional roles self-perpetuate.\n\nAs to the rest of it, there's a lot of childless weirdos going around designing marketing and programs for children having no idea what the fuck they're doing.\nThe latest rash of children's movies is a perfect example of this, there's a reason why they compare so terribly to movies from when we were growing up despite those often containing far more adult subtexts and \"easter eggs\"(remember the entire category of content \"for the dads\").\n\nThe fact is most people, and as a matter of absolute certainty, all children _have none of this anywhere in their minds_ until someone makes it a point to repeatedly expose to and attempt to indoctrinate them either way. This goes for loopy lefties and it goes for the kinds of people who go around saying women should wear bath-towels on their heads and men need to go and die for Allah - and both groups are exclusively motivated by the profits of those who organize this kind of mental illness.\n\nLastly, as to the \"changing of gender expression from culture to culture\" it is far less significant than you'd think. Most cultures share the majority of their concepts in term of basic gender roles and the core of the rest of \"gender expression\". Particular details change, obviously, but the core is relatively consistent. Where we do see substantial differentiation is according to material and political conditions - cultures which are wealthier and freer are less strict on these matters and more fluid when market demands need to be met.\nConversely cultures which are poorer and more tyrannical are both stricter and less adaptable to meet material realities.\n\nAnd this applies to all areas of society, not just the place of men and women.\n\nP.S.: As to retail, this \"thinking\" changed when people realized that customers were more likely to suffer higher prices _and_ be more tolerant when buying from a woman.\nIt's a matter of extensive documentation by now that people are both more amicable and trusting of women, conversely more respectful and deferential to men. This is why so many stores have men roaming the isles guiding and informing customers while women are there at the registers to take their money.\n\nFrom my work experience in the service industry, all of our female waiters always got bigger tips and were far more likely to be forgiven when they messed up - and the prettier and/or nicer they were the more this scaled. Conversely the male staff rarely saw tips but also rarely saw uppity customers and arguing - to the point that when we didn't have a male waiter on shift one of the bartenders would fill-in for problem tables. Tables would calm down the moment their waiter got switched to a guy, but also tips would dry up as well.",

        "text": "@The_Crimson_Fucker The designers of toys are usually childless because they are young and haven't had children yet because the design world prefers to employ people straight from art college and then get rid of them or put them in a different job when they get to 35.  I'm sure some on the design team have children.  Besides let the children have a say in the design of the toys.  Invite them to a meeting where they choose colours and prototype designs and play with the toys.  Young adults have only come out of childhood themselves in recent years so have a better idea of what children like and dislike.\n\nHaving children of your own doesn't help you to understand children.  Growing up the only relatives and friends of parents who spoke to me like an intelligent person and saw me as an individual were childless.  Because they weren't consumed with worries and cares about caring for their own children only caring for elderly parents and their careers.  They were encountering children with a fresh mind and not prejudices so were open and inquiring.  They didn't have children to unfavourably compare me with as parents often do.  My paternal grandfather would assume I liked the same foods, drinks and activities as my cousins, his other grandchildren, forgetting I was an individual.  It was because he saw more of them as they lived closer.  My paternal grandmother would ignore us and use her grandchildren to play one daughter in law off with the other, my mother and aunt by marriage.  I was only aware of that when my mother told me what was happening when I was in my teens.  On the other hand a single and childless great aunt asked me straight, when I was about ten, what I was hoping to do when I left school.  She didn't assume I wanted to be a nurse or told me what I should be doing on leaving school like the other relatives who had had children.\n\nParents often see other people's children through the eyes of their own children not as they are.  They judge other people's children by the standards their own children seem to set.  If their own children are studious they see other people's children who are less studious as lazy or rambuctious.  If their own children aren't studious and prefer to play, they see other people's children who are more studious and are bookworms as oppressed, lonely and/or lacking in social skills so they turn to books.  A minority of parents do admire traits in other people's children that their own children don't have but they are the exception to the rule.",

There have always been male and female impersonators in the entertainment world.  It's only been recently they have claimed they are transgender or gender non binary.  There have always been gay and Lesbian relationships with someone taking on the masculine or butch role and the other partner being the femme though it's not always like that in those relationships.\n\nWhat's confusing are the transwomen who are attracted to women and look butch with muscles and still dress like men.  Some might have done so sometimes when applying for jobs or being with their families to hide that they are trans but increasingly there are those claiming to identify with women but have no intention of looking like women.  I've also found out that there is the equivalent with transwomen who want the sex change surgery and cross hormones but still sometimes dress like women.",

        "text": "@azraelbatosi That's the case in fee paying schools and the public or state schools in better areas.  In poorer areas children are taught to forget about themselves and their loved ones and put the 'greater good' first which is really just the elites.  The individual doesn't count.  It's Abrahamic thinking and the JOY (Jesus first, others second, yourself last) acronym secularised.  There are schools in poorer educational authorities near me where that is how children are being taught.  They are being taught about death studies and sacrifice.  That led to an outbreak of suicides in Bridgend County in South Wales. Look up UK Column on this.  There has been more of a move towards this in late 90's from then on. Left wing groups on Facebook are full of sacrificial people brought up by working class parents who were often religious as well.  It's all about the 'greater good' and the following the 'science' and not about the individual to them.  It's no longer about me, myself, my family, my friends and my mates at work but about my betters.  \n\nA former friend of mine was brought up in Bridgend County which covers Maesteg, Tonteg and Bryngarw.  He is a shell of a human being because he wasn't getting the emotional support at home and was being brainwashed in school where teachers actually bullied weak minded pupils and encouraged other pupils to bully them as well.  I've tried to help him put himself first and stand up for himself sometimes because you can't help other people from an empty emotional well.  He has become a masochist.  He will splash the cash on friends because it's not just about helping them out but draining his own bank balance.  There's no thought going into the copious presents he showers on friends because he thinks if he buys enough rubbish some of it will be appreciated but each unwanted present has a negative not neutral effect on the recipient.  He doesn't have a clock on the wall or mantelpiece, watch or alarm clock so has to rely on other people to remind him of the time at home and when out and about and to ask people to give him a wake up call in the morning if he has a morning appointment.  He did eventually find an alarm clock under a pile of other belongings but no batteries for it but he never has the time to buy new batteries. He won't complain to his landlord about a door bell only being heard downstairs in a large shared house he used to live in because to him that is 'service to self' only.  He won't complain to his present landlord about the water pressure to his toilet being low so you have to wait half an hour to be able to flush the toilet again as he sees that as 'service to self' only.   \n\nSo I try to appeal to his selfless nature in trying to change the self defeating behaviour by suggesting all this present giving is a way of controlling other people and that other people living in the same building or visitors are affected by not having an upstairs doorbell and low water pressure to the toilet.  Doesn't work as the other people in the building and visitors are of a lower priority to him than certain women in his life.  All the visitors other than myself are male so I and they are of lower priority to him than the friends who are house bound that he visits.  Sometimes you have to try and change the self defeating or selfless behaviour instead of the self defeating or selfless mindset if changing that mindset doesn't work.\n\nSomeone I know in Caerphilly removed her remaining children from state schools when her eldest left school and she found out about what her children were being taught with these scenarios.  She also said various organisations were sending representatives into schools to brainwash children with their propaganda.  One of them is Stonewall.  It's led to masochism and self harm.  Turning children in these schools into shells of human beings if they are emotionally neglected at home as well.   They will remain shells of human beings all their lives.",

        "text": "@xd-hc8cc Capitalism with out checks and balances can end up being just as terrible as communism. Just look at the the early years of the industrial revolution. Horrible things were done in the name of profit. Child labour on a scale its hard to believe. Short or almost non existent wages. Company towns that literally owned the people who worked there through the debt accrued while living and working for the Company. The list literally goes on and on into an exhibition of the worst things humans are capable of. \n\nBut the capitalism we have today is NOT unfettered capitalism. We have labour laws to prevent the mistakes made in the past. We have safety regulations on manufacturing and job sites. There's unions that support and actively defend the rights and benefits of the workers in them. We have learned from the mistakes made in the past. \n\nIs modern capitalism with out faults? Absolutely not. There are still greedy powerful people willing to cut corners to make extra profits. But that will never end. Those people will always exist no matter what government is in place. The importing thing is that things can change for the better in our governmental and economic system. Things have changed. People in a communist country do not have the same rights as those in a democratic country. \n\nYour worried about pollution? I agree it's a problem and not a small one. Capitalism is responsible for some of it. But not all of it. China is one of the most polluted countries in the world. The west regularly exports our waste to them and let them take care of it. The reason? They do not have the same regulations on pollution or working environments as in a democracy country. Big corporations have moved some manufacturing out of the US to other countries because of the lack of working regulations. There trying to make as big a profit as possible and don't care about its effects in that third world country that has workers right or safety regulations. Should the American or western companies be held accountable? Yes. The countries that allow those factors to be made should also be held accountable. \n\nNow on starvation. My point was that the people in the USSR and CCP were purposely starved. The ability of the people to farm was purposely undermined and destroyed. The food available was taken away. Look up the Holodomor and The Great Leap Forward. That's a small taste of the horrors purputrated under communism. \n\nGo do some actual research and some critical thinking on these subjects.",

        "text": "@lucymartyr4364 I feel like everyone is so confused and what the true definition of gender is. Growing up, gender was just something on your birth certificate, and therefore your pronouns. In fact, there was a lot of work towards trying to decipher personality types and interests and temperaments from gender itself, and making alternative genders you can convert to is reaffirming the old-fashioned ideas of yesteryear, that girls want to be pretty and soft, and boys want to be tough and dirty and not care about their clothing. While I disagree with a lot of baby boomers, this was definitely something they fought towards, to abolish all stereotypes from being associated with gender. I can say for sure I myself as someone who had gender dysphoria as a kid as well, I feel like I was a boy so much, although I was afraid to acknowledge that to anyone, as it was pre 2016. I felt free or feeling like a boy rather than a girl, due to our society telling us that being a girl needs to be wearing a pink skirt, talking with a certain intonation, loving certain topics, painting your nails, hating potty humor, etc.\n\nit seemed to me the only alternative was boy, which seem to fit more with my personality type, as especially back then, I was really into big robots, I still am now, but in a different way, as in I'm more into the gundams rather than the transformers, as well as I was a huge fan of marvel at the time, and science fiction in general. I've always loved crude jokes, jokes that were unladylike for a girl to ever say or be interested in, loved climbing trees and getting dirty not giving a crap to what my clothing looked like in terms of fashion and just wanting to be comfortable, although at that time a very specifically wanted to wear boys clothes, because of my dysphoria. At this point I just wear whatever, I just want to be physically comfortable. I felt even better and more like myself when I realized I can be feminine and be a girl and like all these things that I described before, and since the word feminine is directly derived from female, basically attributing personality type as being masculine or feminine is implying gender stereotypes, that a personality type can be tied to a gender. The world doesn't work that way, as much as it seems. To me it's not right that there's a voice section in girls section in the toy aisle, I should be all mixed together and not made into such a binary, since only binary is our genitalia.",

You just sound like what would've once been called a Tomboy.

I was saying that potential influence on us as a child is not just TV and our parents, and perhaps kids around us, but the fact that there is a section of toys where they show pictures of boys playing with those particular toys, and a section where they have photos of girls playing with certain other toys. That's all I'm saying, and in terms of clothing yes, I do believe that there is a difference in terms of fit, I agree with you, I personally don't shop in the men's section because apparently my bust is slightly too big and my hips are too wide, I'm not at all full of s******* but I've tried men's shirts, and they are snug around the hips and we'll hike up and I don't personally like that so much. The other thing I mentioned about clothing was more in terms of how standard fashion that is deemed feminine, or even things that are usually made for women, tend to be more fitted and try to show more of her figure then a lot of men's clothing. I know men's clothing sometimes does do that for sure, but say for example, the common printed t-shirt for a man is a lot looser on his body then a common printed t-shirt sold for women. That's all I'm saying, not throwing a fit :-)",

I'd be happy to never hear the word \"gender\" for the rest of my life ffs. I really don't care how people express themselves if they mind their own business about it. it becomes an issue when it's labeled and the label is treated like some sacred category that everyone must tread carefully around lest they say the wrong thing and become an evil villain for it. \n\nI honestly think that there's a lot less people than you'd think who would genuinely be offended by men wearing dresses and women wearing suits if they minded their own business, outside of the super religious/conservative older generation. it's the way the community acts and imposes themselves in the name of \"activism\" that ironically makes them hated. their optics are so horrendous, they have to keep people in line by social backlash at this point when all they had to do was just keep to themselves and the culture would have grown more accepting organically; when the bubble finally grows to large, they're going to fall hard.

I was one of those girls, and I grew up with a relatively masculine mindset of being stoic but like to look and act quite feminine. almost no one is a perfect fit for any one role.\n\nThe community is ruining themselves with their horrible optics. Very few people would have a problem if it was just crossdressing, it's the way they impose themselves on everyone's life in the name of \"activism\", and make people walk on eggshells just to not incur the wrath and social backlash. all they had to do was mind their own business and the social climate would have slowly progressed organically. with what they're doing now, eventually the bubble will grow too large, and they'll fall hard; people don't like having ANYTHING forced on them. support for gay rights is going back for the first time in years because of these nutcases, I feel bad for the normal gay people out there.",

        "text": "based weeb 2 electric Boogaloo Well Socialism isnt necessarily the end result of Atheism. \n\nStatism however is. If nothing is higher than man, then a group of men who rule over all other men, might as well be a God. Socialism is merely a utopian version of statism. I.e. it gives the Atheist a \"heaven\" in his ideology that is becoming more and more recognizable as a religion.\n\nBut atheism just leads to Despair, as there is no way to conquer The Void. Just merely be consumed by it. No leaps of faith are permitted, this means things like the Wright brothers first flight would NEVER happen. (See the Wright brothers didn't know Jack shit about how airfoils work, and WE didn't know until relatively recently that fixed wing aircraft operate on MORE than just the airfoil principle) This means that flight wouldn't be achieved for hundreds of years in an Atheistic worldview.\n\nWhen logic and reason tells an Atheist, \"impossible\" he must bow his head and become a nihilist on the subject. That is the only answer.\n\nWhen confronted with the same issue a Christian MUST answer, \"I was made in the image of a creator God, why should I bow my head to despair?\"",

And Covid19 as proven beyond any reasonable doubt that almost no \"scientist\" in the modern era cares or even believes in truth, and they'd rather twist facts to push an agenda.\n\nFinally Hume's Guillotine means that you cannot derive a moral system from well anything, that is not already moral in of its self. Christianity can only pull it off, because is derives its morality from the Universal Arbiter of Truth.\n\nSo if you try to derive a moral system, it will be illogical, unreasonable, and arbitrary.

But if I did not hear the tree falling as I saw it from afar and some other guy heard it, it doesnt mean we are both wrong or invalid it just means that third  person disagrees.  \nSo only someone who has had it impact them in a way that it affects them personally like say someone who is completely asexual demi trans autistic anyfuckingthing can feel the impact of that tree therefore the most burden really knows the weight of that tree making it often very difficult for others to relate as they were not affected by the tree. Which is valid but still a dick move to tell them to go kill themselves when the tree could have already nearly did that. \n- from the bog standard amount sex having human thats spent way too much time on this as have you rather than spending the effort on improving ourselves. \n\nAnyway thats enough fucks from me thank you for your time and your kind words, idk its eleven at night gonna eat something, drink water hug my dog and continue to not believe in magical crystal powers but kindness instead.

I'm saying this as someone who used to feel asexual, especially in this day and age, if you're not constantly thinking about how hot everyone is, you therefore are an asexual. Basically, all of these different sexualities and genders are A coping mechanism for house screwed up our society is, without directly addressing those issues.

Their point isn't to say that people who identify as asexual aren't normal human beings, their point is, it's quite normal for any organism to fluctuate in their level of desire for sexual intercourse. It is not considered common nor normal to be constantly horny, that is something that our society has pushed upon us, and I think it's strongly connected to the extremes of the sexual liberation movement of the '60s and '70s, basically, there's a reaction to extreme prudishness of the 40s and 50s, and then now it's devolved into the complete opposite, that we're all pressured to feel and think in a constantly super duper snooper horny way, as if we're so desperate to reproduce. The thing is, especially humans, aren't that way. You may even be horny all the time, but not put those hormones upon everyone else. That's not what being sexual is about, contrary to popular belief. It took me a very long time to realize that myself, who also at some point identified as asexual.\n\nSomething I've noticed as someone who identified as a sexual, and when I've talked to other people who identified as asexual, is that we all share one common thing: we felt imposed upon by our society to have stronger sexual feelings outside of our personal boundaries then what felt healthy or normal for us personally. We are told it's normal to be constantly thinking about how someone is attractive, or wanting to bang someone. That's not natural or normal, that's social, and it's not a healthy way of living. It is healthy to have your sexual inclinations fluctuate, and that might mean feeling most of the time not horny, or that might mean feeling more all the time, but that doesn't mean also if you're horny all the time, that doesn't mean you have to automatically be talking about oh my gosh I'm so horny or watching p*** or be interested in banging your friend or a random person on the street or think a particular celebrity or character is super attractive. It just means you have strong sexual inclinations, but you choose to preserve them for when it would be holy and sacred and not to be fleeting and vain in your sexual feelings. Especially as youngsters, we're often times convinced that, oh it's normal to feel sexual feelings! To the point that we feel like that's the only way to live, while the point of the sexual liberation movement was to keep kids from feeling ashamed of their sexual inclinations, it's led us to feeling ashamed for not feeling sexual enough. Again, when I've talked to other people who has ever identified as asexual, they had the exact same feelings about this. It seems like it's not so much that there's a bunch of asexual people, there's a bunch of people that have been heavily affected by our society's unreasonable expectations when it comes to sexuality.",

Please don’t get me wrong I believe in capitalism and definitely believe it to be better than the alternatives but I am critical of it as with all things not because I want it to fail but because I want it to succeed.

It all stems from evolution.\n\nIn the extreme cases, a caveman can be evolutionarily successful as total deadbeat dad, just going around having sex with as many women as possible, and never helping to raise his offspring. So long as their mothers are strong/safe enough to do it themselves. Conversely, a cavewoman doesn't need to feel even an iota of carnal attraction to men, if a man is just going to make her mate with him anyway. Though it _is_ more important for her that she find a man that can and will take care of her and the kids.\n\nIf we define sexuality purely in terms of carnal attraction, only males _need_ to have a \"sexuality\" at all. Women's sexuality will always depend more (and potentially exclusively) on companionship, personality, and wealth.",

        "text": "@PCGameplayism  I haven’t done a political alignment test in years but I know it was pretty close to yours, probably for similar beliefs on free healthcare. One thing I try to remind conservatives about is that if we’re not going to be like the left and abort babies even when we know they’ll be disabled, we better bloody have a system in place to assure their survival and medical care. \n\nFrom what I understand about American health care, by being born disabled I wouldn’t be able to get insurance and afford any medical care. I talk to people with the same disability as me in the US and hear how they’re always having blocks of time where they’re without essential medicine because they struggle to afford it. That on it’s own would disable them further and make holding a job down impossible, so then they just end up on welfare, accessible healthcare actually helps the sick hold down jobs and participate in the economy like everyone else.\n\nI’m in Australia and very much like our half public half private system. If you have money you’ll always choose private because you get doctor choice and no wait times, which results in less of a wait time for those who can’t. The fact the government doesn’t have to cover EVERYONES healthcare helps the federal budget. \n\nMy one gripe with the system is the disability pension. It’s great in the sense it makes some healthcare absolutely free and medications cost drastically less, but these features incentive staying on the pension. A disabled person can often only work a simple job, if you only earn minimum wage, which is more than the pension, leaves you with a higher cost of living, you’re better off on the pension. \n\nI think those disability health cost perks should continue post-pension till you reach a certain income bracket. It means disabled people can live a more fulfilling life working while still getting the helping hand they need, ultimately it’d cost taxpayers less than financially trapping them on the pension. There’s a lot more to think about regarding healthcare issues and I think being an absolutist about either free or no free healthcare is just a way to dismiss dealing with the complexities of the issue and narrowing down policies that are moral and fair for both those in need of these services and those who don’t/who provide the tax money that funds it. An individual country’s economy is also a really important factor in what policies are needed/are possible, as is uncontrolled/mass immigration.",

        "text": "​@PCGameplayism To be fair it \"Free Healthcare\" barely even works in Norway. The waiting lines for treatment are atrocious, and the rationing of the limited \"free\" resources meant that patients will have to suffer from medical conditions that lead to a severe reduction in quality of life or productivity for months and potentially years because it is not deemed sufficiently \"urgent\". Most of the time it is faster just to go to a private clinic to get tested and treated. \n\nExample: Your doctor suspects you have severe Sleep Apnea, you can choose to wait months for a test at the public hospital, or you can pay (ca. 900USD) a private clinic to get checked with almost no waiting. Now you have the diagnosis, choose again if you'll wait potentially months to get the \"free\" CPAP machine, or buy one yourself (ca. 900USD) to finally get quality sleep, reduce your risk of Depression, Heart Disease, etc. Immediate treatment means an improvement in quality of life and productivity. \n\nYou'd think that this would be tax deductible after all by getting treatment privately, you are not extending the waiting line, you are less likely to be on disability which would be a direct drain on the public resources, to need surgery to deal with the health consequences of Sleep Apnea, but no. Common Sense has no place when the goal is \"equal access to healthcare for all\". And I'm only talking about the effect on the person with the untreated medical condition, if you extend the analysis to the patients' relations, then this policy makes even less sense.",

        "text": "@quiewy3436 I'm sorry to say this, as someone who had gender dysphoria in Middle school, I have to say I must disagree with you. Our society has decided that gender is a social construct, gender and itself is not. What we consider masculine and feminine absolutely is, which is a huge huge problem. What we need to deconstruct is not gender itself, rather the societal expectations of each gender, as each gender does not have a personality type nor does it define who You are. I'm saying this as someone who felt like transgender boy in Middle school, although I was very closeted about it at all times. I feel like there's only two options, either I was a girl and liked pink mini skirts, gossiping in a valley girl intonation, makeup, painted nails and hated flatulence humor, or I was a boy, who by my definition at the time and by many people's definitions these days, was someone who was strong, had a full spectrum personality, liked heavy duty subjects, cyberpunk, dystopia in stories, not caring about fashion and only wanting to be comfortable in one's clothing and believing in only practicalities. This is what I thought being male versus being female was, this fit more with my personality, so I believe that therefore must be a boy. I did feel free or believing this, rather than fitting in a box that I didn't, until I realized that I didn't need to put myself in a box at all, that masculinity and having a more rugged personality do not go hand in hand, having a rugged personality and having a rugged personality does. There's nothing Butch about me or tomboyish about me, I'm simply me, Aki, the woman I'm proud to be, there's no makeup not even eyeliner, hates glittery things and loves fart jokes.\n\nBecause of this, I believe it's strongly and healthy too be changing one's gender identity simply because of one's personal interests. We are actually giving in to Old world stereotypes of gender that the hippies in the 60s tried so hard to abolish, so kids like us could finally feel free to be who we are without feeling like our personality traits did not fit our gender, but yet here we are, reversing all of that. There's a lot of things I did not agree with that they did at the time, but it was ultimately to a better cause.",

In fact, psychological studies have proven that *both* boys and girls, suffer greatly if they grow up without violent simulating situations or games, such as Nerf battles, wrestling, the likes. It's been found that children that did not engage in these activities, regardless of their gender, usually grew up to be more irritable, have mood swings, and more likely going to have a bout of rage as adults, and tend to be more snappy and less patient. Scientists believe it's because of the playful act of pretend aggression, that it somehow correlated with actual aggression in the future. So, you are correct, it's biological, but it's biological for both men and women to have the inclination to be aggressive. Believe it or not, most girls have had the chance to dispose of their energies that way, but those who don't, grow up to be more irritable and have anger issues correlated to lack of playful violence. It's not masculine or boy like to want to have a Nerf battle, it's simply natural for a child to want to pretend there is some sort of social conflict that needs violent confrontation, of course they don't think of it that way, scientists don't know why this happens, but it seems to be directly correlated with actual violence, and such play prevents someone from being potentially violent in the future.",

        "text": "@PHUCKyoutube689 There is a lot to unwrap in your comment.\nFirst, you misread me. My approach would be teaching kids (and adults) self reflection techniques, not enforcing PC-culture. \n\nSecond, I understand your frustration with these kids telling you what you can and cannot say. Obviously, they need to learn to not take themselves so seriously because you cannot control what others say or think about you. However, these kids have been bullied by society telling them they can’t be the way they strongly feel they are, so the natural first response will be standing up and asserting their right to be how you are. Your doing the same right now since they are basically giving you a dose of your own strategy which clearly doesn’t work long term. If you let it get to you by getting upset like so many on here, you will just propitiate a cycle. It’s a sad place to be, but it’s your choice.\n\nI realize your doing it for the kinship you feel with those who feel the way you do, but shitting on others is always gonna come back to kick you in the nuts one way or the other karmically. But totally your choice.\n\nLastly, your note on emotional trauma doesn’t exist says a lot about your own trauma. Emotional trauma is so normal in our society that you think it’s normal or natural (this reflects to your views on bullying). Any time a figure of authority or a group of your peers used fear to motivate you as a kid, and you accepted that motivation, you have accepted emotional trauma and it is the source of anxiety for you and many others and is why so many are deeply unhappy and unfulfilled. You probably have a very pessimistic view of the world and people in general as a result and believe that everyone deep down is self-serving. It’s easy to believe that when we came out of survival evolution, but there is deeper core of truth underneath which only you can find in yourself through deep self reflection into your own actions and thought patterns and the underlying reasons, not stopping until you have a clear and consistent answer. It’s a long road and you may lose friends over it, but your strong enough to push through and find the truth of what’s going on in this world when no more anger is within you. Good luck on your journey, friend.",

Maybe she doesn't want kids because of looks, because of mental issues, because of trauma watching her own mother suffer complications, because of being forced to babysit for the neighborhood from the age of 7 and already raised the entire block, is focused on career... doesn't matter the reason nor how moral/ petty/ just/ insane the reason is. Women are individuals, and painting with generalized brushes while treating the generalizations as a universal truth is \"othering\" and damaging.\n\nOf similar note, just because the instincts are there doesn't mean she wants to indulge. We ALL have instincts for exercise, yet how many choose to not be active? We all have instincts to sleep, yet how many choose to not get enough through forcing an unrealistic schedule? We all have base reproductive instincts, yet the willpower to see that actions have consequences...\n\nIf I said that all men want to eat 24/7 but then always expected men to eat everything I brought to work every day and got mad at them when they didn't? Same concept as \"all women want children\". We all love to eat, but on our personal terms. It is a biological necessity, but we don't all partake the same way and it's a huge turn away when others force their expectations onto you. It's still true though... so what happens when you get legislation and social expectations forced on you to prioritize eating above all else? When others are trying to control how much you eat? Pretty soon the cake scene from Matilda will be your reality day in and out... you'll never not hear about food and when you do it's about how much you aren't living up to their understandings of \"men's hearts are their stomachs\".",

Prior to that then it was like something that you would never have outside of jeans, and even then it was like ew gross by your parents. By the way so no one gets confused I'm not saying that everyone dressed nicely, but it's just denim was strictly for jeans and yes jackets too but I'm just trying to say it was innovative at the time",

        "text": "​@Hugh Mongous The problem is people who do think they already have all of the answers usually don't want to be taught otherwise lol. They reject any contrary information as falsehood. If they already know everything about a topic, and they encounter information that contradicts their understanding, then that information must be wrong. \n\nThe point where you become a mature adult is when you find yourself in that situation and can say to yourself \"okay, maybe I was wrong before, I should explore this more\". But for a lot of people that doesn't happen until they're in their 20's, because our brains are still developing at that point. For some people it never happens at all, and they just peak mentally in their teens. \n\nI think you've kinda hit the nail on the head by bringing up the effect of what previous generations teach the youth, but that doesn't only apply to boomers. Gen Z didn't come to form these kinds of opinions in this video entirely on their own, they were taught a lot of this by millenials and Gen X'ers. I know that because I am a millenial myself and I watched it happen. The people around my age were the ones who really lit a fire under the ass of the progressive movement in relation to things like gay rights in the 2000's, which absolutely needed to happen, but clearly it lead to other less positive outcomes.\n\nNamely it created a culture where intolerance of any kind became viewed as a cardinal sin to be stamped out with prejudice, and victimhood is rewarded with praise and attention on a societal scale. On the face of it that might seem positive, but the end result has been a culture where people are afraid to speak their minds lest someone take their word as \"intolerant\" and attempt to stamp them out. Where people are incentivised to compete for victim status because they can see how beneficial the attention that brings could be for them, and now they often do this for reasons that are less than ethical. \n\nAnd all the while that is going on, you've got millenials going into their 30's in that environment. Either fully embracing the aforementioned culture through \"social justice\" ideology, or too afraid to question it. And these are the people who are tasked teaching the next generation, so what are they going to teach them? Well, as it turns out, mostly more of the same.\n\nimo it's not any one generation who is to blame for this. The problem is ideological. It started with good intentions, seeking to fix problems that existed long before the boomers. But somewhere along the way certain people's bad intentions, those who would use it to silence legitimate political opposition and abuse people's empathy for their own personal gain, turned it into a cultural poison.",

        "text": "@folding_chable  Glad you beat me to the punch, I agree with what you say, (I think) but I would have put it differently, while we can and should blame the boomer generation, we must also blame what they raised up, (as a millennial) and it has to do with responsibility, virtue and the outcomes of all things. We can blame parents for not doing a better job, sometimes we should less, and sometimes more, but we must also blame the kid. When the kid grows into an adult, you have to, at some point, start blaming him, despite his upbringing and shortcomings, even if he wasn't given much of a chance, because someone always has it worse, and at some point time will turn you into an adult of sorts, and it can be a childish adult, who refuses to think for oneself, refuses responsibility, uses excuses like \"I was never taught any better, I'm poor so I'll resort to lying and stealing!\" or whatever excuse you can think of, but at some point you have to hold the adult accountable, too, deservedly, I'd say, or else everyone keeps shifting blame to the start point, and at that point we may as well say \"So the first humans should have elected for self deletion so we could avoid all of this\" So everyone should be blamed according to how much they should.\n\nI've said that people, including our generation, generally lost good fundamental values, they don't have it. So we don't think for ourselves, or even know what good is, we say \"morality is subjective\" because we want it to be true, rather than believing or thinking it to be true, truly. Communism and socialism, (being the path to communism) is a bad idea on paper and worse idea in practice, the fact that many cannot see it as such just speaks to the perverted values of people. In high school, I was flabbergasted when I asked a teacher what would she think of my paper if I made it plainly bad and low effort since she said it was \"subjective and not gradable\" (paraphrased) and she said \"Well, then that'd be your paper\" a sort of waving away the fundamental problems of not having an objective parameter within which to test essays and papers, I was very surprised about that because she was our teacher that was going to grade our papers anyways, despite her professed values of \"it's subjective you can't really rate it\" I do think the discussion of how and what and why and should art in its various forms matters, but most people do not even have a fundamental understanding of a lot that involves the world, so when people are asked about or to think of other topics, they cannot understand it, they do not understand the basic building blocks much less what comes after, I suppose, at the risk of sounding like a elitist asshole.\n\nIn my work, I work with younger, (a lot of older and younger) people, including younger generation Z kids, one of them, who's name I'll change to Robert, who is a lot younger than me, is a friend of mine and I like him, and his (changed name) close friend Lisa, who is a lesbian woman. I'd consider her a friend, too but maybe more of an acquaintance. He's smart for his age, he listens without just giving a knee jerk reaction, really thinks about things, I try to listen to him and give advice where relevant, and he cracks me up. He calls me wild, (not in a hostile way) says I have a strong personality, (heard that before, along with wild) and asks me questions like \"So, do you ever think like, should I do think or think this or how will people of my (race) community think of it?\" he's a thoughtful guy. He also cracks me up because he'll tell me things I forget. \"Yeah, you say some shit, like the other week when you were going off on masks being communist\" because he'll say something that sounds like something I'd say but I don't always recollect actually saying it. That and one day he was telling me about how him and Lisa shared the same woman in the same night, (but on separate bedroom moments) while her presumably husband watched them, so it was a cuckold and bull moment, and then he woke up the next morning and just contemplated life.\n\n'course he did pick up a lot of lingo the youngins' use nowadays like 'bet'. I do like him and Lisa, but a lot of the younger generations I dislike, too much time on phones, little to say/do/think or them playing high school social games. Virtue signaling.\n\nWe live in very different times. One thing that I always thought odd about that is some people would defend it, \"well, the previous generation always complains about the newer, one, so, ha, nothing changes!\" No, something can continually get worse.",

I know at some point I thought I was bisexual, until I came to the realization that, I know this might be hard piece of food to chew, but in reality, heterosexual women also find women hot. Women also get aroused by other women regardless of their sexuality. It's because women and femininity is largely a part of sexuality especially heterosexual sexual intercourse, which is also why there are a lot of religions that say a woman should cover up her parts because her body has a specific allure to it, that virtually everyone will be aroused by, and it's so special and sacred that it should be kept between her and whomever her partner is. A lot of people must construe this as keeping it for her husband, but it has less to do with it being for a man than it has to about keeping such a sacred thing hidden from the rest of world except your special someone.",

For example, they're hyper focus on sexuality, and them thinking they were helping their daughters be liberated by pushing them to dress less modestly because they automatically assumed if they ever wanted to cover up, it was out of shame of their body rather than them simply not being comfortable with that much of their body being exposed to the world, they did this because they grew up in a society that continuously shamed both boys and girls, but especially girls, for their sexuality, and made it all out to be bad unless it's for reproductive reasons between two married people. That being said, was that trauma on their shoulders, they have continuously wanted to send the Young generation that sexual feelings is normal and okay, but they do it to a such an extreme that they themselves are also to sanctifying sexuality, and then now both millennials and gen z have grown up in a disgustingly over sexualized society, and it seems like we might finally fix it once and for all.\n\nWhat I mean by this is, due to us never knowing of a world where it was bad to feel sexual feelings, and where the body wasn't bad for any reasons, and the reason for covering up was for the sake of decency, not shame, many of us with our cleaner perspectives on the world and untainted when it comes to this particular topic, we will likely raise our kids to have a healthy balance, and likely change society to not be so hyper sexualized. Basically, we need an extreme to defeat an extreme, to finally make it to balance. This is what you call the penangulum effect, where it must swing in the extreme opposite direction before it could finally land in the center",

        "text": "@TheGooseIsLoose9000 \"By 1921, many Italian workers and peasants were unionized and had their own political organizations. With demonstrations, strikes, boycotts, factory takeovers, and the forceable occupation of farmlands, they had won the right to organize, along with concessions in wages and work conditions.\n\nTo impose a full measure of austerity upon workers and peasants, the ruling economic interests would have to abolish the democratic rights that helped the masses defend their modest living standards. The solution was to smash their unions, political organizations, and civil liberties. Industrialists and big landowners wanted someone at the helm who could break the power of organized workers and farm laborers and impose a stern order on the masses.\n\n For this task Benito Mussolini, armed with his gangs of Blackshirts, seemed the likely candidate. \n\n\r\n\r\nIn 1922, the Federazione Industriale, composed of the leaders of industry, along with representatives from the banking and agribusiness associations, met with Mussolini to plan the \"March on Rome,\" contributing 20 million lire to the undertaking. With the additional backing of Italy's top military officers and police chiefs, the fascist \"revolution\"-really a coup d'etat-took place. \n\nWithin two years after seizing state power, Mussolini had shut down all opposition newspapers and crushed the Socialist, Liberal, Catholic, Democratic, and Republican parties, which together had commanded some 80 percent of the vote. Labor leaders, peasant leaders, parliamentary delegates, and others critical of the new regime were beaten, exiled, or murdered by fascist terror squadristi.\n\nThe Italian Communist party endured the severest repression of all, yet managed to maintain a courageous underground resistance that eventually evolved into armed struggle against the Blackshirts and the German occupation force.\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nWhom Did the Fascists Support? \n\n\r\nThere is a vast literature on who supported the Nazis, but relatively little on whom the Nazis supported after they came to power. This is in keeping with the tendency of conventional scholarship to avoid the entire subject of capitalism whenever something unfavorable might be said about it. Whose interests did Mussolini and Hitler support?\n\n In both Italy in the 1920s and Germany in the 1930s, old industrial evils, thought to have passed permanently into history, re-emerged as the conditions of labor deteriorated precipitously. In the name of saving society from the Red Menace, unions and strikes were outlawed. Union property and farm cooperatives were confiscated and handed over to rich private owners. \n\nMinimum-wage laws, overtime pay, and factory safety regulations were abolished. \r\n\r\nSpeedups became commonplace. Dismissals or imprisonment awaited those workers who complained about unsafe or inhumane work conditions. Workers toiled longer hours for less pay. The already modest wages were severely cut, in Germany by 25 to 40 percent, in Italy by 50 percent. In Italy, child labor was reintroduced. To be sure, a few crumbs were thrown to the populace.\n\n There were free concerts and sporting events, some meager social programs, a dole for the unemployed financed mostly by contributions from working people, and showy public works projects designed to evoke civic pride. Both Mussolini and Hitler showed their gratitude to their big business patrons by privatizing many perfectly solvent state-owned steel mills, power plants, banks, and steamship companies. Both regimes dipped heavily into the public treasury to refloat or subsidize heavy industry. \n\nAgribusiness farming was expanded and heavily subsidized. Both states guaranteed a return on the capital invested by giant corporations while assuming most of the risks and losses on investments. As is often the case with reactionary regimes, public capital was raided by private capital. At the same time, taxes were increased for the general populace but lowered or eliminated for the rich and big business. Inheritance taxes on the wealthy were greatly reduced or abolished altogether. \n\nThe result of all this? In Italy during the 1930s the economy was gripped by recession, a staggering public debt, and widespread corruption. But industrial profits rose and the armaments factories busily rolled out weapons in preparation for the war to come. In Germany, unemployment was cut in half with the considerable expansion in armaments jobs, but overall poverty increased because of the drastic wage cuts. \n\nAnd from 1935 to 1943 industrial profits increased substantially while the net income of corporate leaders climbed 46 percent. \n\nDuring the radical 1930s, in the United States, Great Britain, and Scandanavia, upper-income groups experienced a \n\r\n\r\nmodest decline in their share of the national income; but in Germany the top 5 percent enjoyed a 15 percent gain.5 Despite this record, most writers have ignored fascism's close collaboration with big business. Some even argue that business was not a beneficiary but a victim of fascism.\n\nAngelo Codevilla, a Hoover Institute conservative scribe, blithely announced: \"If fascism means anything, it means government ownership and control of business\". \n\n\nThus fascism is misrepresented as a mutant form of socialism. In fact, if fascism means anything, it means all-out government support for business and severe repression of antibusiness, prolabor forces.\" -Michael Parenti \n\n(https://eastsidemarxism.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/michael-parenti-blackshirts-and-reds-rational-fascism-and-the-overthrow-of-communism.pdf)\n\n\r\n\r\nPlease educate yourself, the actual link between Fascism and big Corporations is undeniable. They may don't believe in \"Free-market Capitalism\" but guess wha, the Big Corporations don't either.",

It's a common misconception that people's natural state is to be casually sexually attracted to random people they meet. The sexual liberation movement conned them into that. \n\nPersonally I agree with others in the thread that point out how some people need special labels to make them feel special or like they've accomplished something when they haven't.

No one knows where life itself in the universe is going. 98% of all life on earth has gone extinct without the help of \"civilization\". We are the only species that can actively delay our own extinction. We track asteroids, develop surgeries and medications. Build shelters. We farm food. We sign peace deals etc. Civilization, technology and medicine are some of the many brilliant things we have created to delay our demise. Its a wonderful thing. Billions of people of antiquity would switch time periods with us in a heartbeat. This is luxury. We all live like kings. Turn a tap and \"vuala\".....water. You don't have to die horribly at a ripe old age of 35 because you didn't know a sick buffalo died in the river up stream. \nRegardless, we can be dinosaurs living in the bush, big and ugly, biting the crap outta eachother and still have a massive rock nuke the existence outta our species. Or we can enjoy our \"horrible\" aircondition, automobile riding, ready made food and shelter civilization and still die either by our own hands, global damage or by whatever other theory out there. Or we live for billions until our sun dies. The end may come regardless but its definitely not because of civilization itself. Ultimately its all because of time. Time brings end to things. Jesus said no one knows the time or the hour that would herald the end of days.",

        "text": "@sambun6394 Yeah, I can understand your concern. However, a giant astroid couldn't end life. It severely hurt it, but didn't end it. That was a sudden event that happened to creatures who couldn't possibly fathom much less prepare for what has happened to them. \"Boom\" and that was it for most life in a few days, save for a tiny percentage. That tiny percentage science says contained one of our earliest ancestors. Millions of years later, an early ancestor of ours who wasn't much smarter than gorillas survived a time of excruciating heat and drought. We were still naked then. It wasn't because of fossil fuels that caused the warming. It happens naturally over millenia as earth wobbles on its y-axis. This very wobble also creates ice ages of which our more recent ancestors, the Cromagnon and cousins Neanderthal faced and survived together. They survived that frozen hell.    We survived because life finds a way. If you wanna see humanity come together as one, its gonna be at a time when we all know the end is at the door step and its here for all of us. Life doesn't wanna die. Every form of life fear or avoid death. We can't help it. Its what we are. When the heat starts getting out of hand and starts killing us off, bet your butt all the oil is coming off. \nI'm a millennial and I have faith in the future because of people like you. Your generation is concerned about the earth. You and your kids are gonna turn off the oil. Your generation of genuises are gonna come up with better solutions to suit your time. Like I said, life doesn't wanna die. You are an example of what I'm talking about. Your generation is humanity realizing things need to change if we are to survive and you will change it in the future. We'll be fine.",

This is all a ruse so we root for exactly that. What is currently going on at the moment is called destabilization. \n\nAs long as we are okay with the crazy they create, it will drive the government crazy especially if they suggest we adopt Chinas ways, being rejected. They will lose their mimds and yell at us if we turn the offer down asking us what the heck is wrong with us. All we got to reply is \"What do you identify as?\" to set them over the edge. \n\nYou know, I didn't really know how we could learn from other countries mistakes before Communism took it over, as nobody ever explained the nature of it, except for Yuri, it is from the moment we are given a choice to fall back on being like China or Russia as an alternative which is what Russian citizens are waiting for, specifically for us to say \"No\" when given that option. That is how we will change history by learning from the past, we will reject the offer which will force our government to come to terms with what they created having to deal with it just like the rest of us, knowing them to be controlling with power, they won't be able to handle the monster they created.",

In Egypt it means camel penis in, in Australia it also means camel penis or for skin, in the US it was another term a Dandy a male who kept up with the fashions of the time in the 18th century  and in some parts of the world, the address the word to mean an ingrown or infected hair on an elephant or horse. So yeah I remember hearing the word used during that movie as well along with Michelle tanner from full house saying it too. But true origins of the word are up in the air on this debate. But most people say that it's definition for that of a Dandy man who is well dressed in the styles of fashion is the most widely accepted. But personally for me I found out that it's definition was towards that of the ingrown ass hair of a horse when I was younger from a teacher. So yeah that's why saying it has a gender association to being a male word doesn't make sense to me. Plus according to urban dictionary standards it's a word to address a friend/person which can mean anyone can be called \"dude\" male or female.",

To me it's a constant growth towards openness acceptance and inclusivity. I feel like what started all the ultra woke stuff was perhaps some of the more moderate innovations socially speaking that Gen x brought to the table, as well as millennials have been thinking this, but haven't really brought it to the table in the same way, just universally feel this way, that being politically correct is very very needed, where we come to the understanding of how disrespectful and hurtful it is to make fun of others for their physical appearance, their mother's cooking wondering on their clothing or what they bring to school lunch just because it's foreign, and then have their mother tongue mocked by others. In the '80s and '90s, this was very common, and if you tried to tell an adult, likely they would laugh you off and tell you while I might be insulting, it's definitely not racist, because they did not intend to hurt your feelings, because it was just a joke Jimmy said. Even the ones that actually meant to bully, they were rarely disciplined for it, as also the philosophy at the time was that you had to just toughen up and resist bullies, having very little awareness of how much is going to affect the next generation.\n\nSo I do believe that we should be cognizant of the fact that we can slip up and hurt someone's feelings, I know I've worked hard on it, but if someone were to tell me that I said something racist to them, I would try to analyze what I said or did, as well as properly respond. I do agree though some people get weird about it, and they will accuse you of being racist when you literally said one of the most liberal things, I remember, I kid you not, in another comment section, I said the phrase we are all the same, which is notoriously liberal, and then people start accusing me for being racist!? It was so freaking weird 🤨😂\n\nI would also like to generally think I'm not racist, I know I'm not, but also I think we shouldn't get offended if someone pointed out to us. Again, if it goes against our natural intuition, meaning for example they think you were racist because you said something that is unifying, or you evidently believe in unification, then that's a huge red flag. I feel sad for this generation honestly, I feel like jenzie took the political correctness message way too far, to the point apparently peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are offensive on Twitter",

The internet is building a simulated reality for people, even us but, most of us maintain some of our sanity, especially adults with real world responsibilities (not all). Kids and young adults without responsibility find pride and instant gratification in saying things that are being propped up by the controlled algorithm. It gives them a dopamine response. Its an algorithm designed to keep us packed away in our square little identitarian boxes, packed away in larger boxes, inside more and more boxes. All boxes are classified as a subgroup of the human race. When you shut those who run these companies down, in other words, when you throw away the screen, then you will find peace and, sanity would once again return to these people. Only after their withdrawals subside. I'm a firm believer that this is intentional. TikTok was \"Made in China\" afterall. Powers that be here in the West would LOVE to see identitarianism here, dividing all of us, and would absolutely love to see their power solidified with communism. Even the capitalists who are already extraordinarily wealthy. They don't want competition.. they'd murder to keep their wealth.. and that they do in communist states. \n\nBut even I'm aware, I could be wrong. Years and year of watching these things unfold with a great deal of skepticism brought me to this conclusion.",

Do you realize the implications of that truth tho? I think that means we will have to gain (notice I didn't say REgain) control of the government & pass a law that denies anyone younger than let's say 26 to participate in any form of online communication, especially politcal, but you'd probably have to keep them relegated to video games & documentaries & simple fun &/or informational videos. Because I don't think we could ever just go back to the way things were before the internet, it does have it's advantages, big advantages. Unless there was a terrible war that destroyed our ability to have internet at all. Idk, I just don't know.... there's gotta be a way to fix this. Teenagers have to be allowed to be themselves but also cannot be allowed to ruin society with their immature chaos & emotional outlook on the world. Either we have to evolve to be wiser younger, or disallow children from the internet, or destroy the internet completely. Damn.",

Previous generations had it so much harder than us in so many ways and it's insanely ignorant to assume otherwise.\n\nIf my generation or your generation was around when lynching was normalised you can bet your ass we would go along with it.. case and point.. it happened.",

        "text": "@danwhiffen9235 Spot on mate. Communes only work when you have a small group, say a family group bound by blood ties, and they do not work at scale.\n\nThere was a time when hippy communes were a thing; it was called the Neolithic Agricultural Revolution, and it was back breaking work for little immediate gain. We have archaeological evidence where you can see the damage to skeletons due to the heavy labour and poor nutrition from only eating grains. \n\nBy contrast, their hunter-gatherer contemporaries had quite healthy physiology due to living in man's natural environment. They probably thought the farmers were mad, to the point that paleoanthropologists now believe the agricultural revolution was catalysed by an extreme religious belief system, as there was no clear benefit to it at first. However, they had more children than the hunters, to work to the farms and overcome the increased child mortality, and they eventually learned to farm better, domesticated livestock etc, therefore their numbers grew slowly and they spread out, and their religious ideology spread with them.\n\nEventually larger settlements were established, food surpluses were achieved and populations grew faster, property rights and the division of labour became a thing, and life started to improve. Chieftains and social hierarchies started to develop at this time, leading to the first towns and cities, and to writing, money and civilisation.\n\nThe only way that society can exist at scale is through division of labour mediated by free economic exchange - capitalism. It took us 10,000 years or so to figure this out, now these kids are like, \"I've got a *better* idea! You know all those murderous dictators in the 20th Century? They weren't doing it right, but if you put ME in charge...\" 🤪",

They really are tho aren't they?!. \n\nAll that untrue shit they said about us in those endless articles and shit came true with this gen. I think it's because they were actually projecting their problems they saw in their grandkids onto the millennial generation thinking that gen z and millennials were the same. \n\nGen z has only been recognized in the collective mentality for like 2 years. If u don't read Strauss and Howe or follow meme pages then u had no idea what gen z was until like 2 maybe 3 years ago at the most. \n\nBack then they didn't even have a firm name. Gen z was still up in the air but eventually won out \n\nI remember this started when they accused millennials of eating tide pods. It was obvious the kids in these videos were like 10 but they said millennials who were in their 20s and 30s at the time. \n\nWe had to take the blame for that and still do to this day. And the snorting condoms and eating table spoons of cinnamon challenges remember those? That was all gen z. \n\n\nWhen gen z started coming into the collective consciousness I just remember thinking \"holy shit these are millennials who are like embracing the whole millennial thing\"  \n\n\nDude I'm proud of my generation. Know generation is perfect but millennials stepped up during inflation and the 2020s and nobody even says that. \n\nAll those Frontline workers and people taking care of their parents. They aren't zoomers and they aren't boomers.",
