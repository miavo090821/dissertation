so I'm like Kung Fu Kenny all the way and as soon as I heard Dre's voice I was like I don't like it and I was disappointing is that this reveals that we as a society don't give a about women and children and abuse against we don't like we really we really truly don't because hip-hop for so long has made too much space and place for abusers every generation before he took stage he played Eminem Slim Shady and people were like this is pointed this is for a reason you don't just play this for no reason I don't know if we've hit a critical mass of men who know how to rationalize when we have been harded we understand that hey we love Kendrick but we understand that him bringing this person out can be problematic or is not can be is problematic for the [Applause] messaging hello beautiful black people hello hello I brought you all here to talk about Kendrick's juneteth concert um and I guess would maybe even want to talk about it or feel like it was a topic I had tweeted um what did I tweet I said what was the point of Kendrick even calling out Drake about uh being an abuser or being surrounded by abusers if you would just bring out Dr Dre the king of the abusers to intro the track and you know what's funny I tweeted that and I muted it instantly and I must have known child cuz that went viral and people lose mind and I realized later that I think it's because academics posted it which then makes you feel academics is a drake Dick Rider and so that makes you I think people seeing it think that I'm saying this as a drake stand and I'm not I let the Kendrick berrade like completely let the Kendrick berrade like I but I think that's a fair question and I don't even think that's I don't even I think it's a fair question on so many levels because I I feel like even Beyond a moral condemnation like I'm not even trying to like condemn Kendrick or make some like moral you know uh uh about people who interact with Dr Dre I just mean like logically like if we were just talking PR like even if I believed all of this was performative or that Kendrick doesn't care about you know that this was just a way to get at Drake even if that's the case if You' have successfully presented us the case you know what I mean like a gang Drake and why this is problematic or these kind of actors even if you're gonna still kick with Dr Dre maybe not this time maybe not today have him intro to track that's just like what my advice would be if I were his are a person like that's not even just about me making a but that's my thought but I'll give it to the room and I also wanted to make sure you know that's what madebe me want to talk about it when I make sure we start off with you know giving love to how amazing the concert was so you know don't think you jump past greatness and immediately just go to criticism I think lots of greatness to be discussed I think lots of that so I'm G give it to the room I know antonet I know an I got stuff I see it Brewing I was like look at her you know I'm really happy that you said that I didn't see that tweet but I remember sitting there and I was you know me I'm Kendrick I ride for Kendrick as much as I do Martin so I'm like Kung Fu Kenny all the way and as soon as I heard Dre's voice I was like I don't like it and I was disappointed and I looked at my man and was like I don't like it I'm mad I don't I don't I can't celebrate this part like why would he do that especially given the allegation against him yes and so I sat back and thought about it I was like okay there's this is so nuanced because we're not I'm not a West Coast girly right and so I wasn't a huge Dr Dre fan because it was you know West Coast vers East Coast whatever and I'm I'm repping my Coast whatever fine but with that said there is a level of there is a level of loyalty and pride that the West Coast has for Dre that I think and and a lot of us do it I mean I think that we were doing it with Diddy for a while where we excuse bad behavior and we exalt these people that are now our icons and I think that we folded in like just a celebrity as an icon and as someone to Aspire to especially black capitalism the culture and all this [ __ ] Dre embodies that for them so in a lot of ways he's a hero and because he embodies his black capitalism because he embodies his success gonna look over some [ __ ] and I'm not excusing it I'm I'm literally trying to process the way in which we approach it I also think that I mean van said it he said people don't care about how we abuse women we don't care collectively as a society we don't care as long as you will give us some [ __ ] that we cling on to and like as long as you are this hero and this black capitalist that we can aspire to and you are quote unquote powerful and you feel like one of the rare gems that we have to protect you're going to get that protection we're going to exalt you I mean it's very ever since he said that I it's been very hard for me to engage in our media without seeing someone who it maybe has some sort of allegation maybe even a conviction I mean they're everywhere and we just Overlook it we Overlook it and it's it's very interesting to me but that is I think Kung Fu Kenny's Lucy I think that that's his thing where it's like bro you're overlooking this thing and this is the work that you still have to do we love you but this needs to be addressed and if Dr Dre would address it and actually do some work because I think a lot of us here are abolitionists do some real work on yourself and figure out what the community needs in order for you to have proved that you should be invited back that's a different conversation never addressed it and just flat out denied it so I'll shut up but I was very disappointed when I saw it but answer I think we talked I know we talked on around the way CS about it in a sense too I think the other piece for me the Nuance for me when it comes to Kendrick is thinking around his entire body of work so like when we think about Mr morale and the big steppers um Kendrick's entire thing is around can I be redeemed what does redemption begin to look like right and so when I think around how Kendrick is even interacting a lot of his night was like when I look at it from like a restorative standpoint a lot of it was like oh we're bringing together two sides that have been beefing for so long when we think around like the history of gangs when we think around all of this it is a space of like forgiveness and music can bring everybody together and I think when we look at him Kendrick would almost he has now positioned himself to be a hypocrite if he were not to bring Dr Dre on in some space so part of it I believe is loyalty if I think around like what Kendrick is attempting to represent in terms of like can I still see the humanity in you even though you have done this stuff I don't discard of you and so I think there's one here's the Loyalty of who Dr Dre is on the west coast if we're thinking around does Kendrick have the jurisdiction to say I have forgiven him and I understand him because now I see him because I'm in community with him versus now Dr Dre what we talked about on around thewe curls is like has he done the work to address this thing and if not then he does not deserve I know I know but that's what means he does not deserve this stage to be on because obviously restorative justice means all parties need to be taken care of and obviously when we think around um all of his victims or those who are harmed and survivors my bad um they are the ones who can be the ones to be like this is what I need and he was not able to give that so I think Kendrick at the end of the day when it came on I said and then no because I was upset I was upset I'm gonna be honest but um I think that's part of it when I think around his lyrical content when I think about what Kendrick is attempting to do with restorative justice is very much so like a um a black man's version of restorative justice in some cases where we can forgive each other but that's not our space to always do that because we still benefit in a patriarchal kind of sense so those are my quick thoughts as I think around him bringing him on we can celebrate we saw that and said you're still flawed you still flawed the thing is yeah so yeah so all of you guys are saying all the great points right um and you know agree with Antonette agree with Maris agree with Olay and the original tweet um it's something that has to had to be said a lot of people are going to try to brush it you know under the the rug because the conversation gets uncomfortable for people because like you were saying Anette we can call out sometimes when it's our favorites we kind of like we move the gold post because we don't want our favorites to be um or if they're legendary like a Dr Dre um and you know a a specific like group of people at a specific age they gonna be like man that wasn't even nothing like that was him back in the you know conversations like that and because right right now Compton is like on the front of the map right now because of you know um Kendrick Lamar putting it on his he's carrying it right now and in Hip Hop they want to re they want us to be able to have the conversations with removing somebody's personal life even though the whole rap is about somebody's personal life um and calling them out about such things but they want us to be able to move remove the Artistry from what this person is in real life and with the Dr Dre uh they want us to be like man but he's legendary how can we how can Kendrick Lumar not come to the city and let him open up like that makes sense to everybody in Compton especially most people in Compton because this is like he's legendary he's big it's they don't want to really go back into but everything that Kendrick Lamar is talking about in this song can apply to Dr Drake and he got that man opening up like that's a real conversation but like you were saying if there is and then they want toow throw out the whole thing about forgiveness right um can he be restored can he be forgiven but he hasn't said nothing to it it's more denial and like he he's gonna always beat the allegations and it's no it's just that we're not really talking about it and we're not holding him accountable enough but as far as it being Kendrick Lamar he maybe he was looking at it from a point of view like that's he's he's legendary he's done a lot for hip hop and we're and I'm talking about saving hip hop so he got to open it up Mak sense okay I think it's so interesting like Maris and Rebecca what you're saying because I think you know what we've also seen with what happened with Jonathan Majors this past week and him getting awarded is there's this idea of communal forgiveness uh he got this perseverance award he goes up there and says I want to thank Will Smith WBY Goldberg this you know group of black actors who have Stood Beside Me in a way to go these people have forgiven me they're back on my side you should be too and it's almost like Kendrick was using his own clout and ability in that show to do the same for Dr Dre you know that people are going to draw those conclusions he knew that people would say yo what look at what Drake said about you and you're gonna bring him out he knew that and so I do think it was his way of of trying to leverage that same just communal forgiveness of think of everything he's done for us and and the difference is there's a there's a generational difference in terms of everybody that Jon Jonathan Major's named because I'm like dog that don't surprise me that they're going to forgive him because you got to always bring the kid home right you got to bring the prodal child back or whatever right but I think Kendrick because he is not of that generation he's held to a different expectation I mean I don't know I think I I don't know I see him of that generation I see like most Compton black man of being of that generation yeah like I mean he is but to you all Point um to to you all's point I feel like the calculation for Kendrick was really simple and he's from Compton Dre is an icon from Compton they both went to Compton High School Dre was instrumental in his early career both literally and figuratively and just what that concert was supposed to mean for the city of Compton and just the region more broadly I I don't know Kendrick personally but I'd venture to say that he didn't go into anywhere near the level of depth that we have in terms of that particularly because as Maris said he's in community with Dre too and to the extent that this is an issue I believe that he would venture to I would venture to say he said this is resolved at least within their Community that's what I was going to say so I I I don't think in any way that Kendrick thought you know he's bringing him up to help redeemed him because I don't think there's anybody who they answered to thinks he needs Redemption Dr Dre has never been pushed out in any way shape or form like he's not in the outskirts like when you think about even what is the media even the mainstream media and the Independent Media how many of the conversations that have been about Kendrick concert even are focusing on this element on it or the presence of Dr dreo why he did that that is something that is happening uh here and to what Maris was saying about you know Kendrick feeling maybe uh with Mr morale kind of thesis being you know can we be redeemed and feeling like maybe it's some level of hypocrisy to not bring Dre and I tell you why I'd say no Dr Dre is not somebody I think like it's so it's so sad with the situation with Dr Dre because it's not even just like it's a like a well-kept secret or a Open Secret or something it's a fact a a substantiated fact that Dr Dre is an abuser and let me say what I say I'm not somebody who throws out abuser again I am a defense attorney more often than not you're going to see me coming over to the side of like you know Redemption and restorative and not car feminism and not canceling and all these different things right like I have even a more sympathetic of thought process maybe to the legal standing of like a Jonathan Major's case or something like that Dr Dre is someone like Beyond like let's if you even just talk of one of Dr Dre allegations they're all gruesome Dr Dre is somebody we know beat the dog [ __ ] out of Micha beat the dog [ __ ] out of D Barnes in a party in front of people while the crowd was held off at gunpoint so he could continue to do it and then other artists the people that he is in community with his entage said oh she deserved it it should have happened uh uh and people like Eminem put out into the into the into the discourse that she was slapped in a song in order to deminimize it forever then uh he has allegations he has tons of children Dr Dre has tons of children many of whom allege like neglect abuse XYZ he also has a wife currently divorcing him who alleged abuse so this is not somebody who's done one thing and we're just talking about something from 91 this isn't somebody who's like did a thing and apologized or tries to redeem or no this is somebody who has showed us a continuous pattern of being an abuser and the community around him has said repeatedly they don't give a right so and the thing is right I'll say this I think like you live in a world life is very complicated especially like it's very easy for us who don't know these people or for me who doesn't know these people to like say oh Kendrick Lamar should say Dr Dre or don't bring him in and not recognize whatever personal relationship he have with him or what he's played in his career right and I'm not going to act like everybody I know in this life um is is going to fall within within the parameters of a good person or has never done bad things or whatever have you but I will say this this isn't like we're just judging kend Lamar on a random day or like holding him to a standard Kendrick jumped out this whole discourse everything that we're talking about is because Kendrick pushed it to the Forefront of the conversation about what the culture represents what the culture approved of and what Kendrick delivered to us in multiple dist track is that the culture should not be okay with men who are abusers or men who even surround themselves with abusers right a baka or whatever or who has a weired case and all these different things so I feel like it would be unfair for me to like lay into Drake like give Drake the nail and Hammer like I've been doing and and and giving all the sincerity and good faith to Kendrick's arguments and what Kendrick is saying and like recognizing the seriousness of the things Kendrick is talking about and then to like dismiss I guess like to to just Overlook the massive level of hypocrisy right because it tells me like all right like all right so you don't like Drake and that's what personally motivates a thing here because Dr J is a piece of [ __ ] person like you know what I mean like I have enough there to know that a piece of [ __ ] person and to know like there's one thing when when people don't approve of something someone's done or they won't speak up against something bad someone's done because that's their friend or they said it in private but not not only is Dr Dre a consistent abuser but he's a consistent abuser who's always surrounded himself with people who will vocally support the [ __ ] you know what I mean [ __ ] on this [ __ ] on the next thing so I just think you know I like just on an Optics level I understand I'm not like I guess I'm not nailing him to the Cross I'm not saying like he should not or shouldn't have done it I'm not saying oh Kendrick shouldn't have done that I'm mad at him because he did it I'm saying it does call into question what Kendrick said to us matters in the conversation that he has us having if he can then go and have this person there doing that that's just my thought process I have a question about that that those are all amazing points Olay and and I I agree with you I think when I listen to Kendrick's disses um and his allegations against Drake I don't hear him talk about violence against women and in the physical form I hear the sexual connotation and I and I hear the you know the the what is it the sex trafficking and being weird with young girls and those are all things that I think collectively society says no you can't mess with young children collectively we're like hard stop and again it highlights that abuse physical and emot abuse of women Society has not said no they definitely of women or men really because other way around same sex whatever Society doesn't say no to that as as I mean we do right but like collectively the majority is not saying hard stop no you need to sit down and think about your actions I I don't think that Kendrick was trying to offer Dre anything in that moment in terms of like hey come here we're gonna have this abolition moment we're going to accept you no Kendrick is like this dude who is the king over here co-signs me yeah and he's gonna come out and I'm gonna be the man and I idolize him and this means so much to me to have him on this stage that that's what hard stop to me that's what it is and that's that I don't I don't accept from Kendrick because he is so reflective and because he has seemingly done so much work on himself that is where I say okay I invite you to keep going because you're showing us the you're you're gatekeeping the culture in a way that I actually appreciate like I get it you don't want to see this thing commodified anymore you don't want to I get it and great it's juneth we're celebrating the culture you made sure it was only West CO or West Coast folks on the stage got you heard you but now how many people on that stage have more work to do and I think that he alludes to it with you don't know what it was to get all these people up here and so I'm not going to knock him because the work that he had to do to make sure that nothing popped off at that show blood and was is beyond anything that I can actually uh imagine uh but yes Dr Dre is is a problem there's people in my life I that I all of this stuff is a big mirror it's a reflection to me there's people in my life I have Marvin Gay I have a hard time giving him up a really hard time Michael Jackson I have a really hard time of like damn for real I really gotta thing is you don't have to give them up like it's not like anybody's making you it's about the standards you create for yourself and what you put out into the world right like different if they were still living and I was in Kendrick's position if I could get Marvin Gay to come out and sing a song with me I'm doing it I'm telling you that right now yeah I'm not gonna listen I'm not gonna have a it's okay you can have problematic people or blah blah D but I'm not going to myself volunteer The Narrative to the world that I can't live up to that what I'm like that's what that's what becomes I don't think that's his narrative think listen it's one thing to want to gatee keep a culture like want to gatekeep a culture and keep what you perceive as a cancer out but what happens when the gates you create are keeping the cancers within because like I feel like and I think like what does it say if you decide you declare to the world right this person is a cancer to our culture we should gatekeep him he's bad because of these sort of ways that he's been he's this he's these things and this is bad but all these other things so what you you deem as like this is the king of culture this is what we covet this is what we whatever have you and all those other things are so bad like in the same breath that you want to like you want to celebrate and you want to talk about all the all all the all the different things that are of value in the community and what's not being respected by by a drake what happens when like I think about even in Kendrick's stuff right you're right andr makes an excellent point about they didn't speak out on the on the violence against women and all these things there was yeah and I know and I hear that but even down to what you did talk about right when you talk about what kind of father he is or or you have children to raise or whatever Dr Dre is somebody who is a deadbeat to most of his kids like in a in a in a heartbreaking way right like multiple tragic stories and all these different things what does it say what do we really care about you know what I mean who is it that we really care about protecting what does the cult you know what I mean what does it really mean in a substantive sense yeah it almost feels like uh something I've been thinking about a lot more especially as you think as I've been thinking around like restorative justice I think around all of these spaces of redemption but also a larger conversation of like how what is the value of cancel culture because for me this almost feels like and I don't know if this right phrase or not but to me it feels like situational moral Purity kind of if that makes sense and so it feels like depending on like where it's at what is our Focus going to be in those moments right and so I don't know if necessarily Kendrick would be my expert in forgiving men right I don't know if he would necessarily be like my expert in this space and so I don't know if I I would love to hold him to that standard I don't know if I would find it advantageous because me and him don't share the same moral compass right U whatever life experiences those things are there's something of a standard that we kind of ascribe to people and like we hope that they are following that same standard but when I think around celebrities and people who are platformed we want them to be as morally morally pure as possible but all of us have our own problematic things all of us struggle all of us are human and so what does it look like to have this conversation responsibly and I think on the other space is like who and I'm still processing out loud right now but like who is the who are who do we want to hold accountable Kendrick did the action of bringing him on and I think Beyond him I think for that situation it was really just to honor Compton now us looking at it holistically and I also think around like generationally it is a little different like I didn't I think around like my students they're not thinking around Dr they're like I don't know who this Ohad is but like not like us not like us not like right so I'm looking at that kind of space and so like even to a larger standard there are people who do know and there are some people who don't right and so is it one our job as media practitioners podcasters whatever we float in the space of how we call ourselves right is it our space to speak truth to power in that space and just make sure we have a rounded idea of who this is and how do we then build capacity or ask people to negotiate their understanding of this because people on the west coast like we said earlier they're seeing this as like this is actually super impactful and super powerful in a way that could culturally and socially move content forward but that hold piece right here is like oh but we still got to deal with this [ __ ] right here yeah and so like are we thinking around like the struggle and of these competing priorities and knowing that something good happened a large buch of good happened and that was a very bad St too and so like how do we hold these competing truths I think you saw people even on the west coast and ENC Compton holding those two truths at once when in the stadium that night before he took stage he played Eminem Slim Shady and people were like this is pointed this is for a reason you don't just play this for no reason and that was immediately when people started being like Dr Dre is going to come he's setting the stage he's playing & you don't do that for no reason especially when Eminem just the week before had put something out talking about Megan and making fun of her for getting shot so I think that again goes to what Anette said about him not really caring about viol violence against women obviously he doesn't uh that that's not really it's not his top priority it's his top priority in that moment and I think also def does that look like these pointed barbs of the night that was the point you know bringing this community together but like at the end of the day I was like okay you started this night you you played Eminem and then we saw a cash app commercial like okay let's I'm not going to act like he is some moral Arbiter that isn't what I I don't think anyone can kind of give him that title but you know I I think yes this was an important thing for Compton and at the same time there were people not just questioning Dr Dre but like uh um there were like I think two other people who people noticed at that came out at the end who had like allegations against them and all this stuff and you know that that isn't the point I think for him really was this is me just taking my point to do my lap to say oh Drake said I didn't have my city I do and that's kind of the beginning and the end of it for him that's yeah yeah so yeah that's that's the conversation I think is I know we have like you were saying Maris it's something that we're all kind of processing here because we've been in the they not like us moment for you know what I'm saying for the last month and so we've been right there you know we all been doing that right so and now we're at a place that's kind of like do we I mean we need to call them out we need to call a thing a thing which we have which we will um but the conversation then it's like what you were saying Ashley it's communal for people in Compton they're like listen the city is up and um how can you know Kendrick Lamar is there he's like right now I'm the king of the city and how can I not put out like the king of the city like Dr Dre how can I not and we're talking about hip hop and everybody saying you know the conversation about saving hip-hop and making sure we keep hip-hop hip hop and not let these you know Intruders in like Drake and and Dr Dre when we talk about hip hop is at the the the top of the conversation and so and we from Compton and this is my city and I want to make sure like he wanted to make sure he did his due diligence and because like like you were saying that's his he loves Dr Dre so he it was a personal moment it was a Compton moment and that's I think a great point because when you look at it strategically the city's not just up it's United in a way that it hasn't been and so the thought process I think behind that is like you know what maybe we can stop these bodies from dropping maybe we can stop all of this Carnage that has existed this this Strife that has existed within this community and in terms of strategically I have I'm prior I'm choosing to prioritize that over the other thing because I can't do it all at once and so I think that there's something that is disappointing for us that's uncomfortable for us who have a clear I'm assuming for everybody who has a Clear Vision of the type of world we want to live in but it doesn't happen overnight like that and I'm really not trying to just give him a soft place to land because I'm still disappointed and was mad when I saw it but as somebody who has to be strategic in what you can actually achieve what you can attack I think about politics I think about you know our Squad who I agree with them but guess what strategically in the actual world that we live in and in terms of the way in which our government is set up we have to pick our battles one at a time and attack them and that is uncomfortable for some people that's something that is very frustrating for me I'm still wrapping my head around whether it's uncomfortable or whether it it's just not realist or or whether I'm just talking [ __ ] and just going along with the institutions as they are I'm not sure but I do think that there is a a strategic move involved and then on top of that I think that there is an additional layer of scarcity in the black and brown Community for the folks that have quote unquote made it for our Legends and that we feel even more in debt to protect because we don't know when we're going to get another Dr Dre we don't know when we're going to get another Jonathan Majors we're like we got to protect these people we got to make sure they're okay because they are the North Star and that's a real thing as well so I don't know maybe I'm just talking [ __ ] no no no I think you're like so I think you're right in a lot in a lot of ways and I want to be clear that I like I said I think you know when when you have a conversation about something you question something people take it like you know condemnation you're trying to hold them accountable I'm not trying to hold Kendrick accountable I want to be clear I hate that [ __ ] I hate when people say that I cannot hold Kendrick accountable he's not in community with me or anything like that and I also don't want to undermine or diminish the the efforts of everything good that happened because there is a thing that happens that the more people try to be inclusive or the more they tried to do right people instead of giving them credit for that they just nailed them to the cross for what's missing right so I don't want to act like take away from all that he was able to do positive in this and what he's doing by having a Dr Dre or acting like I think think it's this you know serious like you know crime or anything I just do think you know it's like it's a think piece you know what I mean a verbal think piece of of exploring why that is or or or or what that means if any or if anything but I'm not trying to we should always be examining [ __ ] to get better I ain't mad at you girl yeah like yeah like it's really it's really that and for me and and that's pretty much it like you you you could have them you do whatever you know what I mean do do do whatever you want it's not a I don't I don't even think it's do whatever you want I just think it's is it's like all right my guy like that's interesting Bas on Bas Alliance what you have said and it's just you know I think of you know Snoop Dog was missing from that people talked about that and Snoop Dog was missing uh a lot of people are talking about it because Snoop Dogg Snoop Dogg was there piing up the the AI song or whatever right like he put a video out after being like was so that like you were excluded for that reason and so it's interesting to me that you you have excluding who are hip-hop greats and legends you know what I mean if they pissed you off or they annoyed you or they did something else so I just think it's it's interesting what we consider like our where think got I think I think he got did video that was so great a lot of press were covering like him and him in the games responses and stuff and what they were saying cuz people because you know they were missing cuz the game didn't get the invite but I think get the game know the game didn't get the [ __ ] but I also don't know that that had anything to do with Kendrick not liking him game has issues with a lot of them groups order to keep like but he also got issues with a lot of them different one of Kendrick's Camp came out on Twitter instead it because the game tried to put out a whole thing to make it seem like oh I was here for it D D D D like you know trying to say face was like you you was talking [ __ ] that's why like but there I mean you know that's what that's what it's GNA be but I feel like for Snoop Dogg they were saying he was you know a fence riter you know he was making this he he he supports Drake and he also supports Kendrick there was no like hey you know we put the city on we all together on this one and they said Dr stood to 10 toes down for Kendrick and so there was there was that moment but um I don't think the game was invited you know what I'm saying I don't think the city really puts on for the game like the game thinks it is and but we just it gave a little bit more um I think it gave a little bit more Community I don't the game just didn't it wasn't a puzzle that was hop inead Tim sorry Tim no no F I mean I think the more Salient things have been said just in that the biggest question is uh who are you going to build community around particularly once you re uh once you Unite the city so like Kendrick has been talking about the entirety of his career the destruction of comptent both institutionally internally all of that and he's used his position as one of the figures within compon who's made it as someone who's speaking towards uniting and addressing some of these issues and so I think oay I think you you did it right and and bringing a question to if we're going to reunite this community who are we bringing in what values are we uniting around because Hip Hop for so long has made too much too much space in place for abusers every generation from bam to Diddy and violence against women children all in between and so it's really a matter of at what point are we going to decide that the work is not worth the harm that is doing to the people that you're in community with and so that's a question I think that Kendrick has to sit with because again I don't think he's going to throw Dre away ever but I do think it's a matter of interrogating what are you going to do with this now because he can't pretend as though he doesn't know only like you said it's it's a Well documented fact we're not in community with Dre and we know this it's well documented almost 30 years 30 plus years of documentation around this and so it's really now a matter of what are you gonna do with it and so I hope this is an opportunity to do that especially just the work that he's taken to bring everybody together in this moment what would we want to see him do with it what would be the steps well if Kendrick Kendrick has positioned himself as someone who's empathetic to appli of women to his degree of which he can understand women's issues and so I think that what I would want him to do is to have a substantive restorative conversation around particularly these allegations and not being selective in his outrage right so we could be mad about Drake praying on children being a predator in that way and having people around him who are abusers we should rightfully call that out but as oay said if you're going to do that you have to look inwardly too who are you associating with because you got people with weird cases too so then it's a matter of are you going to talk about those cases as well or is it just because you hate Dr and so I think that's what I would want him to do with it particularly because he's positioned himself as as a moral Authority just like as an ancillary like example when Bill Cosby one of the reasons why his records were unsealed was because the judge presiding over the case said you positioned yourself as a moral Authority on these issues and so this is now a matter of public interest with you as a public figure whose positioned yourself one of morality for the public to know that these are allegations brought against you and so similarly with Kendrick if you're going to position yourself as a moral Authority on this particular issue and say that we need to remove this cancer from the community you got to do that with the people around you too I think I don't so I don't I don't I guess I don't want to hold Kendrick or I want Kendrick to do anything I think what it really comes about is us like I'm always thinking about how we as a society is responding what we think and I think and Anto I touched on it earlier is that this reveals that we as a society don't give a about women and children and abuse against we don't like we really we really truly don't and we don't care about violence against women and more importantly we don't care about women or having women have a seat at the table like when you even think about how like women have always been a part of Hip Hop just like women are always a part of the black community right but when you see things or celebrations that are meant to be brought about what do you see men in Mass you don't see the women that were a part of the a part of Hip Hop women that whose stories coexisted with these men that are there right so like you'll see a Dr Dre but they'll never invite a D Barnes you know like conversation will never be to include them or to truly write those wrongs and so when I think about what I want to see happen um post the Kendrick is not really about what Kendrick does or any of these people it's about us to me filling in the gaps like being able to appreciate something beautiful that was done like Kendrick did something amazing this concert is great and this is great for who's able to be celebrating who's there but how can we expand our vision more to truly include and Encompass the rest of of of of of the community and that would require us to be interested in protecting the rest of the community and thus having a larger conversation about what we think Hip Hop is what it should represent and and and what's not being done because to me it's like in the same way I would be I would be okay if people lived if they lived in a world where they just you know they were like okay Dr Dre and Misha and D Barnes and all that is is old news or something but they show up differently for the women in Hip Hop today that are being abused or the stories they're hearing about but they don't you know what I mean I think about the fact right think think about it all this starts even like BBL Drizzy is a is a banger right who started BBL bring bringing it to our attention associating drink with BBL right his Megan dropping his right and like what happened I I see his is the first real diss track for the year to really get it started with even a lot of the narratives that Kendrick was able to you know go further with and other people that have been disin but why isn't Megan talked about in the conversation why isn't Megan invited or embraced at a thing like that you know what I mean like that happens in and there's a way that we're comtable we are everyone is so comfortable with hip hop and the black community in general excluding women like not even thinking about women not even being a part of the conversation till for me it's not about what I expect Kendrick them to do I don't expect Kendrick to become like who I think it's worthy if you're if you're critiquing or analyzing you know the situation to analyze what Kendrick put forth versus what he does that's cool but I guess I want to move Beyond Kendrick and talk about what we as a culture you know what I mean like what do we condemn like what Kendrick condemns you know what I mean whether or not Kendrick condemns this these actions of a Dr Dre or these actions of like expand it Beyond these individuals like let's talk about the behavior itself because I believe listen when you think about it when when the society condemns something it becomes uncomfortable for people to do it's the reason why we have the status quo and we have all these like um roles that we all play right is because we live in a world that makes us feel uncomfortable to to break from that right and then and then the same that can be that can be awful but in the reverse of that is when Society condemns behavior when Society truly condemns when everybody looks looks down you you don't feel comfortable to do it that's why like you like yeah there's still pedophilia there's still all these things but that's not the way you're not seeing that the same way you might see other things that Society is not condemning as loudly right as time goes on you see see things more more or less so I feel like we have to we have to start calling out with the same intensity that we would we we see it as a harm if we see it as a harm to the culture or the community men who would pray on women or who would like young girls or whatever we got to see not being parents to your children you know what I mean not taking your care of your children neglecting your children abusing your children like Brian mcnight and them shouldn't feel comfortable like they shouldn't feel comfortable talking to us on the internet the way that they do based on the [ __ ] that we know right like we gota criticize you know the exclusion of women we got to criticize uh selling like what is the Diddy situation is showing me like beyond the the sexual abuse we have to start like criticizing at the root like the The Knowing expect exploitation of each other how many of these artists how many of these Moguls have we known have taken advantage uh financially just Financial uh taking advantage of advantage of the people they work with of the communities we have to be willing to decide like if we really care about Community or we really care about culture that means to truly protect the people within that community and that culture and recognize that some of the things that you want to look past for for the at the people within the community you do care about is hurting a lot of others you know so I there's a lot of things that play and I'm at a couple of different Minds right I think the first part part I think as men we need to be able to see each other and ourselves as victims right and I mean we are also vulnerable to patriarchy we are vulnerable to all of these systems that are consistently telling us this is what a man is supposed to be this is what power is but I don't know if enough I don't know if we've hit a critical mass of men who know how to rationalize when we have been harmed and because of that it's always I'm going to get you I'm going to get you I'm going to get you which is also what perpetuates a lot of this abuse that happens because a lot of it is this is unchecked trauma this is unchecked bad behavior this is me copying somebody that I've seen do this before so this is the only way that I understand that power is gained this is the only way that I understand that conflict is resolved not saying that's everybody but a critical mass of us don't actually see ourselves as being able to be vulnerable but because of us no longer seeing ourselves as vulnerable we resent the rest of the world as men because we are also suffering from patriarchy in a very different kind of way but we also benefit from it so how do we deal with this single layer of being black but I'm still a man but I'm not getting all the benefits so I think there's one tension that exists there I think it's also having to understand as a community we don't get to continue to say what stays in our house stays in our house because we're also a space who says if you see something you have to say something right but if that is the case that means I need to feel safe enough to hold you account accountable without thinking that harm is going to come my way or be like well somebody else is going to handle it or we got to do this we are also a very individualist kind of society right now it's one of my biggest concerns I see as an educator as I work with students it is one of my biggest concerns because I'm like we are continuously messaging to kids and this is what I mean from a media standpoint we're not messaging Community do not Contin to message that we see that in small pockets of communities that exist because that's not up for display for everybody else to see all the time we're not always documenting this is community to come together that's why if you even look at the imagery of to pimp a butterfly if you look at the imagery of the pop out that's that's what community should feel like right there's attention there's complicated Natures of it there's conflict there's love there's Pride right and so when we think around all these elements together from a media standpoint we need the imagery messaged out more and more but we know and I know we talk talk to FD about it he has stuff about it we all talk around like we have to big beat this algorithm as content creators those of us who are trying to promote these positive messages are not getting promoted the way they need to be so I'm of the Mind of Men We need to unpack and other people who are in community with black men need to also see boys as victims and also susceptible to being harmed by the system and I think from a media standpoint we need to continue to have a concertive effort to flip an image of how black boys are being seen how we are talking about black men and then also this will then in my in an Ideal World in my mind this will hopefully lead to prevention less interpersonal and intercommunal violence which then allows everybody to say this is the standard we hold everybody to and we need to make sure that we are all holding to that standard and understanding in those moments of growth it's going to feel uncomfortable and all of us together have to renegotiate our relationship to conflict resolution renegotiate our relationship to ourselves who we see as victims and worthy of victimhood and then how we're unpacking ways that we've personally perpetuated oh we're going to silence this black child who may their reaction would result into being violent or would result into self harm because we're not even looking at like those rates of black men who are unal living themselves so this is like a larger conversation that feels complicated and will take a long time to overhaul yeah so it's it's it's that whole thing of it you know all of those things are beautiful right it's great and I wish that it could happen and be unpacked in one um in today's society like you were saying and how we know that when we try to have these type of conversations and kind of even try to um do it in a way where the push back won't be so major where because people will take it and not understand the complexities of it there are complexities to this like we understand that hey we love Kendrick um but we understand that him bringing this person out can be problematic or is not can be is problematic for the messaging right um and but having the conversation does it take away from us praising the fact that he's brought Community together um and he's done such a big thing by bringing two groups that are not usually together on stage and um bringing bring yeah and bringing bringing um bringing like a gatekeeping that needed to be there around hip hop again um and you know sparking that joy and love for the craft and the Artistry like it it's all those great things and then but there's these deeper conversations that we want to have but it's that um selective outrage it's like are we supposed to be angry about this or can we talk about this talk about the layers of it not be so angry but be able to talk about something and see if we can lead to a solution it don't go like that right now because everybody wants to be like oh if you make um a judgment against um Kendrick you hating on them you don't like them you trying to you ain't talking about what he did the community and we can do both we don't hate him but this is one of those things where we can have yeah this is one of those things where we can have the conversation and still let it lead somewhere else we can do it but no people are they have selective outrage for different things and if you speak on something and say you still like Kendrick Lamar but this is just kind of problematic and this is this is why it's problematic they already like oh you hating you don't even need to get you don't even get to talk about this situation they'll write you off so it's it's it's really tough in that space um and it's uncomfortable when we have these conversations I know once this gets hits the net they're gonna say that we're undoing stuff here they go you know she people ain't some of them ain't even really black black be having this conversation you know said I have to run I have another commitment but that's what I was going to say um in my parting remarks just in that I think it's worth mentioning that what Kendrick did was historic it was beautiful it's epic I want it on DVD if I have to get man at the gas station I want it ond listen the way that he was able to give a master class and and just the craft of mcing himself the way that he put on for his City show that he was tapped in in real organic ways with the people that he selected the way he was able to bring rivaling gang factions who have real active tension and nothing pop off before during or after and just to celebrate Black Culture in real authentic ways it was a cultural reset in a much needed way and we needed someone of his ability and of his stature to do something like that someone who was also connected to one of Hip Hop's most important cities too so all of those things coming together and then happening on juneth was a beautiful thing but that's also the beautiful thing about community that we can praise you we can celebrate you we can go up we was going up in my house watching that thing but we can also have listen the wife and I we was going crazy watching that thing to go to bed trying to watch this I was reading anon's tweets so five times yeah yeah but with that said though this is a needed conversation because D Barnes exists mishelle exist children whom Dre is harm exists and they are part of our community they are worthy of our attention and our protection and we have to stop excusing abuse and harm that is done to people particularly if we're going to continue forward as a community so o appreciate you having me on y'all thank you my good friend yes I think it's interesting I'm I'm thinking about my own um community I'm thinking about my own like family gatherings you know cookouts of [ __ ] and it's always some it's always a couple or a couple folks that you like and and I think what we're doing away with that is really courageous and really necessary is just the H sweeping it under the table not talking about it not addressing it you still can come but understand that we're going to lovingly hold a mirror up to you and ask you to do better I think what's that thing on Tik Tock say the weird thing oh I me on Ticky Tock but shout out to that I'm an older woman okay um but no yeah I think it's I think it's incredible and yeah and I I think that this is an example of how to how to love somebody as much as I love Kendrick and say bro something else to just consider and I know I got a lot to consider over here [ __ ] I know I do for my own self you know and and that's my saying I'm never like people should you know discard folk like I remember years back I think four years ago now one of my friends I grew up with um we a crew back home he is a an abuser like it's czy like he's an abuser and it's nuts what's nuts about it is right like if you didn't know him and like know him as a friend and know that information he is like God forgive me how this is going to sound he's very dumb like not like slow or anything just actually dumb like regular dumb person like a dumb guy like a hmbo he's dumb in a way that like if you're his friend like you you don't even he doesn't even seem intellectually capable of turning up on you like being mad like he be so Zone the out don't get it like he's a dummy you know what I mean and like our own personal I swear to God and he gets with these women bro like but he gets with these women he's romantically involved with and he turns into a demon when he is mad or whatever it's like I swear to you he reserves whatever AG or something for them and I remember I knew he was I knew he was because we had heard stories like he's our good friend we know stories from girls he uh he's dated earlier and earlier years that he's abused like in smaller instances but then he got married he married a woman and he was beating abusing the [ __ ] out her and again we all know this we're hearing the stories from her and between each we know it to be a fact and then um when she like finally like she went on like social media and and told everybody like she posted pictures of the abuse I remember instantly like calling all my male friends to like that are in that group to be like don't you start trying to like excuse it or start tap dancing like it's a mutual abuse don't do nothing crazy like I'm not saying we have to cut him off but we have to acknowledge that factually he's done everything that she says he's done and we have to deal with him like we have to like explicitly acknowledge that not water it down right and I remember I went I went to him first of all went to her first I like went to her checked on her offered me uh uh all my support you know with her and this and I remember when I spoke to him like listen love we love you let it out but you have a problem like don't even try like the first thing you need to not do is don't try and mitigate this like don't try and pretend like it's something else or put it on her or blah blah blah like none of that like we're not trying to discard you or get rid of you or anything like that or whatever but like you need to acknowledge this and I sent him this long thing and he was like really receptive and good to it or whatever in that conversation that we had and then the next thing I know I didn't real he like goes to the his his his wife who he was abusing who had left him and like tells her oh she was never a good friend like she always been hating on me and working against me and all this or whatever and he like blocked me on socials and we never we didn't talk in sense because I'm not going to run behind my abuser friend to like get in your good graces if you're not me because of whatever but I said that to say like I don't think we have to there's a world where I want you to pretend like I'm not a a person who pretends that you need to come on the internet and condemn your personal friend or that you need to cut all your friends off or when you Heir things with them but it does it is incumbent on you to like acknowledge that factually and try to be in a world with them where you work on that or they change or they something and if they don't they are those type of people you realize it's beyond you then then they are Beyond you but it can't be a world where your friend continues to be an abuser or be a piece of [ __ ] person and you want to keep them so you pretend not to know or you try to mitigate it or you do you know a song and dance with them we had to I you know I come from um I told you guys I've been abusive household right the person that birthed me is created me um is you know a former abuser and that's I ain't GNA just throw him away you know um that's that's can't love him love him to death but you know even having a conversation about it at first is great Ian he's like what you talking about that didn't happen that was crazy for me I'm like know you know you're not going to sit here but because in the culture also it wasn't a bad thing it was like that's how you correct your person and so having being here and raising you know Asian-American kids we seen it both sides so we had to be like no you know it's not good like that's that's not a good thing and so trying to have the conversation first there was denial and I'm like but I love them so much and I'm G to keep on seeing how we can um have the conversation in a way where he'll understand and be receptive to it so we kept working towards it instead of just because I remember I tried doing the throwing them away thing but I love him too much and so like I I did a year without talking to him and that hurt me that hurt me um and then finally you know went back in didn't go in immediately and was like you know we need to talk about this or I'm not going to know I just went back to trying to build that relationship and then finally got to a point where we were able to have that conversation it was very sensitive but it was open and he was receptive um not as I would want it to be but him being receptive and at least listening um was a big deal so I know if we're trying to get our community of people to have the conversation we can't be so quick to throw people away um and be able to have those conversations maybe walk away for a little bit and then you know have those conversations um in a different way than what we expect it to look like by just bringing it there and expecting somebody through yeah think even outside of outside of the theoretical and the hope of like what this could be the practice of it is so difficult right yeah like I I think around like even for me there now there I try my best to always engage in like restorative practices I do um because I I think it's important to model it but I know there's one person in my life who abused me when I was a kid that never gonna Beed right yeah because I was only receiving end of that piece and it was a kid from an adult right and so for me I'm just at the point where it's like I I don't need to see you anymore and that's my little s those are my younger siblings that's their father I refuse to to even have to be in the same room as him feel the need to forgive him I was blamed for some of his stuff and so I understand like the difficulty in what this is especially when they're in personal relationships even sometimes familial relationships seem to be a little bit more difficult because being with that person in and every day you're like well it's not every day is going to be like this right and so is this person worthy of redemption um and then the other piece I'm thinking around is like my navigation with that I said yeah I'm GNA do as much therapy as possible but that say what um versus like when I go do work in the prisons um I visit the Philadelphia prison every other Thursday and like talking to some of the youth it is so sad to see like how young they were when some of these crimes they committ and these are people who have attempted murder these are people who have successfully engaged in gun violence and stuff like that and it's it's so difficult because I'm like there is a space where I can see where Community has failed right has failed fa a child and now for us we are only going to discard them because we are now seeing the results of a failed Community or a failed upbringing and some spaces and so it's I've been in the space of trying to negotiate those truths of like who do I see as worthy of redemption do I see kids and harm done as children from young boys where there is redemption because some of them are just like committed to being like I got 20 years once that 20 years is done hopefully I am good um so I'm thinking around that kind of work that I've been engaging in and what it means for me to start soon working and building curriculum around working with currently incarc incarcerated people who are adults adult men and stuff like that and that it's making me reflect on even like those moments of like oh I can engage in these people because it's also like there's a distancing that almost happens that allows me to feel like I can do this a little bit easier so when I think around how we the practice of restorative justice is sometimes difficult when you on your end are on the receiving end of the harm right or the abuse and then trying to think around like but I believe kids are redeemable I believe everybody should have a chance until it was on my end and I was like ah [ __ ] that guy because I think right like it it's nuanced and it's really complicated because um I guess the way I see it with the whole like the topic of throwing away these people throwing them away as abusers the reason why I don't I there's a popular thing that happens online whenever I feel like whenever any kind of accusation happens the first thing the internet or I guess the larger world starts doing is policing all the people they know are closest to them like have you condemned this person have you cut them off have you thrown them away and I think that is such a terrible model because at the end of the day right like you we you as an individual can throw a person away out your life but you can't throw the people away they're still in the world and they're still in community and we're going to interact with other people and do harm to people and if there's nobody if the community or the support system that that person has that's the best bch the best shot we're going to have at those at anybody being able to like embrace them course correct them change them teach them anything right and I don't think and so I think it can be a dangerous model to think like you okay you condemn them and you send them off into the world to like interact with everybody with nothing um having happen but too that being said I don't think the people that are obligate that are the on the receiving ends of these people's abuse have any obligation of any kind to keep them in their life or to or to forgive them and I also don't necessarily think that should be where we look to as our model for whether or not restorative justice is happen or what we do as a community to respond to them because I think you know um I think you're never going to make a most of your victims are never going to be made whole like like even if you were everybody did what they were supposed to do a victim can simply never be able to forgive you or never find you genuine or never embrace you and that's their right you know what I mean that's their right and that does that should not be whether or not a victim forgives you shouldn't become the criteria for whether or not you still need to do more or you still need to try or you need to whatever and people can have a mentality like oh there's nothing that person they can do to please that person so it you know what I mean or they don't have to do anything or whatever have you and I think that's not the case I think two things can happen where you acknowledge and hold space and and respect for how a victim feels and never diminish that or anything like that while also still having your own separate communal standard for for restorative justice and and this person can either meet it or they don't right so when I think of like a Dr Dre like I know D Barnes personally I I spoke to her but I'm not going to speak for her I'm going to talk to her like next month or on her own individual and let her talk but I what I I don't think there he's never tried to Dr Dre has never tried to to to make D Barnes whole to to atone for his wrongs there's never been any restorative justice or anything like that but I also don't know that if he did he could and I think that's her right you know what I mean what she has been done and what she's been wrong and I also think if if there was a world where he had continued to not be an abuser if he had engaged in restorative justice if he had earned the Forgiveness of the community if he had changed I think it would be okay there's a world where the community could accept him or forgive him even while still having respect for D Barn's position now that's not the world we live in he hasn't toned on any front you know what I mean whether it be to D or to the community or his own changed actions but if you see what I'm saying y'all like uh as far as I think multiple things can I multiple things can happen I don't think victims are required to and survivors are not required to get on on board with whatever the community is deciding you know what I mean or if the community forgives they have to forgive right but I also think the community can can respect that position and also still create their own standards and we need to for what these people need to do to be able to be invited back into Community even if they will never be forgiven by the people they can never make right what they've done to the people that they've abused yeah oh okay well bars I guess I to show y'all no that no that was it there ain't much more to say after that I mean I I hope and pray Dr Dre does is able to do some real work on itself because whatever demons he fighting he hates himself it's evident yeah like he can get up there and rap and do all that but bro it's something I maybe yeah personally he's probably effed up his home his thought process everything is probably just not good there's no in my humble opinion if you are able to inflict that type of pain on somebody and you can't regulate your nervous system enough to like calm your [ __ ] down and you do it repeatedly imagine the turmoil the disease that he is walking around and function functioning with and then being praised when like I know he goes home and hates himself I that's what a prison like right what a wish it on my worst enemy they love to bring that eneme that that [ __ ] out for an award they love to suddenly just honor they gr like I feel like they find new ways to honor him imagine being that sick and then going up and smiling and being this this Beacon of light for everybody and then when you get when you get back home under your covers you got all this [ __ ] around you it's Glitz it's glamour you look like everything's great and then them demons demons I mean look at them it's it's real tricky over there I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy that's that's a sad life to live but you know and I think I think that there's a lot I mean just the fact that Kendrick worked with with top the way he did after the things happened with top and his pop and like just understanding the complexities of The Human Experience I think that that's also something that's very interesting to Kendrick so maybe there there is another side that that he sees that we don't know about who the knows but all I know the privilege priv of men is that the privilege of men is that we see each other as human we don't see we don't see women as human like I think we can also just like name the thing a thing too and so it's just like if he's yeah if he's discarded then you can discard me in the same way right so that means what so I think that's the other piece we like I can talk around this piece all the time but I'm like I can see the humanity in another person because even if we start off the episode the immediate thing I was able to name is like let's look at the humanity of what Kendrick represents rather than immediately being able to condemn right away like I'm able to contextualize and try to make sense of how men work and so it gives me the space where maybe I won't immediately just be like no get the out of here right and so I think it's also important to recognize for us as men and those and men who are watching this is like um make sure that we're also checking how we are quick to humanize each other but in that try to space of humanizing each other we're throwing away those who may be harmed and so that's the message that we continue to send so I think from a media standpoint from a Humane standpoint it's continuously recognizing when you are on these large platforms though it's not it was not Kendrick's intent maybe right to say I'm honoring Legacy but the impact is you sent a message out to say this is still permissible behavior and I'm still going to honor this man despite what his legacy actually entails his entire Legacy and acknowledging that entire thing so I think that's the last piece I would really hope like as we get into this conversation around restorative justice transformational justice what does it mean to be redeemed remember in that space of remp and that journey of redemption does not mean that you get to ignore the harm that was done and so yeah as men I urge a lot of us us to quick just internalize and check ourselves before jumping to quickly defend because of our own anxieties around being disposable right particularly black men oo a bar okay real rap bars [Music]
