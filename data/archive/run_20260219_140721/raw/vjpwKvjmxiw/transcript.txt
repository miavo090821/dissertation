greetings and salutations loyal viewers of this channel my name is Sean and today we're going to cover an absolutely classic tyt meltdown because Alexandria Casio Cortez the congresswoman that they helped put into Power with Justice Democrats an organization started by Jen yuger and Kyle kolinsky together recently said that she is with Joseph R Biden and Jank has been itching to replace him for a very long time well before his recent debate performance so is absolutely enraged that all of the Democrats are falling behind Joe Biden and the absolutely amazing thing about this is that even though Joe Biden looked terrible in that debate even though he looks like he definitely has some form of dementia even though he looks like he's way too old to be president of the United States Jen is still wrong in his analysis so that's what we're going to talk about today but before we get into that thank you to everybody who supports this channel via actual Justice warrior.com jooin oh give me the money give you give me the money okay you ready for some breaking news that will surely disappoint you of course so Ryan Noble's reporting on X representative AOC tells us she spoke with President Biden over the weekend and it's time to end the speculation over his future quote Joe Biden is our nominee he is not leaving this race he is in this race and I support him oh there's more there's more so first of all right off the bat I am absolutely elated that Alexandria Casio Cortez has decided to throw her support behind Joe Biden because you could just see the anger the upset the disdain from The Young Turks panel right here and even though Anna is my literal bestie the fact of the matter is I do have to take some joy in this because Jen has put so much into the Justice Democrats into these real progressives and he is surprised that they act just like Progressive candidates that he has supported in the past I know a lot of people were angry that Bernie Sanders ended up endorsing Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden but Bernie always endorses the Democratic nominee so it should be unsurprising that the students of Bernie Sanders also follow suit and bend the knee to the president not to mention the fact that again I'm going to explain to you in great detail how Jen huger's arguments are completely wrong and they actually should be getting behind Joe Biden because it's the only choice they have if all you care about is winning the election I know a lot of people are saying replacing Joe Biden would be the best move but it's absolutely not true as I will explain to you throughout the course of this video oh there's more there's more now what I think is critically important right now is that we focus on what it takes to win in November because he is running against Donald Trump everybody would be running against Donald Trump they they make it seem like Joe Biden is the only one who gets to run against Donald Trump you know a Democrat a generic Democrat that will start with 10 points higher lead is also running against Trump except would be 10 points higher so look I progressives are sticking with Biden more than establishment Democrats are it doesn't matter you'll get blamed anyway at the end of the election but why why are they doing it because I think that they don't know strategy at all they're just flumix by strategy if you tell AOC strategies you'll like how dare you first of all you got to love Jen's overreactions over enunciations and absolute panic and you also got to enjoy the fact that he is pointing out something that we all knew for a very long time the moment that we saw Alexandria Casio Cortez which is that she's not a strategic thinker even though at this moment in time somebody in her ear is likely a strategic thinker because Jen is like oh well a generic Democrat pulls 10 points ahead of Joe Biden therefore they should definitely replace them but the fact of the matter is those generic Democrats or generic Republican polls don't stand up to scrutiny when you actually have a candidate's name attached to that on top of that while the Democrats might have some prospective candidates and by the way this is a criticism that Jen has leveled before he even ran for president because there was no real primary against Joe Biden the fact of the matter is none of these candidates who are any good who could win a Democratic primary are going to sign up for this last minute replacement move because they think that they have a future in 2028 I mean think about it if if you're Gretchen Whitmer and you think you can be president and you can win the nomination outright in a clean way in 2028 why would you sacrific your political career for a Longshot Victory which is what it would be by the way if you replace Biden in some shady way at the convention if you're Gavin Nome the same thing but on top of that you also have the problem of Cala Harris's home state being California so you would have to replace both ends of the ticket and of course we have Camala Harris who's an absolute doofus in every possible way one of the most pandering absurd politicians that you could possibly have remember my video on her little be thing and remember what I said about her and collard greens you know because she she she likes to cook with them allegedly and yeah you you don't really have anyone that is willing to take this position that is any good and again you will likely lose the election if you swap Brien in fact it is almost a guaranteed 100% loss if you swap Biden but you have a minuscule chance or at least some level of a chance if you keep him in the race and don't take this from me take this from a guy who's been successful in predicting presidential elections for years and years in this country a better track record than any political pundit because he made it absolutely clear Alan lickman is a presidential historian known for the 13 keys to the White House a forecasting system that has been used to successfully predict nine of the last 10 elections to him it is still the best bet for Democrats to have Biden stay in the race so yeah this guy has a metric one of his metrics is the incumbent Advantage for presidents and he has pointed out that if Biden were to leave for any other candidate they would lose that advantage and almost guaranteed to lose the election the 13 keys to the White House are 13 true false questions pertaining primarily to the strength and performance of The White House Party where an answer of true always favors stability if six or more of the keys are false we have earthquakes if fewer than six are false we have stability however if Biden were to exit the race two of the 13 Keys would automatically be in Jeopardy the incumbency key whether or not the incumbent candidate is the sitting president and the contest key which looks at whether there is competition within the incumbent party for the nomination Biden running checks off two keys right Biden steps aside they lose obviously the incumbency and it's not at all clear that there wouldn't be a big party fight so again this is some who's been correct a whole bunch of times as compared to Jen yuger who says oh I predicted Hillary Clinton would lose in 2016 which congratulations for that but you also predicted that Joe Biden wouldn't win in the primaries or in the general election and you were wrong about that on both accounts meanwhile I predicted Biden would not only win in the Democratic primaries but I predicted that he would win because of black voters and specifically turn it around in South Carolina and I predicted this a year out from the South Carolina primary but nobody comes to me for analysis even though I've been the most disc correct except for all the times that I've been wrong which are quite notable first of all she should have never given him the endorsement in the first place she should have used it as leverage to get something anything how about something as simple as paid family leave that pulls at 84% at least have him in pressure uh Schumer to introduce it in the Senate these are layups but they hate using their leverage and I'm sorry I I love B but it starts with Bernie he never ever uses his leverage so Jen says oh if she's going to endorse him she should at least used her leverage to get something like paid family leave that according to the Topline polling polls at 84% now we've talked about on this channel so many times how Topline polling numbers don't really mean anything they don't actually indicate support from the American people because if you put something in a poll that sounds really nice people will support it but when you get to the nitty-gritty of actually trying to Institute it in terms a policy It ultimately ends up falling apart how many people thought we needed healthc care reform under the Obama Administration but when he actually passed said Healthcare reform what ended up happening he lost a thousand seats in State legislatures lost the Congress had all sorts of problems post that piece of legislation and really wasn't able to accomplish almost anything after that that's because the Topline polling of we need Healthcare reform is not good enough because anytime you touch that particular issue you end up dying politically secondly he talks about Ocasio Cortez using her leverage she has no leverage the idea that she is going to endorse Trump or some other candidate is just not true she's never going to do that so whether she formally endorses Joe Biden or not that's not going to move the needle on a single voter the real reason that Jen is angry by the way is because of the whole Israel Palestine thing he doesn't like how in his view Biden is too pro- Israel so he's looking for a reason to attack Joe Biden he's also trying to be correct in this instance by saying oh he's going to lose the election so he could say he called it later but the fact of the matter is Jen has been very hit or miss when it comes to election predictions he was talking about Hillary winning by the way day of the election even though he said he predicted it before that he just made both predictions and then when it comes to Joe Biden he again said that he was definitely going to lose right instead they go here have it have it have it and what happens you think that helps the minute they get a chance they're going to bury you anyway if you're not sure call Jamal Bowman and see how it turned out for him so this is a terrible strategy of stick with Biden to the end then the progressives look like they're the ones that are holding on to a incompetent guy who's going to lose to Donald Trump why would you do that the establishment Democrats or the losers who don't know how to govern this party this is what progressiv should be saying at the top of their lungs we told you not about not to just rub it in no guys strategically now again I'm not somebody who praises progressives or anything like that or progressiv members of Congress they happen to be among the worst in a lot of regards in my opinion but the fact of the matter is like I said before it is actually a good strategy to double down on Biden because the Democrats don't have any choice like I said they are likely to lose the election 100% if they swap Biden according to actual experts who have been correct on the predictions and according to basic logic and with Biden they at least have some monom of a chance we told you when they picked the establishment leader in 2016 Hillary Clinton and they pretended they knew what they were doing that they didn't know anything and they lost to a buffoon named Donald Trump and we told you that Joe Biden was not the right guy in 2024 and we were right again but instead of being right instead of taking the victory she's finding a way to snatch defeat from the jaws of Victory so Jen says we told you Biden is not the right guy in 2024 and they were wrong and again if you would have had a primary system where maybe Joe Biden lost the primary the Democrats probably end up losing that election anyway then you can make that argument but at this point in time the only strategy is to double down on Biden especially when he says he's absolutely 100% not leaving which by the way I said he was definitely not leaving I don't understand how anyone can just ignore what the data is telling us about Biden's chance CH es of beating Donald Trump it's like they they're just ignoring all of that no anyone this is a stone cold fact he's look Nate silver is screaming this at the top of his lungs just like I am because we understand numbers we've been doing we've been in politics for 25 to 30 years no get this through your heads no incumbent in the 40s is likely to win an election they are very very unlikely if they're in the' 40s no incumbent in the 30s in an election year has ever won ever in American history so look Biden's approval rating and his numbers are very low his polling numbers are not good it looks like Donald Trump is running a clean election to win his second term but the fact of the matter is Trump is a very polarizing candidate I know a lot of people absolutely love him out there in my audience but if you had a different Republican against Joe Biden I would say it is definitely lock for that person to win depending on who it is of course but the fact of the matter is Trump of all people because he's so polarizing can drive negative people out to vote against him that is something that other Republicans just don't have the ability to do so this can ultimately end up aiding Joe Biden and again we are going to see some level of a convention bump in August for him and we will see what goes down during the second debate after he has secured the nomination so even though I understand the numbers that Jen is bringing up I understand that Biden is very unlikely to win reelection with his polling numbers in a standard situation it's not really a standard situation because Trump was president before he's also an incumbent he has a record and again he is one of the most polarizing and toxic people to the Democratic voting base and they are likely to come out to vote against him no matter what so even if it was like that oh my God we got Andy Basher and he's like maybe we don't agree with all his possible but my God he's won as a Democrat twice in Kentucky and he's got these super popular things even he would struggle to make up this kind of a deficit okay even the most dynamic greatest Democrat or any politician would struggle to make up this kind of deficit but Biden's going to he's going to stabilize then make up 16 points in approval he was at 52 when he barely won he's at 36 now do you understand politics at all and I'm sorry but progressives in Congress demonstrate every single day that they do not understand politics that is correct I totally agree with you on that so Jen right now is saying that the progressives in Congress don't understand politics but the funny thing is is while this is true while we saw that when Ocasio Cortez introduced things like the green New Deal and all these other absurd pieces of legislation the fact of the matter is the only move for Democrats once Biden says he's refusing to leave the race is to back him it is the only politically Savvy maneuver that you can have and Biden is somebody who is not likely to listen to someone who ends up selling him down the river or has sold him down the river in the past one of the reasons why the Obama people and the Clinton people cannot get into the Biden camp and convince him to leave is because these very same people and Barack Obama himself didn't back Joe Biden in 2016 when he thought he should have had the support of his president and his president's former campaign staff so Biden didn't run in 2016 he essentially gave the nomination to Hillary Clinton despite the fact that he thought he would do better in a bunch of Midwestern states with workingclass white voters which by the way is likely to be true and could have won in 2016 but because all these people aligned against him then he's upset about that CU Hillary ultimately ended up losing he played the role of a subservient Democrat who bent the knee to another candidate and it didn't work out for the party so then when he ran in 2020 he decided that he was just going to go despite what anybody said and by the way Obama in 2020 despite the leftwing conspiracies about Bloody Monday where Obama called all the candidates and forced them to drop out he did not actually have the backing of Barack Obama again you can read the book lucky how Joe Biden barely won the presidency you'll find the documentation to all of this you'll find statements from CEOs black CEOs that Obama met with he was pitching Elizabeth Warren so was the New York Times They gave that double endorsement to Elizabeth Warren and Amy kachar and this is because that is who they thought was the appropriate air parent to the party so when you see people from the obam camp who didn't back Biden until after he locked down the nomination who didn't back Biden in 2016 when he thought he had a good chance of being president and you wonder why he's not listening to them you wonder why he's not listening to the New York Times that is the reason why because these people have essentially betrayed or wronged Joe Biden in the past the Joe Biden Camp even if he's not all there the people that are surrounding him and they don't want to bend the knee to them especially when they've been proven wrong before and they are because they're cowards let's call a spade a spade okay let's call it what they are Hakeem Jeff Chuck Schumer total cowards like oh what does the leader say we bow to you 36% you don't mind losing to Trump every person right now that's saying Biden should be the Nomine is saying I don't care about losing to Trump at all look Biden said another lie in one of these interviews he said oh people doubted me in 2020 that's not remotely true okay right and oh I was losing in no you weren't look people love to rewrite history of the 2020 Democratic primaries pretend that Joe Biden was a Shuan but remember he was limping into South Carolina after terrible finishes in the first three states Iowa New Hampshire and Nevada and guess what he was also out of money because Bloomberg ended up entering the race and although he wasn't taking the big money donors he convinced them to not spend any money to see if Bloomberg would actually have a chance not to mention this guy was pillaging staff and the way that he convinced them in order to join his team and the DNC to not back any other candidate was he offered them this sophisticated data model in order to buy off their support so he could have a shot and he was still in the race in super Tuesday he got more votes than did Elizabeth Warren who people think screwed over Bernie Sanders and Biden broke and short staffed still beat them all Biden who didn't even have campaign offices in various states that he won on super Tuesday ended up demolishing every other candidate and securing the nomination then people came to back Biden then they jumped on board and I understand that cloar and Budaj ended up endorsing them earlier than that but the fact of the matter is they had no likely choice because these were people who had 0% black support and we were going into all the states where the majority of Democratic primary voters happen to be black people which Biden had a lock on so yeah Jen can scream and cry all he wants about them backing Joe Biden and Biden not backing down but he actually has logical reasons or at least members of his team that are running the show because I do believe Biden is in cogntive Decline have logical reasons for doing so they have a track record for wanting to back this guy and it makes sense for not only Joe Biden but for the Democratic party if all they care about is the chance of winning the 2024 election for for them to stay now Jen is going to break down the dire polling numbers look you have to face it it does not look good for Biden as of right now so at this point in the race in 2020 at this exact time Biden was up by nine points and he barely won with 44,000 votes in three swing States I know he was up by nine he's now down by 3 to six do you understand that's impossible no you don't that's the thing if your average Layman I don't blame you at all how are you supposed to know what's impossible and possible in politics it's like saying oh can you unclog that to how do you know you're not a plumber right I mean I so okay but this but everyone who knows politics Ezra Klein David ax James carille uh Nate silver myself look we don't agree on policy but we all agree on numbers but even with that going into this Shady scheme where you're going to try to swap them at the convention build up name recognition and not look like crazy conspiracy stuff is going to be a disaster for the Democratic party on top of that Trump is going to talk Non-Stop about how he knocked the president of the United States of America out of the race with just one debate he's going to take that Victory and run rough shot over whatever third tier Democratic candidate they're going to put up because again Gavin Nome Gretchen Whitmer anybody who thinks they have a shot at the 2028 nomination is not in any way shape or form going to sacrifice that for this hell marry win because none of these people actually believe that the evil orange man is going to end democracy as we know it it's not true it's not remotely true maybe some of the dumb people who believe it are people like Alexandri oi Cortez and that's why she's backing Joe Biden but the fact of the matter is outside of that people with rational brains don't actually buy into this but you know what those are just my thoughts I want to know what you guys think down in the comments below and I want to know if you believe that I'm not only right that Biden's not leaving but this actually gives the Democrats as of right now the best chance to win if you like this video then show them by leaving a like subscribe for more content follow me on my social media support me via support links in the description of this video this has
