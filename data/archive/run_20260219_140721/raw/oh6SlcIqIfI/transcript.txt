so fox news had tom cotton on to fear monger about china and this is just a perfect example of pro-imperialist propaganda and how these private media outlets have state officials on to just launder state department propaganda and nonsense and xenophobia about china so let's watch this and then we'll discuss or he's not going to do the way trump did it but he hasn't even called him yet the first visitor that president trump had in mar-a-lago was the president of china so what message is he supposed to get in china because they have not slowed up at all good morning brian no they haven't i'm glad to see joe biden singing a different tune now you know the campaign he said the chinese leadership weren't bad folks and that they weren't our competitors of course they're our most dangerous and long-term strategic competitor but to simply rebuke president trump for being the first president in two generations to stand up to the chinese communist party and say he's going to do it differently without specifying how he's going to do it differently is not a show of strength look it was a year ago this week that i started demanding investigations into the labs and wuhan and whether they could have been the source for the plague that china unleashed on the world you know the media at the time hyperventilated that i was spouting conspiracy theories now they're admitting it's plausible and needs to be investigated meanwhile a year later we're still dealing with a fall on here in america our schools are closed and kids are not getting educated in no small part because of chinese communist malevolence and negligence all right so if any chinese folks are watching this and this is your first experience with u.s mainstream media now you know that u.s corporate media allows people to come on and just launder ridiculous conspiracy theories um and provide no pushback at all here obviously the media had tom cotton on private media having a state official come on without providing any pushback obviously not supposed to be the role of the media i really don't even have to say that with fox news um obviously pretty much everyone in america who hasn't been living with their head under a rock understands that fox news is um the propaganda arm of the republican party as cnn and msnbc are um for the democratic party so what's tom cotton mad about here first of all he's mad that biden said that the leaders of china aren't bad folks um and tom cotton would like to let you know that actually no uh the entire country of china 1.4 billion people they are all evil and they all hate the us and they are all planning to subvert our country um wanting peaceful relations with another nation especially another nuclear superpower that is something tom cotton is strongly against as are all the neocons mike pompeo sean hannity a series of neocons have all been doing segments on fox news since biden's been elected saying biden you better be tough on china you better crack down on china and this is a joe biden who said he is going to form a multilateral effort among the us and their allies to put maximum pressure on china but apparently for these bloodthirsty neocons that isn't enough baida needs to be threatening warfare he needs to be threatening sanctions um it's not enough to say he's gonna put a multilateral effort to meddle in another country's affairs um he needs to overtly declare that that country is an enemy and why so why is it so important to tom cotton to recognize the evil of china is it that china was the only country whose gdp and economy grew over the covet pandemic um no that couldn't be it is it because china is doing uh the belt road initiative and doing development deals with countries like iran and venezuela who the u.s has been trying to destroy no that can't be it is it the fact that china just signed the world's largest trade deal in history um and it excluded the us uh that couldn't be it that couldn't be what the neocons are upset about it's the fact that that china lied and not only did they lie about covet but tom cotton accuses them of making coven in a lab saying that at first it was a conspiracy but now there's all this evidence uh coming out saying that kovid was cooked up in a lab in wuhan where tom uh where's this evidence because right now if you google covet deaths you're going to find about 10 000 deaths in china a country with a population of 1.4 billion and you're going to find stories about how they built hospitals um in a matter of days in the areas where the outbreak was worse they did mass tracing um the government nationalized wages and made sure people were paid while they had to be home from work because you can't just cancel the economy and then not give people any money because that doesn't work because people need money to survive which is what we did in the us where instead of having 10 000 people die with a much smaller population we had 400 000 people die and now uh meat packing workers are suing the fda or sorry suing osha because they were forced to stand side by side without any ppe in america and then our government agency osha would come in to regulate this and they would call the businesses ahead ahead of time this is this happened in multiple meat packing plants or osha they're supposed to come unannounced right so they can investigate what's going on and osha was calling ahead of time saying hey we're going to come investigate today so the meatpacking plants would have people stand six feet apart have them put on the ppe osha would come investigate they'd leave and they'd say oh all right no more pve back to business as usual so we can keep putting out as much meat as we're used to a bunch of people got covered bunch of people died and and this happened countrywide nationwide now we have four hundred thousand kova deaths the most of anywhere um and we're projecting it on to china you know the u.s um state department has no way to grasp or cope with their failure other than do what they always do blame a u.s state enemy um 400 000 people in the u.s died it's china's fault you hear them say here the schools are closed and it's because of communist party subversion oh really tom cotton then why are the schools open in china and why are the schools open in vietnam and why are the schools open in cuba and they had a tiny fraction of the amount of deaths we had why why are the schools open there but not in america i mean this is capitalist projection to the utmost degree our schools are unopened and 400 000 people are dead and we look at communist china who has 10 000 people dead or yeah or something like that much less than the u.s like it's your fault you must have cooked the lat or you must have cooked the virus up in a lab and given it to us uh because uh china is just a giant evil communist um place that's just trying to subvert the us it couldn't have been you know that a cap the capitalist mode of production is just not set up to handle a pandemic right it couldn't have been that it couldn't have been that uh the us government doesn't care about workers and it's so thoroughly owned by the rich that they couldn't even think of providing minor worker pain or protections during a global pandemic it couldn't be that it's all china so i want to point this out because over the next four four years of joe biden the neocons and fox news are going to be trying to push him to do intervention in china because china is threatening the the profits of a lot of the donors of these people like i said fastest growing economy in the world and they are communist and they are centrally planned and they have talked about moving towards socialism and they just signed the world's largest trade deal in history without the united states you know the first time the united states has been left out of a deal like that and they're scared and usually they're not pushing openly for war with a with a power as great as china you know with a country with uh nuclear capacity but but here you see it you know um because if they're threatening the us profit motive um there's nothing they won't do and there's there's no amount of people they won't sacrifice to make sure their their profits stay high so if that means war with china that's what they're going to do i mean i'm sure that's what these people want i'm sure that's what tom cotton is trying to do with his cenophobic racist xenophobic disgusting conspiracy theories that he's allowed to spread on on the most popular cable news network in america fox news um you know i'm sure these people want war with china um and we need to watch out for that on the left you know there's already people on the left calling for sanctions on china calling for intervention against china you know they're the the worst they're the new hitler you know the playbook we hear every single time when the u.s state department wants us to invade another country so see through this nonsense um block fox news and cnn on your parents tv or just explain to them how it's just pro-war propaganda um and tom cotton if you're watching this you are a xenophobic piece of garbage and you need to cope with your own failures and stop trying to project them onto the country of china all right peace out everyone i hope you liked this video [Music] you
