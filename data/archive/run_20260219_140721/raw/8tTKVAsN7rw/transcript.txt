hello everyone and welcome to the probably canceled podcast in Coalition with the midwestern marks Institute my name is Bridget and I'm your host and today I'm here with the 2024 presidential candidate Dr Shiva I'm super glad to have you here today how are you doing I'm doing good Bridget how are you I'm super great I am so happy that you took time out of your busy schedule to come on the show I actually tweeted a couple days ago saying you know I've never voted in a presidential election in my life because you know I I really honestly believe that it's all rigged so I never took the time to vote but I said you know I'm considering voting for Dr Shiva and you know I got some people approving I got a little bit of push back but then I got a DM in my message box of somebody from your team asking hey do you want to have Dr she on your show and I said that's awesome cuz I've actually been meaning to have you on for a while now and we're running really close to the wire the election is coming up in about two weeks as we're recording this so I'm really happy to have you here welcome welcome bridgid where would you like to start and uh yeah I think um one of the things I think Heather does you know our team does is we actually look for people who are independent truly independent minded people who are actually curious um on the social media now there's a lot of people you know people called grifters they just gri from one topic to another in fact they express views but it looks like they have no intention of ever doing anything about their views there's a big dichotomy with the theory or the things that they talk about and the fact that they actually don't want to do anything and that in itself is in my view the Edward bernes model of advertising which is precisely what the establishment are as I call the Swarm wanted it people to do they wanted just people to be entertained never to do anything um exactly so it's a phenomenon you may have seen with this doofus guy called Nick Fuentes I don't know if you know this guy oh my God yeah unfortunately I know who that is he's a complete [ __ ] fool uh last year a guy called Kanye West reached out to me um and he wanted to he said oh Dr Shiva I've heard a lot about you because I'm thinking of running for president this was in in 2023 early and I and I wasn't even thinking about where this is early 2023 and I said well Kanye if if you want to do anything you have to learn politics you have to understand political Theory you have to have a framework I said okay okay I want to learn from you he goes you know all my songs Jay-Z taught me about my songs and I learned because I want to come from you and I want to plagiarize from you I said okay I said but you have to learn some Theory so he said okay I'm G to get on my Jet and I'm going to be there tomorrow well he never showed up and the reason he didn't show up is Nick Fuentes told him not to show up oh my God 25 whatever stupid fool and if you look at this idiot's life he just talks a lot sit on the sidelines and he went from Laura lumer who's a rabid Zionist then hung around with this uh stop the steel guy who [ __ ] up a lot of people on January 6 Ali Alexander then he goes over supporting Trump and in his latest rant he thinks he's he should actually support kamla Harris so this is what happens when you don't have a framework and a lot of the young people these days are following these fools who have nothing and they ultimately Corral people to aism you see yeah a cynicism of not to do anything that is very very different Bridget from where I've been at because I've had to come Bottoms Up and I've been a very very curious student of revolutionary politics since I was probably four years old since I experienced the cast system growing up in India so this is not like entertainment for me this is very personally real and has been real to me and all the people that are in my life you know everyday working people now I was fortunate to have access to certain knowledge ability to think through these things from an engineering standpoint you see from really looking at it from a very um not an armchair philosopher standpoint and that led me through a series of experiences series of you know scholarly work to recognize that if you know if you look at the Arc of human history people trying to understand understand how the oppressed overcomes the oppressor um people have tried all sorts of things you know anarchos syndicalism right Marxism leninism Classical liberalism right fascism you can go down the list um and I studied all of these teachings as best as I could but most of this stuff was defined by people or philosophers or economists or journalists uh or lawyers right rarely were people who let's say were engineers or plumbers or electricians involved in this kind of framework or thinking so I left off where you know Marx in many ways um did a very good retrospective analysis of historical materialism Lenin appar uh attempted to apply that in Russia in a feudal environment um and he put forward some of it analysis and state Revolution which is still a great piece of work the problem was that after the Russian Revolution took place and the leninists were in fact successful um I think Lenin towards the latter part of his life realized that you cannot have change in any one country and you would really have to have proletarian internationalism like you can't have revolution in one place um and I sort of and then you go read The Works of Adam Smith or Thomas Payne right um and that was in a different time period as feudalism was converting you know on its way to still in its early stages or in its later stages right so my view was that um how do you actually have change take place um recognizing that whenever you try to centralize a change right things blow up you know what I'm saying so now the anarch or syndicalist say let things just occur but system science which is a science of engineering system science which really emerged in the early 1900s so you can't really blame a lot of these revolutionary thought leaders of the time wherever they were because they actually didn't have the science I can't you can't really go blaming people who try to fly airplanes and crashed and killed themselves until Bern principl came along so there has not been a scientific framework for actual change using modern um science and that only emerged in the 1900s so you can't really blame some of these guys they did the best they could right what I uncovered was at a deep fundamental level engineering system science can go beyond where a lot of these people were attempting to work and that really developed a whole framework which I uncovered that these the modern system science is interesting enough it matches one to one and you're going to find this sort of in a completely different domain in ancient system systems of U medicine where they actually describe the body as a whole system so there emergence of system science and these systems uh parameters you can apply to anything your body uh Microsystems large systems all scale systems it's it's um you know multiscale and the net of it is after I made this discovery I taught it as a course at MIT for many years was published um and then I realized that this really needed to be taken to the masses because I didn't really want to just teach this to a bunch of system science at mit2 I actually use it to oppress people if you look at zjf brzinsky or Kissinger or the Kennedy School or Harvard or these institutions um they use the science of systems to manipulate in a large scale this is how the few are able to control the many if you saw the little video I did called shatter the Swarm Bridget so my goal was because I've always been interested in shattering the Swarm and in things is that where Lenin got certain things right there other things he didn't get right because he didn't have the physics or the science which was self-organizing systems and so our goal is we are educating people on the Dynamics of how systems work all people of all different backgrounds typically everyday working people electricians plumbers School teachers nurses and now we've created a global movement you know when Co came out I was the first guy who exposed Expos Co for what it really was March of 2020 where booby [ __ ] Kennedy Jill Zin or Trump were all promoting lockdowns for example because these people just go with the wind they wait it's always too little too late after the damage is done so during that period in 2020 you know we developed a significant amount of trust and confidence to across a half a billion people in the world just by looking at the unique video views and posts Etc and then when I ran for Senate in 2020 that's when the censors hit us and I was the one who discovered the fact that the government has a backdoor portal into Twitter and all the social media companies long before [ __ ] Carlson or Glenn Greenville in fact those guys intentionally concealed our work we can talk more about that and I won a major federal lawsuit representing myself where we showed that government has a backdoor censorship portal to all the social media companies and that was used to throw me off Twitter when I exposed the fact that they had deleted ballot images in my own election anyway the reason I'm sharing that is he was during that period of 2020 that we gained significant traction and our movement really began the movement for truth freom and health and that's when um the sensors decided they really needed to do a lot of Shadow Banning and they started really putting us back on the platforms but concealing us you see it's in it's censorship 10.0 but nonetheless the reality is that the real change is not going to come from social media influencers talking it's going to come from bottom BS up movements that have frankly not been major events major movements have not happened in the United States particularly since the 1970s when the left wi and the right wi took over all the unions so that's one feature that's important that we are doing so my running for president gives people the opportunity to really see what a real bottoms up leader looks like not someone chosen from Top you talked to people in the green party Jill Stein bunch of people went into a back room and anointed her and she's design a scumbag she's a climate scam carbon tax Plantation owner and now she's dangling quote unquote reparations to manipulate black people the reties The Establishment has a very interesting systems Dynamic it's it's it's almost you could look look at it as as simple as any other system in nature a dynamic and that Dynamic is they have two heads the obvious scumbags the obvious establishment but the obvious establishment cannot survive without that another head which is the not so obvious establishment and once you chop off the not so obvious establishment they cleverly spawn a new one so in 2020 we had to expose booby Kennedy for what he really is he's a complete Zionist he's a [ __ ] scumbag and I know him on a personal level okay and I had to do the Dirty Work of exposing him in 2020 we lost about 20% of our followers because he convinces a lot of women to suck his dick and follow him okay in fact he was banging a lot of the antivaxers that just came came out because people are so enamored by the kennedies some God awful reason you know oh man he's on the EP he's like on epine flight logs multiple at least three times and yeah he actually said I believe yeah but more importantly we had one of his very close Associates who shared the video where he's saying I believe in full vaccination of all Americans and then he goes on to then talk talks about how corrupt the CDC is and how he's going to fix it and then he supports Trump who's out there doing his act on McDonald's McDonald's burgers and their foods are some of the worst right totally on the blackmail the Mad blackmail list like big time cuz you know and I I really liked Bobby I really liked his listening to his podcast I think he's he is an encyclopedic knowledge type of guy he really knows his stuff and then he claims to be anti-war and then supports the genocide and Gaza and not only no but you have to understand that everything that comes out of his mouth is plagiarized you go look at his entire history declare your Independence was our campaign slogan he stole it he comes he sends literally Bridget people to our Zoom events word for word copies our stuff and does videos when he was at Harvard first of all you know he couldn't have gotten in he said he boasted about just putting the Kennedy name his roommate wrote a senior thesis for him and won the award so these people are parrots they're actors Trump is an actor these people are actors right they've never done anything so to the extent he sounds good that's what he wants you to think he's intelligent but he's a dope and he really lost me well the thing is it's interesting people call him Bobby like as though they know him why do people call him Bobby because his dad I mean didn't people call his dad I know but but it's interesting right how they get the the level of psychological manipulation as though you know that you're friends with them there're someone in your living room this is all Edward Bay's advertising techniques his father was a big proponent of Vietnam War his his entire family was you know just a different head of the mobster family and they enamor or they get us enamored into Camelot and all this nonsense and so this is a brainwashing and none of them ever worked hard we have a woman in our movement our Arizona leader and she said her father went to school with Kennedy in fact he was his roommate JFK and JFK would come completely wasted had every STD and never went to class and but would somehow or RFK JFK JFK JFK okay but I'm saying this goes deep but somehow Mr would get A's he wasn't even allowed into the Navy and his father made a call you see these people's lives are scripted bridgid and it's hard for the masses to understand this now I've had the unique opportunity because of the journey I took and because I was pretty good at what I did to be invited into their area is to be co-opted and I never could do because I never forgot where I came from be when I was in Hollywood be it in academic circles so I understand these people are one of the most insecure people they never have to work they're highly arrogant they can commit Noe booby Kennedy spits in policeman's face he can do anything they can do [ __ ] anything if you talk to friends when they go skiing they violate every rules they do whatever the [ __ ] they want because they're the [ __ ] kennedies yep it's a nepotism yeah it's booby [ __ ] call him booby Don't Call Him Bobby no because you're showing a it's a it's a very subtle neural network manipulation thinking they're one of us he's always been a scumbag Morin kenan's work exposes the kennedies exposes you know the misogyny of these people and you know he drove his wife to Hanging himself and then took PR photo shots over the coffin and then after she was buried pulled her out and took her out of the Kennedy Space you see these people are horrible [ __ ] human beings and then booby Kennedy tells you to your face personal integrity and public Integrity are two different things and yet people because of their laziness because they don't want to build a Bottoms Up movement which is what we're creating follow these people so the The Establishment has the obvious establishment at any point in time it's a physics and then they have the Noto obvious establishment it's like they need the plus and minus you see like magnetism yeah need the North Pole and the South Pole so when when you cut off the South Pole they grow a new one so you know I learned this as a 17-year-old kid I was very fortunate I there was a guy called Jesse Jackson you may I don't know how old you you may remember him he was running a rainbow Movement Like Bernie Sanders like booby [ __ ] Kennedy independent movement and at the last minute and we were young kids 17 18 kids and we said oh my God he's anti-establishment and the last minute he Corrals all of his heart hard working activist and he says we must support the lesser of two evils this is the most important election it was uh Reagan versus Mondale and gives all of his votes to Mondale on the floor of the Democratic Convention and apparently he got a a private jet for that deal okay that was a deal that was struck so when Bernie Sanders ran I had a lot of good friends very smart people I mean hyper intelligent people oh my God Bernie Bernie Bernie Dr Shiva you should support him said he's going to [ __ ] you over he mark my words on the floor of the DNC convention he's going to hug Hillary very good friend of mine neuroscientist out of Harvard I've shared the story many times because I was eating dinner when she dropped her fork threw her plate at me and walked out she goes you're always critiquing everyone Bernie will never do that I'll put my life on it two years later she calls me crying she had moved up to Canada lives in a cottage very and she ran all of uh New England for Bur so that's what these people do they sucker in activists demoralize them and that's their job bridg that's what Russell Brand is doing too I don't know if you noticed but like they have you know they they pretend to be anti-establishment but then have no program of going forward or what to actually do he's just like Good Vibes man and then he ends up just you see he's a compromised human being so the establishment always finds compromised people who do all sorts of and then when they step apparent you know even a little bit out of line they expose them and then these compromised people act like Martyrs so they get a double whammy they make money on the way up and they make money on the way sort of down you see and so they're the not so obvious establishment in system science we call it a disturbance so the establishment understands his physics so they need the Russell Brands they need the [ __ ] car I need the Elon mus I need the booby [ __ ] kennedies now we as a movement because we understand this Dynamic Lenin called them social Democrats okay we expose them and we educate other people that there can be no movement unless you viciously expose the not so obvious establishment yeah that is a big task to do because we lose a lot of people because they're caught in the cult at some point in time booby cult Trump cult you see [ __ ] Carlson cult Tucker Carlson by the way and so but the good news is we have created now a global movement about a half a million people we have created a curricula because you have to train people an engineering course of sorts a community a university of sorts an institution but it's not theoretical we're not like a bunch of gome Chomsky who I knew very well sitting at MIT in your Ivory Tower talking about writing you know big books with footnotes we're actually on the ground he's another uh Epstein list person but more importantly know when I studied with him when I was 18 years old everyone coralled me to him and I was very cast s for a year I studied with him and at the end of that year I said so Professor Chomsky I still remember this I still I'm in his room I still see him rocking back on his chair and I say so what do you think's going on with the world and he turns to me and he goes well we're at the culdesac of humanity there's not much you can do we're going to blow ourselves up oh my God okay so I said what a [ __ ] prick and I was 18 I said this guy's full of [ __ ] he's Anarchist man well he's not an anarchist he's a Dem moralist okay so recently last you know we do by the way every Thursdays at 11:00 a.m. and 88 800 p.m everyone listening we do open houses for our movement truth freedomhealth.com go there and be come to our open house a very interesting volunteer shows up by the name of Jessica Coco and Jessica had been involved in many many movements as a serious activist she said in 1993 she went to a she sneaked into to a New York University academic event where only Chomsky was invited in all of the academic Elites and this was a tutorial Chomsky was offering telling people how we must and listen to this very carefully we must ensure no workers movement ever comes up in the United States what and in order to do that we must rewrite the Russian history by by attacking Stalin we must tell people Stalin killed 25 million people someone in the audience said wait a minute Professor chy that's not true he said just repeat it it doesn't matter yep oh my God that's crazy but the goal was we must demoralize activists Bridget this is a goal no so this is what we have so anyone who's out there misleading people and has a lot of eyeballs they are paid by the Swarm swarm to do that booby [ __ ] so that was Bernie's job says a bunch and they always say some good [ __ ] right they have to say some good [ __ ] yeah but at the end of the day he embraced the [ __ ] imperialist [ __ ] woman Hillary Clinton how can you do that that's not principles and then people who follow him split a number of them just became very demoralized they I mean these were serious hardcore act and he had succeeded you see yeah AOC is another one of these that they're going to groom to be the next Nancy Pelosi I swear to God right but right but she says just enough to manipulate people this is why our movement is the only force and I can say this without some people may think it's arrogant but it isn't I'm just sharing the facts it is the only force that has spent time understanding theory created an educational infrastructure community and we are looking for people want to save themselves and build a mass movement Bottoms Up with the Right theory so at Nick dentes the reason he goes from Laura lomer who's an ultra Zionist one day than to Trump and another day thinking he should support K because he has no Theory as you know he doesn't have anything he have nothing but I'm saying [ __ ] Carlson is deep State CIA Elon Musk CIA mosad so overnight The Establishment is able to create these Noto obvious establishment they go and find a guy called VI overnight because they didn't want this Brown face getting the eyeballs so they create this guy overnight you know they make one phone call to Media it's all done within hour someone becomes a front face Tulsi gabard a completely pro-war Hawk who presented herself against the military industrial complex but was all out to bomb the [ __ ] out of Iraq and she was also all out to go take out you know the Palestinian Fighters there right so this Central concept of the two-headed side of the Beast particularly the not so obvious establishment is what must be exposed and we do that that Dirty Work Russell Brand complete disgusting human being I mean suddenly he's a Christian I me this guy he's a piece of [ __ ] right that was funny that was really funny he just randomly decided he's saved oh my God right so he'll do anything these people will do anything but their Central goal is they are all owned and the litus test is will they now you wanted to talk about these other fools like Jill Stein so what's happened is you as over the last four years people realized that Trump and kamla Harris are one and that's if you look at we did a lot of The Cutting Edge work on that I mean I've met Trump multiple times I did all the election Integrity stuff that he used to raise a half a billion dollars and a book just came out saying he raised a half a billion off my work he only used 9 million for lawyers where did the other 491 million go so I know these people I've had many opportunities to be co-opted by them and I just can't do it cuz I [ __ ] hate them and that's the problem that I have that's the if you want to say a mental problem I have I hate these [ __ ] people and I cannot be co-opted by them and this is unfortunate for them so we built a massive movement my running for president now you know I ran for Senate people said why are you running for Senate well if I didn't run we wouldn't have discovered the backd door portal to Twitter because they don't want Engineers they don't want intelligent people who come from the masses ever running you know we raised two million bucks in Massachusetts $1$ donations we challenge a Republican party it was a Republicans who colluded with the Democrats to steal my election but it was all good because we exposed the backd door portal we exposed fouchy you know we we got 128,000 signatures we delivered them to Trump fire fouchy Mara Maples is ex-wife reached out to me she delivered that letter but we have all the data to show how Trump sold people out how Bernie sold people out and we go after these people why because we want to build a true Bottoms Up movement Bridget we have a goal and our Bottoms Up movement now tells gets people on the ground we do not believe in online media you're talking to the guy who invented email technology is not our savior the greater the more of the power for technology it gets co-opted and it gets used to consolidate power that's what's happened with social media all of our conversations are mine they're watched I'm probably one of the most shadowbanned people yeah you are oh my God you definitely are 400,000 followers I I used to do a tweet it would get a 100,000 retweets 10 million views per day and I'm lucky I even saw your uh campaign ad earlier this year I just by chance happened to come across it on Twitter and I was like how come I have never heard of this guy that's actually crazy because it was a really beautiful campaign I think I'll I'll find it and I'll clip it right here I directed the whole I don't people now I have a degree also in design you know I it was a great ad and I was like this is exactly what we've been needing because my whole thing is why do we not have candidates who are antiwar and and they want to support production and Industry in the United States like if we had those two things combined that person would win and then I found your video and I was like this guy knows he knows what needs to be done right who would have ever thought I'd be running for president of the United States of America I was born a low cast Untouchable in India's cast system a system of aristocracy oppression and racism my name is Dr Shiva aad I'm an MIT PhD a full bright scholar a scientist engineer entrepreneur and inventor my family and I left India to come to America on my 7eventh birthday I grew up in the workingclass neighborhoods of New Jersey Jersey playing baseball mowing lawns painting houses and coding software my friends and neighbors are blacks Italians Irish people of all Races as a 14-year-old I wrote 50,000 lines of software code to create the world's first email system and was awarded the first US copyright for email recognizing me as its official inventor at a time when copyright was the only way to protect software inventions I did that long before I ever came to MIT revealing that big Innovations can occur anytime any place by anybody growing up I saw politicians dividing Us by race and religion in both America and India to have us fighting each other while they remained safe in their gated communities and in their playgrounds of Hollywood Martha's Vineyard and Silicon Valley I'm a fighter I fought racism and exposed their imperialist wars fought for workers and put my life on the line against Global corruption I never wanted to run for political office all that changed when I saw working Americans as never before been duped by The Establishment and the not so obvious establishment across left and right we were being sold out and made to forget why we came to America and why America existed lawyers academics billionaires celebrities and politicians Elites clintons Kennedy bidens Obamas bushes black and white have hijacked America they printed trillions for their friends they delivered crumbling infrastructure corruption and racism they've transferred trillions to themselves dividing black and white fear-mongering and fake science lockdowns and censorship dirty air food and water pushing drugs upon us making us sicker we've been so P out one set of rules for them and another for us we deserve a warrior with a history of courage in putting everything on the line for you who believes in you not them who has created a movement Bottoms Up For Truth Freedom Health I've exposed their lies at the right time never waiting until it was popular I've exposed her false gods who exist to lead you back to them I've exposed her fake signs of lockdowns and masking and provided you solutions to fight them and win and protect your immune system saving Millions I expose fouchi Galvanize a fire fouchy campaign when others remain silent when they stole our election we sued the government and Twitter in our historic 20120 Federal lawsuit exposing in bare view the government and big Tech censorship infrastructure the Unholy alliance between government and social media companies where was Elon and his grifters they stood by the sidelines and did nothing they did not use their megaphones to help us when it could have made a big difference now our movement grows for truth Freedom Health independent of all of them everyday millions are learning the science of systems the knowledge the elites do not want you to have so you may learn how to think stand up and fight independent of the establishment of left and right and their fake Heroes now it's time for you to join the movement to win back America to win back truth win back Freedom win back your health that's why I'm running for president of the United States this race is about you this race is about truth Freedom Health versus Power profit control we've had enough they think we'll fall in line and vote again for their lawyers celebrities billionaires and chosen ones from above we choose our heroes from below from the rank and file who do what is right at the right time not when it's convenient and popular they can never represent us what America needs is a movement by the working people for the working people or educated organized decentralized and fight for independence from their systems of control and that movement exists it's ready for you we don't need them we need us to go bottoms up neighbor to neighbor my journey your journey are all the same it's our time it's time we had one of us it's time to win back truth Freedom Health to win back America be part of this historic movement all the way to our Victory on November 5th 2024 if you're an American citizen Pledge Your vote now for Dr shivi D the independent candidate for US president no matter where you live you can be a part of this volunteer as little as 20 minutes a day don't delay this is Dr Shiva and I approve this message paid for by Dr Shiva for president think about I've had to always do the impossible my whole life my parents I mean you consider the cast system my mom was an incredible person getting a mathematics degree as a woman in the 1940s dark skinned low cast Indian woman cons think about that Bridget women talk about feminism my mom was a feminist long before feminism existed at a deep level in India my dad grew up in war torn Burma never saw a book until he was 10 years old and this is real this is not some [ __ ] fake story you know grew up under a mango tree learning math and then became an engineer again from that same background my dad was dark as you could think about the level of discrimination he went through and then he was so good that he was sent to the United States for training as an engineer and when he came here to Chicago they said his name is Aur by the way you don't have last names in India they said we can't teach you anything so they invited him here and he came here in 1968 we waited about a year and a half to see my father then we came here and then we settled in Patterson New Jersey one of the poorest cities in the United States oh yeah black and then we went to Clifton black and white and then Lake kwat then the last three years my parents just kept moving to the better Public School Systems I went to Livingston New Jersey all Zionist the cushioners were in my town Chris Christie was my catcher my baseball team okay oh my God so you have to understand and I was the only dark skinned kid among 4,000 kid students and I aced at everyone all of them I was good in sports as well as every uh subject they would there was one time in pipany this is in New Jersey where they would not allow me to take an exam even though I was a best kid and my mom and dad went in there and ripped him a new one so I've always had to fight not being allowed to compete and that's what Jill [ __ ] Stein just did with that free and bogus Fair elections group a bunch of zus [ __ ] Jill Stein was just recently created by the liberal Elites because they need a new Democratic party oh God okay and Jill Stein is the one who kicked Cynthia McKenna a black woman a PhD a revolutionary black woman out of the green party who is formerly the vice president because she said you know I believe Israel was behind 911 and was Jill Stein who had her kicked out and called her an anti-semite that's crazy and now Jill Stein is manipulating black people with quote unquote reparations now I have to do the Dirty Work of exposing all this stuff oh my god let's vote for no she is not the alternative candidate now my policy position on Israel since 1984 has been very different since I was an activist we must end the occupation of the United States of Zionism you you can it's like a bunch of liberal white kids when I was at MIT I burned the African flag on the steps of MIT fighting South African apartheid but the Revolutionary Trend at MIT was like let okay it's fine to talk about black South African workers 10,000 miles away what about the black workers and white workers right on campus we also mobilize them along with the apartheid movement many of these white kids would be afraid to go to Roxberry or inner parts of Boston they would talk about helping black people in South Africa but they would never want to walk over there they're afraid of the black man you see so the revolutionary position is very different than the white liberal position the white liberal position right just says enough [ __ ] to act like they're radicals but they are the other face of the establishment that is what Joel [ __ ] Stein is after we expose Kennedy we hammered that [ __ ] they had to now they created a vacuum which is which means a vacuum would be filled in by me and our movement so they shadowbanned us they sto they steal our content and they promote this Zionist Hood which is a Race So how how do your positions on Palestine and Israel differ from Jin and why why do you call her a Zionist can you just elate that let me tell you all these liberal Zionist so in nothing has changed Bridget in 1984 I'll give you the the you have to understand the the magnitude of this manipulation you can look at this guy you may know him guy called Mia Kahana have you ever heard of him he was he was a rabbi from Israel who wants to just Slaughter every every Palestinian in 1984 Ariel Chiron if you remember went into saber and chatila and I mean not all of this stuff has been keep it's a recurring process literally took tanks and mowed over people in saign chatila okay brandise University is one of the biggest Jewish Zionist schools in Boston so we had I led one of the massive protest and mayor Kahana came we chased him off okay at that protest there was again these liberal zionists because liberal Jewish zionists and you know what their slogan was cease fire now you heard that slogan before it's a [ __ ] up slogan and slogans it's a bare minimum what's that it's a bare minimum but it's a [ __ ] up slogan it's very different than end the occupation of America by Zionism very yeah two different different one comes from a very different roote one says we're okay with Zionism we believe in this decadent state to exist Israel right the other one says no it says fundamentally that America is occupied by Zionism who use the working people of this country and some of those people who are anti-zionist within Israel to maintain that aircraft carrier known as Israel to support us imperialist interests that says Zionism is racism in the service of imperialism very deep different political analysis that says and the occupation of America you see the slogans reflect political Consciousness what does ceasefire now says ceasefire now is for the liberal zus apologist like Jill Stein one step forward or two steps forward one step back well that means Israel keeps always making one step forward it's disgusting it's it's a Zionist [ __ ] slogan all and and you also have wealthy Palestinian to wear the little scarf go to these movements they live in Qatar or Kuwait right to them this is a shtick this is a class war this is not a completely nationalist issue right there's Progressive nationalism and cultural nationalism so to the extent that some of these people come out and and it's the same old [ __ ] people but the reality is the fundamental difference is do you want to end the occupation of the United States by Zionist Jo Stein doesn't want to do that no way and if you look look at our little tweaks it's little tweaks always oh we need to stop the military spending no the end point and the beginning point is that Israel is an outlaw State it's stolen land period and the United States is completely occupied we must look right here which means all Aid to Israel must be cut all of it and then anyone who's in Congress is who has dual citizenship who's part of APAC all that [ __ ] needs to go let's start there that's a core issue so she cannot do that because maybe she's of a Jewish background and still has you know these heartfelt connections to Israel at a deep level now the reality is the free and fair elections even though I fulfilled all the requirements to be on that debate stage they colluded and kept me off how is that different than what happened when the establishment kept me off Mass [ __ ] chusetts I ran as an independent I fulfill all the criteria they don't want a real revolutionary like me they cannot have this Brown face I mean haven't I earned my right I have four degrees from MIT published I've done all the [ __ ] [ __ ] work bottoms up but they cannot and they have random people on those debates too like some random socialist lady with purple hair was in one I am pulling libertarian I never heard I am pulling higher than Chase Oliver who's a Libertarian right here now I called free and fair elections a woman called Ariel I forgot a lot she's executive director she goes oh my God oh my God it's Dr Shiva I go yeah I go why the [ __ ] are you keeping on saw the election she goes Dr Shiva I know nothing about that I said Ariel you're the executive director of free and fair elections and you don't know what they're doing she goes well they decided that I said do you know they've taken someone like you they're using you you are just like a nice naive good activist that they bring into these organizations I'm sure you're working your butt off for them but these decisions are being made behind your back room they're not transparent decisions so that's so so the green party is a scam party it's of the liberal Elites of the democratic party remember what I said they need to have two heads they need to have the obvious we've the Democrats and Republicans have become the unit party so they're going to create a not so obvious version of them which is what the green party and the Libertarians are going to be yeah we are the true revolutionary Force so that's why they are scared shitless about us mhm I mean if I got on that stage they're [ __ ] done they would be so destroyed oh man I wish I could see that wish see that the climate change scam I mean the carbon tax scam is what Jill Stein wants so you're moving slaves for One Plantation to another right yeah can you elaborate on that because I try to explain this to people because can people people ask me all the time why don't you vote for Jill Stein and this is one of the reasons is because the green parties like like faux environmentalism a lot of people don't really grasp that concept could you just give a rundown first of all do you know who CP snow is no okay if you have time go read a book called the two cultures by CP snow you have to do it it was required reading when I went to very good Public School inner city school and my teacher had us read it you know in the 70s we were very fortunate to have these hardworking teachers CP snow is a physical chemist in England and he was a great author literature writer okay he was a h he had the humanities and the science well CP snow would go to these very elite parties in England and he would go up just to [ __ ] with people he'd go up to these Elites who would talk about Shakespeare this and Shake he goes oh can you tell me the second law of Thermodynamics and they look down at it now CP Snow's view was if you know Shakespeare which is sort of common parlons right you should also know some basic [ __ ] what is the first law Second Law you know the laws of thermodynamics right so we have created a generation of educated idiots who don't know fundamentals very simple fundamentals and because they don't know that people over here can manipulate them so here's the fundamental issue okay first of all carbon is an atom CO2 is a molecule So when you say carbon what are you referring to number one okay number two I'm going to keep it I did a I I I did many many videos on this number two and again this is me putting on a hat as an engineer scientist who studied physics I have four degrees from MIT the number one institution in the world I've done my [ __ ] work so here's the reality now the thesis is that humans are affecting carbon right CO2 levels to be specific and that rise in CO2 is going to increase temperature change right that's so they say that's what they say that's what they say now how did you calculate that how did you calculate the increase in CO2 is going to increase temperature okay how would you calculate that we all know there's no disagreement there are many greenhouse gases out there okay and greenhouse gases can affect temperature no one argues with that but in science when you have to do engineering when you have to do real science you're about how much when I was in high school I had a great chemistry teacher Mr Walker and he had three jobs by the way he was a carpenter a general contractor and he was the AP Chemistry teacher and he was one of the most harshest uh teachers if the answer to a problem bridgid was 99.25% off why because that one 10,000th of a difference could blow up a power plant you follow how much matters yeah arsenic is not bad to consume neither is mercury how much a certain level of it is actually enhances brain function too much can [ __ ] it up you see yep it's how much so how much okay so how did they calculate how much they use what are called mathematical models okay so if the mathematical model models are going to predict something there's a fundamental and their evidence of predicting something what is the definition of evidence evidence is reproducible predictions so if I ran a model right and I put in the input was a you know 10 20 30 and I got one the next time I put in 10 20 30 what should I get one right if I put in 20 40 30 and I got the answer two the next time I put in 20 40 30 I should get two right that's called a reproducible prediction that's what laws are like Newton equation does that make sense that's what evidence is now so these climate change dingbats have created mathematical models and by the way there's $2 billion worth of funding any idiot can create these mathematical models when they created these mathematical models and I've read through the ipcc report which is a long report they have how many models do you think they have about predicting that CO2 levels in climate change guess how many they have they they count they about 150 and each model is predicting different levels let's say of iceing on the Arctic one says nothing will melt one says everything will melt and there's different flavors that is not evidence bridg that is called [ __ ] random [ __ ] okay it's theories it's theories now also none of those models included clouds okay why is that important if I shine a light into your eyes you notice your iris controls the amount of light that comes in so it's not like you know and if if if there's less light your iris opens up well the clouds are like an iris they can retain radiation in the Earth or they can let it out so many billion years ago the earth was about 30 uh the sun was 30% cooler 6,000 degrees Kelvin the sun was 30% cooler so if the sun was 30% cooler what do you think the temperature on Earth should be if you were if you were just doing it without the intervent it's oh it's going to be it's going to be frozen right the Earth would be an ice ball but it wasn't there were flowing Waters and waterfalls and all this [ __ ] why because the clouds don't know how to interact we are a complex system you see and these morons don't understand system science we're an interconnected system of systems and and intelligent systems know how to maintain homeostasis so these [ __ ] idiots didn't include clouds now it gets even more interesting how are you modeling all of this where you're modeling the flow of two fluids one is the ocean and one is the atmosphere right gaseous fluid liquid fluid got it and these are what are called in fluid mechanics if you take a The Graduate course in fluid man it used to be called 203 at MIT you learn about fluid mechanics one of the things you learn is a turbulent fluid we don't have the equations to model a turbulent fluid The navor Stokes equation has not been solved for a turbulent fluid you can win a million doll prize right now if you solve it we're talking about two turbulent fluids trying to model them so it's all [ __ ] [ __ ] and moreover we're at the lowest levels of CO2 we've ever had and you know when human beings came to be when we had very high levels of CO2 what do pot growers do when they're running their greenhouses they pump in CO2 if CO2 levels go below 180 parts per million all life on Earth dies in fact we're at the lowest levels of CO2 so when you add all this together this was just poof made up why because they want to make sure all of us human beings are tracked by carbon usage car and then you can have a carbon tax which is connected to your social media score you see which is then connected to digital currency so now you and they're going to restrict your uh ability to travel if you go over a certain Lev whatever whatever want to do so the world is at an important fractal point from a systems perspective either the Swarm the elites which is their goal is they look at from a global imp capitalist standpoint they are seeing they have Revenue they have expenses and they get profit their expenses are all of us they're saying why the [ __ ] do we need all these human beings couldn't we create an elisium around a half a billion people why do we need these human beings more land for us more real EST state for us and robots will do those things right it's a natural conclusion of where capitalism leads to but there is another piece which is for the 8 billion of us we want truth Freedom Health they want Power profit control there we can use the same system science to achieve a very different end State and that is what the mission I'm on so my running for president is an opportunity to Galvanize people and create a mass movement but we have to create the infrastructure so now we have leaders all over this country because we had to get on the ballot and we've gotten on the ballot in nearly every state either was a right in with electors or listed that's crazy okay that's really difficult to do they make it so hard to very we did it you know how much we raised $50,000 booby [ __ ] K raised two million sorry 20 million do you see people forget people power so all these [ __ ] retards are sitting on the sidelines thinking Russell Brand is going to save them so you know he needs a whip taken to him that that's what he should he should take a whip and lash himself he would probably like it don't don't say that he might like it he might like it you're right and then you have people so you have two forces against working people the grifters the not so obvious establishment and the fact that working people are denied access to this knowledge so that is the problem that I've cracked the code on and that was seen as impossible I've always had to solve impossible problems but well I can see your dialectician I can see your use your understanding of dialectics I've read I mean you know I I've read all the German philosophers I've read all the Indian philosophers right I've had to do the work it's not surface level I've gone very deep you know I've read all the comment turn notes from the first Congress all the way to the seven I've understood where Russia went off okay but nonetheless the Russian Revolution was one of the greatest events in humankind it was a Russian people who won World War II and these things the elites do not want people to know so right now they really don't want you on the debate stage they really way I mean I am the most [ __ ] qualified person to be president of the United States Donald [ __ ] Trump I've met with Trump TW twice he called me and invited me to marago I said I'm not coming because you he he endorsed a guy who committed the election fraud then I was in Miami and all my friends oh you're being too hard on him we went up there was a two-hour meeting he was like you know it was sad my partner Michelle she left that meeting crying for like we like this guy has no friends he was a little in a small room he looked like a lonely old man just repeating [ __ ] it was sad do you his wife doesn't love him it's a [ __ ] whatever the [ __ ] that is yeah it's an arranged marriage for sure right he has no one who loves him everyone I mean we were Michelle was literally sobbing and when we were leaving his assistant Molly came running she goes Dr Shiva not only he gave us a bunch of Mag outs he wants you to have this it was a very interesting gift it was a big silver thing he only gives us to heads of state so he's a only [ __ ] fellow he's a tool you know he's never had to work he just repeats [ __ ] so I have experienced these people at a deep level when I went to India on my full bright the prime minister of India appointed to be the head of the largest scientific institution and I expose all the corruption I to leave India under death threats Wherever I Go Bridget I have had many opportunities to serve at the highest levels with these [ __ ] [ __ ] and I do not want to do it and I cannot yeah I mean MIT is a CIA Hub yeah sure third MIT was known as a CIA Hub now do you know I didn't even know about MIT until two weeks before I applied I went to an all zus high school the number one student there and don't you think the guidance counselors would tell me about it I was going to apply to one uh you know two local state colleges here I am I'd won every award 800 on my SATs 800 out of 800 had invented email won the one of the westing house science awards no one told me about MIT randomly that's crazy my mother had helped these two women who were kicked out by their husbands they were homeless she let them stay at our home she one of them had a friend who dangled this brochure said you should go to MIT I thought it was a mental institute massachus Institute I you know he wouldn't leave my home two weeks later he came and I filled out the application with a pencil just for a joke submitted it get accepted first time I came to visit MIT I thought I thought the place was crazy people looked nuts and then my Zionist High School said oh my no no no you should go there because their ratings increased right as teachers and my high school physics teacher had the Holocaust thing on her thing literally she said she' been in the concentration camps and she said no no no Shiva you must go you like it and I go I said the people are nuts they look crazy she goes no you like Boston that was what attracted me come to a city so that was my background so the day I Ste foot at MIT I started a radical newspaper called the student because a black woman deed had been fired who had helped a lot of blacks a lot of minorities a lot of women come to MIT and this was when ra was in office and they were removing all the gains of the 1960s movement you see it's a backlash so I became that's when I started studying I studied with Chomsky briefly and figured out what Chomsky was about but this is I've been a student of this for a long [ __ ] time this is a profession I'm a professional revolutionary of sorts if you want to and I and we're training others Now using the science of systems not philosophy not German dialectical philosophy right not liberal philosophy but engineering science and that's what's been missing so it say grounded you should come to our open house you would learn a lot but again we don't try to convince people we tell people you want to follow Trump go for it you you want your ego's too big you want to learn go for it but what we are finding Bridget is amazing people you come to our movements all working people go to my feed a butcher an electrician and in the states where they thrw us off the ballot we have six active lawsuits going on you know who filed those lawsuits we did I wrote most of them we have I have one that's all the way up to the Supreme Court right now none of these lawyers want to help us so we've had to learn the law we're teaching an electrician how to go fight a federal judge this is a serious Movement by the people before the people and this is why Jill [ __ ] Stein [ __ ] Stein Zionist racist and all you [ __ ] green party people thinking we know we have so many green party people coming to us and they want to share all the [ __ ] about this [ __ ] organization the level of corruption within it the level of you know how they anointed her you see so they're going to try to do you know an O and they're going to try to create some martyr around her okay like and the butch wear guy her her VP pick is not a good I don't think yeah he's a black slave so that's what they do you have the same thing white liberals finding black house slaves so they cannot have the real person who's done the work study worked as ass off still works his ass off it's too [ __ ] dangerous that's why people like you must endure so I'm putting a thing out to all the grifters you're saying you're anti Zionist why so this is my lip test if you're real why aren't you endorsing me and why aren't you putting me on your show either you're jealous either you're full of [ __ ] and you just want views and clicks dumb ignorant you don't want to learn or this is just you know a grift for you so that's a litmus test you see Joe Rogan follows me when I I did the five scientific papers exposing I mean I'm still a full-time scientist assistant have you been on his show before you should he won't put on Eddie Bravo I've asked him many times his best friend during the GMO times I did five pieces of really good science exposing how GMOs um what the fundamental differences he put Kevin folta on who is a Monsanto guy he's pce of [ __ ] do you understand he's owned by Ary Emanuel oh for sure okay for sure so I'm the reason so everyone so I've you know hopefully you've learned enough about this concept I invite everyone to come to our open house if you want to learn you got to learn guys you're not going to do this by instinct you have to it's counterintuitive a lot of this you have to study well we've created that environment if you want to sort of think you're doing something by listening to Joe Rogan videos well you're a fool we have so many people who accidentally will come across us because of the Shadow Banning so what we've done is I tell now people go watch shatter the Swarm and we have little business cards we put out millions of these cards people go door too and the card says save yourself they're killing you and we have a picture of the you know you can go find it on shapr president.com cost of living is going up lifespan is coming down and if you want to understand how the few control the many go watch shatter the Swarm 15 minutes familyfriendly I don't curse there I to retain my composure there it's more of a that's Dr Shiva the system scientist doing that okay and if you watch that video it'll give you the systems Dynamics and then I'll share I'll link that in the show notes so people can just click on it and go watch it but hey we're we're really short on time cuz you have to leave in like 10 minutes I got 10 minutes but I hate to cut you off but I really uh I want to make sure before we wrap this up that you give some of your main points your your political platform of what you would do if you were elected president what are your yeah so I what are you running on I think people really need to know this I should have done at the beginning funny because people don't want to talk about platforms until literally it's like a bunch of people procrastinate for their exam you know so people wait into the very very last minute right and then they want to know what what is your platform points um so let me talk about that um I just want to tell people that I'll be there shortly let me just tell them okay so number one okay you have to dismantle the first amendment has been destroyed and it was done by Trump on November 16 2018 when he signed cisa into law Elon Musk is a front face of the new censorship 10.0 and the reason is cisa created a backdoor portal into all social media companies that must be completely taken down platform number one otherwise there's no we have no First Amendment anymore number two I believe truly in the Second Amendment I think young kids from the age of K through 12 should be taught full firearms training and this should be a natural part of the culture where people know how to use weapons because we need to to protect ourselves from the government number three kids should be taught system science one of my mentors Jay Forester who wanted you know it's a new field of how do you think from a systems perspective Bridget not thinking reductionist we live in the world of complex systems now Health Care Systems transportation systems that knowledge needs to occur at a very young age no dual citizens in public office the network we have today the internet structure that we have today owned by four major tele telecom companies and now the fifth one starlink which is essentially a government Enterprise we need to have peer-to-peer networks called mesh networks we need to have a network by the people for the people held by the postal postal service the postal service was one of the most incredible institutions and it was created to ensure Free Speech equals free reach Elon mus doesn't believe in that neither does the ADL obviously we need to end the FED right complete nonsense complete we need to cut all Aid to Israel not one [ __ ] penny but here's an interesting thing I believe I believe there should be no personal income tax at all zero but we should have a very high corporate income tax about 50 to 70% and by the way if you look at the Heyday of the United States when it grew it was when the corporate tax was very high so I'm saying let's make it even higher why because see when you start a corporation I've created many businesses what you're always trying to do as a corporation you're trying to manipulate tax okay you have to have lawyers and and you pay a lot of people to do this so typically people when they start companies where is Apple headquartered why why are they in goddamn is uh Ireland why do people go to bise because they're trying to cut that corporate tax rate my goal is you have to cut off all these eliminate all these offshore tax Havens and you increase a corporate tax rate very high and and cover up all those why because now companies if they're making profit they're going to say [ __ ] I have a lot of Revenue I very little expenses what are you going to do I have to increase my expenses right to reduce profit how do you increase expenses pay your workers more wages increase infrastructure expand you see what I'm saying you put that money back in to the people helped you deliver it but so if let's say the company grew by 1 billion to two billion you're making 50k well maybe you should get paid 150k why and then you don't pay any taxes Bridget isn't that nice that be really nice right so that's so people say what do you mean 50 50 70% that's why because corporations are entities that must be incentivized properly to support the people that help them generate their wealth not to hide it no tenure in federally funded institutions you know I've created the certification program for clean food there's seals that we've created it's a Bottoms Up movement and I think there should only be one 8year term for any elected official just do one 8-year term Senator president you get elected eight years because eight years you can do a lot and then you're done this twoe two year two-y year thing for House of Representatives is nonsense because right when you get in you're trying to get elected you can't do anything it's chaotic yeah purposely chaotic so this is how we solve the education problem you know before first of all people didn't go to universities they learned a vocation suddenly going to universities became a business and and the parents were taking the student loans it's not a student loan it's actually a college loan because the college is getting your money right and then they take the student loan money and they invest it in endowments Harvard's endowment keeps growing by orders of billions they're using student loan money so here's my way that you solve this problem because you make this you make the universities co-sign the loans not the parents so if you have a student and he's got a $200,000 loan the university should co-sign that loan you know what the univers is going to do they're going to make sure Bobby is not taking transgender philosophy of artw artworks a major he's gonna maybe learn engineering he's gonna learn a skill yeah he can do that on his hobby you see because if he learns that and he can't get a job the University's on the what's the point yep yeah what's the point we should investigate the Zionist control of Hollywood and financial systems they talk about diversity Let's do an investigation of diversity in all the top universities how diverse are they we should map the Earth Earth's surface fully for lots of reasons we should really perform a historical analysis of the origin of human civilization where did we actually come from what is the real history number two all universities all their nonprofit status must be removed we got to tax them um we have to educate people to boost immunity that's where all of Public Health policy should be based on that comes from resilience not like you know booby [ __ ] Kennedy's talking about oh my God Kellogg's is putting in green Dy well they have a right to do that but you you you you you want to remove green Dy from Kell can hurt children but you're fine with bombing the [ __ ] out of right Gaza that's okay so we need to go to the root of this which is boosting natural immunity we should have no tax on local farmers producing organic non-GMO Foods if you talk you know I go almost an hour and a half to get grass-fed meat there's not enough Supply Bridget right um we should make government customer friendly there should be a rating system system like Yelp for every [ __ ] government employee we have it for restaurants where's the [ __ ] rating system for your it should be up oh this guy's not like when election time comes it should be a you know a rating system so now these government huh that would be nice yep and it should be open um we should prosecute prosecute the ipcc Al Gore John KY Jill Stein the green party all these people been involved in the climate change fraud it's an absolute fraud Jill Stein should be prosecuted we should end gpos and pbms do you know who they are so we talk about big Pharma every every equipment every product that goes into a hospital goes through a middleman called a GPL there's only three of them everything that goes into a pharmacy goes through PBM these are the dark Forces behind the supply chain they control the flow of price the flow of goods so it's not Healthcare is costly these people make it costly right and those should be eliminated now people told Trump to do that and he he didn't do that the way we also solve healthc carees we must support dpc's direct private uh practitioner care where doctors don't need to take insurance there's a group of doctors who saying look I'm not going to take insurance you just pay me 75 bucks a month I'm only going to take 500 patients I have more than enough money half a million dollars I learn earn and I take care of all the basic 80% of the stuff you see I mean I just went to see the doctor for something and I had to pay 60 bucks anyway for the co-pay and I'm paying 1,200 bucks a month for insurance what the [ __ ] right well I lived in Mexico for a while and you could just go to the doctor and pay like $30 you don't you don't need insurance you don't need it's they just that's how they do it there and then finally we have to stop the collusion of big farm hospitals and big insurance so I have actual policies you see but I'm the only one who wants to end the genocide in Gaza Jill Stein doesn't she'll tweak it because she's a [ __ ] Zionist so everyone listening out there Joe Stein will support ceas fire will she support her fellow zionists being thrown out of Congress will she actually repudiate ask or does she believe in the existence of Israel does Israel deserve to exist ask question I say no yeah it's an outlaw State stolen land it's not a state it's a regime big big differences the green party is a new Democratic party being created in front of our eyes to keep fill the vacuum so people like me the real revolutionaries don't come in and really get front face with the people and that's why the only way to win is people need to raise their Consciousness we need 3 to 5% of people understanding this Dynamic right and that did occur during the 1900s across the world people started having these conversations they understood political Theory they weren't just a bunch of grifters I mean people like Russell Brand Fuentes go down the list I mean these people are not leaders they're [ __ ] The Establishment loves them they love them they promote them yeah but they will not promote the guy you invented email works every day has studied all of his life is an actual bottoms up person too dangerous they don't want you on the stage you cannot you cannot go on the stage because you actually have uh viable ideas that most people hearing what you just listed off most people would agree with what you just proposed everyone agrees with what I propose it's what all working people work their butts off want I because you know what that's who I am I work every day I get up at 4 in the morning I to do my science I have to write papers I have to manage teams I have to create products I still get my hands dirty I wrote my Supreme Court lawsuit by myself yeah day I'm sure you're you're you're super busy you I'm really grateful that you came on this show and you're welcome back anytime I feel like I could have talked to you for endorse our campaign don't around endorse it say everyone should go and vote or wri in Dr Shiva you need to say that you need to put your money where your mouth is so that's what I I'll say it right right here right now if you are going to vote you should write in Dr Shiva because there's nobody else who has I mean this is my problem with the green party and Jill Stein and Cornell West and all these Alternatives that are just misguiding everyone they're not serious Cornell West is a [ __ ] doofus they pull him out as a black doofus guy out of Princeton brother brother brother and then they put him back in the closet okay next brother this brother that what the [ __ ] are you calling these people Brothers for they're your [ __ ] enemy doofus I don't know where he went either he just like dropped off his campaign they don't have a campaign they don't have a movement they've got nothing we were on the ground in Massachusetts the hardest state to get on WE collected 20,000 signatures in 10 days they P signature collectors $10 a signature Bridget they have nothing We Are The Movement that they must Shadow ban so all of you listening out there we're [ __ ] here get off your [ __ ] butt how can people how can people follow your your work and follow your campaign and everything that you're doing number one go to our open house that we host every Thursdays and Fridays v.com orientation go to shatter the.com shatter the Swarm start there and then we give a free course there it's like 20p part course it's called get off the [ __ ] Plantation it's called get off the plantation add of the [ __ ] get off the plantation and you will understand that once you understand who's running it it's a very scientific analysis but it's accessible then you have to make a decision do you want to be a house slave or a field slave now a lot of people this is a very important decision because that means now they're alone they got to stand up on their own two feet they can't [ __ ] think Russell Brand is going to do it or booby [ __ ] Kennedy or Joe Stein or [ __ ] they have to do it now they are ready to [ __ ] learn and then you become a truth FR Health Warrior we teach you system science the same [ __ ] I used to teach at MIT to the elites I teach to everyone and it's a learn teach and serve model you learn we have scholarships and you teach other people we have a hairdresser who's taught other people think about that we have people teaching the same level PhD level system science to others and without that knowledge we're [ __ ] and once you learn that knowledge it's done and our goal is to have enough
