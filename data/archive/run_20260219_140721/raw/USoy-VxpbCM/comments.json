Vijaya Gadde kept saying they don't ban people for one tweet is all about \"context\" aka their subjective view of your past behavior. Is clear that for Milo, Sargon and Alex Jones they would justify the ban by looking at the rules in the broadest way possible and their subjective opinion of their past behavior. But when Kathy Griffin asked for the doxxing of minors, they would only look at the offending tweet and look at rules in the most reductive way possible.\n\nThough, I'm less concerned with bans -- life time or otherwise -- over all the shadow-baning, de-boosting, de-raking and algorithm meddling going on. At least it's public, we know who is gone. We can see the double standard and we can react accordingly. But when platforms start meddling with content delivery, we can only infer it. Hence, you have to ask your YT subscribers if they are getting your videos or not. Sargon did the same recently. It is a much worst form of differential treatment, there is no appeal, no acknowledgment, no chance of public outcry, nothing. It is a form of keeping us pacified. It is Goggle's \"The Good Censor\" in action.",

Well then I'd say he shouldn't have had him on in the first place. But I don't think that's why he didn't grill him. He's grilled plenty of other political figures on his show. \n\nI heard from Gavin M. (Forget how to spell his last name but y'all know who I'm talking about) say on Crowder' s show that he'd kiss Jack dorsy' s ass because he's such a big figure and would want him back on the show. Which fervently disagree sacrifices your principles for a chance of fame. \n\nSo Rogan didn't grill into because A) Joe isn't really a political guy. B) He didn't want to discourage dorsy from ever coming back because those podcasts would pull millions of views easily. Or C) Joe doesn't think that the censorship is that concerning and he sympathizes with Jack and his views. I really doubt it's A) i guess I'd rather it be because of reason B), but i get a feeling it's probably C).\n\nGreat analysis though mate. Love your growing channel",

    "text": "For once I agree 100%. Most times I agree to some degree. I´m very happy that the deepness of Twitter \"asymmetry\" (I could call it something much more ugly) is chopped to pieces.\n\nThis Twitter ideology is related to the weird union of censorious lefties and censorious corporations. One of the most striking similarities, which is always rampant with communist regimes, is not accepting humor, jokes, comedy, and most of all, sarcasm. Anti-freedom of speech people, corporations, establishments always go after jokes, and these days memes. Their ideology in practise is so idiotic and incoherent, that it´s excellent material to joke about. That´s why everything must be taken literally, as seriously, deviously and hatefully. My old history teacher said :\"The only things tyrants and dictators fear, is laughter.\"  I know that´s not literally only thing they are afraid of, but when you have the mindset of an sjw, a smallminded tyrant, who thinks that everything that she feels insulting or just not to her liking, must be forbidden from everyone. Dictators rule by fear, say for example, Nicolae Ceaucescu in Romania during communist regime. When the fear was outed, they, Literally, killed him.\n\nThis is why the lefties (and, this would go to far right, if they were in the similar position, only it would be \"national\" thing, not \"universal\") hate comedy, jokes, memes, they show their weaknesses, stupidity and how dysfunctional their ideology or agenda is. This goes for islam, by the way, make a joke, get a bomb, authoritarian ideologies take jokes very seriously. It is said, that PEOPLE WHO LAUGH, ARE NOT AFRAID. Take away laughter, implement slaughter, and there we are, we have stalin´s Soviet Union, or whatever authoritarian regime.",

So I went to my desktop and watched a video with my production grade equipment and noticed a hallway affect along with the low volume. A lav mic with a separate track recording so you can tweak the audio to rid it of ambient sounds should do the trick.  \n\nYour content is great but the small changes to upgrade the quality of the viewing could help out for new people who find your channel, good audio keeps viewers , especially viewers for your type of content as I would bet a significant amount don't actually watch but listen while doing something else.   \n\nI like your content and I don't wanna see your channel lose it's viewers due to production quality....",

As they pointed out in the podcast (and Tim really brought that point home) the bias seems very much like it is subconscious. The rule about misgendering was the perfect example to show it. They intend to reduce harm. They fail because of subconscious bias. That is the answer of Occam's razor, and the one you should stick to in my opinion.",

It's the principle that the simplest answer is usually the correct one and tell me how you interpret these two scenarios:\n\n1. Several tech gianst all show a specific bias that happens to coincide with the culture in which they are seated, that being Silicon Valley. These tech giants are all aware of this bias and are willfully engaging in censorship and claim they are not in favor of said censorship.\nor\n2. Everything is the same except their bias is subconscious, which doesn't imply nefarious intent. I'm not saying that nefarious intent is there but I would require more evidence to suppose such. What is that evidence you are harbouring?",
