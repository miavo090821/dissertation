hello everyone this is carlos garrido and i'm here with my partner eddie smith and welcome to our second podcast podcast number two um eddie i think you had a question that you wanted to ask me that uh was going to put everything into perspective yeah i mean basically the the number one question every philosopher has and have been unable to answer for years other than of course jeb bush um but you develop a time machine um and you have the ability to go back in time to the day that hitler was born would you kill baby hitler i would not i would not i'm very kantian when it comes to that uh i would take a deontological approach and and just consider that killing babies is wrong there's probably something else you could do maybe stick by the baby and make sure he doesn't end up as as hitler that would probably be a better better bet than just becoming a baby what about you you kill the baby well now i'm thinking you could create some kind of alternate timeline where you create communist germany so if you follow by hitler and you make sure you like reading in marks um and all this stuff as he's you could use his charisma or whatever to capture the the post-world war one economic you know turbulence that was going on in germany and you could bring people to socialism then we've got the ussr china and communist germany like who knows how that alternate timeline would have played out yeah yeah definitely there's a lot many more there's there's so many more things you could do than just kill baby hitler you got to be more creative than that yeah come on jeb so so next we wanted to talk about something a little more serious um the just a little bit this is tad um we're gonna talk about the rise of violent fascism in our country um so nice transition there um so uh bolivian journalist ali vargas was at the capitol riots and he noticed that there were fulan gong cultists from china who are an anti-communist anti-xi jinping anti-chinese or chinese communist party um hyper-political religious group who literally believe that trump has been sent by god to destroy xi jinping and the chinese communist party uh there were cuban gusanos obviously white miami cubans who you know a lot of them their families were the plantation owners who were benefiting from the felicio batista kind of un regulated pro-western dictatorship and had their land seized by the cuban revolution um elements of of that were there and also uh iranian monarchists so iranians who support the shah which when it comes to the monarchis and the the fulangong these they wouldn't even really have any kind of legitimacy if it wasn't for the u.s backing and the cia backing like their their ideas are just pro-western right um you know based the fulan gong and china and the iranian monarchists really have no plan or no idea for their country other than we're just going to hand everything over to the west so these these parties wouldn't even exist if it wasn't for um the us and then you know there were two tweets going around from people within the political establishment like it's so sad to see you know chinese defectors and it's so sad to see venezuelan opposition party people support trump and support the capitol rides it's like well who do you think these people are you know these are far right goons the venezuelan opposition party has tried to kill trump multiple times i'm sorry have tried to kill maduro multiple times like you don't think they're going to support something like the capital riots um and now you see you know pelosi and other members of the establishment trying to blame the capital riots on russia you know on foreign interference trying to push off the blame and it's like no this is you know the white supremacists in the us and and the disaffected people who are ready to storm the capital as well as these far right-wing elements from other countries um are bred by the us you know we've created this situation in which you know when we have an election people storm the capital and and try and you know and start fires and there's violence um and there's unrest because our country um is extremely broken and we've been we've been sponsoring and emboldening these far right literally fascistic elements in our country for a long time now and now that's you know manifesting itself as violence yeah i um i definitely think there's like two different circles of two different spheres of trump supporters there's like that element is definitely more aligned with uh the right-wing pseudo-fascist part of trump and then there's the populist side of trump which um was the one that caught the the sectors that would have historically gone with the democratic party which were the working-class sectors and stuff um i think these sectors were disen disenchanted this time around a lot of them if we see some of the statistics of where trump won it was people who made a little bit the people that were in the highest income classes of those districts that were primarily voting for him um so i mean how we what we conclude from that i don't know that doesn't mean that necessarily that it was working class people and and lump in elements that didn't vote for him or that voted for him less this time around but um they shish released an interesting article i believe today or yesterday on rt that was talking about trump's betrayal to populism and even if it's right-wing populism um yeah we have uh a lot of the the trump followers now that are calling him basically a phony and a traitor um and a part of the swamp that he said that he was going to drain um and it is our role now to go to these circles and get that energy that led at least some sectors of the working class to follow a billionaire to the point of storming the capitol building and try to organize those sectors um that's that's been something the left has been quite bad at i think it was actually better at doing it in 2016 with the first time uh bernie renner ran than than in 2020 but um yeah we we can't forget where the trump phenomena comes from because if we do then we fail to do the reflective act that we have to do um in order to realize what we can do better to address these um these sectors of the class that end up falling for right-wing populism yeah yeah we need a strong socialist movement to fight this because people you know 78 of american workers live paycheck to paycheck and then that makes people susceptible to right-wing populism if there's no left-wing populist movement reaching the workers and then as i cover this week the fulangong and um has a propaganda arm called epic times and they put spent 1.5 billion dollars on social media advertising one boosting trump and two boosting q anon um and as well as anti-china conspiracy theories um so this is the kind of groups our government's backing and once again we see our government sort of backing fascists um and that's you know look at how world war ii developed the centrists and and the ruling class are always going to choose you know fascism over socialism um so what's the answer to that the answer is to build a strong enough socialist movement to to reach people and to and to pull them out of these out of these you know these online traps you know people kind of call it the alt-right pipeline where you where you sort of fall down these rabbit holes and you have that and then you just have the regular trump worker who thinks the capital riots were you know nonsense and destructive and doesn't support them at all but they voted for trump because he said he's going to end the wars and bring manufacturing back to the us you know those are the other the other people we gotta reach you know and those are the people who are available you know i i guess the kind of far-right fascist elements who storm the capital doesn't represent the majority of america and i was looking at someone was doing a class analysis of it and they were finding that most the people who stormed the capital were either like unemployed or they were petty petty bourgeois so you know it's not the working class who's engaging in these things um and now that trump's gone you know most americans especially working class americans are fairly apolitical you know it's time to build a movement um in the next four years that's able to reach these people and give them a message for something better and something constructive you know people are tired of the destruction you know obviously we we don't conflate blm with the capital riots or think you know they're fighting for the same thing but but people you know i think we're a little bit alienated by the rioting and obviously there's more right you know black people will have a lot more uh the blm movement has much more reason to riot than these far-right fascists but i don't know we need to start reaching to people with a message of construction rather than than destruction i think the met the feeling i've been getting from living in the midwest is people are just kind of tired of all the destabilization um so yeah that's what i think our message should be going forward here absolutely yeah one of the things you mentioned there was the ability to um to the propagandizing of trump by by this anti-china elements and the promoting of the q and on and all those conspiracy theories and it reminded me of uh a work of all to say where he i think the work is called philosophy as a revolutionary weapon where uh in a very lenin inspired way he's talking about philosophy as the medium by which we're able to distinguish the true from false ideas and and that always when we're able to do that when we distinguish what the true idea is truth is always in the side of the proletarian interest um so i think that not to say that we have to i mean become philosophers or anything like that but the process of critical thinking and trying to distinguish the what's the [ __ ] from not [ __ ] is always a process that when successful it ends up benefiting the elements of the working class and when it's not when we're able to when we leave this junk just spread around all it does is bring damage to any working class and poor and london elements as we saw in the capital riots and the falling for false idols following them and it doesn't benefit their interest in any way possible exactly i like that um i think that's probably you know enough about the capital riots um but let's move on here to what you want to talk about um with lennon and our we're going to try and do maybe a section every podcast talking about um like relevant politics or geopolitics like we just did and then we're going to talk about some philosophy which is more carlos's specialty so we're going to discuss lenin today and i'll just let you take it take it from there carlos um yeah i'm not so sure that it's it's too philosophic of a of a topic it really isn't it's just a like a a guidance thing basically but this comes from a lecture that lenin gives to the young communist league in in russia and what he's doing is giving them the means by which they should begin um working towards the building of socialism um and i think it's quite pertinent today because i mean if twitter is a representation of the left um a lot of the things that lenin is mentioning that communists have to do is something that the left is is utterly failing at doing in the us um so one of the things we see from the twitter left is a constant just sloganizing just bringing up communist slogans and slogans and slogans and there's a lack of of of knowledge for for history for theory and what we have to do is realize that we're not gonna we're not gonna be successful communist by just reading communist literature we have to expand ourselves because when we engage in arguments with um with different uh proponents of different ideologues um if we know their arguments beforehand we're going to be a lot more successful in debating it um and i think there's a lot of failures when it comes to that because just people don't know lennon says here that you can become a communist only when you enrich your mind with the knowledge of all the treasures created by mankind and that's another thing that um we have a left that sees the socialist project not in terms of growth and i don't just mean economic growth because there's malthusian elements to it that want to limit growth and try to have this sort of aesthetic socialism or you're limiting bodily pleasures and stuff like that for the planet right um but that gets translated to a lack of personal growth as well um and and marx we saw that the growth that happens in the different epochs of society is also reflected in the in in the individuals they're also growing along with the society um if you want to think about it in in terms of hegel it's a process of constant becoming a little bit more and more conscious of of yourself um this i'm sorry there was someone knocking out the door but this this process of growth is ignored and if we if we continue where we're going without engaging with all of the rich stuff that has come from the past all of the stuff that humanity has been able to create and and all the stuff that has helped humanity progress um we're not going to be able to build communism we're not going to be able to grow and become these uh this highest level there's basically ubermensch of a human um that that the communist society requires of us to become um so yeah and lennon in this in this lecture is is mentioning that that we have to not just engage with communist literature we have to read the best stuff from the previous epochs and read it in a way that is not disconnected from reality but read it in a way in which we can look back at reality and see well how can we apply this in practice right we don't just want the academic process to be something where we just shove information into our heads but we want the information into our heads that's going to help us in the future and in practice which means that not only do we have to read the best stuff that has been made but we also have to be aware on how to do even the most elementary things um in society like we need to learn how to fix a toilet and do like all of these regular tasks but be able to be even if you're a working class person in society to be able to run the government to know the most elementary and the most complex and those are things that i think are are are missing from the left today um as soon as you bring up something from a different epoch that represents maybe a different class position they just call you out for it immediately without realizing that you can also learn something from that and you can learn in critiquing it as well but yeah yeah it reminds me the whole your whole uh little uh talk there reminds me of that aristotle quote um the something like the sign of a trained mind or smart person or whatever is to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it so it's like one of the things i do is i read the wall street journal and cnn and msnbc and fox news every day obviously i don't agree with them but one i want to know what my enemy is saying and two you know there are facts hidden behind the veil of nonsense if you have the media literacy and the background knowledge and the theoretical knowledge of political economy to know what they're saying is you know what parts of what they're saying are true and what parts are biased and then what narrative overall are they trying to pitch you know and if you're um and it's important to read all of that uh and then yeah i disliked what you were saying about kind of becoming it's like che's idea sort of becoming the new man you know a lot of the socialist people who would go talk to to che you know a lot of people in the soviet union would be like che wants to skip socialism and go right to communism right he's saying the cuban people should be a new kind of person um you know defeat individualism and embrace collectivism and there's none of that on the modern left you know i got attacked for saying that leftists should work out i'm like capitalism wants you to be fat you know it used to be a sign of affluence to be fat because there wasn't enough food but now we have all this food and they're just trying to sell you sugar and and you know stuff that's terrible for your body and terrible for your brain and you finish an eight-hour to you know 12-hour day at work and you're driving by mcdonald's and you want to grab it so part of defeating capitalism is to tell yourself no i'm going to go home and eat a salad and lift some weights you know um and not that everybody has to do that but it's you know it's something that's missing we we always talk about how like those capitalist meme pages are like you gotta grind to get this much money right you gotta wake up early and work hard and dedicate yourself to making money and socialists will see that they'll critique the big this is stupid this is capitalism but think about the ethic behind that right the ethic is human the the distortion of that is capitalism which takes it and says you should try your hardest and strive your hardest to make money to exploit others to expand your capital you know through violence whereas you know that is garbage but the ethic is not so bad you know i'm gonna wake up every day and fight for socialism i'm gonna wake up every day and i'm going to enrich my mind by choosing to read instead of you know whatever else watch reality television television or all the distractions that that consumerism gives to us so um that's missing too and then just the like having knowledge of the economy like you said there's nobody in the socialist movement who could really run an industry right now and if you read the cuban revolution like there's tons of stuff they had to do after they took power right they had to assign all these people to these industries and you have to work with global capitalists and you have to know what the global capitalists are thinking or your socialist experiments going to get crushed um and obviously we're not anywhere near being able to even think about stuff like that but but in a way we need to right we need to be thinking about how we're going to go into these major industries and and what is the plan for them what do we actually want to do with them um how are we going to pitch workers on the future that we actually are trying to build here yeah and i think that process of building the what jay would call the new man um it's it's quite an arsenic process it's a process of developing virtue um and and developing virtue in all arenas like you said working out to maintain your body healthy eating good uh reading enriching your mind all of these things are so important and we have what seems to be if the left is at all representative if the twitter left is that all representative of the actual left um we have what seems to be an anti-virtue left like it fetishizes um loser elements because it just reacts it's a resentment left that sees these values that capitalists are promoting of grandeur of perseverance of this and that for the wrong reasons right as you said but it automatically automatically reacts and says no when it it's unable to see that there's a kernel in that that's true that we should persevere and have goals and and struggle and have this sense of discipline and this project that we have our life dedicated to um the difference is that as communists we should have this project also in connection to the class drug one to the building of socialism but yeah i mean it's it it comes again from from a lack of of what we call the left being inside working class circles and working with with with people um and and what you realize is that if if our left right now did what lenin would have wanted like vanguardist to do which is go to working cluster go to where the masses are we wouldn't be able to work as a vanguard because we're so like like we we miss the complete ethos the spirit that you need in order to have people follow you right so even if we go to these working class circles we don't have the character to have the the virtue elements that allow for the people around you to follow you so we also have to do a process of character reflection and and realize that to some extent we are going to have to clean our room before we we go out into the world right um we are going to have to improve ourselves in order for us to then be that beacon of light for the working class when we go into those circles and have them be able to trust us and follow us if we are you know um not virtuous if we're eating all this bad food and just uh not the most professional looking folks who's gonna follow us you think working-class people who have this sort of traditional morality are going to follow us and say this is if this person is a representative of socialism is this what i want no we have to look presentable we have to try to be as virtuous as we can and improve ourselves as much as we can so that all others can follow our projects if we're shitty people others are not going to follow us which is something else that a lot of the stuff that you see on twitter is people just saying the meanest [ __ ] [ __ ] right saying absolute disgusting things to other people yeah not treating people with any any respect you know when the whole idea of the ideology is humanism you know at the base it's like we're trying to create the best world for humans and then you're on twitter calling other members of the left telling them nobody likes them or whatever and you know everybody's i saw a bunch of new year's resolutions from from leftist who i like saying you know oh if you think anything's gonna get better in 2021 you're an idiot like why is that your mindset our project is one inherently optimistic because we're trying to move forward and build a better world and two we're trying to be like you said the vanguard we're trying to show people um that that we can be better you know that we can transcend capitalism um and and it's not that we're saying you know that like depression doesn't exist or that these struggles don't exist and that they aren't enhanced by capitalism of course they are but you're gonna feel better if you you know talk to someone about it and you and you keep a positive mindset you do things to to improve yourself and to try and overcome overcome these things you know these these mental issues or these things that drag you down things like depression what's not going to make you feel better is spending five to eight hours a day on twitter you know being mean to people it's gonna create a negative cycle you know your brain works at like feedback loops the more positive stuff you put in the better you're going to feel you know that's why reading makes you feel better um i like what you mentioned there of the the pessimistic left and if we're we're talking about philosophy it's a schopenhauer in left that's uh it seems like a paradox because socialism as you as you said if one causes himself a socialist you need to be optimistic you're optimistic about building a whole new society um out of the the birthmarks of the old and creating this new man and and stuff um so it just reminded me i wrote something down a fun a funny quote that i think is from shishak i don't remember who it's from it's um the king is dead long live the king and that's that's the basic dynamic of the pessimistic socials you're positioning yourself in an ideology that's necessarily optimistic and then saying the complete opposite of that that nothing's going to happen so why be a socialist just be annihilus just do nothing um so this is something we have to reflect on we have to get rid of these pessimistic impulses because i mean even just practically if you think nothing's gonna happen um how how is it gonna work out in your everyday life of trying to make something happen right you need to know that something is possible in order for one to strive to do it and i think that's one of the one of the famous phrases from the preface of the contributions to the critique of political economy which is where the base and superstructure thing comes from and marx he says something along the lines of humanity doesn't put itself a task that it cannot fulfill and if we are putting ourselves the task of socialism it's always possible it's oh as long as capitalism is the global order socialism is always a possibility so these pessimistic elements are just absurd and we have to get rid of them and again it's just a complete character change that we need to we need to make and that doesn't mean that we're putting the baggage on people right um people are results of their environment and this is the environment that capitalism has created um for the youth uh the the left that we see on twitter is a reflection of the left that capitalism has has allowed to exist and if people we know that people are a reflection of their environment so what kind of environment are we creating here on the left is it one that encourages people to read and better themselves or is it one that's entirely pessimistic and you're seeing the rise of post-modernism and post-leftism too and and you know we've talked a lot about that how their whole narrative seems to be pessimistic like we'll never escape capital like what is even the point of thinking that way you know and it's the kind of um you know if you look at not to keep going back to the cuban revolution but they had 22 people when they started right and obviously cuba is an island we're not going to be able to do what cuba did and have a guerrilla war but they were optimistic you know they what chase said when asked why he chose to follow fidel he said fidel um was the one who was ready to stop whining and fight so there was a communist party in cuba at the time and they were pretty powerful but they kept they were orthodox marxists they're like no we need to uh develop industrially before we can have a socialist revolution it needs to follow this process of abc and chase said no let's quit whining and fight a guerrilla war they took over the country and turned it um turned to communist and then the soviet um people who were coming over to cuba at the time uh to start building relations uh chase said we proved marx wrong he said marx thought it was gonna we were gonna industrialize and then turn to socialism and the western countries were going to do it first and the russians the soviet union ambassador said no you didn't prove mark strong you proved the cuban communists wrong because marxism doesn't go by this step-by-step process you know a b c d marxism recognizes that history's in constant motion and at times you know it goes away forward at times it goes back and things don't develop in a straight line um so so the russians tell them you proved your own communist strong you didn't prove marxism wrong and i don't know necessarily where i was going with that but if you're optimistic and we need to be optimistic and ready to adapt i guess to our material conditions is the point of bringing that up yeah i was going to say that's funny because precisely the russians and i think it was 70 it was in the 70s 1870s um there was that precise problem that that chad thought he had proved wrong because of course marx in the in the manifesto talks about socialism coming about in industrialized nations and in other places as well um so you have this one militant this russian militant versus who sends marx a letter and and she's like um we have people here that are talking about russia not being able to be socialists because we haven't industrialized we haven't had our capitalist epoch um and so we have marxists that are promoting capitalism in order to then have the necessary stuff to have socialism um is this correct because the peasantry seems to be ready for socialism and marx writes five drafts he writes five drafts the first one is like 40 pages then it's 25 then it's 30 and then the one he ends up sending is like four pages and what he basically says is that my studies were specific to europe these epochs that i'm talking about are specific to europe socialism your peasantry has not it doesn't have the individualist spirit that develops in the ethos of capitalist countries and thus if you can have socialism you don't have to pass through capitalism so that's funny that um that you mentioned when when the soviets go to cuba and they they basically tell jade no it's it's the communist party from cuba that you're proving wrong not marx um but yeah overall that that spirit of of being able to do something of that something um is conceivable it's possible right and we hear this all the time through like capitalist propaganda but um i think it's a helpful mentality to think about especially in relation to revolutionary struggle because without it i mean what's the point if something's not possible what's the point and the overall marxist project is precisely this like the bourgeois theorists uh make capitalism uh capital they think that objectification the work that one does to make something is capital that's what the bourgeois theorists were doing calling the structures that exist now as universal structures they have always existed and what happens when you're facing yourself against a system that has always existed against a state that has always existed against social relations that have always existed that where's gonna where is your inspiration going to come from if you're fighting against something that has that's eternal it's basically fighting against the god so what marx marx's project is saying not just hey smith ricardo says you're wrong but it's saying that your theories are a result of a specific epoch it's not universal it's very specific to our time and because it's very specific it's obvious that it's going to change in the future just like feudalism change and everything else before that so the left has forgotten this and it's it's treating it it's has treated the the universalization ethos of the bourgeois theorist with with capitalism too seriously it has treated the fukuyama statement of of capitalism being the end of history way too seriously and um it has forgotten that we can have a new end of history basically nice i like that i think that might be a good place to leave off that was a really good good tangent there so thank you guys for watching um leave any recommendations for videos you want to see in the comments um and and yeah i've had some people asking me to do workout videos given that we've been talking about becoming the new man if i get enough requests i'll start doing a short 30 to 50 minute workout videos i saw uh dr asitar bayar was doing uh meditation videos that's another great thing for your mental health uh pretty cool shout out to you to do a like a thing where we put like uh um snippets of like soviet workout lifting videos because um their methods were really successful they brought him to cuba and cuba would do really really good in the olympics um yeah like a 12-time world champ from the soviet union right here hell yeah yeah yeah we wrestled iowa state the other day and they had a cuban at 197 who was like about two feet taller than me and jack he was really built oh yeah wonder if he was on that soviet lifting program yeah i don't think cuba has developed their programs much since i know in baseball at least they're they're pretty much teaching the same thing that they were 40 50 years ago but i mean it's working cubans are there's like 29 in the mlb they make the the country with the fourth most players in the mlb coming from a small island of what 9 10 10 million people so yeah in wrestling you got anthony h media right now he just came over he's a jacked dude they don't know how old he is he's like a freshman in college but everyone's like that dude's like 27 but he is a beast then you got yoel romero too obviously in mma these jack cuban dudes uh oh who's the other uh yalies bonnie rodriguez is a representative of the cuban wrestling team who's like one of the most exciting wrestlers on the planet uh salis perez is a bigger cuban guy so yeah they're putting out these amazing athletes despite being a tiny island it's awesome yeah well that's that virtue that virtue principle the development of the new man one of the this basically the equivalent of our pledge of allegiance when we're growing up is uh pioneers pioneers for communism strive to be like jay and che is i mean we know who jay was like his discipline was insane his attitude is fortitude um so yeah that that ethic of building the new man is still quite big in cuba it's probably dying out just because of the nature of the blockade and stuff like it gets to a point where stuff starts becoming redundant um when you hear it all your life right but it's still definitely there around the circles that it should be in working class circles in cuba and not it's it's a little bit missing from academic circles but but yeah who knew yeah it's my own kind all right right oh well at least you're a bright spot in dumpster fire that is academia all right see ya everyone thanks for watching see you everyone thank you
