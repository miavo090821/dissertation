she tells people to vote the person who's on the fence is like them kind vote I ain't voting just because a lot of people believe it or because something is the status quo doesn't make it correct doesn't make it objective my beef that I would have with Joe Buon or with the Charlamagne is that you don't really have the range in many instances to really kind of push back on I think that's really where the dangerous part is when we give her access to these larger platforms that people are paying to see I'm flabbergasted that there's really people out there that think that cace Owens can come we're always putting a spotlight on what they're saying what they're doing wrong we can't even listen to Fig and figure out what we might need to deconstruct and talk about and Amanda puts a spotlight on that and that's [Music] uncomfortable hello beautiful black people have convened here on a Sunday hey hello so I really wanted to talk to y'all because F there I want to talk to you about two things this Amanda Seal's hate train we've been seeing and also um The Breakfast Club and not just the Breakfast Club Joe Buton did it first too bring in Candace Owens up there and I think these kind of thing these two things are not so unrelated actually because I I think it's interesting someone posted on on on Twitter that in the same breath that people are acting like Amanda seals is the most unlikable irredeemable plag to the black community they're like yeah yeah ask Candace Owens let's let's the white suemac someone actually said to me yesterday in my mentions like I would love for us to invite The Prodigal daughter back home not you [ __ ] talking about Amanda seals can't be invited nowhere telling me Candace Owens should be brought back home home she never been in by the way mind you so I just wanted to bring that bring that to the room because I feel like there are some complicated like this I don't even know if the discourse is as complicated around Amanda seals as people act like it is I actually don't I'm not sure it is that nuanced and fair to be honest like this idea that because I've never seen like liability be litigated on on on this level like oh she's unlikable first of all the mass consent to it but then also the decision that that means now we don't invite unlikable [ __ ] nowhere cuz I know a lot of unlikable [ __ ] and they be at stuff well they be they be they be they be abusers pedophiles godamn uh uh fat phobic colorist they be uh all type of wild crazy stuff so to me is just really really really interesting to see The Selective moral outrage or the selective measuring of likeability Cu to your point who who like Candace on so so y'all kissing enough Candace On's ass right now for y'all to just be like forget everything she's ever said about black people that she didn't made a nice profitable lucrative creative I can't I don't know it's also been interesting cuz that kind of also connects how they're treating um Amanda seals the same way they're treating Mo'Nique the same way they try to treat teraji P Henson and so there has been like a particular thing around black women who pretty much like have really great careers but the way they've been treated they've been speaking truth to power and so they've been punished for kind of being honest around like their experiences and so no you harmed me and so why should you why should I not be able to express how I've been feeling or Express the neglect because beyond the anger or the frustration that they're feeling it's hurt that all three of these women are experiencing or just feeling like hey I'm actually not I wish I was further than where I was or I wish people would embrace me more whereas like Candace Owens never had the she never had a fall necessarily because she's always been like pretty much like neglected so everybody else feels like these other black women should be grateful for the space that they have so we're going to punish you more versus like can't for all essential purposes and the student who got FS who ended up getting a c and ended up passing for all and of purposes is how I kind of look at her and so they're kind of saying like she's redeemable these other women though don't get to be redeemed or we're going to collectively just push them away and so I think that's just been an interesting thing to observe on my end I think it's how we value influence I don't I don't know that anyone I don't know in anyone in my inner circle who thinks that Candice ow is redeemable or even people that I see online I think that people feel like she's valuable because she has the influence that she has and so if they can change her narrative then that is valuable which I am completely against um I I I also think it's interesting when we get into these conversations around having conversations with Candace Candace Owens or people like her we have to be really selective I think and intentional with who has these conversations with her who can actually um dispel some of her disinformation like it and I'm and this is no shot to any of these other media Outlets but we know that she can she's not a stupid woman she's effective she's effective and she's highly intelligent because she can speak circles around a person who isn't well read who who can't you know con they can't combat what she's saying and so then it becomes dangerous then it becomes that the messaging is out there to the masses to a lot of folks who go to these outlets for their news unfortunately and then that brings us into this other conversation with like Amanda seals I actually think it's very nuanced because you have Amanda seals who's dedicated her life's work to being for the people to being truth-telling and I think a lot of us have and I think a lot of us have to not have to but there's this question that I always have is that when I have people who are telling me that I'm coming coming across as self-righteous or sanctimonious I have to figure out what my goal is and if my goal is to achieve a certain messaging and to bring people in am I achieving that goal if not then am I effectively communicating and so that's not a diss to her either because I'm a fan of hers but I do think that collectively we have to figure out how we're making things more digestible for folks and bringing folks in and I think that sometimes we get so frustrated with folks that we feel are not serious are not focused are not um activated that we push them away and so it's easier to go to The Breakfast Club and fck what's this can I curse on here try of course oh and go to what's his face [ __ ] Joe Button because that's digestible that's easy right and it's such a it's it's so complicated to me because I'm like well how do you get the message across but then you still are black woman and a black body who's forced with this likeability [ __ ] I think some of these messages just aren't easily digestible it's what I feel like it gets to is we want some of these things to be put in a pretty little package and we wanted to be said nice but there's no way to say these nice things so it's like I read the art the oped let me not say the article there was two there was the root and Essence it was the root and essence I read the Ence Ence way was way Kinder the ruse one is typical let me not let me talk [ __ ] but anyways I read the essence op it journalism journalism is a lost art but uh Essence oped I there was one part in there that I was like talking about wanting both and that was one of the only Parts I agreed with I was like yeah this is an industry that we'll talk about abusers being likable and pedophiles being likable and all these harmful people being likable you're not going to be likable in in in that industry or that type of Industry where it's like people don't want to hear the truth and some of this [ __ ] is not going to be digestible there's not going to be easy way to to hear it or for it to be said and I think people just want to acknowledge that I just want to be ignorant and comfortable I I was going to say I'm not convinced oh I was going to say I'm not convinced that it's just how she's I believe that I believe a lot of people are gaslighting whether they know it or not um consciously because I don't think it's just about the uh the uh how she's doing her messaging I think it's the message itself because when you look at who people do listen to who are the most popular black platforms or black media people they are the most abrasive confrontational disrespectful dis missive loud ass [ __ ] you can find like when I think of them every time one gets popular like why is Charleston white or whatever the [ __ ] of person we listening to you know what I mean Joe Joe Buton didn't get Popp in everyday struggle and people listening to him as a media personality because he was [ __ ] kind because he was respectful and what I realized is I I I did a video recently and I posted a clip from from Jess hilarious where she is saying um she's literally calling women dummy [ __ ] who who will recognize themselves as cisgender or you that language she's like oh you dummy [ __ ] didn't know um you were cisgender until a transom told you that and then I resp my response in the video is no I learned it in college because it's a fairly academic turn and blah blah blah blah that's it no no ad people will be in the comments attacking me on on and how like you're talking down to people or you're not bringing people in the per the person could literally be cursing you out denigrating on the other side the the real issue is the is the messaging if Amanda seals was saying what people wanted to hear I I think to be honest I think um with certain messaging I don't think they would be a gangster in the same way um but two even if let's say it is legitimate right let's say and there are some people that have legitimate critiques or different IND things they've been mad at her for saying um on the internet at different times right I've seen people make constructive critiques about her on colorism I've seen people bring up the um the the the guy the neurosurgeon and that that incident but here's my thing if let's say all that is true I can find for you 50 black people that are invited to everything that have done that and where it's like colorism let's say Amanda seals is colorist like most of hipop and and all of these famous people and all of these people that y'all love color is [ __ ] all the time I've never seen you keep them out the room or whatever I've never seen I don't see you keep you're like they're like oh she falsely accused even though I think I think they I think that situation is I don't think that's quite what happened anyhow wait wait wait wait what you talking about what are you ref you do you know this do you know what Mark Mark do you know this which thing do you know the the thing they be mad at my Sals for with the football player turned neurosurgeon guy yeah um yeah so Myan um yeah it's it's it's it's a it's a misrepresentation of what happened and and and and I I I know both of them and I know Amanda well so um Amanda is one of my closest closest closest friends in the world um and I and I I'm I was I was thinking about this um so the the the myth of it is that is that she falsely accused myin R of sexual assault or sexual harassment and that's not what she did at all she told a story about her experience with him and then she talked about other people reaching out um to her and sharing their experiences and she connected that to what was going on and she never accused him of something this this idea that she accused him something and then was proven false or lie it's just part of the broader to me culture rape culture where we always trying to construct a narrative where it looks like a woman lied about sexual assault so that we can justify not believing them she never ever lied on him and I know my I know her she never ever lied on anybody um and Amanda is not colorist at all I mean it's it's it's it's it's so strange to me uh I was thinking about the root article um and I was thinking if the roots purpose and and I I started writing for the root uh literally on day one I think I had the first blog on the roote me and Melissa Harris Perry Mark is everywhere and I'm just and I remember the mission I'm only I'm not saying that to flexx I'm saying that to say like on day one they their literal Day One mission was we want to uplift black people we want to tell a story about black people that doesn't get told in mainstream media we want to celebrate us I mean skip Gat started it you know um and so then they've reaffirmed that mission all the time when they do their route 100s and when they do all this that and the third and I was thinking you're writing a piece that first all feels like it could have been written in a high school newspaper and second um you're talking about why people don't like somebody what the [ __ ] does that have to do with uplifting black people let's say it's true let's say she's unlikable she she's I don't find her unlikeable again she's like my sister she's family to me but but if let's say she were so what why is that a story you want to advance just in general right second why is the story you want to advance about a black woman right and third if the bul of her time is spent uplifting our issues right getting Negroes to vote getting people to pay attention to sexual violence thinking of you see what I'm saying thinking about black upliftment in general you know what uh her post a couple weeks ago that went viral holding roal test forar around what black people's wildest ancestors Wildest Dream should be and it's not capitalism right um whether it's talking about Palestine right whatever she's doing if y'all rocking with it what value does it have to discredit her right if but if you paint a picture that nobody it's like it's like if you were starting Olay if you were starting God forbid um a movie blog a movie a movie YouTube channel about movie reviews right cuz you right cuz she has terrible judgment about movies we there want people to watch your Channel about movies I wouldn't write an article week before talking about how you got Love Jones wrong right right even though I was right but yes you were totally wrong but let's say you were right it's like I love I love I convince people that you're right that that I'm right about that one movie Yes like now no one's going to [ __ ] with your movie channel cuz I've constructed you in the public imagination somebody who doesn't know movies yes so if I say she's somebody y'all shouldn't trust she's somebody y'all shouldn't like she's somebody y'all shouldn't [ __ ] with which is implicitly what they do with the root article then all I'm doing is Mak it hard when she tells people to vote the person who's on the fence like [ __ ] that them kind of [ __ ] vote I ain't voting oh pal [ __ ] pal like if you actually care about black people this don't make sense on top of the Petty and childish and I would say largely inaccurate right you know you know what I think is interesting too the kind of mass consent like normally you see black people talk so much about like we we we we love to start a conspiracy about what's happening behind the scenes who's being black ball who's being this and we so badly want to see behind the scenes and then when there are usually black women who let you know they are being black walled and how the mechanics going there's so much ey like what you saw from Mo'Nique what you see for Amanda seals and what I find interesting is I don't really know what people want from Amanda seals because the original clip that went virro they're like oh it was Amanda complaining about being black ball that wasn't it she was she was on a live talking directly to her own audience her own followers who who check into her and she said thank you so much for that y'all [ __ ] with me if it weren't for this affirmation that I do get for y'all I wouldn't receive it otherwise because the industry doesn't [ __ ] with me and then everybody jumps in to be like the industry don't [ __ ] with you why you talking I'm like that's what she said and she's comfortable she acknowledged that she was saying thank you to her own audience and then everybody and then the fact that you then see the industry do it because when the [ __ ] ever has it been discourse just like not an incident not nothing just her expressing her feelings on her own live about the fact that people don't [ __ ] with her and then the need for Publications like Essence and Sh to jump in and they're basically she said that I've never been invited to you know Essence this and blah blah blah and for those Publications to then turn around and be like yeah let me explain let me let me hash out why this person is so unlikable like that's ever been a ground that's crazy no yeah not only is it crazy I think that the the center piece of this is uniqueness and you SE a piece of this is nuanced in terms of how we're able to engage in dialogue my beef that I would have with Joe Buton or with the charlot man is that you don't really have the range in many instances to really kind of push back on some of the the nuances that they making you feel me when Nicki Haley took her ass on there on Breakfast Club and [ __ ] she was making all different claims I feel like it's like hey you ain't got the rain Charlotte you feel me and it's like no I I look up to Charlotte in terms of the way he's able to be in but I think that the way in terms of that he brings in political abundit and you and and and I feel like you overcompensating for how you're able to get in to understand what's going on I think it does dangerous things you feel me for us in the community because I know a lot of folks to point sh made here is like hey they not F to go turn turn on Olay they F to go watch Joe Biden Jo Joe Buton they F to go watch you know I'm saying Breakfast Club when he make a claim about you know I'm saying uh uh reffin conservative policies that lock up black people while talking about how the system lock up black people that that to me from an educational standpoint that doesn't you feel me hit good with the students and with the audience and I think that it literally creates rhetorical violence material violence you feel me I think it really literally creates distancing between people that's really doing the work and people that ain't doing work especially when you think about the Nuance of what they saying about Amanda seals you feel me so Amanda seals can be right most times but you can over sensation Broken Clock getting right twice a day yeah is what was your question when it comes to The Breakfast Club when it comes to I'mma just sck with The Breakfast Club because I don't think Joe button's doing anything but trying to get more famous and more money but I think specifically with The Breakfast Club I feel like there is this reach to try to Rebrand especially on charlot M's and to try to get what we would call more serious or more political or and I think that he wants to have that range right and I actually I actually am like well I I have to ask myself well I we shouldn't just say that's not you don't have it you shouldn't do it right BEC or cuz I feel like he knows that he has the platform he knows it he's and I think that he's trying and and and stumbling to to be more responsible with the plat form what what is it that we would ask of him if he's going to engage in these kind of interviews like what are the things in which that can solve some of this where like is it bringing on fact Checkers is it having more research is it having better producers like what is it because he has the thing now but he he's not equipped like he's he's in the seat but he doesn't have the cabinet behind him to like fully like arm him for like who's coming on there this what I say I agree with that I agree with to extent but I also don't want to hold the Breakfast Club to a different standard then we hold NBC CBS FOX CNN because I'm not making a statement I'm genuinely asking okay yeah no no I know you're not I'm saying I find that sometimes people when they watch Like Larry Elder go on to The Breakfast Club or or Candace Owens they'll be like nobody challenged her and then I watch on CNN every day Republican senators or Zionist leaders or whoever say the wildest [ __ ] and no one could challenge or they push back once for half an inch like wait you're saying all black people are monkeys do you have any evidence of that and they say all black people are monkeys they go let's just move on right sh Man actually made that point to me yesterday because he did call me up because I because I said something about them um uh bringing on Candace Owens and he and he kind of made that point and what I said to him was this is about personal responsibility you're correct right you're like why do black people why are you getting the same kind of this outrage and I'm like because you have a black audience you have a black audience who sees you as a as a black platform you have a black community that looks to you to to do certain things and then they they expect you to assume a different kind of responsibility in the matter on what you should who you should platform and if you do how they should be appropriately challenged and whether or not you you choose to assume that that personal responsibility or you see it in that same way is is up to you but that's why that's why you're getting something different than those white Outlets are getting we have a great expect and I think you're and I think actually raised the points yeah um that that reflect what's possible right so so when Larry Elder went on The Breakfast Club um um uh but Tes and figuro was there too and so she was pushing back charag was pushing back Envy was pushing back I I think that now did I agree with all of the points that were made or all the push backs no I you know um and I hit him after too that's my man you know I hit him up after say yo you should bring on name like three black women um political pants and or um political scientists who could who could at least come on and do like a response video right you don't want like like when after October 7th they had the ADL come on Jonathan greenl and then they had me come on after so we didn't debate each other doesn't always have to be a debate yeah yeah just be like all right you talk for a half hour and then bring somebody else on for a half hour and I think there's a way that The Breakfast Club does do that so after cace Owens you may get a string of people ranging from a political Leti this to Dr Umar right who will all have a different take and a different reason for not agreeing with Candace that's fair I appreciate that but but but there is one thing I would add um on this particular point of C because I think the Breakfast Club actually does a decent job of that normally um my only push back my only push back would be that with Candace Owens as she kind of does this tour this black people tour you know right before she got fired and probably more after she gets fired black people love to bring people back home we love to believe people are the prodigal children even if they not which is your point O right like she was never home you know if we believe that that she was never home then the problem would bring her on is that we normalize her that's what I explained to charl man I'm like you're legitimizing her think like like for example like she made a video she made a whole documentary about George Floyd why George Floyd was a was human garbage and didn't die from police but died from like that's that's a very dangerous thing so if we bring her on but don't challenge that right um she's transphobic right she says transphobic things she trans antagonistic at the very least right she's very transphobic we don't challenge that so we like five things that that that Candace does that we find problematic and then we bring her on and talk about the two that we agree with because what polite black people do right we talk about the [ __ ] we rock with you about we not going sit fight with you about now people trust you you legitimized the voice and that's what I was explaining to Charlamagne this woman is a quite literally a paid for token of white supremacy and I and I think I want stay on that point for a second because there a lot of people talking it's like interesting to me how people in one breath they want to try and pretend this woman is some kind of Genius her intellect is so unmatched why we should listen to and the other on the other hand they want to paint her like you know she's ignorant like she like one discussion and explain all like oh you know that's be of black people and she be like oh right like it's an accident what she does this woman knows what she's doing this is a calculated this is a decision this is a choice this is a business she understands she has been a black woman in America too this is a woman who originally started over on the left and liberal and on that side and when that didn't work for her she pivoted right she made an executive decision she doesn't need to be explained anything there's nothing to be cudle there's nothing to be broken down to she is there for a reason there are people who cut her checked there are people who need her to have specific kind of messaging and you know what purpose she serves she is she is whenever black the white people and racist will always embrace the one black person that is willing to speak against the collective what is the collective opinion and what is better for the collective and that is her job and she knows that's her [ __ ] job and it becomes a problem when you then take her like we we have that understanding most people at sense know they're trying to disregard this woman what it is she is an agent for white people and the right to say oh this is our this is what black people think we have a black person saying this we know what her job is but she is not a voice that we listen to and we tune into but if you take her and you put her on our black black platforms where people trust and you say and you you try to essentially rehabilitate her you kiky her you give her the things you show and you highlight what people won't find unreasonable then they trust that person someone they can listen to and what I tried to charl manne tried to to when we were talking about this kind of painted as as though you're not having enough faith in black people like I don't think black people are smart enough to discern and I'm like this is not about black people people in general are consumers the average human being is a consumer the reason why we have commentators the reason why you have thinkers and people that you trust is so that you can you can kind of defer to them and lean on them and you don't have the time to scrutinize everything that you say when you legitimize somebody is somebody people could go to listen to and that's what you're doing when you say Hey listen to what she said on Palestine or listen to what she said on one other thing me and people go okay well if she's a trusted voice I could listen to on these good things then she's a trusted voice I can listen to on the other things and what people don't understand is the the issue and I was explaining this to Charlamagne he was like oh there are people who watch her are people who like these things are explaining to me why certain aggressive people they have on there are well-received and I'm like that's a [ __ ] bad thing yes I'm not I was like I'm not unaware that black people have a lot of uh regressive views or socially conservative views or or tenants of white supremacy that we have not recognized our tenants of white supremacy so we will unwittingly Embrace that we need you need to be presenting people the information to unlearn that y not feeding it to them like oh yeah they like that and then using that to make that right like that I think there's a huge a huge huge huge problem with bringing a Candace some once's up there and it's important to remember that while you've done that you've already legitimized this woman who already has millions and millions how many people are going to see if you go bring on whoever next week you know whatever you bring on the Str exactly but you done made a hoopla and a spectacle around bringing this woman and it's honestly you got to really think around I talk to it about my students all the time like you cannot be lazy consumers of information and so I'm teaching them like how to site their examples challenge ideas understand how to like navigate multiple media sources but the reality is like we have a lot of lazy consumers especially in the social media era in the attention economy and like what does it mean to get as many eyes on you and keep them on you the reality is somebody like a Joe Buton someone like a Charlotte M someone like a Candace Owens which is different from Amanda seals is that they are great broadcasters and that's the thing like knowing how to deliver information that capture people's attention and hold them there I particularly I enjoy Amanda Sals as a broadcaster but I can understand how she's drawing in a way that like you're giving me information I have to sit with where the other ones are just like I can take this at face value because I'm still entertained in a kind of way people get tired of me talking cuz I'm a teacher right so I got to break these definitions down make sure I'm held accountable make sure that there's an intended change that's the reality but when I look at other adults who are seeing somebody like uh Candace Owens go on and speak to the economic anxieties that they may be facing speak to this not being like a traditional Community speak to like the black man needs to be in the home and when she's talking about these points particularly on The Breakfast Club talking about them on Joe Buton these are she is speaking to a particular base that they're angry she's speaking to a base who's just like I am tired of this political system I'm tired of where we are going socially and so because of that people grabble on to her quick hop takes that she has cuz in reality oh yeah well if I got more money during Trump's thing I'm going to talk around the stimulus chats that we got great and now we're going to look at Biden who just does not Market the stuff that he has passed very well and so people have to dig for this information where I can just say boom boom boom boom boom here's the spark notes this is where Candace Owen plays a role and the reality is when you go onto a platform like Joe Buon or The Breakfast Club you run circles around these [ __ ] because they're little they do not they don't communicate as well with each other they can't run these similar circles and so what he's inadvertently doing is posturing her as the expert him as the learner which makes everybody trust her opinion more and because they trust her opinion more he now has made her an expert that people want to rely on more so again I think the social kind of space that we're in right now the attention economy the influencer economy that we're in lends itself to somebody like a Candace Owens because now who's the teacher who's a student now that charlem Ms in his role as a student and not the agitator or Communicator now everybody else is going to follow along with Candace Owens and I think that's really where the dangerous part is when we give her access to a breakfast club access to these larger platforms that people are paying to see because she will never in her life and maybe if charlamagne's like hey I think you should talk to Angela Ry let's see what happens now Grant I don't think she would bring her onto a platform like that but to have somebody who go toe-to-toe and you can politically educate your AI do it so Angela wouldn't debate her because she wouldn't want to I remember when I did one interview with uh where and I hope I don't think they mind me saying this yeah I was about to interview go down to sit down to Duke Candace's show uh a couple years ago and I got this FaceTime at like 10: in the morning and it was it was Angela and and uh and Amanda like breaking down to me why I shouldn't be doing this [ __ ] it was like the light Mafia and they was going hard I was legit scared too you know and all the arguments were around legitimizing somebody because it's like you you can beat her in a debate you know what I mean that's not the issue right you you can you can you can I was going to say that yeah it it innately legitimizes it once you once you constantly reinforcing this idea that we need to be responding to the right and I had this conversation with charlam man because he specifically said um he said he was saying that what our side doesn't do well is that we're always responding that the right starts the thing in the clips and use this our advantage while all while simultaneously putting us in a position of response where it's like we're always supposed to be platforming these people and replying to these people and letting them run a conversation blah blah blah blah blah and all you do is legitimize it and something I feel like people don't recognize this the right does not spend their time platforming leftist voices they do not contend with us with they don't have to contend but if they're not letting our views they recognize they like the right's entire Playbook is to keep our message from being heard they do not try to respond to it they do not figure out how to debunk it what they do is they they censor us they ban books they try to get rid of our access to the rooms and there's a reason for that because they recognize that the ideas that are the most pervasive and the most harmful are not what are the strongest or whatever they're what's heard the most what they people have reinforced constantly so I think in and of itself the fact that you're even saying the the message that that Candace Owens is even somebody worth hearing worth replying to it makes people feel like it's worth something worth scrutinizing in the first place you L intellectual sh I actually think it it also pivots them as always the problem and if I if we're drawing the parallel between how people are talking about Amanda Seals versus like Candace Owens and loving like Oh Come Back Home it infantilizes number one black people to be like yes we are we are we all live within the system of white supremacy and we've been indoctrinated but we also have a responsibility to deconstruct and decolonize our thinking and I think sometimes we do this infantilization within each other of like well she just don't know no better she does no better she knows what she's doing and she's utilizing these tools for a reason but also the continuous kind of like I think of George Santos on zway and like how we all always brings them to on like leftist or liberal platforms to argue with them and kind of try to point out poke in their argument they don't do that to us the one thing with Amanda seals Amanda seals she's talking to people who already are kind of on this side like she's talking to people at least in in how I receive her in a lot of her videos is like I'm not platform people platforming people that I know already don't [ __ ] agree with me or I'm not wasting my time arguing with them I'm not going to platform their ideals and what they're saying I'm going to talk to people to to further unpack and now that you start to get triggered in way of like now I got to do some type of deconstruction in my own thinking because I can't always look at what conservatives are doing I can't always they have their base you know what I'm saying these people that say these hateful transphobic anti-black homophobic um anti- or or Zionist things right not anti-zionist but Zionist things they have their base and they're working with it and my my my frustration has been noticing that we're always putting a spotlight on what they're saying what they're doing wrong we can't even listen to Fig and figure out what we might need to deconstruct and talk about and Amanda puts a spotlight on that and that's uncomfortable when you have to start thinking about well [ __ ] I might have some stuff that I have to deconstruct still I can't always sit and but look at the bad guy what they're talking about over here there [ __ ] over here that we also have to deal with but they're not platforming what we're saying ironically she gets accused of though is playing the victim which is because but she does it a lot what do you mean um I was going to say um are we talking about Amanda or we talking about Candace I'm talking about Amanda people position Amanda as though she's playing the victim um within her own Community but it's like when that mirror is held up it's a very uncomfortable thing to reckon with yourself and that's the thing like even when we're talking about Palestine and Israel you know when I was discussing that like how what are the ways in which you embody Israel's policies how do you show up in that oppressive way within your own life and it's like we can just say Israel is the big bad wolf Candace Owens the right the big bad wolf but like how many of our people don't are not in support of the trans Community how many of our people are not in support of black women for real unless they want to [ __ ] how many people are just like you know black capitalists and like blind to how harmful that is so like these are the conversations that I think make people really uncomfortable you're going to get pushed back but like again this I one I'm flabbergasted that there's really people out there that think that Candace Owens can come home I really thought that people just wanted clicks and likes I'm just like wait what okay this is a learning today like this is shocked no I was just saying I'm shocked I didn't know this was real discourse I thought people was playing games I'm not shocked man I I live in Texas I live in Texas I'm born and raised in Texas live in Houston you feel me what I my my my my beef when it comes to how homophobia and transphobia become issues for [ __ ] to kind of coales and build solidarity and Coalition on to me is what Candace Owens was kind of damn near able to exploit when she went on to that thing what I know is that before cace Owens did this little tour she had a few bite-sized pieces that went very viral and it was black people being like when she's right she's right you never see they CLA she WR about transness trans identities gender identities feminism so for me it's still to get like to me the former debator start coming out and it start okay if me and you are debating and I choose to engage in this argument from particular way I am making it where I'm positioning you as an authority expert because now I'm trying to go back and forth with your ass but I'm also doing some things by defining what is I'm defining what it is not so I think that to maris's point about like the the to me like the uh teacher student orientation it literally becomes for me it's like you you not positing yourself you know I'm saying the way you was going at other people you know I'm saying the way you went at little mama you feel me you not positing yourself you're not you're not being antagonistic with these two specifically Alex Haley Nikki Haley and this so for me it's like again the it's not saying you shouldn't do it you feel me to get to the point you had asked earlier is like so what what what could charlot manne do to make it where we can have these conversations and to me it's like hey prep preparation as a former debater you go do your research you go make your speaking points you go have your writers and your producers really position you in a way that make it where you can still be the position of expert on your Channel and not become the student that is being hard though man that might be too much hard for somebody up at 4:00 in the morning every morning doing a show every day Candace ow is not going on a show every day though like Candace ow is not going on a show every day and to me like what's the difference between black media and White media if we feel like the standards that white media said we gotta get you you I've hosted Rising on the hill which is a very right or rightwing show you're excellent on there by the way thank you thank you and often times the things like what people need to understand right people don't want you to be in these debates right like debate these people and blah blah blah you cannot con debates do not convince anybody other than who was already on those teams period like that's that's just the truth right like you will see there have been a bunch of debates on Rising that have gone viral on Twitter and blah blah blah blah blah and if you go with the left like celebrating me and you go look in the YouTube comments and they calling me everything but Ault you know what I mean they not watching that they not this um and what I realized and what happens in a lot of those debates it's not about what you say a lot of what the WR is saying is ridiculous it's [ __ ] ridiculous and insane and inflammatory and offensive on its face if you could simply ask a question just or just just framing who Candace Owens is who she was what she what it is that she does would have been enough to to discredit her voice you know what I mean from from being somebody that people listen to legitimately but none of that was done and and and Charlamagne will admit to his own self that that no push back was uh was had like and I do recognize that the reason why you've seen cace Owens be diesel bitsize viral is because black people are quick to go jump on a transphobic homophobic train right when they get some of that which is why when I addressed it a few days ago why I thought it was wrong like who this person is I didn't even get to that let's just talk about what this woman thinks about black people her core platform is anti-black like that is her agenda like this is what she has said this is a woman who said the the the the police officers got everything right with bana Taylor this is somebody who who like I mean would turn around and leave yeah there's there's a couple things that are at play like as I look at this entire thing I think one is I will start so what I enjoy about what Antonette does on her show is she will ask the questions when presented with just objective information right and now how do I sit down with this information that's going to be super important what I think is what the issue is when you get to larger media that you know follow your journalistic integrity if that exists anymore there is this push I think for black media what does it mean for us to be objective and for us to be credible often times we've been pushed as like oh there's no way for black media to be objective or follow this journalistic Integrity because they're already emotionally attached to this thing there's already this piece that's attached and so often times when I look at it I'm just like yeah no we should be frustrated with the conditions that we're existing in cuz that is a real thing that does not dismiss the fact that objectively these things are happening and now how am I responding to it so I think right now what I've noticed some black platforms and it's all different types like even um pause with Sam J right she was trying to explore like what does it look like to look at all sides of this particular thing because we don't see enough objectivity in a space of influencers we don't trust people's opinion anymore and so like I think when we kind of bring on the opposite side or why we invite the opposite side in is because we're just like let's check all of the boxes I think the last piece is that what Candace Owen speaks to is what some of us grapple with a lot of the time within our community and I hear it in barber shops and just regular conversation is like what is public accountability versus personal responsibility of the black community should we be reaching out for other people to have to save us or should we be the ones pulling ourselves up what Candace Owens speaks to is what a lot of black people say behind closed doors is just like well they're committing the crimes and they're doing this and we need to stop and we need to look at this because we get to absolve everybody else from the conditions that white supremacy has created and so a lot of people I've noticed especially just being a teacher honestly working at the University that I work at I'm just like oh there is like this push for objectivity and this push for well that's great all this Dei stuff we can keep talking about the system but I think when we look at the role of media look at the role of politics and how that impacts all of us she speaks to the space where a lot of us are just like well we can't wait on the system anymore so it is on us now somebody I mean to me then it's like well then let's find somebody who has that impulse but loves black people that partan exist I think part of the problem is I think part of the problem is treating objectivity as reinvesting in the status quo is that we've been convinced that to be objective to be fair to be rational is to legitimize both sides is to ha both sides and that both s and and let me tell you how that works in application right this is something I I recognized in law school in public and becoming a public defender when I went in law school they would teach you to believe in the aders in the adversarial system right like a lot of you would talk to who would become a prosecutor or who would become a defense attorney and they have the same explanation right up until the end because they're being taught that the system is right the adversarial process is just both sides need to be there and when you think like that you believe in the other side that's how you end up with defense attorneys and public defenders who believe that you should be getting punished who believe that this is appropriate they're supposed to do to Bear you know what I mean because you see it that way I don't think objectivity is is giving people just because a lot of people believe it or because something is the status quo um doesn't make it correct doesn't make it objective or doesn't make it a legitimate Viewpoint that should be heard and I don't think I think it's a mistake that we've lived in a world where the status quo has never been objective the status quo has never been both sides the status quo of the world out there does not say it needs the black opinion at the table or it needs the left opinion or it needs that that is not what the status quo is the status quo and the objective has been what is is white supremacy and what suits that white majority and for them and it has never included us so I think it's a problem when we take we get platforms and we manage to grasp a little area of airtime of space and we say objectivity is to keep presenting their [ __ ] sides when I worked at huff post I remember um Ariana Huffington had a policy of like we're not bringing the other side of climate change right it's a fact it's real where the the you know what I mean like we're not bringing somebody to tell us just like we're not going to bring the other side of round earth yes you know what I mean yes we we had we had the same policy it wasn't just like um scientific stuff we we had the same policy on on beating children right we weren we weren't allowed to bring people in to bring the other side of whether you can spank or beat it's really just beating beat kids you know because we had we took we took a moral position on that right so I think it's I I don't think that we have to we hit some super high ground by legitimizing positions that we think are either morally or scientifically or intellectually untenable and to your point I mean everybody said it but ol you said it really in a very particularly interesting way to me was um um how the Right Moves you know they'll own right-wing media Outlets will only have you on to they'll show the other side if the other side is weak yes Hannity and Colmes Hannity and Colmes for years was was the was the was the was the liberal conservative Duo you know they found comes at last in fact the show lit was called hand and liberal to be named later right into to the end and then they founds say Sean not seanes uh Alan no did no didy I was like damn man it was all good I like you scrambling and scraping Daddy no Diddy though no CU that's a whole conversation to be had about that but I got to say now that we just brought that out it's fascinating how the most residual part of the Diddy Scandal crisis is his sexuality and not sexual assault lingering part all we talk about which is why Candace Owen is able to have the [ __ ] platform that it just it all but anyways ex exactly Mark Mark you have to leave soon so I want to ask you because you've sat down with Candace Owens right and you've gotten feedback on that would you do it again if not why if so why and then I also am curious because I I I hear this and this is fruitful for me I'm learning a lot for this idea of like we are taking a moral stance we're not having the other side on I'm not disagreeing with that what is the rebuttal then cuz I need language for it what is the rebuttal then for folks who are like well this is bias this is no longer media this is no longer journalism you are being strategic with your messaging and this is specifically what Candace Owen says this is why other people won't talk to me because they want you to be pawns they don't want you to hear the other side and she weaponizes this intention I mean it's propaganda it's all propaganda swear God I mean that argument that they make assumes that there is an objective media and that we're exact diverging from it as opposed to saying all of this is a political set of choices CNN was straight media MSNBC was leftwing Media Fox News was right media and all of them were Zionist in their in their presentation just as one example right so so it it it's it so so you would watch the objective you watch all these different types of media and believe that this thing was true because it's not being mentioned it's not just about what you talk about it's what you don't talk about yes and so I would say all media is political so I I would start there but then I would also say to them look we're willing to have different sides of a debate but what we won't do is presume that that everything is debatable so I might say What's the best way to stimulate the economy that's a different question right then um at some point are we going to continue to ask if if if Barack Obama was born here right is I mean because we did that in the media for I mean at some point this isn't a debate you're just legitimizing nonsense yeah you're just leg is not a debate you know and she using them points right and some of those points get smuggled in maybe not from Candace but but from somebody but some of these mainstream people also we can have experts in who have alternative opinions not influencers who have alternative opinions I watched um I watched all five hours of it I watched all five hours of this [ __ ] right there was a five hour debate on Instagram between I mean on YouTube between on Israel Israel Palestine between um Norman finlin on the left on one side of the issue and uh this guy named um Rani right felstein maybe the most knowledgeable um political historian of Gaza World um MIM Rani is a Palestinian active theorist writer whatever right on the other side they had uh uh beny Mars the leading Israeli historian and the fourth person was Destiny the streamer right Destiny has more views than all of us in this room put together right I've been on Destiny show and I've I don't I don't have an issue debating Destiny or talking to Destiny but Destiny was then positioned as an expert on something why because he's the one everybody knows and he's the reason people showed up some people show up to watch him get dog walked other people showed up to watch him win but either way that's what happen so so when cace enters the room to talk about policy she's the biggest name the breakfast C could have brought on a right-wing policy expert to articulate right-wing legitimate right-wing points and then we could have that debate but if the person would come in say hey I'm famous and then set some [ __ ] on fire and then and then we just fight over it that to me that's a different kind of kind of approach and so part of it is not that the right wants to have different perspectives you can have different perspectives the question is why are you why are you the best person to have this conversation I think people have to I think as we have to learn that everything is propaganda that as consumers everything is framed to us in the way right like when you're when you're in court and you get a set of facts right you're on the defense versus you're the prosecutor youall have the same set of facts you have the same set of facts and you go home and you come up with a story you literally decide how you're going to story tell this the other side here is your version of the events of the same facts at at at opening statements right this is theion the it's the way like me me and two people I remember at the beginning of law school having a debate with one of my classmates and I was explaining why gentrification was bad he comes to come debate with me but he doesn't he isn't even familiar with um familiar with it you know white person why they want defend it but he starts debating it debating to support gentrification and he calls it gentrification and I stop him and I say that's your first mistake if you want to be a GST me you need to call it Redevelopment you know what I mean it's it's the way that you go about framing things it's the way that you go about Brandon it's all propaganda we're all engag in a song and dance of propaganda it's just about what the interests are in that propaganda who is it meant to serve are you centering and how ethical you are being but we're all in propaganda and I think that's the mistake that we that we allow right where and I and I think this is a mistake our side makes too we're always I realize this when I work with activists and organizers and people on the ground and and the academics I think we're always trying to teach everybody everything that we know you know what I mean we're always trying to get into the minutia with people and give them the provision and the statute and the yada yada y That's not what it is and that's not what the right is doing they are they recognize that they're in the game of propaganda explicitly that's why they get into messaging that's why they get into Logans and slogans and foolishness they start saying and they run with that nobody on this side knows [ __ ] you know but they but they but they give them the tools for that we over here not recognizing what game that we are playing we think that we in a coursework we teaching people political Theory but we we are all in a propaganda cycle so I think I think it's a a mistake when you know if you recognize that you're in a war propagandist and it's two sides why are you taking the other side's propaganda that they have C they've curated and your using it you're using your Law and Order you calling well Biden's calling the immigrants illegals you you know what I mean you're taking all this all their slogans all their foolishness and and you're you're legitimizing it you're putting it up on a pedestal and you're never given an opportunity for your ideas to be heard because something I was explaining to shalam manne was he was talked about how his audience receives people when they do bring Progressive voices or you know um trans people up there and how they're they the audience is angry and I'm like well if you spend all year feeding not feeding them the tools to understand that feeding them propaganda from the other side then by the time you bring the people there they're being lashed out on they they don't understand they haven't been given that you legitimize Str her normativity to the point that this easy to come out exactly and also other people are angry when you bring people like kenth Owens but you don't look at that anger as a same and why is that why you value the anger you know what I'm saying and to the point of like objectivity and and and you bringing up that we are all in this propaganda war is like because we are and think within Academia and like left leftist you're right we try to well we let's look at all both sides and because they've we live in a system that has framed or gaslit us in this moral argument of like if no you can't do propaganda propaganda is bad even though we're all you know we're all literally the dissecting propaganda it's it's everywhere there's nothing wrong with saying yeah I am trying to get you to be on this side absolutely but left LEF is they don't liberals they don't want to do that I am trying because this is what the facts show these are the facts that I have these are facts that I see you're absolutely correct I'm trying to sway your opinion I'm trying to change your values and your morals yes let's stand 10 toes down in that but we play this like more morality game of like no well we're we're again like I said we pin it on like the conservatives do that we're nothing like the conservative no they do this they didn't I am trying to get you to to to your opinion I'm 100% constructing arguments and messaging in a way that I think will be effective to you like that you engag in in mass media right they do do that they do do that when they want to they do that with with things that they're doing that with gasa and Israel they do it when they want to so it's like you know how to do it so what the [ __ ] are y'all doing over here and it's like I their messaging is so uneffective that it's I think that we it leaves us desperate to a to a point where all we can do we right now the hope this is crazy to me we're getting a little bit off topic but I'mma go there The Hope right now with the [ __ ] Democratic party is to is that Trump will be more visible louder than ever and that is what they're riding on getting Joe Biden reelected that's their whole [ __ ] game plan is like hopefully people will hate him so much and he'll be so loud that we'll win and it's like they rely on these clips that's their game plan they rely on being in conversation with these folks because there's they're not Proactive or imaginative enough to really create the world that they're saying that they want and and that's to me the Crux of the whole thing it's like you don't really know how to get this [ __ ] done without dismantling the [ __ ] that you you've built and so now all you can do is say they're so bad keep us we'll make it at least manageable I I think we have to like analyze like intentions and something I've been I've been thinking a lot more about it because I think what happens is like I have a very like obviously I have a platform media yada Yad y do all these different things but my first interest is not like engagement and fame and yada y my first interest is trying to get people onto a certain way of thinking right it's trying to shift social Consciousness for black people that is my main my my main agenda and how that I'm thinking of it and I I I shter to think for for as many people some people I believe that's an interest I'm not taking that away that that is a one of their maybe one of their foremost interests but I don't think it's the main one often because what I'm realizing a lot of people for me kind of realizing when I make I just recently wrote a Greg abbit expose I'm putting out soon and and of course Greg Abbot has been doing [ __ ] [ __ ] for 30 Years everybody knows that the name Yes Man all kind of [ __ ] and you know what I realized I put together like a two hour expose on all of why we should all be concerned about what's happening in Texas and everything Greg Abbott's done and there was no [ __ ] propaganda on him like you could go on YouTube and nobody think about it the amount of people that make video essays they spend their time there will be people who make video essays about this episode of oay and friends that they M about what I you know what I mean but there's nothing on that and I think that how how many of us like on my side of the fence that I know are genuinely on my side of the fence but spend that energy is making propaganda attacking their own side 24/7 all this this and the next thing people that are more aligned with them than not but there's like a treasure chest of these like Republicans and right-wing figures and people that actually like we could do something about local figures who are nothing on them and what I realize I think there outrage of there are a lot of people who they are against Donald Trump they are against the right they are against Republicans they're against all this but that that attention economy of when people are outraged by them in office and what they're doing feeds them you know what I mean feeds you on views feeds you on outrage in a certain way that I don't think a lot of people want to go to the effort to to do the same for the other side like I I think there's a there's an ease people feel like let me go get to Candace Owens views rather than go build up you know other view other other people or go platform the FD signifiers or whomever have you y they're like let me just go jump in that that Candace ones let me go get um let me go try to be with Joe Rogan let me go try to be whatever other right-wing podcast is happening so get not PE mixed up get not peace mixed up I think that we get into the political PE content and we get and and then we start to ignore you know what I'm saying the pop culture or other way around actually we get into the pop culture content and we don't get into the political content I know that from being from being from being an influencer it seems that if I'm not able to make my political idea conversation issue circumvent with pop culture people ain't trying to hear about it so I think go back to like thinking about like media literacy or thinking about trying like how how we are trying to teach you know what I'm saying individual it's like hey I think that now anti-intellectualism is on the rise in our country and it's being positive a lot of times as neutrality and objectivity and it's being positive as if hey if you have some intellectual analysis that is questioning the status quo we think that you are being bias and it's like H yeah it's impli bias and everything I'm just being real with you and giving you mine you know what I'm saying and I feel like it's just it just it just make it word now at a time when we are having all this suppression happen on Instagram on Facebook trying to get rid of Tik Tok you see what I'm saying uh us on the left we having to fight even more for visibility because we are being suppressed you see what I'm saying in my mind this this right here is being proliferated more in a time where we need to be doing it over here because we have a tradeoff as as a former debate coach I know if you answering this argument you answer that one you proliferating Candace Owens at the same time you have these messages that's going to be I feel like more political social economic for the progression of us that's being suppressed and you know how they trick us they trick us into believing that the reason they are actively suppressing us we are literally actively being suppressed whether it's it's meta literally setting the settings to block us out at by default as political content whether it's Elon must buying Twitter and and and suppressing algorithm and banning leftist accounts and platform and whoever his right-wing ghouls ad about to verified or then trying to ban Tik Tok we or YouTube's algorithm actively will demonetize your [ __ ] you talk about leftist stuff the algorithm you put too many black people in your thumbnail the algorithm put you in suggested right so actively press but then what happens is when there are people like the Amanda SEALS or whomever it is that speak up about that or or or even when Frederick Joseph talks about it on social media that they're that that he's being shadowbanned people go and get mad and they try to tell us the conversation becomes about how we're not good enough Messengers that we're not messaging ourselves in a way to get reach but the gag is this none of not like the gaslighting on that is so crazy because all of us have platforms that we would never be given by establishment or have been given by establishment by Media or given a job or opportunities we literally have massive platforms because we are able so much better able to effectively message that we a we are able to get around being suppressed and the fact that we don't have this access to create followings and then they tell us they tell us oh we just need to switch our messaging when it has nothing to do with our messaging has everything to do with the fact that we are being actively gay capped out of the spaces well Joe Biden invited my black ass to the White House my mess was so good and then literally months later my messaging was so good on Israel Palestine they decide to take the clearance in the same year you invited my ass on so it's to me the idea that I'm not a effective Communicator or this that and the other we know that it's cap like we know we know that it's so far from cap that it literally starts to I feel like get into how the Strategic gaslighting starts to happen how strategic gasl happened I feel like part of the structure because now because now it happened where Antoinette conscious Lee Christina oay now we have to prove that we are not like the opposition and that we have a particular moral compass that's always willing to give space to other things even if I say trans women women and you say [ __ ] trans women I should have enough Ambiance to give you time and space because your side deserves you too and it's like no that's anti-intellectual and that's a moral bankrupt idea about how you trying to spend neutrality and objectivity and also it's it's keeping the status quo legit like I've been I've been in rooms with educational Leaders with political leaders um Business Leaders here in Philly and I'm sitting there I'm just like yo there is a convers that needs to get be had because for me I'm always my big thing is like how do I Bridge academian Hood so if like the [ __ ] on the stoop don't understand what I'm saying am I effectively doing my job as well in terms of being able to communicate my information and a lot of the time when I'm in this room I'm s I'm in these rooms a lot and they're like oh you're surprisingly off of the internet Oh I thought you only did internet activism I said I I teach I do workshops I I get people registered what are we talking about right but it's interesting because once they saw my platform begin to rise there has now been almost like a oh well you're only doing this influencer thing oh well it's not as effective as it [ __ ] I said I'm an academic journals what are we talking like what are we talking about right and so like in these moments it's been interesting for me as a content creator as my stuff begins to um platform a lot more there are more people who are on like who are in these rooms that I would have naturally been excluded out of but I had asked him the question I said we're in a room full of black leadership here in Philly what makes you any different from white people in these positions of power then I get accused of saying hey why are you attacking us just like everybody else attacks us and now you should you should have you shouldn't oh what do they say you to stop begging people to give you these opportunities right and I'm like but we said if we work from inside the system which y'all are in the system then there should be some type of tangible change but they then to play the game and now because they see me being abolitionist Keys like oh well no you're too radical you're too this and so now I am no longer like the safe platform but in the same token people are in the back end having private conversations of like Maris I want your platform to be I want you to bring on more moderates I want you to bring on the other side because we think that you can Bridge what is happening with the Boomers and Gen X with younger people in gen Z your people in Millennials and stuff I'm just like but my platform was intentionally created for black abolitionists who enjoy some coffee you see and you see and you see how that's crazy that it goes from you're just an internet activist and then you see what type of change that I'm making with my platform that I had to use because I got excluded from your spaces now you want to use it in capital now you see the value but you want to use your propaganda through my platform this didn't mean nothing before right and I think it's like a you see that I've made it work cuz I the reason why I had to lean far into this is because I got fired for it the [ __ ] I was saying online I got fired from being in the classrooms and I was like I'm not going to have to work in the system or work outside of it you don't believe that we can work outside of it but then you see that oh we're actually like you said Olay our message isn't the problem we actually found because we're building platforms and we've got tens of thousands hundreds of thousands millions of people that see what we're saying and feel what we're saying that now you want to reinvite us back into these rooms but under your rules when they decided to oh not no magical Negroes no I know butay pay attention to where Amanda seals was valued in 2020 is when Amanda seals is valued is when black people need somebody to listen to who is there and so same thing happened that and I understand her frustration because nobody was [ __ ] with my good morning to [ __ ] and [ __ ] only they said do you got to say this every single morning but come 2020 people are like oh wait Maris I actually need you to talk in these uh with school whatever schools local mayoral candidates but it was so fascinating to me because now you understood my value when black people needed the most now we're in a space where we're exiting I think we're going to see a shift now that it's an election year but I can still see a frustration where Amanda is going to closer to November we'll see a different shift on how people think about Amanda because they like you on one day something I realized I think what you just said like how Amanda SS is received and that and also you proves like something that I've been recognizing they like a lot of these people who want to come to you and want to use your platform or or or want youo on particular times they like what they're like what I like to call like one day activists they believe they want one viral hit they want one viral moment they want to come to you for one day when a message is needed after something happened and the reason why you can say on that one day when they the one day that they need you you could say anything that you want you could be as Pro prolific as you want you could you could be you could be as well-rounded and really say the [ __ ] that you really want to say because they know that a one-day message doesn't mean [ __ ] you have to do it's it's what you do every day it's the way they had a problem when they heard if they he the first time you said good morning to [ __ ] and [ __ ] only it was a problem but by the time people continuously hear that that becomes normal because that's how ideas actually take hold right it's in being heard it's being indoctrinated you never convince people or change their mind once time but there'll be people who they hear you enough people don't with me but abolition no more that's not crazy like they've done heard it the people who follow me like people who I who who follow me including my own mama and family who don't agree with me half the time have have are now a against cash bail and they don't know when that happened they are enough you know what I mean information and you on something right and that's when we become a problem to them that's why they like us they will invite us for oneof apparences they like us when we go viral they like us to come talk about this and give them that moment because that's the only time we're not harmed that that thing doesn't truly isn't truly harmful to their status quo right because they like the moments where they need us to say the profound thing and what people really want to hear when the country is in a moment right that's why they liked Amanda in 2020 but they don't want to hear it every day they don't want to see you actually keep chipping away at that because that's not what they want to see happen right it's like I always said to people everybody was after the protest in 2020 everyone was like oh uh all these people went out to protest we had all these people protesting and now look and look what everyone supporting I'm like what were those people protesting the same thing is you I guarantee those people who were out there with you they might have been protesting that that that that uh black person was killed by the police but they weren't protesting the what made it possible they weren't protesting over policing that makes that possible they weren't trying to actually get rid of those things they weren't United in that and when and and and to make them United in that has to be more than that one moment is the continue beating the block every day and that's what they pedagogical concept of teaching [ __ ] over time and recognizing it's going to be like a process that happens over time and and recognizing that that that becomes the issue about kind of showing the other side if we can if we can acknowledge that the other side is a status quo that's always there to me from the educational standpoint it'll be like okay I'mma teach you black history I'mma teach you indigenous history it would sound Preposterous for you to be like what about the other side [ __ ] that's that's the Core Curriculum the other side the other side is everywhere I'm giving you the other side right now you know what I'm saying you feel trying to trick you they be trying to trick you into believing you need to like that's the the argument think it's funny is right people always trying to tell me like oh you need to listen to other side so you know what they talking about the other side is what I've heard my whole life I qu literally I swear to God I I literally you don't know how often my boyfriend I'll be like oh such and such went to every be like this and I tell him exactly oh you've seen it no I know exactly what they think we've heard those arguments a million times you can debunk their arguments you can address those arguments you can structure messaging and stuff around what you know their arguments will be based on without ever having to give more service and more air time and space one should have heard it four five times man the same we grew up in their arguments we IND in their arguments the system is their argument 4.0 in their arguments talk right they teach you their arguments in school right because that's what people don't realize you're you're dealing with curriculums and stuff that are built around a specific thing like when I think about it now as an attorney and what you know that you know how long they were spoon feeding you originalism and trying to tell you oh and like teaching you in my conservative constitutional law classes that oh the left and the Liberals are doing judicial activism versus what they're doing blah they teach their [ __ ] they messaging their talking points and their propaganda is what they feed into schools that's why you see them now trying to ban African that's why that's why the fact alone that African-American history is a thing rather than just history because America can then just carve out everything they don't want you to know like that person that's an elective maybe if you go to college a nice liberal arts college and you got a lot of money you could take that you can learn that but cut that out we'll cut that out here go some 1865 the Pres Day American history here goes some uh French ution here goes some is like hey that that is the status quo and the reason why they are Banning critical right or Banning direct inclusion or trying to ban know what I'm saying ticktockers because it is literally uh what's what I want to use it is it is is infiltrating the status quo in a way that make it where now you don't get to dictate how we know think about it two years ago nobody would talk about Israel because you knew you was going to be called anti-semitic now the education that has been literally brought into all these Realms now we have the range to make distinctions between the Jewish identity and his eyes identity now we have distinctions and it's just like that education that came through Tik Tok and Twitter and Instagram and Facebook and even these different pundits it's like that's what they pushing out against now and it's just believe and I fully believe that's the real problem with Tik Tok why you see them right now aggressively W the band Tik Tok they've been talking about it but this this this this bipartisan support you're getting for that is because T it's it's and to me it's it's squarely on on Israel and Palestine when it comes to when it comes to Tik to because that that has served neither party well right like you've never seen in all my life it has never been even of the leftist progressive voices before October 7th and it's current now you've never seen this seen of Palestine never in your life never in your [ __ ] life have you ever seen it like you could have gone every Palestine has been talked about my whole life and I've never once like where people would jump on your shoulders if you don't [ __ ] speak on on this man [ __ ] I went to the club in Birmingham I mean I I came from Alabama I'm in a club in Birmingham Alabama all [ __ ] [ __ ] got a KI on in the club I'm talking about a be in AI so to me is just showing like hey man I'm in I'm in Birmingham Alabama this St is one of the worst states when it come to education now we're starting to lean out so much and we starting to peep game that you've been pissing on my hand and telling me it's raining for a long time I now smell a piss I'm looking for the rain now you don't want me looking for the rain and it's just that to me I recognize like hey the bureaucracies the lobbyist the interest groups they all funded by corporations so if you know [ __ ] a half y' AP pack of candidates or [ __ ] you get some money from uh us uh uh Starbucks you get some money from McDonald get some money it's like now it's all hitting it and to me it go back to how we started the conversation to me the the the the way that Amanda SS has been able to push Pro Palestinian paradigms and talk about being critical of different corporations I think that has also implicated her and how she's unlikable you see what I'm saying also Candace sens is trying to fold in her idea of well I said some things about Zion if you're being real Candace ens really being anti-semitic if you're being real Candace ens really being anti-Semitic try trying to use [ __ ] she anetic as [ __ ] like sis you make you you you killing it like like that's it and that's and and and that's always a thing you know what I hate is like again when these conversations these platforms do not do the the work year round to expose people to these arguments or why this is this so there are a lot of black people that do not that do have not grasped the fact that anti-Semitism is a a tenant of white supremacy because in their mind they aren't bothering they're just conflating Jewish people Jewish people are white and blah you know what I mean they're not recognizing is that and so when they've already when you only bother to bring up these things when you want to bring up a Kyrie Irvin talking nonsense Kanye then this people don't realize it and they don't realize why a woman who is a staunch who is Candace ens is somebody who has a white supremacist ideology that and which is very consistent with anti-Semitism so there's a reason why this bigoted [ __ ] that's been aligned with that bigoted ass side of aisle the entire time suddenly her and them out of Lock and step and that's because she's [ __ ] anti-semitic that's the only reason why she's on the right side of this issue when it comes to Palestine and Israel and that's cuz she's been on some [ __ ] the Jews stuff that's exactly how with Kik in when he went on his anti-semitic tour and his white lives matter sh listen and and that's that's the reason why the out come around like this [ __ ] is about Mis educating and educating and how influence and visibility is able to push people to make decisions and or relate to other people and just acknowledging and being critical how there there are moments that literally cause division and violence and you feel me a lot of [ __ ] up [ __ ] in the community based off of visibility and based off of how different people choose to relate to each other on somebody else visibility right now there's a lot of solidarity Happ there in our community on the backs of black Trans women on the backs of black qu people on the backs of is that that that is that is happening and right now it's right now it's always been that but I'm I'm scared right now though it's because a lot of people are showing me that you hate black Trans people and black drag people more than you hate white supremacy and I think that c is Owen is is is is is is goddamn the the the the Trojan Horse in some instan in other instan she just straight up gapo you know what I mean and I think I I ain't rocking with it yeah I gota go though I I'm sorry I gota go he my kids I hear my kids like I gotta be a father yeah think this conversation has been super helpful for me as it's interesting I I had a conversation with my co-host on my show about Amanda seals and this whole thing and I was really I've I don't have the platform that Amanda seals has by any means um I don't know Amanda seals but I have been on the other side of a community that I love so much um and their their frustration with me on my messaging on how I'm messaging on how I'm how they feel like I'm talking down to them I am judging them I'm chastising them in order to get them to critically think think a certain way and I had to sit with that and it was deeply painful because I'm like yo I've sacrificed a lot done a lot and like I could be out here doing [ __ ] [ __ ] easily but this is what I'm this is what I've committed myself to and I'm still getting push back from the community that I'm in love with and doing this for that's painful and I was immediately defensive and it took me a while I swear I'm just cautioning this this is not about Amanda cuz I don't know her but it took me a while to sit and do the audit of like how can I be more effective why are people having this push back of me and as soon as I started to do that and listen it it subsided a lot more and I feel so much more effective and I only say that to say like this is super helpful because I I was not considering a lot of the aspects that y'all brought up when it comes to Amanda I definitely saw like this black woman like ability [ __ ] is [ __ ] but there are other things where it's like there's Powers at play when it comes to her so this has been enlightening for me because I don't know that I that I saw it from that kind of well-rounded um view but I also I also caution us without with the audience that we do have and like and and recognizing like in our we understand I think everybody this call understands how dire [ __ ] is how real [ __ ] is and it's like we have to get serious and the other this is trauma response when people want to go and listen to Joe Buon and listen to nonsense because it's escape the world is [ __ ] hard right and so that is one thing that I just wasn't acknowledging there was a lot of times when I was like and y'all not serious and y'all don't want to do the research and you don't want to do the work and you don't want to hear this message you anti me and it and it's not taking into consideration like I'm not anti you I'm [ __ ] tired TI and you're chastising me you're not taking any of that into consideration that you might have a capacity for some [ __ ] that I don't have well that is you know what that that's funny that you say that because in December I made a video um I made a video and I was basically like um I I I was like we need to stop treating everybody I the video is generally about the fact that we need to stop treating celebrities as our go-to on political issues and as our activists and and because we're centering them so much we're upset about this and the next thing um but it would but in the video I specifically said not everybody is an activist not everybody black has declared that they are an activist um and that they should and they should not be critiqued and chastised like they are that's not fair like life is you and Amanda funny enough it was Amanda commented to me and said I disagree everybody should be an activist and I said to her I think that is an unreasonable burden to put on people's shoulders like the average black like black person is just trying to survive they have a million things in this world people have going on and reasons why they can't commit their life to that or people just don't want to people should black people should have the freedom to have have um a freedom of life and joy and not Center their life around struggle and depression and activism if they don't choose to that's an incredible thing to wear just cuz that's what I do it doesn't mean um I think others should and Amanda didn't agree with that she thinks everybody should be an activist and I think that that might that's because she loves her people so much and I and I get that and I and I but I will say this being with being an activist and doing or doing that kind of work can can make people feel disenchanted with Community like very often people act as though it's the thing that makes you feel like oh I'm so no actually when you feel like you've committed your life to black people and black community you're always centering black people in everything you do even at your own personal detriment or your own person personal happiness and peace and then those same black people are blowing down on you every day every day is black people trying to get me to to be Pro mass incarceration every day is black people trying to get me to exclude black gay people black Trans people every day is black people trying to tell me you know trying to get me to to to see a war between black men and black women that [ __ ] right there like that can that will make you feel the opposite if you're not careful if you're not being thoughtful about that if you're not reminding yourself and taking a step back and remembering white supremacy and that our people have that you know what I mean if you're not thinking about all those things so I don't put that burden on on people I don't think black people should have that burden but I think when you do think that I think that can play in to a lot of kind of what you're saying anet and and kind of chastising our audiences and chastising black people you know like oh you need to do this you need to be reading y'all not doing this and it's like everybody can't do that like even like myself is in a position of privilege and I and I say that all the time like I'm in a I have a million different um privileges but even just in the it's a privilege to be able to pontificate like even to like to be an activist or to be a messenger or whatever most people most people let alone most black people do not get to go around the world telling everybody what they think speaking up on everything everything that they find a problem it's a privilege to be able to be like I'mma buy a million black people's books and read them and this and I say this and blah blah blah and to be be able to speak out and I think sometimes there is a way I think that frustration with being like a voice and feeling caring too much about your community and having your community like attack you or question your motives or question your intentions or question on you message all that can compound to make you like your where your love doesn't come across even though it is your love that's making you upset and making you message in a way and making you so frustrated you're seeing your people do things that are harmful to them it's really upsetting to trying to convince people to not believe something that's bad for them you know um so yeah damn no that's that's a word and that's something that I was going to reference that episode uh because I really appreciate when Anette gets like super introspective with this stuff um but like in the conversation I know I had to experience stuff like that too because there's something when you are committed to the struggle and people are just like you want to always talk around this kind of stuff right and so I also recognize when I was in that the other piece to when I was in that room full of like educational leaders which is like we're in this work every day and to me I'm just like this is your this is your job this is your N9 to5 I get that and I pushed it was just like but is this enough because in you doing this stuff every day I said I teach I'm in the work every day but for me I have the capacity to understand how Media or even just having a platform can provide an extra layer of nuance that they AR going to get into the school and so these are spaces where I look at them and I'm just like I know you're sitting here and fighting and six figures in fighting it looks a little different right cuz this is this is the piece that you're getting um and so when I listen to the conversation around like not everybody's activist I actually agree with that I don't think everybody is entitled to be an activist because people don't have the capacity even when people say teaching is inherently activist work I'm like no they're bad teachers let's not say that either like there are people who can do some of the work right and so for me I know I made an active decision to want to be committed to the struggle committed to my people and what comes on the other side of that and again Martin Luther King the church was not banging with him for half this time anyways and so we understand that historically people who are committed to a specific message do not necessarily get celebrated on all sides maybe in retrospect we can appreciate cuz if we're eating the fruits of your labor like great now every black person so that's how I kind of always looked at it is like though I am committed I am taking some hits the people who was not bang with me now I personally might not bang with you but you're at least we are now moving forward as a community and so I'm really big on like just trying to think around like what does the immediate Community need how can we then model that and slowly but surely understanding like I am still coming from a really good intent and I think when I I become a little defensive for Amanda seals in that regard because I'm just like she is committed to the struggle me may be tired of it because it sounds like the same talking points the same thing of like we don't want any more slave movies right they're all the same talking points and so even that messaging though I I offer I I I and lovingly I push back on the struggle messaging because I think even I was wound up in this role romanticizing struggle because so deeply it's what I identified with even that verbage of I'm in the struggle it's like we get it but you're you're in Liberation you're in you're into Liberation there's there and words mean things and people don't want to if they're struggling all day they don't want to come home and then get activated in in the struggle it's like okay I had a [ __ ] long day my kid needs this my kids the [ __ ] rent is out of the skyrocketing what is what how can I feel good so you Liber possibility model that's yeah that's all I'll shut up yeah so I yeah no nuh don't say that but you maybe think around like even posturing it as like I'm committed to the possibility model and the radical imagination in my head right and so I think the possibility model is even an opportunity cuz even getting feedback from me they're just like oh at least when I come to your platform Marque I see the possibility of what a free black man can look like you show me what a joyous black man can look like right and so it is also understanding like on the other side of like getting that kind of Praise are a bunch of other [ __ ] just like well I want no I want no black gay [ __ ] like doing this he's in a different kind of boat he's doing this and so I'm just like on the other side of the transformation is like that's when I understand what is the committed what is my commitment to the possibility of what could be and understanding like on the back of that that's foreign to so many people and because it's unfamiliar there's a tension that's going to exist because I don't know how to navigate an uncomfortable space so when we think about just the humanity of a person yes we don't want to have to come home to another struggle and when we're asking you to challenge yourself to think of something that is new everybody's just like but what what kind of work does that look like and I don't think we do enough capacity building on like what does the work look like and how do I exist in this and so how do we think around that in between space of like hey I see the end road now how do I hop over this tree that fell over how do I patch up this ditch that is in the ground and like really think around it from that and so I appreciate that push Anon and I do believe like that's the piece that I think we miss sometimes within the messaging is like let me build the capacity for you to be able to you know do the thing also not everyone has to do everything I remember that video o right and I remember seeing both you and Amanda disagree and being like I see what both of you are saying and then the I've recently had to think a lot about capacity because I I feel like maybe we've all experienced the similar kind of critique that I meant you're too much are you this and that and you're like well let me sit back and be like what you know what is it realizing my own capacity and what you said about like damn but I'm trying to fight for my people and here it's mainly my people that are telling me these things and attacking me and threatening me you get really [ __ ] exhausted and like you think about your own capacity and I I think it right now I'm kind of I've been recalibrating with like yeah maybe not everybody has an activist I do think everyone should at least have a certain moral belief right you can say oh free Palestine you can post it a couple times but the capacity to keep doing the work is different than having the simple moral belief and not everybody's going to do everything everything people like to say well a Mana complains too much am Mana if you want to go see certain Joy there's people who do that am Mana doesn't have to be the person that does everything she can be the person that calls the [ __ ] out and complains and and call and calls it out and points it out that could be her role and you know what's crazy though they really they when they when they decide you're something they diminish they diminish what you are in the first place they make you onedimensional because I see people saying that like I saw some tweet like oh I followed am Mana seals and I had to un after one day cuz it like it just exhausted like girl when do you have fun when do you this I was like this [ __ ] is a comedian she has shearious HBO special like I was like what the [ __ ] are like people will not engage your [ __ ] and then be the main ones making sweeping generalizations of char somebody said I saw a tweet that was like oh what did she do like she always complained but like she don't even have a podcast she do I was like what yes she does like and a lot of people listen I was like y'all they just say things like Amanda seals some day like does she do anything else I'm like yes the [ __ ] has cats she has dogs she do fun things writer acting what we talk about highlight the negativity because I'm like for as many people as there are that say negative things about there are a lot of people who say positive things about her I have a whole celebratory interview of her on my channel um TS Madison and my interview with TS Madison that came up today at the end she's singing Amanda Seal's Praises Mark just told you is one of his favorite people Christina likes her too A lot of people work with her and know her like me and me and Amanda both are cats are like the spokes cats for Flatbush cats in the neighborhood neither one of us got our cats there but in community and we showed up and did little sponsor videos for them and she did that like before she was she was in New York to like record a a special and that's what she she spent her day doing like helping them raise helping flish cats raise funds it's like people will they and and that's why I thought it was so sad but I thought it really said spoke to something more menacing because I've never seen Outlets decide they're going to like like real news outlets decide they're going to like make it a fact that you're an unlikable person that that nobody likes you that blah blah I'm like this is a woman who's worked in the industry for like most of her life could it possibly be so that stays booked that nobody likes her she has a a show she has a podcast where she has a bunch of guests and a bunch of different people who like her and speak fondly of her um and to me it's more than just a man to seals cuz people that think like oh why are you dying on that hell or something no it says something about what can and is done and what people want to do to black people who are too outspoken you know what I mean or speak Community because I have a hard time believing that with whatever everybody says or who don't like her legitimately I have a hard time believing if her platform wasn't was wasn't what it was people would be saying the same things you know like I'm like if she was just acting and not saying these things if she was just having pop culture conversations and leaving political analysis out of it would you still be swearing up and down that you don't like her and she doesn't deserve to be in his rooms because I don't remember people loudly on the same this loud Amanda hat Amanda SE hat Tran didn't start until her activism became in the Forefront of what she was doing when she became more activist and entertaining to them that's when I saw the entertainment industry decide that they were going to declare that she isn't supposed to be in spaces she's an antagonist she's an antagonist within the establishment and I think that's what it is I think a lot of the time because I'm like there is no way for somebody with her longevity of a career and as diverse as her career is from a short standand flow tree to radio hosting to acting like she is somebody that in our community we would regard as like this is a legend and like we should be able to honor somebody like her Legacy and it's like interesting cuz I'm like what is about her Legacy that people misconstrue or people try to like push into like one space and so these are things that I've just been thinking around as we are having this conversation as we think around why people can collectively declare the we she's the social Pariah essentially and so they yeah y'all left me with a couple more questions because I'm just like this like a lot that's unfair yeah social par is a lot and here's the other thing is like let's say let's say amand two things let's say Amanda has had a couple of bad days where she cussed everybody out on set let's say she was horrible a couple of days fine right cool does that then mean that she gets thrown away because here's the Now where's the restorative justice inette this throwing away of the people like what are we talking about because that doesn't and here's the thing if she is cuz Amanda has a career I ain't hating but if she's Beyonce if she's I don't know even Kelly or Michelle does she get thrown away in the same way because there's that value thing it's like she's not big enough for us to not throw away but she's she you know like or she's not big enough for us to to have to hold on to because we need her so we can discard of her and make an example out of her and it's just like uh okay makes me feel like a black woman's greatest and I I hate that people going feel like this but I it makes me feel like black women just aren't allowed to express their feelings because the thing people said most about her than anything I've seen is that she complained too damn much the fact that this video that upset them so much the video itself was just her expressing to her own followers who like her her feelings and then I saw just complain all the time and like what is the why is the number one sin to y'all of black woman being discontent like let's say she is complaining let's say she is talking about she's expressing her feelings can she not do that why is that the thing no apparently not apparently not but the I have to self reflect because I when I first heard the video I cannot sit here and lie I was like oh boy I wish she could have just said I've worked so hard and in this community it hurts my feelings that I'm not invited to these places I really deserve to be at these places and I thank y'all so much for rocku with me but like and and that's really what I thought so there's some conditioning in me of you have to be likable like I am immediately saw that and was like oh why like this though and so I'm sitting here and I'm like y'all are helping me through work through my own [ __ ] like it's a mirror because I did I cannot sit here and lie and say that I didn't look at that like I knew she was going to be attacked not cuz I thought cuz I had a problem with how she messaged it just because I know that they do this to her this is not the first time there was another time um yeah she when she' expressed she' had a she was on live once um uh like last year upset talking to her followers about you know feeling black balled and blacklisted and not wondering whether or not she was going to have an agent and work again and they they did the same thing to that that clip of her um and I'm like and you know what I what I think is sad is she's not I understand the feeling she's describing like that was the thing that made me really sad for her and know that she would be attacked like I don't like to use Twitter much anymore because I feel like in the same breath that your audiences need you to talk to them and be candid and emotionally vulnerable in order for you to establish that relationship and Par social relationship with them is they condemn you for it too when you get upset and you or you tell them that you're sad about being bullied or or that people harass you online everybody when people when it's not them everyone looks at the majority everybody looks at the what they think you should be so grateful for and they think that you are just focusing on the negative and so I'm always hyper aware of the fact that there is a thin line between when my own followers will turn on me and call me annoying and be like oh they don't like that I'm talking about this talking about that I always am worried about that I don't even like to share too much on there and be on there for that so I knew that Amanda seals was going to get that and the thing is I know a lot of people that feel that way I know I know the feeling to feel like oh I would love to go to a Essence fest or be invited to these things I'm like I write outp ads for Essence but they don't invite me you know what I mean these platforms know who I am they share you but they don't invite you you'll see them you know and I know that feeling I I I I recognize how we are perceived as black women and that you can't say it without people jumping on your back well who the [ __ ] you think you are and why should you get to go anything and you should be grateful and yet I know that so that was why I felt for her but it was crazy cuz I know so many other people in Industry that feels how she feels and both mainstream and independent who just don't feel like they get the recognition that they deserve with the content that they do and what have you but you can't even say that to your own Bas it's crazy but to me she was speaking to a point like that most of us as creators have all talked around we have to leave The Establishment all she's talk about the same thing Ryan Leslie did was just like I'm leaving the industry in order to like just directly talk to my audience right all of us as content creators can express appreciation because we do not exist without that base and so when I first heard her say that I was just like dog this not real like I keep this work going one because it's the stuff that I love but also yeah y'all really be rocking me y'all spending your money on my patreon I love that so to me it was a to me it felt like an expression of gratitude but it also gratitude cuz she did her M she did her video where she was like to me more directly complaining about the industry before when she was talking about being black baled and they they they jumped on her back for that last year this video felt like she was telling her fans thank you like thank you I really cuz there is something to that there have been times when people have been on a hate train against me and I felt like [ __ ] this F this I don't feel like I hate everybody if I [ __ ] I I'm feeling like a b a ball of hate and then I'll go outside and I'll meet someone who follows me and I'll come home to my boyfriend like you know I think if you could see your audience you would feel so much more grateful like if you those numbers I think the more you do this work and the bigger your numbers get the more you don't appreciate that those are real people watching your [ __ ] or how they feel you're not in the house with the people who love you that's the thing it's like when people watch your content or they do feel positive impact from you and the people who love you the most are not the ones who comment online you're the people who love you are not who you hear from on your YouTube comments and stuff way if you run into them in the street is to hate you here so I I did process I've like I've been times where I've thanked my followers like yo thank you I really appreciate that like and it felt more like that like she was just being honest like listen the industry really don't [ __ ] with me thank y'all for how much y'all make me feel [ __ ] with and they took that and they were like how dare you talk about the very true fact that we don't [ __ ] with you like Essence they never denied it that's what's crazy Essence never said they Essence never said we invited her and it's not a problem you know what I mean they never debunked anything she said at no point in time did any one of those Outlets come out and say it's true it's not true we did invite her she did this they never came out with any stories at no point did they come out with any additional information about her they use the same three talking points in the internet Z guys said she's not she's not likable her messaging isn't like likable enough and people have been annoyed with her online but they never said that they didn't blackball her they never said that she did some other horrible thing behind the scenes that justifies this treatment it never happened they just said it's true that this black woman is unlikable and therefore every all black people should be in Mass consent that she deserves to be blackballed from these spaces despite the fact that even we her biggest haters recognize that her number one interest is in service of black people not that're the unfriendly black hotties I hate this for us oh but thank you all so much ER for joining me today [Music] w
