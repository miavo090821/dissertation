A subliminal isn’t the same thing as an open call out.\n\n2. If 2024 ends up being recorded as the downfall of Drake the first song by a notable artist expressing public beef lyrically was Hiss in January. If you know US history the battle of Bull Run is considered the start of the civil war, even though bleeding Kansas was described as a time period where ppl were shooting back and forth before that. In most wars there is an official start that is preceded by violence of a smaller or less official scale.\n\n3. Also given what Kendrick brought to the fore front about PDF stuff in hind site I think Megan was the first well known artist to bring it up publicly. At the time people ascribed it to Nicki but knowing what most ppl know now and putting it with the bar about “Dudes walking around with the same scars” as chicks with BBLs it makes it obvious it was aimed at BBL drizzy.",

From that perspective, Drake is/was basically a \"great power,\" \"too big to fail,\" and used to all of the social privileges that come with it. Kendrick was (to most mainstream casual listeners) a rising  power that successfully challenged and publicly humiliated him. And now Drake is a declining power that is lashing out. One thing that also makes sense if you read it this way is why Drake is going after UMG and by proxy the entire industry: research shows that humiliated powers tend to go after third parties rather than the power that humiliated them, both for psychological reasons and practical ones (unsuspecting third parties are easier to defeat).",

He has no connection to the culture, especially black America's culture, he always knew he was an outsider, but instead of just trying to show what he's got, he just tried to suck up to everybody else. And it's annoying as hell to me that he tried to make this about him being mixed, and now bringing up him being Jewish in the lawsuit, when there's literally three people that break that whole damn argument. \n\nEminem, the biggest white rapper in history, Lil dicky, a trendy Jewish rapper who who earned his respects by just being is Goofy self and doing his thing & j cole, who shares a similar background to him, being mixed, having a white mom, but Cole talks about real shit and he's always been for the culture, unlike Drake.\n\nThe thing specifically with Kendrick is is that Drake nose Kendrick is better than him.

        "text": "Absolutely! Drake is high-key jealous that he doesn't have the reverence and respect Kendrick does. He's had a chip on his shoulder for *YEARS* because the hip-hop community never respected and appreciated him like that. Of course he grew a massive fanbase of the kind of white people who say \"I don't like hip-hop, but I like Eminem!\", people who had no respect for the craft or community but co-opted the language and esthetics to appear \"cool\", who would uplift and fight everyone for Aubrey... and I think Drake hoped deep down that that would be enough to change the minds of the gatekeepers, but it didn't because many of them recognized what he was doing. Drake is the epitome of pretending that he's not bothered by his fanbase not sawying the hip-hop community into accepting and respecting him, when deep down he cares greatly. \n\nOVHoes also love to argue about how \"unjust\" it is that so many rappers \"used Drake to forward their own careers/momentum\", while conveniently ignoring that Drake did the same when he first came onto the scene and later when he became an elder statesmen figure. Drake *always* saw all of his relationships as transactional.",

It’s was the last straw, the one thing he rested his hat on that nobody, especially not Kendrick, could take from him: his record-setting numbers. \n\nNot Like Us got played in stores. It got played at sporting events. It got referenced by politicians and played at their rallies. I would see groups of teenage white kids at the mall singing “They not like us,” as well as people of every background dancing to it at the clubs or even on the street. It was mega-huge, in a way that Drake can only imagine himself being in hip hop. And not only was it that big, it was that big as a repudiation of his success and legacy, more than even The Story of Adidon had any ability to be. \n\nDrake lost record after record to a song calling him a colonizer who surrounds himself with pedophiles, and to a guy who had everything he had wanted to have in hip hop—save for one thing. The commercial success. Well, now he had that too, at a peak even higher than Drake had ever reached.\n\nAnd so that was it. That broke him.",

Sometimes it hurts if it doesn't seem to gain interest, but I keep trying because that's what a creator does. Heard about one writer known for not finishing books asked another how to finish books... and the advice was \"Write. Write every day. Write over and over till you're happy with what you have.\" In short, if you aren't willing to practice your craft even when you produce something you're not happy with, you'll never finish anything. Also, in a very real way, create for yourself. Put out things you want to see in the world. Sincerity has a quality that will probably reach someone if they see it.",

    "text": "There was a comic event from Marvel from 2015 called Secret wars where Doctor Doom accidentally caused the death of the entire multiverse, but grabbed a hold of the power of the beyonder, essentially the power of creation, and took the last remnants of creation and made a planet to himself. Only for Black Panther and Reed Richards, Mr Fantastic, to show up and ruin the entirety of his plans. \n\nDrake is Doctor doom, Kendrick is both black panther and Mr Fantastic, and battle World literally represents the battle over hip hop that they were engaged in. After outsmarting Doom, it came down to a fight between Doom & Reed, where Reed essentially gets Doctor Doom to admit that Reed Richards is better than him & could have done better. People laud Doom as this magnanimous villain, which he is, but his biggest flaw is that he's an insecure bastard who will sooner burn everything down around and then do an ounce of self-reflection. Like Drake.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention. Reed didn't even want doomed to say that. When Doom ask him if he thinks he could have done better, Reed's response is similar to what Kendrick's last line on Meet the Grahams is. \"I don't think I'm better than you. I think you can be better than what you are.\"",

Pusha T is one of the goats, but few would call him the Goat (capital G). Had Meek beaten Drake instead, no one would've started calling him the Goat. But with Kendrick, the title had long since been on the table, and losing this beef would always mean that the loser would have to forever hold their peace (or that L). He can't let it go because he has always been the Goat (at least in his and his stans' eyes), and to lose this time means to lose his entire legacy. Ironically, it would've only been figuratively 8 months ago, but he's working hard to make it literal!",
