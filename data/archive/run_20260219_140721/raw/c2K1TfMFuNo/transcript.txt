promote myself go to the YouTube channel Midwestern marks and then hit subscribe uh but then go to my playlist uh dprk the Democratic People's Republic of Korea I've done more videos about the DP like more long form videos explaining how the dprk actually works their history I did like a back and forth with vou about it vou if you know him thank you Ruby for the rose um I did it back and forth with him and then did this like 2hour breakdown on yanme Park the North Korean Defector and her appearance on Joe Rogan and Jordan Peterson's podcast um but then also check out loyal citizens of panyang and soul which was produced by The Liberation school which is an arm of PSL who I have my disagreements with but that movie is really good for understanding Korea and the actual history and how the propaganda is produced but um ACP is the future hell yeah all right now that we've got a 100 people in here I guess I'll explain the beef the drama um so Hassan [ __ ] large streamer um thank you H for the superpower um loosely associated with DSA you know I I I'm sure Hassan's viewers are in other parties besides DSA and is is Hassan a member of DSA or not let me know in the comments if he is um so I can give you guys accurate information as far as I know he's not directly associated with any party um but you know it's pretty obvious that he's a Social Democrat and a lot of his viewers are in DSA and every time that he's mentioned the ACP the American Communist Party um which I'm going to put an ACP hat on while we do this every time that he's mentioned our party the ACP which I'm in the executive board of it has been something that's not true um the worst one being he claimed that we had a cryptocurrency which was not true it was based on a lie that was spread by a Twitter wrecker and he told his massive audience that we're in fact a crypto scam and then never retracted it he he found out that we're not in fact a crypto scam and didn't feel the need to apologize even though he's one of the largest streamers in America America and our only goal here is to organize American workers and organize against imperialism which was sketchy and then you know he thank you for the ice cream and then he made an attack against me um over one of my tweets and I showed unequivocally this was recently in a video that what he claimed I said in that tweet is absolutely not what I said and I get it you know he streams eight hours a day you make mistakes so it's what ever but it's it's repeated you know this was the and that was the third lie I'm blanking on what the second lie was but anyways somebody in the UK thank you everybody for the stickers appreciate that all that money is going to the ACP baby thank you um so recently he was doing that big speaking engagement at Cambridge and somebody from George Galloway's party asked him why he's attacking the AC thank you for all the sticker appreciate you all um and his response was to Fed jacket our comrade Jackson and to say that I don't even know what kind of argument he was making he was arguing that Jackson is a Fed because he went to the donbass region um and supports Russia thank you I don't know if I can even say that wow appreciate that you guys are killing it with the gifts today but he went um he said Jackson to Fed because he went there did propaganda or did Media stuff about the donbass region in eastern Ukraine and then he was allowed to come back to the US freely which isn't even true Jackson's been held at the airport multiple times um as uh you know many members of our leadership have been they've had their their property seized they've been searched um so I don't know but it doesn't even make logical sense thank you so much for that um it doesn't even make logical sense like uh you know if he's too supportive of Russia why would he be an American fed Russia is the number one enemy of the United States and NATO right now so the argument's incoherent um and it was interesting to see Hassan be put on the spot and challenged on these things that he said about our party that are untrue and you know his response was extremely weak and you know we could make the same argument he's being platformed by CNN recently and all these large outlets now I would never accuse anyone of being a Fed without hard evidence the way that he's doing to us um but if there's anybody who's you know cracked down hard or cracked down upon by the state hard it's us and if there's anybody who the state allows to do their thing um because maybe they view it as a compatible version of socialism with the establishment thank you for that um it's Hassan perer you know he's he's made tons and tons of money off of socialism look I think it's incredibly simple I think it's incredibly simple actually right look I've been in the space for four years I know how it works I know how live streaming and and being an influencer and like I know how I know what you are allowed to do what you're not allowed to do and I know the systemic limitations okay since he got a start on the purple website since he got a start on the purple website Hassan [ __ ] has faced zero zero systemic push back in any form he has never faced any kind of systemic push back he's never been deplatformed he's never been demonetized he's never had media hit pieces on him besides Fox News which doesn't count even that's a glow up because it's Boomer nonsense but all the other mainstream media Outlets have done nothing but give him glow ups and he's faced zero systemic push back the narrative and the discourse has never been engineered against him his reputation has never been under attack by state or intelligence forces and the only people that have attacked his reputation and made those things go viral are actual genuine organic actors who just don't like him because he's a gatekeeper so how exactly is he going to call Jackson someone being you know Jackson's part of the system Jackson's a Fed how can he say that when he's faced zero systemic push back in any form ever in any way Jackson's banned from everywhere except one website whose CEO has made a very public commitment to free speech that he would look really bad going back on he's banned from PayPal for Christ's sake okay he's de and look that's just to talk about the deplatforming what about demonetization Hassan has never faced any adversity he's never faced any systemic push back the corporation that he works for loves him they never go against him they never do anything right how does that work that Jackson's part of the system and hisan is not bro the the the icy on the cake is that Hassan [ __ ] said all of this he said all of this y'all ready are y'all ready he said all of this while he was inside Cambridge University he said this from Cambridge University do you think a genuine threat to the system is invited to Cambridge University do you w up real radicals and critics of the system are not allowed to become the top live streamers of amazon-owned websites without any push back whatsoever without any adversity at all thrown their way nothing what wake up who is the real dissident and who's the fraud Hassan is not a real dissident he has never faced any problems in his career and and take it from me because I used to be like you and think oh no it's organic anyone could no it's not if you are a threat to the system you cannot have a career your career is done okay you can't have a career if you're a threat to the system unless you do a workaround like Jackson literally is doing or luck out by having Elon Musk buy the entire company and make a public commitment to free speech and there's some fool in the chat talking about Lites please commit yourself to a psychatric hospital because our only connection to Lites is that we gave speeches at an event hosted by Schiller an organization that Chinese cgtn is hosting like weekly and the connection Schiller has with cgtn and Chinese institutions goes Way Beyond anything we've ever had so when you're talking about L that was before the ACP existed before there's any ACP and they're talking about larus sites for what and by the way what was the content of that conference uh talking about being against funding the war in Ukraine how is that a Fed agenda you don't even know what you're talking about even if you're correct that they worked with the FBI and what does that have to do with us what does it have to do with us that larus sites have worked with all of those people I mean what does that have to do with us Hassan [ __ ] in 2020 told his audience to vote for Joe Biden a guy who voted for Jim Crow segregation bills is Hassan [ __ ] a Joe Bist um Hassan [ __ ] has streamed multiple times with AOC a woman who voted for Iron Dome funding so because we gave a speech one time at the Schiller Institute conference where I did what I defended Hegel I defended coev I defended the proletar as the privileged subject of History all things they disagree on by the way the larouche followers because I did that and Jackson spoke there too we're Lites but Hassan shouldn't be held accountable for streaming with AOC who literally was in Congress and voted for Iron Dome funding you are attacking us because it's convenient to because you don't have the courage to actually stand up to power because you don't have the courage to go against what's popular and what's trendy because you're afraid that the the the mob is going to go against you you're not speaking on the basis of principle and sincere belief you're just saying these things because it's convenient it's convenient for you to say them socially somebody says I saw one person say I don't understand the anger and what happened was Hassan fed jacketed the American Communist party when asked about us at Cambridge and I see somebody else saying you guys are attacking Hassan for relevancy it's the it's it's not that he is he's told four separate lies about the party now every time he's brought us up he claimed we had a cryptocurrency when we didn't he made up some tweet that I made which I didn't actually make he and then now at Cambridge um one of somebody who's a fan of the ACP a workingclass guy who wants to see unity and wants to see real organization and doesn't understand why the largest socialist Creator in America is telling lies about us and attacking us he asked Hassan a question at Cambridge he said uh why are you using your platform to launch attacks at the ACP in George Galloway and Hassan denied that he was attacking George Galloway and then he responded to the the question about ACP by fed jacketing Jackson one of our leaders who's been you know targeted by the state who's been targeted by zos who's been targeted by the right-wing Venezuelan opposition who the Maduro government literally had to protect him from because they were physically trying to to attack him and get to him he's he was detained at the airport multiple times and and that's what we're saying is you know how are you going to call us feds to your giant audience when none of these things have happened to you but these are the the repressions that were're actively facing from the state it doesn't make any sense bro he's the he's the top political live streamer on the amazon-owned website and that's organic that's not manip that's not there's no like systemic significance of that fact when Jackson B is B Jackson was demonetized from YouTube for one year and then got permaban like why have why has nothing ever happened to Hassan look what am I am I irrational for raising that question like if Hassan was a threat to the system where are the CNN hit pieces where are the people calling him a dangerous I mean for Christ's sake even Bernie Sanders in 2015 was getting hit pieces written about him saying that he's a sexist and it's Bernie Bros that was Bernie Sanders in 2015 a senator and like Hassan [ __ ] has never faced anything I mean what never fa listen am I irrational for asking the question why has Hassan [ __ ] never faced any systemic push back or adversity in any form whatsoever like at all he no demonetization no deplatforming no censorship no media hit pieces no narrative discourse attacks against him no like engineer the the biggest adversity Hassan has ever faced in his career was a stream another stream Named Destiny who created him um yeah yeah I mean and Eddie Eddie someone's saying TW um the purple website likes the money they make off of him did YouTube not like the money that Jackson was making for them think about it did YouTube not like the money Jackson was making um do you know how much money the purple website would make make if they had other streamers that they've banned and deplatformed do you really think it's about the money that website doesn't even make a profit and what he is making for them as much as it is is p it's nothing compared to kais sonat and compared to all these it was nothing compared to these WL streamers you have no idea what you're talking about he's the top political stream he's not the top streamer he's the top political streamer you know xqc makes more than him right like what are we even talking about here he doesn't even make that much in the grand scheme of their operating cost for Amazon and everything and and and and so it's like why are they keeping him around why are they keeping him around oh we're crying and we're jealous right but who mentioned who first first he literally fed jacket at Jackson and he was like well my red line is I'm just asking the question how is Jackson able to travel to Don bass and not be arrested when he returns to the US uh I don't know Hassan because he wasn't breaking any laws every other method they have to persecute us when they don't have a legal pretext they not only have you but are using I want to give you guys an example ACP type American Communist party in Google we're not even allowed to be on the Google results I think we got our website there but we there's a total blackout there's a total media blackout why did the media cover our Dearborn event which like was so much smaller but there's nothing on ACP compared to how many millions of impression we got on the algorithm it's crazy right now let me ask you another thing look up American Communist party on Reddit or on social media and look at what the narrative is about us and what people say about us now ask yourself a question what have we done to deserve this bad reputation what has our party actually done if you look at every single chapter that our party has and look at everything they've done the most controversial thing we've done is feed people Thanksgiving turkeys the poor people couldn't afford Thanksgiving turkeys so one of our chapters went to a community service event where cops were present and helping distribute turkeys and they publicized it and they issued a self criticism and a retraction for it because it was wrong to work to to to have police have a presence Distributing the free turkeys to poor families that is the most contentious controversial thing we've ever done and they even retracted it and issued of self-criticism over it okay which was and the grand scheme of things they were feeding poor families right so it's like it's like where is the what has ACP done to deserve the bad reputation that they've tried to create well I don't think they've succeeded in harming our reputation but there is such a concentrated effort to destroy our reputation but like what justifies that so hold on let me cook let me cook stay with me now stay with me now if we are so innocent and we've done nothing wrong and there's a concentrated systemic and coordinated effort to to strike and destroy our reputation why has that never happened to Assan and yeah you're right we're nobody's compared to Assan you're right so that should even make you more critical about it if we're nobody compared to Hassan why why are we so under attack and he's not we wouldn't be if H's twitch didn't get banned and Jackson's every single social media didn't get banned and right now you guys are on my eighth Tik Tock page right the argument about he he's making too much money for twitch I I was making plenty of money for Tik Tok they still banned me for taking the wrong positions and it's always been positions that Hassan is afraid to take and I understand you know there's some overlap in my audience and ass son's audience we live in this world of social media and Prof filicity and you know people get an attachment to these personalities like Assan but look at this what do you call him teaming up with Danio Sullivan of CNN the corporate News Network to do a hitpiece against us the ACP what what do you call that what do you call it when somebody is being platformed and hosted by the Bourgeois media in order to attack a communist part that's in the streets that's in the communities bringing people food getting people organized doing you know real socialist and communist education and and you guys know you all follow me on Tik Tok What which one of my videos uh have I done that justifies the attacks against us as right-wingers and Browder rights and right-wing extremists like what are we talking about if you follow my Tik Tok if you follow it for any period of time you know that is not true you know that it's not true you know that the right wiers hate us they attacked me they were some of the people who doxed me and you know emailed my employers demanding that I be fired which they did end up firing me right and and it's it's we wouldn't be asking this question if Hassan didn't attack us first right but he attacked us first not once not twice not three times but four times and now he's calling us federal agents so yeah it it makes perfect sense to us for us to say well here's the amount of State repression that we've faced we've lost our jobs and been blackballed from social media what state repression have you faced because if you're going to make a claim that people are feds present some evidence and there's no evidence look look I wanna I wanna I want to ask a question to Assan [ __ ] fans just genuine good faith question I'm not going to yell at you if you're a threat to the system do the editors at CNN and the people who run CNN do they let glow-ups get published about you why would a news organization controlled by the CIA be like yeah give him the glow up no problem like what why why why was that how was that how does that work if you're a Hassan piger fan we all know CNN uh there's literally through Wikileaks we've gotten actual evidence that a front for the CIA and they they do work very intentionally about everything so why is CNN giving Hassan glow ups does anyone know does any any Hassan fan have an explanation for that since you want to start this thing about who's serving the system and who's not like please one Hassan fan explain how you can be a threat to the system while CNN is giving you glow ups I just would love to know how that works to give you an idea of the level of methodical manipulation CNN engages when you when they don't like you um Don O Sullivan came to our event in Dearborn and we had all it was all like infrared people a bunch of people right they found one troll from Hassan's Community who infiltrated our event and 50% of his documentary was this crazy troll pretending and they they're spinning it like this is our supporter like everything they do is so calculated they're so so calculated and so manipulated why would they give Hassan a free pass and do a glow up on him so you're saying Hassan's a right-winger yeah I'm saying he is an OP I'm saying he is controlled by the system Hassan is not a critical of the system he is the system he is ex he is the only political live streamer that they permit he's there for a reason they don't let someone rise to that level unless it's controlled opposition you don't parenthe as a quote um it's only once you stray from the post that you feel the tug of the leash right and that's what H and I and and many members of the AC have experienced you know straying from the post meaning criticizing the system that you feel the specific about that Eddie I don't mean to cut you off no you're good yeah but I mean and for me it was uh calling out the proxy war in Ukraine was the first time I got banned and calling out the color Revolution efforts in Cuba right so as as soon as you you really start to to take a stance against the system that you get suppressed so yeah it is very suspicious for us I'll give the line what the line is as somebody who's been in this space for a long time and I know how everything works I'm going to give you what the line is always been where are they going to start attacking you are they going to destroy your reputation or are you chill right and the line is very simple will you call for a Dem exit and leave the I'm saying as a left Winger what's the red line for the system to attack you as left Winger if you call for leaving the Democratic party and forming a new party a third party that's the red line like that is where you are officially a threat to the system and I have my disagreements with PSL don't get me wrong I really do I really really don't like the PSL a lot for a lot of what they do but to give them some credit even the PSL when 2020 when those protests were going down they went after PSL because PSL is not in the Democrats and they kept saying PSL is tankies this and that supporting authoritarians and now code pink who's aligned with PSL Nancy Pelosi was on record doing Russia gate and China Gate against them so Jill Stein I like the PSL but I'm fair enough to give you to just explain to you objectively what is the red line you have to cross to be considered any kind of threat to the system as a left Winger and it has always been since 2016 by the way advocating for forming any kind of alternative political power than the two- party doop and you know Hassan never did that he has never done that he has never done that is in his entire career he's never done that we are nothing compared to Assan right everybody I'll take it sure Hassan is much more viral he has much more followers and he makes much much more money I agree you're right even all of us pulled together he's like 10 times more prominent than we are I'll even say that right okay but with as little as we have we built and reconstituted the Communist party and we built the ACP now you can hate the ACP all you want but you can't say it's not impressive you can't say what we have done is not impressive you can't say what we've done is insignificant we we're on the radar of the the entire country now I mean that's an exaggeration but we're we've been thrusted onto the scene because of our efforts because of our ability to know how the algorithm works and there's and our supporters right if Hassan genuinely LED his followers to build a new political project and a new political party let's say in 2020 or 2021 like imagine what he could have done with his following with his Resources with his pull imagine what he could have done to actually impact politics and he didn't why didn't he do that because the minute he would do something like that he gets deplatformed just like Jackson and the hit Pieces come out and CNN is going to write hit pieces on him so you need to understand how it works you need to understand he's a grifter he's a grifter and he's self-serving only for his career and his money it's 4 d chess man yeah it's 4D chess but where's the results of the 4D chess hey people what does that mean he's radicalized them what do you mean what does that mean what does that trans yeah for for AOC it's and that's what's so frustrating it's like so he calls himself a socialist right with in the the era that we're in with the US Empire pushing us to the brink of World War III it it makes so much sense for all socialists and Communists to to be you know working together fighting together or at least at the very least you know if we're not going to join hands and fight together at least don't attack each other at least don't you know he's the the largest socialist streamer in the country and our party is doing all this on the ground work and he chooses to use his platform rather than to support that and to you know help Galvanize more people to do that on the ground work and meet people's material needs and organize workingclass people he he instead aligned with CNN to attack us and it is I mean what how does that help the the Socialist cause in any way please they don't they don't ever there's never been a single hitpiece from the Civil Society think tanks nothing against Assan nothing only Fox news is that's it which is predictable it's to be expected but is a is Fox News the system no Fox News is controlled opposition to the system everyone knows that but nothing literally nothing uh he's never been called Dangerous who has called Hassan dangerous from mainstream media who has raised the alarm Bells I mean I'm baffled because you'd think it would be the Palestine thing that tips the scale finally he's triggered the alarm bells and now the system's going to go after him but it hasn't you mentioned Ethan kleene Ethan kleene is like he's like uh grasping at straws Ethan Klein is struggling to criticize Assan Ethan Klein is not doing that successfully with the the backing of no Ethan Klein looks like a crazy person right now he's failing miserably Ethan Klein his whole reputation has been destroyed he the whole rightwing hates Ethan Klein and you know you do have the destiny and Drew pevu uh Neo you know uh the Neo lib you can't even call them left wing they're not anymore um and I guess they're embracing him kind of but but what what is that on the purple website it's nothing what is that on on YouTube it's nothing you can't have a a level of Monopoly that he has all right I hope this is a Hassan fan go ahead Kalisa oh hey guys um I'm not sure exactly if you're looking for a debate to note or just kind of some comments but I was just kind of kind of r on what you guys were just saying um I'm not I'm not a communist I I'm not sure what political I am um so please do correct me if I'm wrong with any of the information that I um bring forward but I just wanted to say that it's it's unfortunate what's happening and I'm so sorry that um you guys are being kind of targeted now but um also not surprised you guys are being targeted because for for communism you're there to to bring the people together to fight against this neoliberal and uh capitalist system and because the system is so it's such a plague you know and it's so ingrained within everything that of course of course you're going to start to get picked on and it's I ask question are you like a Hassan viewer Hasan fan I I'm not even kidding I have no idea who this guy was so I had to Google him just now and I've seen him around yeah keep Googling it thank you anyway um thank you thank you for your support we're just looking to debate Hassan viewers right now but we appreciate you yeah look look um all I heard is the ACP is their socially con conservative party I mean um but what have we done that's bad what have we actually done that's bad that's what you have to think about all right what have we actually done that's bad nothing right and um you know to look that that woman to respond to her look we appreciate the support and the good faith and we're not surprised we're under attack by the system either but that's not what we're trying to say obviously it's very predictable that if you're a communist you're going to be under attack by the system but what's kind of grinding my gear is a self-proclaimed left socialist who's the biggest political live streamer possibly one of the biggest live streamers uh political live streamers in America is from his warm seat in in camridge University uh trying to accuse us of being co-opted and part and part of the system and bad faith actors when he has never faced any systemic push back in his entire career you like what we've done materially but your ideological shortcoming I saw that one um but how you know like what do we it's more what we don't do that you have a problem with no we're not going to organize Pride parades no we're not going to have workshops talking about fat phobia no we're not going to sit around and like we're not going to do these waste of time time things that the DSA does we're just going to materially get good things done for the workingclass movement of this country that is the number one problem people seem to have with us it's what we won't do and what weuse to do right and I don't mean the flex but like nobody probably has a is more well- read in Marxist Lin inist theory in this Internet space you know besides us as far as people who actually have an influence and a foll and uh I I know a lot of people found my videos through Hassan but they found my videos to be a step forward from Hassan and um it's the guy streams eight hours a day so do you really think he's taking the time to read Theory you know in the few hours of the day that he's not streaming no he's just appealing to his audience telling them what they want to hear reacting to videos I I spent 3 hours today reading Lenin's materialism and Imperial criticism and I don't say that the flag I say that you know to say that we are sharpening our ideological tools all the time we have this massive education program run by the co-founder of Midwestern marks Carlos gito where all of our members are in addition to working in their communities and bettering the conditions of people around them are Reading MA are reading Lenin are reading uh people whose names I can't say or will get banned all of us are engaging in the act of reading Theory while Hassan streams for eight hours a day and calls us a crypto scam so what else what the hell else are we supposed to think of that and and what are the people who you know were fans of me and our fans of Hassan I get that you might be split but like how are you split how can you not see what he's doing I mean it's it's disgraceful at least have me on for a conversation I know a lot of his audience wants to see that but he won't do it because the loudest members of his audience the most liberal members of his audience would freak out on him for it and he's too scared of them again but I have a really simple question which no Hassan fan can answer and I'd love to see anyone answer this question can you be a threat to the system and a leftwing threat to the system if CNN gives you glow-ups would the CIA controlled CNN which they are by the way it's been proven that they're a front for the CIA would they like the the guys controlling CNN they're like oh yeah this a son guy give him a pass like could a threat to the system get away with CNN portraying them in a good light I just want one Hassan fan to answer because it's the one question Hassan fans cannot answer um are are critics of the system capable of becoming the top political live streamers of Amazon owned websites and getting C and getting blowups by every mainstream media news Outlet besides Fox Jim yes he can yo no shot there's a guy who actually believes that's possible tell us how is that possible teach us how if Jackson Hinkle is a bad faith actor in a Fed but Hassan is not explain to us how that works do you guys know how much harassment I get from the Tik Tock system on this half it's every day when I wake up I have to appeal multiple videos because they've been taken down which kills their virality it is an anthropological curiosity to me now that there is a human being that exists who just said what Jim said that yes it's possible I would love to know how that's possible Jim please tell us how that's possible join people requesting let's see if they can answer the million-dollar question no Hassan fan can answer thank you Manny it's a simple question no Hassan fan can answer if you are a left-wing threat to the system does the system's regime Outlets glorify you with media puff pieces how does that work Jim go ahead explain to us the impossible you you can hear me yeah first of all I just want to say I'm not a Hassan fan I just think that the way you're talking about it it makes it look like there's a conspiracy but we know that it's it's the capital's interest in CNN it's it's it's vested interest it's not that they're actually being I just want to ask you a question you think CNN is solely concerned with profit no I don't what I'm saying is this idea you said that there there it's they're representing the CIA we know that they're connected we know that there but that doesn't mean there's somebody from this and we know that the CNN is concerned with controlling American public opinion in ways that benefit the system yes or no no that that's what I'm saying I think that's a misrepresentation of these ideas of a false media because what CNN it's they're not they're not being paid to do that it's the vested interest it's the it's the companies that do that that succeed there's no wait wait what are you talking about CNN is not controlling and manipulating American public opinion to align with the system no I'm I'm saying they are but I'm saying okay they are okay we just stop there they are so you maybe in good faith I'm going to try to interpret what you're trying to say that no not everyone working for CNN has that conscious agenda but you don't know how bureaucracies work if Don O Sullivan wants to do this he needs to get the green light and if somebody at the top has a problem with it they're going to shut it down and that's how bureaucracies work oh we had to shut it down it's it's a no-go okay he got the green light to give Hassan the glow up he gave him so what does that say and there are actual you know State Department employees and stuff working at CNN I I think you're saying like they're not directly controlled by the intelligence agencies but that's what the revolving door is we all know that this revolving door exists it's or wherever in any kind of systemic bureaucracy it's not that every single person there is directly conscious serving the cia's interests it's that the bureaucratic decisions that are made reflect those interests so what is allowed what isn't allowed how things are spun what the editorial team permits all of these things are very carefully manufactured and controlled very very carefully very very carefully I mean when New York Times did a hit piece on Jackson you have no idea how manipulated that was so I'll give you an example they interviewed Jackson and and they asked him um you know something like uh um how has your Twitter grown was your Twitter growth been successful and he's like yeah of course uh it's been great on Twitter my growth has been phenomenal then they spun that and took it out of context that quote and they said here's what Jackson has to say about Gaza and they go it's been doing very Su so you see what they did it was an incredible level of methodical bad faith it was so engineered I was on the phone with Jax in every step of the way in his New York Times interview okay and then I saw what they published and I couldn't believe my eyes you're not going to sit here and tell me they don't know what they're doing they do know what they're doing the the hitpiece that Tess Owens did about me and Jackson as well you need to understand you don't look you would be reasonable if you're like they can maybe get away with you know some glow ups but not a single negative hit piece not even one not even one person fearmongering about them not even one not even one article nothing how does that work okay I'm I'm confused on now what you're talking about where you're saying there's no like not a single person because there are people maybe they don't call out Hassan but on CNN besides Fox News there has never been anything from the guardian from any kind of reputable mainstream media Source they have never gone after so Publications I'm sorry I I I'm talking about people but people have been on the show and they have made references to Twitch streamers they made references to Hassan I don't know I don't know about on literally but that there's if you watch CNN Morning Joe and like these other things they bring it up and it's in the little segments where they'll bring people on and they'll talk about how the left has to have the left and I know that's what we're talking about right that Assan pikers The left's Joe Rogan there are there are dissenting opinions that's not that's not the point that I'm tring make even allowing that conversation we where's our but this is the point never do that for us they never no I'm not I'm not trying to say that at all all I'm all I'm trying to say I think that there's a little bit of a reductive stance because even if you can prove it that's that CNN it is a conscious decision which I think you can so I'm not saying that but I think it's reductive to use that as a point to say Hassan is not a threat because I think there's many other reasons why Assan could be brought on why he why he could be getting called The Joe Rogan of the left how could you be a threat if you are given such a free pass and an easy time by the system because because this is what I'm saying it's it's more methodical than just people are going to watch and all of a sudden just go to Hassan like what like that's not that's not there's a benefit to getting people okay with CNN because we know that people do not trust CNN they do not trust the news so they're throwing they no it's their equivalent of Fox News I'm saying they're trying to you're saying you're saying Hassan has so much power this is what you're trying to say Hassan has so much pull that CNN is trying to use him to siphon the viewers to make CNN look better but you didn't I'm just saying it could be incompetency I'm just saying there didn't ask the question of how Hanan was able to gain that poll how was he able to gain that audience from you talk about his streaming audience that he got from like yeah I'm not I'm not defending I'm saying it's being reductive to just say that he's not because of the way CNN treats him he's not a threat I'm not saying he is a threat I'm I'm trying to say that there's there's other reasons there's better arguments and we shouldn't be looking at this from this point of view of what CNN does because we know that either way why not CNN would never platform Michael Michel compare can you compare how CNN treats other people versus Assan compare how they treat us compare how they treat people like I'm I'm but but I'm why they blackall perenti and not Hassan we don't point that out when Hassan calls us feds of course we should no I'm yeah but this is but this is what I'm saying that's not you can't this is not like we're shifting and we're getting into CNN I'm not I'm not trying to defend Hassan I'm not trying to defend CNN I just think that that kind of statement because that's the kind of statement that like because I think that the only thing that this kind of argument I know a lot of I got to address a genius in the chat murder simp 9000 because is your Feds CNN won't let us out we're the feds but the guy getting glow-ups by CNN and all mainstream media and who gets no systemic push back that's a genuine actor the guy who's gotten nothing not a slap on the wrist from the purple website Amazon's website that's not a fed we're the feds because we're getting persecuted all the time you are a I can't say it but you're think you don't do that you don't think you don't think we're feds cuz we're getting nothing but persecution and he's you guys have to think like critically okay the guy that looks shiny and squeaky clean I get it you want to go and follow the guy who's shiny and squeaky clean but just know that he looks shiny and squeaky clean cuz nobody's doing him dirty and if nobody's doing him dirty it's cuz he's not a threat to the system and the people that are threats to the system they do them dirty I have questions about the FSB we're not talking about the FSB we're talking about Hassan trying to say that the American state is somehow throwing us a bone yeah the guy that looks squeaky clean like there's nothing wrong with him that's the guy you got to question you don't go and look at H and Jackson and say oh these guys have a bunch of Filth on them yeah because we're getting filth dumped on us constantly this flater person on oh can you hear me yes all right I'm the perfect person for you to talk about this cuz I was like you know a Hassam fan for a while I mean I just been in the political Sphere for a while but I found Midwestern marks like maybe two years ago and I really enjoyed like learning about content from y'all and like way like you said way deeper communist and actual socialist thought than Hassan like that's definitely a point that he's trash at so how do you feel about Hassan now honestly like hit me at Cambridge and stuff I I totally agree with you guys for like a good fair amount of points but I think that well I definitely think that he should he should platform you Eddie I think that would definitely like the conversation would open up and I think that he shouldn't go on arguments like calling you guys like a crypto scam or something but call us feds too yeah bro but I see Fletcher I don't want to break this to you bro Hassan is an OP whether he's in on it himself or not I have no proof but I am willing to bet everything to my name that the system it's a fact it's 100% true that he's propped up by the system okay I did I did like look it up I was like you know I'm I'm gonna find an article like sh on Hassan real quick and you're right it was mostly Fox News like I even thought if I looked up the Hassan 911 part that I'd see a seeing in and them cover and [ __ ] on him more but I do see like during his streaming coverage like covers a lot of people whenever they talk about him like there is tons of people in the Democratic Progressive sphere who do do dirty but I would totally agree that there is something to say about how much dirtier you guys get done than him but I'd say that him being promoted in this piece by CNN is obviously they pick him a little bit for his coverage on LGBT and and like in in civil rights and stuff like that but the same reason Fox attacks him this guy the guy like like one journalist can pick him without it being like corporations as a totality I'd say but why is it it's not one first of all it's not one journalist it's the entire network they have to give the green light I'm sure if you put them on and you had him talk to Anderson Cooper like Anderson Cooper would just like completely disagree with all of his world viiew you you can have someone I need to explain to you how this works you can they can disagree with you but that's not what it's about two people having a civil disagreement and conversation is not a problem what they do if you're actually a threat is wreck your reputation destroy your reputation portray you as a bad faith actor portray you as a crazy person portray you as a monster portray you as a propagandist those are the things they do when they see you as a threat I mean you're a fan of my content right you know there's an insane amount of people on the internet who think I'm an extreme right winger hold on no no I want I want I want to address something from smearer he's saying that ACP supports getting funding by uh by owning property and and landlording all your favorite leftist organizations in the US the PSL the cpusa you name it all own real estate all of them without exception and they rent them out to tenants and that's how they get Revenue and funding can you address that can you address your landlording problem yeah about the about like the he sorry you can continue no I was just going to say like you know the the the smear campaign against us has been so thorough to the point where you have people believing I'm an extreme rtist and you know how ridiculous that is because you actually engage with the substance of our content so think it's totally fair to question why the same thing hasn't been orchestrated against Hassan as he fed jackets us people people are curious people are curious about the Dugan thing listen guys don't talk to me about Dugan until you go read a book by Dugan a book go read a book by Dugan do your homework and come back and tell me what Dugan's about then you can attack me for saying that Dugan does offer for an interesting perspective though I don't agree with it which can get you thinking critically about things geopolitics and so on and so on so first of all instead of accepting what CNN and all these CIA people like Alexander Reed Ross have said about Dugan go read him yourself and then come back to me Slavic Supremacy and Christian nationalism okay I'm not going to laugh at you Dugan even when he was the most problematic which was in the late 80s and early 90s that was his most problematic phase when he was involved in the uh the cbow party he was one of he didn't found it he was buzzing around it but even then he has fully always repudiated all kinds of racism all kinds of racialism and any kind of notion of any kind of ethnic National or racial Supremacy and I can give you texts written by Mr Dugan where he denounces nationalism constantly he doesn't he's not a nationalist he's not a religious fundamentalist he's a philosopher uh Plato was a philosopher Aristotle was a philosop Aristotle was a philosopher who Justified slavery so should we cancel Aristotle and not engage with the philosophy of Aristotle why is the Russian go read the book yourself don't talk to me about Dugan the boogy man until you've actually read him yourself instead of trusting what the system is saying about him go read him yourself and see what a big monster he is and I've never even by the way Eddie has nothing to do with this this is just me never even right there's so many that's another thing as I get called a Dugan and a larou like I've never I'll them I'll address the larouche thing um the larouche thing larouche was introduced to us by the same parapolitical podcasters that themselves popularized him and used to like say oh he's got some interesting ideas about like British intelligence or whatever so that's how it was introduced to me personally personally in 2020 after that I never really read larou I've never read cover to cover any of his books but we met um we met uh the Schiller people like Daniel Burke who I know personally and those people are decent to us and I've never I have no complaints about them and in every capacity that I've ever talked to them or anything it's always like they're protesting the Ukraine war they want more better relations with China and Russia so like we had no or not we infrared Eddie had nothing to do with this I have to emphasize this you're talking about me I didn't see any problem now everyone kept afterwards told me oh there's all these problems with larouche and all this stuff so I'm like okay I mean I don't know I really didn't know I didn't I don't know about all these problematic things about larus from the 80s or whatever and like and but that's that I mean um when I said I did the praise you're talking about was when I said the world the land bridge idea was a great idea where we build a bridge from Alaska to Russia to deepen economic cooperation between the US and Russia I love that idea right but I mean I don't agree with larouche on anything when it comes to philosophy I don't agree with his economics I don't agree with his politics I don't agree with the strategy um and that's that the most I know about larouche is from watching H debate a larouche follower and absolutely destroy them and cook them on like a lot of these positions that larouche took and then to turn around and you know have so many people calling me a laroui like I don't know anything about him and and it's only because of my Association Taz who I know for a fact has major philosophical disagreements with theou that he's expressed multiple times so listen guys fell ladies and gentlemen you cannot simultaneously be a lite and a Dugan you can't be both you can call me a Dugan you'd be wrong you can call me a lite you'd be even more Wrong by the way but you can't say that someone's both it doesn't make sense what is the what do you mean Adan larou what are you talking about those camps have zero connections with each other I Schiller has no ties to Dugan and Schiller people when I went to their the conference to speak which was the only time I met them in person besides Daniel which he was also at the CPI thing in Austin so that's it they gave me [ __ ] about Dugan just just like you give me [ __ ] about Dugan so why are you saying larouche and Dugan it makes no sense it's incoherent it makes no sense um and by the way Carl Marx read everybody in Marx's day there was no such thing as Marxism all the people that Marx read were non- marxists all of them and that he was inspired by L guess who inspired him to write imperialism the highest stage of capitalism was it other marxists no it was an English liberal conservative liberal Hobson who inspired Lenin as a matter of fact and more indirect lineage that people neglect and forget who inspire ired Lenin decisively to the point where all the re generations of the Russian revolutionaries took it for granted people like Alexander hen people like churny I can't pronounce his name over the top of my head the real original author of what is to be done which lennin Lenin's what is to be done was a play off of the original fictional novel what is to be done chernovsky I believe is his name and these were all non-m marxists whose views would be regarded as deeply problematic so uh let's not kid ourselves uh complaining about you know potential non-marxist sources of uh reading an inquiry you are an opportunist do you know what opportunism is tell me what opportunism is from the Marxist perspective and then come back and I'll decide if you're even worth responding to so how is dness how does Eddie feel do you have worms in your ears or your brain do you listen to nothing just said that the I mean to the extent that you know it H has done what Marx did and found the rational Colonels and every thinker um yeah I I I am in 100% agreement with this idea of you know like Civilization States being stronger than balkanized States right that uh you know one unified state that Encompass as many ethnicities or nationalities is is stronger and seems to be the way forward in the future versus balkanized you know West people allowed not only to be influenced but to be shaped by profusely CIA like neoliberal academics pushing intersectionality and Gloria steum and you can be influenced by all of that and let it shape your entire world view but I'm getting crap for reading Dugan how does that make sense how do you fall for all of this neoliberal crap that was anti-marxist and reactionary but I can't read Dugan and draw conclusions from Reading Dugan even if it's critical can I just chime in and um say just few sentences is and head out um I don't know why I think you guys have the setup where it doesn't allow for camera but some folks were calling me a creep for wanting to join the call I'm just a leftist woman who is I consider myself further to the left than Hassan however I really really genuinely don't think this conversation is being productive and I I feel like there's a lot of pointing fingers like he called us feds so he's a Fed um yes it did surprise me it it fully surprised me that he was put on CNN all of a sudden and on pod Safe America however safe I didn't even know that oh man however hacks um yeah they are Biden staffers um however uh I know how media works and they know the pendulum swings and they know when there's going to be a right-wing government people are going to tend to want answers and people are going to want to shift blame and see who has any answers so they tend to platform whoever is going to be I guess the one that will bring the rating the opposition and in the in like their version of the opposition now Hassan is not as far left as I am but to people on CNN and whatever to them that's like very very extreme like people you don't think he's a fed you think he's being utilized by the corporate media and the FEDS I genuinely in order to get people back into the Democratic party which you know it's en regard of I beg just let me finish my thought process I promise I will be done soon I think he's also being used to mock being a leftist and not a Democrat because I've noticed every time he's brought on like after like even though the interview looked glowing and everything every single host has said something negative about what he's saying they're like oh like that's so funny that he says that he doesn't know what he's talking about that's not has he even listened to the policies that Kam like was talking about did he even like realize so he being used be like yeah yeah yeah you want answers you think he has answers you would expect hold on you would expect them to at least disagree with him but they problem is what yeah you would expect the host to disagree with the guy who's claiming to be like a radical socialist on CNN of course but the question still stands of why are they even platforming him in good faith he's getting so many he is like you cannot deny look you cannot both of you like I and I love Midwestern marks by the way fan been following you for a while you cannot deny that he has a big platform he has a large why why why I'll stop you I'm gon to stop you right there how is he allowed to have a big platform he has been in media for the past 10 years he has got banned eight times you think you think having a career in media is going to protect you from the system you look at Max blumen look I think you are refusing to listen that's not what I'm saying he has platform already he is easily accessible to a lot of people when you're easily accessible it's easy to transmit information to people that are you cannot access they believe probably his audience are people that okay can I ask you a question why has he not been deplatformed or demonetized even one time because he's bringing them so much money at the end of the day we live in a capitalist was Jackson Hingle not bringing money to YouTube by the way how do you know he's a lot more divisive and he is straight up a Nazi like he just says a lot that word hold on hold on before we get to that before we get to that um you don't think Hassan is divisive on the purple website is but he is like very soft like this is why I consider myself further to the left because I feel like he is he's a bit more Li upad than he likes to you're not even hearing yourself right now he is the number he he was allow toow unimpeded he was allowed to grow unimpeded to being the top political live streamer on Amazon streaming website the top he was allowed without any obstructions whatsoever no media hit pieces he has connections his uncle's literally has been in media like they have they he has doesn't the argument that he's not control opposition and I'm not saying that he is what I'm saying is that this this conversation is not productive like this conversation is going to cires I just want to ask you a question we should let call us feds and say nothing it seems like look I did not know I did not know that he called you feds that's what the whole conversation's about J let me ask you federal agents let me ask you a question do threats and dissidents and critics of the system are they allowed to to grow on social media at all with zero systemic push back no but he has the benefit of having again connections he didn't start I agree he's got connections that's what I'm trying to say what connections though I swear to God just let me finish he already had a platform and he did not start as a leftist he actually had a lot of like he was very much very lived up in the very beginning he likes to say that I have been consistent and saying the same thing but if we you go back all the way back to the beginning of his journey on The Young Turks he was in really as I guess so I'll tell you something um I'll tell you something it doesn't matter if he flipped his position and it's immaterial as to what I'm asking you if he changed his position why didn't he start getting systemic push back for that he already grew the platform no he you're completely wrong so Hassan's more leftward turn was Bernie's primary run leading up to 2020 and that is when he built his this the audience that he has today 20 roughly 20,000 live concurrent he has not grown past that since 2020 since 2019 2020 so it was precisely on that basis that he grew and he has since received no systemic push back now there are so many political live streamers that were part of mainstream media that did build very very large huge audiences who have gotten deplatformed or demonetized because they have taken positions that are uh considered threatening to the system because he always played it safe that's why I'm saying I'm far left than him because he is actually do you you do realize that he has a full team a marketing team like he's an entity he's a he's a company like you're making our argument for us what I'm saying is that at the end of the day you can't like we I still don't know if he's a Fed but he is still a media entity I if he's if you're allowed to be a media entity it means you are being protected by the feds he is a pathway for people who have radical leftist energy to filter them right into to the Democrats it's they're called radical recr there's something else and they've been vital to the ruling classes strategy for the last however many years there's something we have to address I want to go back to this yeah so JY JY erso that's Star Wars my actual you think whatever whatever do you think do you think that um a form of persecution could be like reputation destruction and um things like that like you know if you read books about how us intelligence agencies operate if they don't have a legal pretext they cannot cannot they cannot like um get you physically right yet at least they wish the camera works because I would I would love for you to see my facial expression I would love to show you my lived [ __ ] I'm from Iraq I'm from Baghdad I'm just I'm just gonna I came I came to the states in 2009 I lived American imperialism I've seen it with my very own eyes I have held dead bodies I have see the blood of my cousin so care what you say on live please not to cut you what I'm saying is that I have experienced American imperialism probably more than a lot of people that are in America I have seen it firsthand I've seen soldiers being uted right there and then can you answer my question what what I'm saying is that like I feel like there is an immediate push back like you just assume that I am just this probably some LEF I ask you a question can you can you answer the question can you ask the question again do you think that when us intelligence agencies cannot have a legal pretext to Target you that they'll resort to trying to destroy and malign your reputation of course they will always do that so you can't repeat it because we're on Tik Tock but if you roll back the tape you said that Jackson was a literal yatsi can you tell me why you said that have you seen his antiemetic comment like he has said some [ __ ] that is really yeah name name them name the things said there are specific tweets there are so many tweets that he has posted name name want me to send you links CU I can I I have your Discord uh uh Midwestern Mar read it out but like censor any like bad blocked him like in the last two months but I can unblock him and go he has you cannot tell me he has not been like like I'm I'm very kind of shocked honestly because well what do you think what do you think the worst thing he said is the way he just he doesn't say Israel he talks about like he says Jews this and Jews Like have you not read an example you cannot be serious you cannot be serious you can't be well I'll believe you if you show me an example why don't you give me one example I I will gladly send you plenty on your Discord I I don't right now I'll be able to now I have to go on X and unblock go to his page and search the word that you're for if you can if you can send hold on this is ridiculous if you can send us links you can just read off the tweets yourself just read them to us oh my Lord at the end of the day I guess my point was this is pointless and no I think that's an incred together we need to realiz we have each other focus on the main thing we need to work together you're the one who just attacked Jackson not with us he is he is not he is not prove it then show us the evidence that you say is so abundant on his no pickles on my broker says he has evidence so I'm going to give you a Lifeline call and help have no pickles on my Brer what's up you you know what uh H and Midwestern marks actually watch your guys stuff like like you guys H even though there's some things I disagree with you on you're there's I won deny that there's this is like a game show and she phoned in some help okay all right all right Lifeline Lifeline all right so in terms of anti-Semitism I don't I off the top of my head not for that but for things like Jackson Hinkle going back to Hassan piger and the FED thing to make it clear I don't think you're a Fed I don't think M Western marxis I don't think all right so you don't have anything anyway JY you made an accusation well okay I I want to just ask you a question just just and hear me out here right in good faith you were so ready and willing to call him a yatsi without any proof not even off the top of your head but it's just because he's kind of like known that way in the spaces you frequent now could you even entertain the possibility that that could possibly be because the narrative has been engineered and manufactured in such a way that it's easy for people to call Jackson a yatsi even if there's actually no concrete anything backing that up hold on the there's a watermelon who said they can be the lifeline go ahead and uh request then well I guess before I get a Lifeline not that I'm trying to get a Lifeline because I really don't even know why we're spending any time talking about this hled unless you guys I think it's a good example hold on are you friends with him trying to defend him or what's going on like what what's the point of having I certainly don't think he's a yatsi Jackson is one of us hold on to be clear Jackson is that's when we disagree and that's when I have then to leave because we're we're just not goingon to see eye to eye appreciate the opportunity hold on but why is there such a dis that was such so we're talking about persecution and manipulation and who's a fed and who's not and there's such a level of psychological discursive barrier here on this issue in particular where this woman could not even engage and you're telling me the feds have not manipulated it and engineered The Narrative to be so overwhelmingly against Jackson again Hassan [ __ ] is the guy who's squeaky clean there's nothing wrong with his reputation Jackson is like a demon in comparison for what hold on the question is do you are you so naive to think that's organic do you think the internet is organic do you think that this is not we know how much things are engineered and controlled because for us to partake in shaping narratives and controlling discourse which we do as the ACP and as infrared yes we do and it's a lot of methodical planning and Engineering that goes into it that we're doing and we're amateurs and we're fighting actual feds and battle them and we're amateurs who don't even know what we're doing so to say it's organic no we don't buy that we know what it takes to fight the system there's nothing organic about it uh all right um zigg go ahead I'm gonna reiterate the question I ask every Hanan supporter is it possible to be a threat or dissident uh against the system if the system's media machine is doing blowups on you and praising you and you're getting no push back at all CNN in particular the question is um sorry could you repeat it yeah can you be a threat to the system if uh CNN is like doing glow ups on you and giving you no problems and no because they're agents of the system right I'm glad we agree thank thank you all right let's bring up someone else uh jesser I'm going to ask the same question is it possible to be a threat to the system and have CNN do glow ups on you and like cover you so well and make you look so good you eating hello [Music] thank you sleeper so all right I think this guy's a little dumb found it oh [ __ ] sorry I I didn't realize I was on my be I'm literally walking my [ __ ] dog that's so funny sorry my bad um so actually I wanted to say to you guys um I really appreciate you guys for accepting my request um I wanted to say my I and this is an exact answer to your question H so I apolog olog I just wanted to get this point in real quick um I wanted to say my all right we're looking for people to answer the question um K Don please uh if you heard the question answer it and if uh you haven't heard it I'll repeat it people got to fix their internet should go to some else yeah um this person is uh wow it's like they backed out I added two people they backed out uh Venice go ahead okay they left uh Jay with the hammer and sickle Emoji uh can you answer the question Jay you're on are you there Jay what are these noises all right get the [ __ ] out of here hell is that uh Kevin can you answer the million-dollar question yo what's good guys yo what's up can you answer the million-dollar question that no Hassan fan can answer sorry can you just repeat it for me real quick yeah can threats to the system be get glowing uh uh glow ups by CNN I think honestly I think yes if they're trying to like discredit someone else like you guys honestly like like if they're just doing it like real short term you're saying you're saying uh he is a threat to the system but just not as much of a threat as us yeah I mean I don't know if necessarily I think he's a big threat or anything but I feel like he could be a good Gateway you know what I mean like some people kind of get interested in his stuff and then they go along a path that ends up with you guys kind of thing um right but that's kind of not possible if he's in Cambridge calling Jackson a Fed right yeah I mean I get that but I don't know I think a lot of the people who watch him disagree with a lot of the stuff he says right like especially something like that and that's like kind of like a like a nice like leftist thing now it's just like calling everyone feds especially you guys for some reason so I don't think necessarily like he's like some kind of you got to ask as the question what would feds do to Target actual threats well they would fed jacket them and make everyone believe it especially with someone who's uh nominally leftwing or who claims to also be a socialist that makes it more powerful because normies see that you know and this is the the power of controlled opposition and radical recuperators is you know they see someone who calls himself a socialist calling communist feds they're more likely to believe it than if Fox News is you know saying dumb [ __ ] yeah but if if he was like integrated like that wouldn't he be doing like the pro rava or you know SDF like vosch kind of positions like he was he didn't he wasn't Pro Smo when it started like he was saying you know Putin is bad and stuff just to be safe but he was introducing people to the concept of you know understanding that you know Putin did this because of the um like all the NATO influence in Ukraine and stuff like like he's a safe version Ling like coverage of that war is why I was banned from tople place from tikt they deplatformed me and I was doing very well by the way and they deplatformed me because I was um I was uh being far more direct than that so it's like why would they now maybe they're not going to deplatform him well okay I need to tell you how it works with the deplatforming what will happen is that a think tank will do a hitpiece on you and saying and all they did to me is they said I repeated Kremlin propaganda which Hassan also did by that same standard if you're saying this is because of NATO expansion that's a Kremlin talking point that's all it takes the think tank publishes a report it looks very scientific it looks very professional oh he's repeating Kremlin talking points so they're insinuating you're a you're a an agent of Russia and then uh a news Outlet will cover that think tanks report they'll cover it and then from that coverage they'll reach out to the platform and the platform you know and that's how it works um and that's what happened to me why did it not happen to him well I think he was just really trying to take the safe road cuz I mean like look like we all know he like he likes the money right obviously right so so he's going to make sure that like that keeps coming in I know like cuz I was watching hle like the dive is what his show was called then when it first happened and yeah you know he was going out he speaking the truth and he got asked for it so H son's trying to figure out that right balance I do think he's more radical than he lets on but I think it's more so like uh like like he is a careerist like opportunist right but I think him existing is better than him not existing for the left because it kind of gets some people were more lib right I think he no I I think he's got a monopoly on the space and that if he didn't exist someone would take his place who's actually like principled and well maybe not even principled but actually leftwing like actually left wing and I think me getting some of his fans to come over to us is more a credit to the power of Marxism leninism which I've studied deeply than it is a credit to Hassan you know I think would have been able to find those people anyways um I think it's more likely that he keeps people in a sort of echo chamber and then of course you know as soon as I actually am part of a a real organization doing work on the ground he starts openly attacking me rather you know and and kind of closing off that bridge that his viewers could take from him to me I don't really give him credit for the overlap in our audience I think it's just cuz a lot of um you know a lot of people are looking for something deeper more theoretical more systematic analysis anyways and they would be without with or without Hanan all right K Don hey what's up yeah I hey I just joined can you uh repeat the question or if yeah the million dooll question is how can you be a threat to the system and CNN is um doing blowups on you um how can you be a threat to the system I think CNN is doing blowups on you like they did for Hanan [ __ ] oh um I mean by attacking their like interviewers directly like you do research on the interviewers yeah yeah but did they do that for Hassan did they attack him oh uh personally I didn't see it but yeah I just uh because they didn't they didn't attack him they didn't attack him at all um our boy King ratchet's back all right King ratchet what's up so correct me if I'm wrong here are you guys angry at Hassan because he called you uh feds am I am I understanding this that's the most recent thing he also said we were a crypto scam when we did not have a cryptocurrency and it was a lie he saw on Twitter and repeated then never corrected so I can can I be fair here because I gotta be honest the last time that that that we had a conversation and this is just purely on on Marxist s or Marxism and I'm a Marxist as well and the last conversation that I had with you two you guys were defending America as like a settler Colonial Nation Jesus Christ can you talk what does that have to do with FEDS the the problem is when you guys are using Marxist leninism and using know the Marist bastardizing it you you are though you are you don't know the Marxist leninist position Amic Ed Eddie don't don't allow this guy to get away with what he just did you have a theoretical disagreement with us about Marxism how does that give you the right to justify slander something is either true or it's false it's the truth or it's a lie and someone is lying about us and you're trying to justify that lie because you disagree with us about Theory no now the connection come out get calm down calm down I want to have a civilized conversation with you make the connection the the connection is if a person listens to enough of your specific views on something and you're bastardizing Marxist leninism that is people can assume I don't know if that's his mentality I'm not uh Hassan people can assume though that you guys are control opposition I'm not trying to be mean when I say that you know okay I'm gon to but I'm going to explain to you something that we can back up with empirical proof with actual evidence so this is proof this is fact this is fact our position was the norm for the established communist parties the labor movement and the Socialist movement period until the 70s and 60s with the rise of the so-called new left and when the new Left arose the soviet-backed traditional Outlook was undermined with the backing of the CIA in the feds who bankroll Gloria steum who bankroll the university academics and to this day it's New York Times publishing the 1619 project so before you make talking about changing Marxism or whatever we have proof that the CIA the feds manufactured your position ours is orthodox stalinism yours was created in the Laboratories of the federal government so don't sit here and try to make a connection between your claim that we're misinterpreting Marxism with well that could lead people to perceive that you're feds when your entire Outlook and misinterpretation of Marxism was created by the CIA instead of laugh look up what Lenin said about the American Revolution no no no it's it's you don't even have you just got to use common sense L said about it no think Eddie Eddie just use don't even entertain use common sense resp would the feds want Marxism to be something that is part and resonates with the history of the American people and the majority or do they want Marxism to be alienated and cut off from the working class the American working class which one is better for them it's simple of course they want to be alienated from the m to resp I I don't want to be angry and like yeah that at each other I would love to respond make the we have we have empirical evidence specifically when it comes to America so like regardless the the scenario that you're drawing here about America and being um the CIA would would draw a line with us specifically marxists who are reading it from a just empirical standpoint what's the empirical standpoint that America is a settler Colonial nation was Russia settler Colonial it's true was Russia sir was Russia we're talking about America right now I know talk reactionary you're very reaction King ratchet you said Marxism leninism Lenin was in Russia was Russia settler or Colonial with the expansion into Siberia talk about America we're talking about America was Russia sett Colonial when they expanded into Siberia do you know about a city called Vlad vosto how was where come from you're you're very reactionary answer my question directly reason Russia settler Colonial a you sound like a reactionary you sound like a reactionary you don't want to have like real Nuance radical conversations you want Russia settler coloni last conversation that you and I had was Russia settler or Colonial under the Romanov Dynasty Russia settler or Colonial under the Romanov Dynasty oh my god did you know Russia settler or Colonial when they expanded into Siberia I got the next point after this no no no I want him to answer this they was the board were the borders of Russia defined in a settler or Colonial way Ukraine it's called Frontier who went into Ukraine was that settlement was that colonization and Eastward both Westward and Eastward was there settler or colonialism in Russia yes or no sure let's say sure okay so despite the fact that Russia was settler or Colonial the Marxist leninist position in practice was preserving the Integrity of Russian history rather than National nihilism affirming Russian national identity and the continuity between the rsfsr the Russian Soviet Republic and the historical Russian State and even under Stalin they extended it from continuity of the historical Russian Empire to the Soviet Union itself in terms of being a successor State okay can can I respond to can I respond can I respond can I respond to you I I have to give pretext of this conversation because the last time that we had a conversation we were specifically talking about America and the argument that you were making what's different time out can can I respond bro like you you have a very you're very triggered by this so like the the conversation that you and I were having was about America being specifically different from um Israel's um and then the a ton of the examples that you were speaking about was about it was very reactionary and it was very much like Republican esque in a way and it was like it was specifically about like oh do you know the first person that passed away from uh when when America was turned or or turned against the British I got to cut you off this is really genius stuff please keep talking it happened it this is the I'm smizing the conversation sound you answer the question it was reactionary and it sounded Republic genius it was re wow this is like Aristotle when we're talking about America and specifically no wait wait stop King you haven't said that enough times please tell me the country we're talking about again you haven't told me enough times talk calm down please make your point what country wait wait what country are we talking about the point that I'm making here is the fact that you went because we were having a civilized conversation and you were you're wasting time you weren't having the best success in the conversation you immediately start doing reactionary talking points all right King what do you think K what are you trying to say what's your response to my point about Russia right now I'm not talking about Russia though I'm talking about America right now so what's the difference though why is it allowed both settler Colonial why were they L why can't we yeah why can't we have the same attitude toward the USA which lenon regarded as far more historically Progressive than Russia by the way that Lenin had toward Russia historically why can't we have those relations I'm making the next point after he answers this h no go ahead answer that make your point and then I no answer the question first because my Point's different he's trying to avoid this listen really bro listen you're allowed to have no no h Eddie bro listen King you can have whatever position you want about I don't care I don't really care what you think about America right but don't sit here and say we're distorting Marxism leninism bro you you're out of your league you don't know what you're talking about right we are that's our religion we are Orthodox Marxist leninist we live breathe and beep for it right do you think do you think this is a reactionary statement that saying we're not we're going against Marxism do you think this is an anti-marxist and reactionary statement the history of modern civilized America opened with one of those great really liberating really revolutionary Wars of which there have been so few compared to the vast number of Wars of Conquest which like the present imperialist War were caused by squabbles among Kings land owners or capitalists do you think that's a reactionary thing to say about America's history no however what what you guys were do what you guys were arguing we got to be exactly what we were arguing no it really wasn't what you were arguing was America specifically the Revolutionary War had nothing to do with uh uh I don't know how many what words I can get away with racism it had nothing to do with imperialism at all what you that was what Lon just said in the quote I read to you that was from Vladimir Lenin we were we have his position exactly he said it wasn't imperialist he said it was liberating bro King I'm going throw you a I'm is after this conversation I I seen it last I seen I know you're ragging your finger it feels good to to to be wrong however I I saw the last conversation I have as and I have to do this to tolerate your weight time wasting specifically and and I will round and round it goes like Sonic I got Asbergers guys listen let me tell you something you don't like to listen I'm throw you bone throw youone okay you can call me names that's fine let me throw you bone King you were not very satisfied with your performance in our last debate you come up here you came up in here trying to change the outcome or whatever listen bro take the L you I'm historically right so I don't care about performance you you care about performance because you're a debate bro and debate Bros usually care specifically you the one bragging about how you won the I made very simple bro debate bro is like when you're like oh bro a debate bro is a sophist who's like oh The Logical proposition of the aums I'm I'm being real I'm talking to you like a normal person I'm asking you why it's different inica Russia and became a reactionary when I was pushing back on Y no you're a reactionary let me debate like you're debating no you're a reactionary you're the reactionary I really don't you're what you're saying respond to what you're saying well it's true last time we talked you said you were explicitly defending racism last time we talked you were being reaction how you argue how does it reaction King you're being reaction okay you're the king of reaction bro you're being re the problem is the the last conversation that we had the lastation we had the last conversation that we had I brought up bro this is about America yes this is about America and you're being re bro you sound reaction understand I understand it makes you feel good reaction reaction inside it makes you feel good the the point that I brought up was the Declaration of Independence in the grievance of the the 27th agreement that's what I'm saying bro you sound reactionary and sound reaction I brought that up y'all started pivoting like oh no well let's talk about how bro it's on YouTube I saw that y'all posted on YouTube you sound reactionary bro anybody on here can go listen to the conversation that we had it's on YouTube you're right they can so why are you here right now what are you trying to say yeah everyone can go see what was said everyone can go watch it so what do you want right now bro the point that I'm making to you is originally I don't have a beef with Y I want you're just trying to change the narrative you're trying to define the narrative now when everyone can see for themselves and draw their own conclusion based on you're coming in here now trying to retroactively change what happened or something no no no no no so what are you here for bro what you trying say point is you're upset about why Hassan would call you a Fed yeah a Fed yes and I understand why a person would call you that when you're have the same position King because we made him feel bad about losing a debate and then posting it on YouTube yeah he understands why we would get called fed I didn't lose a debate like a Fed are you about to say Lenin was a Fed what are you even on bro what what are y'all talking about you're saying you're saying you'd understand why Hassan would call us feds because we have the same view as Lenin no I said specific why because I want to have Nuance convers I don't want to argue like that's not what I want to do I want to spec look every time I start speaking bro you know what bro that you gota I don't want to argue I want to have a bro you came in here calling us reaction listen bro what you want to do is save face after getting defeated in that debate and you made it that not us it was chill it was respectful I had no problem with how it went down everyone can go see how that debate went down it was really long by the way I was very patient with you I was like really really you know leveling you know whatever be in good faith and you're not satisfied with the result you probably saw comments agreeing with us instead of you so you're coming in here talking about a whole lot of nothing and now you're saying oh I understand why Hassan would say what he said and then you said well cuz you know you're saying because America's a sett or colony and you don't want to destroy the country America in a socialist uh proletarian dictatorship and it's like well they didn't destroy Russia and Russia was also built on settler colonialism in the same way so I'm just trying to understand why you're saying what you're saying and this I'm not talking about Russia I'm talking about America why not what's different about it you gave me nothing bro now it's always going to go back to that it's always going to go back to that you're looping you're avoiding that we're going to bring on uh Nikki and then we're going to bring on Abdullah yo Nikki all right all right well that was a much better guess than the previous abdal what's up man what the hell is this [ __ ] man hell no man what the hell was that I didn't hear what he said he talking French O instant ban I mean I'm just like what the hell man yo go ahead sludge Nikki wants to come back on request request back up it uh disconnected you it wasn't us I don't got a problem with France I'm just saying it's like I don't understand that bro you got to chill I mean you could I can't police or you could be saying some bad stuff that's going to get us in trouble you know I don't know I'm just messing about France the French Revolution was based to the shout out Pierre should we let squint on uh yeah also the Matrix wants to come on take the red pill all right squint left the Matrix is here yo what's going on hey guys how we doing uh all right can you answer the million dollar a question or what's up okay go on uh can you be a threat to the system and get glow ups from CNN can you be threat to the system and what and be get glow ups from CNN meaning CNN will praise you and will portray you very positively oh no that's impossible right I I'm glad we agree bro Hassan is not a thre to the system I'm glad we agree I'm glad we agree uh I'm glad we agree you know that's what it's all about common ground that's what it's all about common sense because I think it's common sense but apparently there's people who uh who don't understand this yo go ahead Matt all y what's up uh I think um I'm gonna be real I think you can be a to the system I agree with what you guys are saying though like on the main point I feel like he's not far left enough but guy like me guy like me I used to be a pretty big Hassan guy because I used to be like a like a Democrat you know I used to think that like Obama was a great guy you know what I'm saying he he shift me he didn't radicalize me but he definitely turned me towards more of a Social Democrat where I started saying like ah yeah people should have free healthcare and whatnot but um overall I think he's a positive force for shifting people more left but I think that they should be going into more depth on that after they have came him me I don't really watch him anymore but I think he has his purpose and I think that we should recognized his purpose guys like hakee on YouTube are great I think Midwestern marks is good um but I think that he does have a purpose and he can be a threat to the system but you actually have to let it play out over time over time people will watch his content and turn more towards actual communism all right let me ask you a question do you what you're saying may have been true uh before 2020 I would I would give that some credit before 2020 maybe but now I can assure you sir that all of the young men at least are all going over to the far right and Hass is converting not even one of them he's actually a big uh impetus for the far right he's he's facilitating it yeah he's an enabler saying that like are you saying think he's a tool right he is hated Hassan is hated now by the majority so the far right point at Hassan and they go look at this shill of the system if you're really against the system join us the far right so he's enabling the far right hold up hold up run that [ __ ] back I mean I don't know if can I say that I don't know if I can say that my bad he's the only because he's the only major person calling himself the left wing the far right will point at him be like you don't want to go down the leftwing path join us the far right we're the real threats to the system but what what what is he doing that would make someone want to go to the the far right I mean if you look at because people I'll tell you I'll tell you what it is because people can see how insincere he is how inauthentic he is how much you know um uh how much he's U how should I say politically correct how much he's like they uh they rely so much on censorship to keep their Monopoly and look bro the purple website is like a bubble it's literally like a bubble right and outside of that bubble nobody agrees with the culture on that website and like he is like a seen as a gatekeeper and all of the newest like kaai sonat and like the WL people even Aiden Ross like all of that new generation really hate him a lot I I I want to go back to your point about being politically politically correct I don't really think that that's again we can go back to what the last guy was I don't even need to go there talking about political correctness we don't even need to go there because what does that actually have to do like with really anything it's just I'm support for like you know lgbtq rights no listen listen don't don't shoot the messenger I'm just telling you what's happening he is really turning off a lot of people and making uh the left wing look really bad for the new generation of radicalized young people I think this is why a lot of people have a problem with ACP and this is not what I'm not saying this I mean I'm not going to say I disagree or agree with them but it's the fact that I think and and there are certain revolutions that have obviously um and how I'm trying to say this is that I agree with Revolution either way I think that that's a great like obviously it's a great thing to do I think you're not going to get you're not going to get changed through um voting either way and re U is great however you can do it is going to be great but I think that when you say when you talk about you know how he's moving people away from the left because he's too politically correct or too um he's too inclusive is what you're saying basically it's not that not let's not people into the movement who dud we have plenty of people with all sorts of sexualities in our party listen the the issue is he's don't shoot the messenger I'm just telling you how it is he's seen as a gatekeeper who shuts down discourse a lot of young people have questions they're like all right H he doesn't even debate by the way he won't even debate the right way so they're trying to like understand and figure out what perspective they should have and Assan is just saying no just censor and deplatform all of the uh reactionary people so when your average young workingclass person sees that they're like on that's not right now you could be in the know and you he actually going against that when he about on a college cus I feel like I want I want to talk about that he has talked about that before about how deplatforming right-wing people and I remember this deplatforming right-wing people is wrong because then you have these people who think they're in the Matrix like oh what they're saying is so correct they have to silence them he's talked about that before how he is against deplatforming right-wing people because of that exact reason how it makes but in practice he's not but tell me why in practice every single political stream on the purple website is gone including me and he's still there we can go back to the point about CNN there's there's a difference and this goes back to the roots of what we were talking about there's a difference between what you guys are doing and what he's doing he's not a revolutionary his purpose and I I think that both purposes play BR listen it's not about no no about purp listen listen bro Matt Matt objective role that he plays Listen Hold up you guys are revolutionaries all right no no bro listen right now we got to save time all right yeah Matt I don't know who are I don't know if you have brothers or cousins or you live in the real world but it's not you can portray yourself as far left or as Extreme as you want to be but if you have no way of communicating your position to normal people without having a politically correct filter that's fake and inauthentic and inance year you will make no progress okay what's your what more thing one more thing to add to that point the biggest gift that was given to the Trump campaign in 2016 was when Hillary Clinton called his supporters a basket of deplorables what does Hassan [ __ ] call Trump voters he calls them Hogs you don't think that helps the rightwing I'm just trying to bro I'm just trying to tell you point but we don't need we don't need to be I'm saying H's audience and you should do some self-criticism too I'm not doing this to I don't watch a on anymore I've already said that I'm tell you bro the leftists in this country live in a bubble and you don't understand the real world and how real people think who are outside of the college campuses and the Nos and the activist circles it's hard the leftist or leftist it's rough out there bro Hassan is in his purple Castle listen Hassan's in his purple castle and we're out here in gutter in the street fighting literally ysis by ourselves and no one is even giving us backup or helping us because they're living in their oblivious purple castle in the clouds are you telling them are you telling are you basically explaining that more workers have to organize and more Hassan fans have to organize right I mean I do organiz they have to go out and fight in organiz the far right that's making inroads with the masses and they're not doing that they're just saying we hate the masses the masses are all settlers we can't stand the masses we're they're Hogs we're better than them I I also I okay well I also think that I also think that Hassan said okay I'll say it again I'm not a Hassan fan but I'm not a Hassan hater I think I'm neutral on because I think he has some good he has a good purpose but um Hassan said before that like you know everyone deserves a second chance and we shouldn't be pushing out these people cuz a lot of right-wing people they they can't make a switch back to you know e not like leftism but democ the right I'm not saying show Mercy on the right I'm saying don't run away from them that's what he does won't he won't debate right-wing people right he won't engage with it he won't debate them he won't confront it what is the what does the debate actually solve instead of like an actual comp because I'll tell you why he doesn't confront them because he thinks oh anyone who would ever follow that person is a lost cause anyway well bro that's starting to be the majority what a them doesn't cause a difference the only thing that cause a difference yes it does you can't give up the fight for the mass conversation conversation like what we're doing right now is going to cause a difference if someone's injur you can't no you have to crush the far right to win the masses or they won't respect you if you're running away from them how are you going to win the masses how are you going to be respected you can't just say the masses are a lost cause what do you mean they're a lost cause who are you in your $3 million Mansion calling them hogs in a lost cause and saying this country is cooked you have to fight for the people you have to fight for this country I'm not gonna like I'm and we're being called far right just because we have the courage to be in the battlefield to not seed all these these points to the reactionaries or seed all these people to the reactionaries which is one of the thing Lenin explicitly calls again giving reactionaries all right the Democrat left from before 2020 that never evolved past 2020 y'all need to take the L you were wrong about a lot of things all right I'm not going to get into details I'm going to mention one thing big Pharma y'all were wrong about that you were wrong about so many things that you say oh this is a farri talking point you were wrong about these things and you you seated it to the far right and that was a big big mistake that's another thing Hassan on the other day on his show he said the media got covid 100% right by getting behind big Pharma that is such a gift to the right when he says things like that oh man he did so much damage doing that that's not the Communist position it's not it's a neoliberal position and he's taking that position while calling himself a socialist and it allows you know right-wingers to to point at people like us and say we have those same neoliberal positions when we don't well you're well I don't know okay hold up I don't know why why you why you guys are trying to infight with him when they do the same thing the regular Democrats like KLA Harris like like Trump's campaign Trump's com oh no no I mean yeah no I mean that's you know I'm not gonna I don't need to go into that I mean what no that's another thing that's that's another thing I have a problem with framing wise how is Trump to the right of the Democrats exactly I don't I voted for Claudia de Cruz I didn't vote for either them because I think they're right but I'm just saying even H accepts the framing Trump is the far right KL is not the far right why isn't right at this I don't agree with I don't agree with Hassan's actual idea on change he believes that you know let's vote in Bernie Sanders to make changes I don't agree with that either I think Bernie Sanders isn't a good isn't that great of a person at all either I mean I don't agree with a lot of the things he says but I do think he has a purpose in like what he did for me I'm I'm got purpose look bro I I hate saying it but the ugly truth is that you have college campuses and a bunch of people in corporate careers and in Nos and in corporate workspaces and like all of these like sanitized you know environments that are just totally privileged Bubbles and that's ass son's viewers meanwhile the rest of the country is rapidly accelerating to the far far far right the youth especially and none of them are going over to Hassan and he even knows it he's admitted it so he has his bubble that he's kept since 2020 and the rest of the countryes in flames and one of the reasons there's no leftwing is because the far right people are pointing to Hassan saying look at him he's part of the system and they're right he is part of the system so all of the people angry at the system in the status quo they're not going to the left they're going to the far right and why should that be it's the left Wing that should be against the system right yeah I'm just telling you the truth no no you're right no I mean I'm not like I'm not like denying that fact that you just said I'm not like you know you're not wrong about that you know you're just preaching to the choir here I mean I don't know yeah I'm just saying man it's rough out there it's rough out there and Hassan is not doing he's not helping he's really not helping bro we're in the trenches out there you know um you guys don't know how much of it is a battle for us you know being able to make this position palpable to the real world is really hard and it's like we're fighting the far right and then we have Hassan coming and attacking us it's crazy it's almost like he's a farri collaborator it is yeah I would say to Matt thanks for coming on and think a little bit about what what we said reflect on the role that Hassan plays and keep in mind that you know he could be yeah serving a different purpose than just a pipeline to People Like Us yeah can you hear me yes yeah yeah I I kind of wanted to disagree with you guys because I don't really see this point in Hassan being like a bigger threat in terms of like not go on like encouraging more debates with the right when if anything like the most annoying factor of people who just understand that what leftwing is that that difference obvious difference between you know liberalism neoliberalism versus actual like leftism like I don't really get the point in just kind of bro because the left wing is supposed to go against the system and the far right is pretending to go against the system and they're lapping the so-called left Y in terms of winning the working class and the youth and that's I don't feel like there's no point in engaging that another good example like of somebody who does that but doesn't bring anything good out of it like look at Destiny every time bro Destiny's not on the left he's a neol liberal wing and I hate that like people like like people like him are trying to make him like he's in the left like he's a part of this no he's not even he doesn't say that he is a right liberal he's a right-wing liberal dude he was literally complaining because he couldn't go to the DNC but the Democrats aren't leftist at all there's nothing left-wing about them yeah I get that but don't understand this whole point and just like kind of putting him into this like category where it's like he's not for us when it's like dude he's like not even like close to that whole thing and it's just like that constant feeding into into listen bro Hassan [ __ ] is not only uh a part of the system he is actually doing damage to the left wing can you go he's doing damage to the left wing because if people think because if he has Monopoly on what the left wing is and we're here trying to be an alternative to him and he's attacking us fed jacketing us so he's preventing anyone from being leftwing that's not him and if he's the only face of the left wi everyone angry at the system is going to go to the far right because why is the leftwing part of the system that's what they're going to ask they're going to say the leftwing is the system all of the censorship all of the whatever all of big Pharma the operations and that Hassan is the face of that right so they're going to the far right because he's imposing himself as a monopoly on the left in this country and that's a disaster it's the a effect he admitted it he even said in this CNN glowup that all of the young men are going to the far yeah what do you think yeah because I don't like lot of like rightwing like groups because all they get out of it is just like trying to get their Cloud up just by doing these debates it's like they're just going to constantly pull this no I'm right and you're I know but it's a constant it's a constant battle you have to wage that's what politics is yeah but I just feel like it's G to get get us nowhere if we continue to do it though no it's going to get you everywhere that's what politics is you have to constantly be in the thick of the whatever the consciousness of the masses is at you have to be in the thick of engaging with that and he but doesn't matter a lot of these rightwing St just like some of their biggest like issue whether it's not they can say most craziest [ __ ] online for like follow they're lapping him in terms of total clout compared bro the purple website is a bubble I'm trying to tell you that it's a huge bubble you mean if I if I go to the gym say they'll suppress us if I go to the gym yeah if I go to the gym if I go anywhere outside and I ask a random person what their opinion is they're far right bro it's crazy see that it's crazy you know so there needs to be a question of wait isn't the left wing supposed to be against the system well why is the biggest so-called face of the left uh part of the system yeah but I don't see him as like the biggest face of the left though if anything like seeing him like getting kicked out of the DNC because of his comments about them like getting like being funded by Israel who's the biggest who's the biggest face of the left but who is the biggest face of the left then I don't think there's any point of like saying who's like number one I feel like there's a kind of like many who just kind of pick what who they choose want to pick out like it's just up to people on who they decide on what say he's the biggest the number one on the purple website he's the biggest quote unquote socialist influencer in America what oh yeah one thing I wanted to ask you guys like what exactly about him being politically correct is like too wrong for him apparently like like again don't shoot them I'm not the one deciding there's anything wrong with it I'm telling you that the average person sees someone being inauthentic and not sincere about what they actually believe but what they know is what they should say because it's the moral thing or the institutionally approved thing they don't like that it's it's ingenuine it's insincere and they see it as fake and they see they see past it they could smell it from a mile away all because like he kind of speaks out on like issues on like trans rights or anything like that um look I'm not going to say that I'm going to say that you could even if you had those views you could have any view you want but if it's not coming from the heart something that you can communicate genuinely like why should a random person believe this someone who's not incentivized by greed and money and social validation to have these like positions it's going to be it's going to be a really bad look and that's what it is as far as he's concerned like I'm not going to necessarily say that his socially liberal positions are the reason necessarily for example George Carlin had a lot of socially liberal positions but the way he presented them through like comedy or whatever seemed to actually like resonate with people and it wasn't turning them off even if people didn't agree with it it was like nobody hated him or couldn't stand him or called him fake for it yeah but that's not who Hassan is he's not a George Carlin he's a completely fake inauthentic actor yeah I don't see the fakeness at this point if even the Democrats even should understand that he's kind of a threat to them bro I never really understood is the one pushing back against the claim that he got kicked out of the DNC what like a couple months ago you mean yeah he's saying he didn't get kicked out when did he say that I've heard him say it pretty sure do you know what exact like quote he said I remember like Destiny tried to say oh yeah he got kicked out of the DNC and then he was like no I didn't something like that yeah I haven't seen any anything about that but I don't know I just feel like for any kind of like constant media that I feel like people have been wanting to look for in order to get more into Le leftism and socialism and communism I feel like it's just been like a big Battleground that has always been and I feel like I've seen a big occurrence like uh Resurgence and more people like fighting against like the red pill movement which has obviously been a pipeline to like the alt-right stuff and I've seen more and more creators and like on whether it be you or uh other like streaming platforms or Tik Tok constantly speak about it like I understand like I've seen more of like our generation speak out against it maybe not in terms of hold on I'll is you a correction people he wasn't he wasn't kicked out uh for being for having any political position but he was uh prohibited from streaming so they basically said you can't be here if you're going to be streaming and they had invited him there to join a creat for they had invited him there in the first place but he wasn't allowed to live stream the whole thing to be part of creators for Comm was the name of the group they invited so had he turned his live stream off he would never have gotten removed to be clear about what happened I mean that shows you exactly what he does for the Democrats he you know takes radical energy and and filters it right to the DNC just like AOC that's why I keep saying it's the AOC effect yeah I don't really see that connection between him if he can constantly bash him as like many times as he can then why did they invite him to the DNC to be one of the creators for comma they clearly see him as useful I feel like that was a choice they decided to make but I don't think they really went into him blups on CNN mainstream media does nothing but gas this guy up I'm telling you he's part of the system BR they've always not listen bro it's easy say we're all part of the system but when you're like us who are deplatformed constantly subject to uh reputation destruction uh harassed by feds literally demonetized all the time and like uh just so many things done against us constantly yeah bro there's a difference between like being part of the system in the sense of buying an iPhone and being part of the system in the sense of like no systemic resistance or push back to anything you're doing when you're a high-profile self-proclaimed left-wing streamer and let me tell you techmo the system and when I say the system I mean the ruling class has always always always needed people like Hassan and AOC who posture as being leftwing but they ultimate purpose even though they don't say it and this is what makes them so effective at what they do they're ultimate purpose is to bring people back to the Democratic party to say we need to work within the Democratic party and go out to the elections for the Democratic party there have always been these kind of people and no matter how much revolutionary rhetoric they give they all they their final solution is always we need to work through the the Democratic party always need these ALC because I have had like 5050 like like views on she voted for Iron Dome else yeah but I think another isue I've never really seen him as like very big of like part for the Democrats is like his like amount in support for the Palestinian movement and just the fact that like Richie Torres like has constantly like spammed like a being better than Richie Torres doesn't make you a a revolutionary I'm sorry look targeted by democrats who are funded by ape it's like that's got mean for something like I don't think part of theame targeted I think that every single person that's quote unquote targeted him was themselves like grasping at straws like struggling to do so rather than an actual systemic United systemic attack listen when somebody is attacked by the system you can tell you can actually tell like it's so clear because everyone is coming after them all the constantly like constantly non-stop like you could tell something is a coordinated attack all right and uh he has not never gone through that yeah uh I think that's one thing I do agree on like I would like to see him like more interact more more like a stronger like leftist like people like like your guys yourselves and a few other people I can think of but then again there's that always just thing of like I do notice that he does hate that like debate stuff that constantly goes back like he doesn't want to do that do you think I like debates I I literally do not like debating hate debate yeah there's just always that issue with me where it's like for some people it's like is it is it the intentions for it really to try to get a me like message out about for like actual leftism or is that really I'll tell you exactly why you have to debate debating is about who who is willing to stand on a position and say it with their chest even while they're getting push back and how do they respond and how do they like leftist debating other leftists but just debating the like the like right- Wingers and all right people like I don't see it at this point like I feel like it's so repetitive like looking back and trying to go to like that 2015 2016 era where you had guys like that yeah they have been lapping bro they've been win winning because listen you have debates are everything because it's about dominance it's about who wins and who gets destroyed all right and if you stop doing that the other side is going to grow and win yeah I don't I don't really see it like that because I've seen more that's what's happening the being more hypocritical in their talking listen listen everybody knows that Ben Shapiro is the like uh speak fast and like repeat like and he built the giant audience because all the last tried to do was censor him instead of engaging with the you know that guy uh you know that guy uh can we say his name Rick quentes quentes Rick Wes rickes that guy will literally not debate me he's running from De all right that's how much him we would crush him he's scared of it because he know a grosser like like what's the point in feeding into that though I don't I don't understand Fe we'd crush him that's why he won't debate us his friend Jake Shields is trying to get him to do one with me and he he won't do it because he knows the effect it would have it would show his audience his ideological incoherence yeah I agree that and like even a lot of the other people like I noticed like they're too like cowardly to actually do it like like for years always seeing Ben Shapiro constantly going around these like college students but like I never seen him do a debate with Norman felin noard you're gonna be the young because they kind of proven that point that they're hypocritical so there's really no point in doing that debate it's like saying there's no point in fighting a war bro that's like saying there's no point in fighting a war of course there's a point it's everything it decides everything yeah I I know because I just really see the more and more of these big like writing wiggers and then uh the Vic Fuentes types like just really it really becomes that line to between who are we actually going to like learn something from this like whether like talking to one or actually just getting something out for cloud you're going to demonstrate the superiority of a given position to people who are neutral remember everyone starts out neutral you need to understand that so if someone has a stronger position obviously they're going to go with the strong and you look like you have a stronger position when you're chasing after everybody and debating everyone and it looks like your position is weak when you're never willing to put it on the line in any way yeah but it's just like so tiresome and seeing like all this Contex I agree it's tiresome politics is tiresome war is tiresome but there's no rest in this if you're claiming to be leftwing you can't rest and say you're tired you got to keep fighting I had another uh question about like for you guys like when you guys were growing up what type of like content like U whether it like was music or any sort of media that really got you into your political beliefs I watched The Amazing Atheist TJ Kirk was probably one of the first people I got into oh wow and what about you um I don't know I just like I I didn't like the system and I liked you know the militancy of like marxists and you know to me Marxist at that this was like 20 2007 or something so like when I heard about Marxism it was like CH guara and it was gorillas and it was like the bolix and the Red Army and I was like that's like the the revolutionaries fighting the system it's like that's how I got into it yeah I never really understood on How Deeply biased like in any kind of media you can find whenever like take for example Call of Duty like straight up this guy named Joe Mama goes oh so you were just edgy yeah I was 11 I was like 11 or 12 so yeah a little bit you know oh yeah but yeah I was saying like growing up I never really understood like the big like right-wing bias that like I've seen in so much media whether it come to like video games or movies like like a good the good example like Call of Duty obviously L being like a lot of Western imperialism like bias like the Black Ops leg games like the amount of like insane like anti-communist like like story like writing in terms of those games like whether it became to like an the anti-m mission or that that really embarrassing like a attempt at theel Castro like in the Black Ops one games or even something like like American Sniper never understood how the hype for that movie and just finding out that Chris K I'm gonna tell you the actual story the story began was like five when I was traumatized by a movie called blood diamond and oh yeah with Leo yeah and I was like these bad guys were really bad in the movie and they were like the revolutionaries and I just became fast like what is a revolutionary what's a revolution like oh it's when you know they they're they're Rising against the government like I remember learning about this in fifth grade I was like oh that's really bad but then as I kind of grew up a little I was like actually the government's bad and being a revolutionary is good yeah that movie was wild so like that was the pipeline that started it was like just being fascinated by the idea that governments can be overthrown and change for me it was actually Act 10 in Wisconsin the uh Koch brothers governor Scott Walker crushed the teachers unions and my dad was a teacher and there were all these protests and we went and protested around the capital and the more I learned about the the government I realized it was corrupt and I was like you know eventually you get to the point where you realize you need a a revolutionary change but it was being with those people marching around the capital like we can actually fight back against this [ __ ] and and seeing the depravity of of Walker and how corrupt he was and how smug he was about it and how he [ __ ] on workingclass people like my dad it just made me want to do anything to get these people out of power and unite the kind of people who were marching around the capital against him but you know what Screwed Up is that you know what Hassan's entry into so-called left politics was what his uncle being a millionaire who owned a media company oh yeah chank yeah yeah if anything I like I've disliked the The Young Turks less and less now ever since when I was when I was 11 I was reading about Chay guara when Hassan was 11 he was fighting diabetes okay I'm just saying for him to call people fighting really hard right now feds it's just kind of crazy that this guy is like literally just learning about Marxism and he's making these claims that he's making and we have genuine stories that where we came from the ground up from the working class and dedicated Our Lives to fighting this system and he just shows up at camb Bridge the you know the university that's closer connected to the British MI6 and British intelligence than any other and says that we're
