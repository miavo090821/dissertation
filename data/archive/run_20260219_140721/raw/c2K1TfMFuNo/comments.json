Others went to bring food and supply to civilians in Donbass and they didn't get jailed too, because it wasn't illegal. \n\nHinkle didn't go in Donbass to fight against the Russians, but didn't engage in action deemed illegal and was still under scrutiny. How can you say that he went in Donbass for the US gov, as a fed, if he didn't do: 1 anything in support to us policy; 2 anything ILLEGAL against us policy at the point that the absence of legal repercussions would make the lack of it suspicious?\n\nWhat is hard to understand, literally?\n\nYou could go to Russia tomorrow, or at the Sochi Youth Conference. They will search your arse once you're back in the US, but they can't jail you for it. Would that make you a fed too?\n\nVeterans for Peace is an org under us scrutiny and they likely do more for peace, and by extension also the working people of not just the US, than you.

He actively takes actions to discredit the left by talking down on other left wingers as well as promoting actions that are not in line with other socialists (while being portraited as the socialist model). Examples being that he only talks about things that are somewhat popular to not like about the establishment, but when it comes to his issues with the left he goes to CNN and talks crap about them and even lies to what they are which in turn gains him clout. His actions against the establishment have been words with little meaning to them, while his actions towards the left have been specifically targeted to discredit them and push the image of socialism down. I guess in some ways what I am saying is that his backlash against the left is louder than the one against the establishment. Already from this it makes things pretty clear that he is a controlled opposition, to appeal to the people that already disagree but to gate them from becoming a threat to the system, and at the very best to turn them the other way around. To give some perspective; as a real socialist the enemy number one is the capitalist establishment, even though you may not agree on some points with other socialists you don't fight with your brothers. Once you turn your back on your brothers and start attacking them, that is the point you have lost your sense and become a tool for the capitalists, it is called divide and conquer. Whether Hasan is a direct right wing agent or not, he has deemed it acceptable to align with the establishment against the left wing movement for his own gain and that itself marks him as a collaborator, basically he was bought up if not already from the start.",

He trashed RBN‘s Medicare for all rally he trashed RBNs general strike summit, he trashed the rage against the war rally, and he even trashed the very milquetoast force the vote push.

You guys totally makes sense. \n\nIt’s OK to pal around with Congress people who steal our tax money to fund actual Nazis and white and blue country fascists, and gush about how excited they are to be around these same criminals at their convention according to you so-called leftists. We should definitely listen to you about moral  superiority when you condone this behavior and these associations. Pathetic.",

Also, it’s pretty funny—you’ve clearly never actually played fantasy football because that analogy makes zero sense (lol what is a “round” of fantasy football).\n\nIt’s so funny to me that you people complain about ACP affiliations but not Hasan’s affiliation with actual Nazi funding Congress people.

I have heard Haz say probably a dozen times that although he has no animosity towards the Laroche people, he doesn’t agree with really anything they believe in with the exception of a Landbridge. So if he was such a big supporter of this movement I don’t know why he would constantly clarify that he doesn’t agree with their worldview. And if he was a fed, why is he getting banned from like every platform and Jackson too? Why are they getting hassled at the airport? Do you think Carlos was lying when he said that sketchy Colombia cartel guys tried to kill Jackson in Venezuela when that was his first hand account? I just feel like this conspiracy of yours is all over the place.\n\nAlso, I’m curious, what do you think is worse, being vaguely associated with Laroche years ago or being a Democratic Party operative attacking any group that tries to organize outside of the Democratic Party, and funneling young people into the Democratic Party? Which do you think is more damaging and destructive?",

Either now or when things get really serious, they are a liability for anyone who wants to build something good politically. Since when did we accept the 'lesser evil ' nonsense? With all I've said about Hinkle, I'd still wish him no hrm. In fact, I do seriously worry for his safety. That's what happens when you make a career out of gratuitous offence mongering. Haz, I don't have much either way to say about him. But this is all pretty basic prudence about being wise about association. Then again, it's not my project, so do what you like.
