My whole extended family had to raise money for me to go. It was a great trip and I learned a lot from it. But 2 things stuck out to me when comparing it to the US: \n1. There was no litter. Most notably, no dried gum on the sidewalks. \n2. Prices were as listed, no additional tax, and flat numbers like $0.25, $0.50, $0.75, $1.00. \n\nThis made me lose my mind. And it really opened my eyes to things and the \"greatness\" of America. If something as small as gum on the sidewalks could NOT be a problem...\n\nI agree that if more people saw outside the US, they would realize how fucked we've allowed ourselves to be. And maybe that's the point. You can only think of yourself as great if barely see the rest of the world.",

There so many layers to WHY students/people are uneducated here in America but I mean that what the government wants because smart people do not cross reference or do analysis on the big picture.",

All of the checks and balances currently exist at the whim of people who are wholly beholden to essential one man and his moods. What goes along with that, though, is that this whole little d democracy thing only works if we all agree to play by the same rules, and we've seen an increasing \"muscularity\" from conservatives that says hey, if we don't get our birthright dominance soon, we're willing to burn this thing down rather than relinquish our grip on power.\n\nI think back in my lifetime to events like the Ammon Bundy milita standoff. You can make all the laws you want, but at the end of the day unless you have someone to enforce those laws, they're worth as much as the paper they're written on. In FL where I live, a troubling trend I'm seeing is that the state is threatening criminal charges for non-cooperation with enforcing these new immigration laws. So political violence and loss of freedom if you don't agree with policy decisions. They can get away with that because they know that the right generally has a monopoly and comfort level with the threat of violence because their opposition largely is not armed and \"Not About That Life\".",

Beef is an expensive commodity, a bag of coffee beans will run you at least USD10, and eggs can be as high as USD6-8 for a carton depending on where you shop and the origin. China is not a hellscape but its also not a utopia- its a real place with many of its beauty and issues",

Style is important. Representing the possibilities is important, as much as we want rationality to be \"the thing\" that moves people.",

Not that the systems and establishments haven't been failing, but ultimately, democracy is always highly dependent on the people. The establishments failed the people because the people failed them first. That's the cause and effect. And that's the brick wall in figuring out how to move on from here. Going off Olay's point, what we have now is people being very fickle feelings, and easily influenced into making stupid, irresponsible major decisions. Being passive, to general detriment. We have people rejecting competency, decency, intellect, function, compassion, responsibility etc. Not everyone, but the majority, which is what rules democracy. All of those establishments and systems have to be by the people, for the people. That needs people to be active, not passive, that's how good systems, good establishment, come about. They're made, not naturally occurring. So what to do with a majority of passive people who don't value integrity? Well, like Colormind said, what we need now is imagination.",

A show where we divide the map up into four quarters. And in each quarter of the map we have two main but also more others that will inform people in these sectors of everything going on politically, from local races as far as politics in other words your local mayor Governor superintendent head of transportation etc.  The same way they break up the basketball game / Leagues.\n\nAnd then these Main anchors will come together and do a huge platform show talking about all the government politics who is running,  what whey were for previously and what they're running for and standing for currently. \n\nSo that we all get more knowledgeable/better understand what's going on at our local levels as well as our main top levels.   Also the anchors could still do their normal YouTube platform stuff because think about how many people would follow them over into the political show.",

Republicans have continuously optimized their messaging and means of transmission, as this was always where 'optimized' conservatism was headed. I'm left wondering if Democrat establishment is even trying to win elections at this point. \nThis is to say, if the Left, and Democrats by necessity, want to build their coalition then we'll need to identify who our intended audience is, what they want to hear, how they need to hear it, and how to communicate to them at scale for that message to resonate.",

I've lived in cities, but have mostly lived in several rural areas in korea and currently live in an area that most Koreans havent even heard off since its so rural. I say all of that to say where on earth, even ten years ago can you buy three weeks worth of food for 50 bucks in Korea? Yes, Americans could benefit for traveling and living outside of the States; I agree with many of the things that were said. However, that girl lost credibility when she said that because that's really  not possible unless she barely ate and she got a free meal like lunch every day. Maybe she ate at a dorm? But groceries for that price, nah. Korea is often not cheaper or not much cheaper than the states.  South east Asian countries, yes. But Korea and Japan aint that cheap. China can be cheap too though.",

The other thing that I dont see brought up too often regarding the redbook app is, if the users are primarily wealthy or upper class folks like it seems, maybe we aren't getting as full of a picture of life in China as we think we are. If that is the case, then maybe the solution isn't \"we should be more like China.\" Additionally, why are we trying to jump from one authoritarian/imperialist system to another? Why are we not comparing ourselves to and seeking to be more like other democracies? Again, it points to that lack of imagination and wanting to be told what to do thing that you all mentioned towards the end. \nI also think it's weird that rather than using any of the 1 milliom and 1 other apps (or just divesting entirely) so many folks jumped ship to anothet Chinese app that isnt even the same in function as TikTok. Lastly, this may be a little conspiratorial, but how did folks decide on redbook??",
