        "text": "@ZaavanMusic There is also a difference between teaching your child and controlling them. If your kid asks for something, do you snap at them or do you explain why they can't have it? When they don't want to eat, do you ask why and show concern, or do you raise your voice to them when they don't comply?\n\nI've had a mix of both in my family, albeit never extreme in either direction, but I've always leaned towards the explanation instead of the punishment. I found out I was neurodivergent only a year ago, as an adult, and looking back I can see that many of my behaviours like being picky, having emotional outbursts and having social problems were a result of that. I am really grateful to my parents that they weren't more forceful, but when I had meltdowns and were slamming doors e.g. they did react forcefully; not with straight up violence, but I was dragged to my room and told to stay there. And that wasn't my fault. I was a kid with a neurological condition neither me nor my parents knew about and it sucks that for a part of my childhood, I was a bit weary of my dad because of it. Whereas, whenever I've gotten things explained to me clearly (the whys and why-nots), then I've been able to adapt much easier.\n\nI don't have children myself, but I have plenty of nieces and nephews and I get glimpses of how much of a challenge it can be to raise children. I also understand that they're your responsibility, you can't just let them starve themselves or accept them skipping school or whatever. But I think control should be the last line of problem solving. I have a niece that has some food problems, and the way her parents solve it is by compromising (one potato and one sausage, then you can go from the table) and keeping an eye out for malnourishment. Turns out, she has eating days and fasting days, basically, and they've been able to work around that. I've always felt that was a very ideal way to deal with the problem. Communication, compromise and comfort. No parents are going to be perfect, obviously, but I think that's something I would aim for if I ever have children.",

Perhaps along with his sense of entitlement, his abuse also played a role in his behavior. And even if he is a manipulator, that doesn’t mean his claims of abuse are wrong or they had no impact on his behavior. \n\nI think the point I really want to drive home is that we need to stop seeing evil people as one dimensional, storybook villains who simply wake up one day and choose violence. They are, at least partially, the products of their environments — their societies, families, etc,. — as well as their mental health. That’s not to say they have no control over their behavior, or that it doesn’t deserve condemnation, but that control is hindered by their environment and mental health. Such environments promote toxic masculinity — eg., senses of entitlement and unhealthy ways of expressing anger — that facilite abuse against women, trans people, and men themselves. We need to focus more on taking proactive steps towards combatting the environmental/mental health factors that help cause this violence as well as working to rehabilitate these individuals, even if they are serving life sentences.",

I was talking more about our society and justice system at large. \n\nRadical honestly is ABSOLUTELY necessary, but in a purely punitive justice system like ours, where an admission of a crime can land a person for life in a dungeon like prison, or for years followed by a life of collateral consequences, that’s not going to happen. When you back someone into a corner, their only choices are fight or flight. Now, does that mean I think we should give every abuser a pat on the back and high five? Absolutely not. But a more rehabilitative and less punitive (though not entirely non-punitive) system similar to the German or Nordic prisons could increase the likelihood of people coming forward with their abusive behavior. \n\nWith that said, I think we are generally on the same page, and as long as you believe in an abolitionist (or, at least, a carceral system that emphasizes rehabilitation over pure punishment), then I think we don’t have much to argue about.",

Now let's mitigate that chance by giving restorative help to people that have caused harm so they don't cause more harm to the people around them. \n\nAnd this wouldn't be about forgiveness either.

The details, that I won't go into because I'm not here to trauma dump, are deeply misogynist and dis/ableist in nature, which to me reaffirms that to prevent violence we need to build communities that are resistant to bigotry and structural inequity. Thank you for putting it into plain words, I'm not always the best communicator and this video has been really helpful in explaining to others why yes, even after that, I'm still an abolitionist, and no, that does not mean I think this individual should be let wander around and hurt people, and no that's not a contradiction.",

That's why we're so fetishized and there are so many passport bros. He felt he was entitled to her because she was a woman and on top of that, one he \"imported\" from the third world.

Leave after the first time she hits you. \n\nThis is the type of advice that type of dude gives to women in Ana's position, so I honestly don't understand why they can't follow the same advice themselves.\nAnd if a woman treated a man like Ali treated Ana, I would advise the woman to stop that behavior or leave the relationship and the man to run as soon as possible, too.

    "text": "I really appreciate this discussion. I always felt that the thing stopping me from being fully on board with abolition were the mechanisms and systems that lead to violence OUTSIDE of poverty and marginalization (\"affluenza\", misogyny, racism and xenophobia, homophobia and transphobia etc.). Like, I get that investing into social programs that actually address material concerns and address the root causes of crime is the more effective and compassionate option, but that doesn't really address the crimes of people who don't fall into those categories, but who's fundamental beliefs justify their violence towards others. To be clear, I was already like 95% of the way there, this just helps with that last 5% lol",

    "text": "cases like this make me so angry, even if she did cheat how the fuck would that justify taking her life and the life of who you suspected she cheated with? \n\nrecently i was at an event and i was sitting chatting with some dudes my age and one asked what they would do if theoretically they found their girl cheating on them. most of them said they would catch a case, and although they said it somewhat jokingly i still fear that type of mentality that a lot of dudes and more rarely women have that they would feel justified in taking someones life if that happened.\n\nik this is not 100% pertinent to the video as this was specifically this man believing his ex cheated on him and killing her over the shit he internalized, but the normalization of escalating romantic betrayal, or percieved romantic betrayal to murder is so insane to me. its sickening how many people would defend it saying oh they did all this for their partner, they were together for X years. people who think like that are not very adjusted at all.\n\nagain this is not counting rejection, honor killing, breaking up, etc. which is its own fucked up thing. im specifically talking about cheating. like your life is not some fucking shakespearean drama, go get therapy.\n\nedit: sry for the rant, i had to get this out 😓",

They speak up because they don't want someone else to be harmed the way they were but that voice is not always listened to. I feel like I'm talking to a brick wall when I want to do more work with our incoming students (I'm campus based) on consent and healthy relationships. Or to get more men involved in doing that work so it's not just me talking at them. \n\nIt's a weird place to be in because I know I work within a system that continues to do harm even if I try to mitigate it. I want to do away with punitive responses, but I feel a sense of relief and accomplishment when someone who hurt my clients finally faces consequences.",

I don't think a militaristic society that glorifies violence can ever be abolitionist. It will always glorify violence as the ultimate solution so it dehumanizes the victim and perpetrator. I see women who adore the military mindset, the thug mindset, the brutal mom/sis/daughter/auntie/grandma/niece/whatever mindset, and it is all taught. It's hard to teach peace. That turn the other cheek thing is seen as so holy because it doesn't feel human, humanly possible. But of course it is. Resorting to violence never really makes the winner feel good, never mind the recipient. I mean it does for a second, then the consequences come. What we should be taught is how to disable anyone assaulting us, with whatever is available, and leave it at that. But anyone beaten hand-to-hand can now just be shot. We're kinda screwed. We're too irresponsible and immature for the weapons we invented.",

I spoke with them and the general thought was prison makes a criminal out of people who would’ve otherwise never been criminals because they hook up with other big time criminals and instead of rehabilitation they get indoctrinated.",
