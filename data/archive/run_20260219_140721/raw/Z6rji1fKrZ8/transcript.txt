hi YouTube it's akela obviously and I'm suing a grown man who goes by the name Sargon what's up guys the actor justice warrior here and today we're going to talk about Aquila obviously having a failing YouTube channel and being desperate for money okay but before we get into this topic I don't know if you guys know this but you could actually give me money through PayPal or patreon and if that is not sufficient enough you can actually take cash come up to me and stuff that money down my pants so that way you can feel like you're supporting me and I don't have to file a desperation [ __ ] lawsuit we're just gonna pretend like that never happens okay so a Roven youtuber Akilah obviously made headlines recently when she filed a lawsuit against Carl Benjamin aka Sargon of Akkad now the reason that she filed suit against him is because she alleges that he re uploaded an edited down version of her election night video and that Sargon's video represented a market substitute and therefore could not fall under fair use you can't just change the name of something and then re-upload the content and that's basically what the Sargon guy did now last week a lot of youtubers went over this lawsuit and they all seem to preface their commentary by saying I'm not a legal expert but Sargon should do this Sargon should do that well I am a legal expert I mean I have no formal legal training and I don't know too much about the law but goddamn it I have a video camera I know how to edit therefore I'm a legal expert and I think that the people who are telling Sargon that he should settle have not delved deep into their phony legal expertise as much as I have you see what Sargon actually did was edit down a video that was over 10 minutes to about a minute a minute 40 seconds he uploaded this video with a new title a couple of days after the election and it was a joke on the reaction that people had during the presidential election and essentially what the joke was is how this person reacted throughout election night in the beginning when she thought Hillary Clinton was going to win she was jovial and excited when it started to turn you saw the nervousness in faison her words and then total regressive screeching meltdown now a lot of people seem to be under the impression that since Sargon didn't add any commentary to this video that it does not qualify as fair use which in my opinion is [ __ ] ridiculous yes using clips of a copyrighted work for commentary purposes is one of the facets of fair use but it's not the only facet use of somebody else's copyrighted work needs to be transformative in nature and it can't be a market substitute for the original work so Argon's version of the video was in no way meant to be a market substitute for the much smaller channel Akilah obviously that's complete and total [ __ ] Akeelah was obviously trying to appeal to the crybaby sjw's who are upset about Donald Trump winning and Sargon was obviously trying to celebrate the fact that Hillary Clinton lost now I don't really care Sargon settles or not that's really on him but the idea that this case is unwinnable is absolutely ridiculous John Oliver does a segment every single week that's called and no and in that segment all he does is change the title and play clips of other people's work to prove a point that was stated in the title this is clearly what Sargon of Akkad did and for those who are saying well John Oliver segment is a part of his overall show and it's never really uploaded in an isolated way on a platform like YouTube you've obviously never been on HBO's channel or the John Oliver channel on YouTube because that's clearly not the case these segments are uploaded as standalone clips and it's totally fine so if I was Sargon or Sargon's lawyer the first place I would go to is HBO's John Oliver and this particular segment and I would point out that although I don't have the narrator that John Oliver has my video is basically the same exact thing as these John Oliver weekly segments a change in the title and then a series of edited together clips to prove the point of the title for satire purposes now Sargon might decide that he doesn't want to go through the trouble of fighting this through the courts one of the problems with court battles like this especially in the United States is that even if you win you're probably gonna lose because you'll spend so much money defending yourself that it's not really worth it but honestly giving this obnoxious regressive with the dying Channel any amount of money it's something that just turns my stomach she's clearly bitter that her channel is failing that's why ten months after Sargon uploaded this video she slapped him with a lawsuit because she's tired of being made fun of by people who don't have the backing that she does but have much larger audiences so when it became perfectly clear that her channel was dying she decided it would be a good idea to cash out while she can and destroy a key part of the platform for the rest of us trying to make it here on YouTube so if I'm being perfectly honest I can't stand this person what they do and what they believe in so I don't want to see them get anything she actually recently uploaded an obnoxious damage control video which featured amazing gems like this lots of critiques about my appearance lately which I just want to put that to rest I'm a beautiful woman you're not gonna hurt my feelings by saying that I'm ugly or fat or whatever else okay I'm getting laid and living my dreams so I think you might want to go for a different angle um news flash when you tell the trolls that this particular criticism that really stuck out to you doesn't actually bother you they're gonna double down on it that's why I have a beautiful woman feel we're not gonna hurt my feelings by saying that I'm not my girls okay and I'm living low and living my dreams and for the record none of you should go out of your way to harass this person she's irrelevant let her channel die just like Matt Foss and hopefully this will set a trend for any other youtuber who wants to destroy the platform in order to make a quick buck not only will you lose but you will slide further into irrelevance than you already are anyway that's all I really have for you guys today thank you so much for watching if you like this
