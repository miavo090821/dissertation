Akihla tanked her case after she admitted to the courts that Carl's  use of her footage was a critique (read: Fair Use) however Carl ruined a clean cut case by failing to appear in court. Both have spent 10s of thousands of dollars on legal defense, and it seems Carls defense sent in a letter to Dismiss the case. But as of November 2018 it's still technically an open case with no formal judgement.",
