    "text": "Marxism doesn’t “need” any of those people. This video crosses a line that matters for anyone serious about Marxism-Leninism and materialism and the historical and dialectical materialist analysis. Presenting Heidegger, Dugin, Žižek, Lacan, or figures like Haz al-Din as “needed” by Marxism isn’t an update or enrichment—it’s a substitution. Marxism doesn’t lack ontology, psychoanalysis, civilizational theory, or metaphysical depth; it is a materialist analysis of labor, production, class, and imperialism oriented toward disciplined materialist economic class organization and power. When these other frameworks are introduced as “necessary” supplements, what disappears is political economy, discipline, and the primacy of class relations. Haz al-Din’s contribution here is affect and posture, not material analysis, and Midwestern Marx’s endorsement of this stuff confirms a broader pattern on the channel: Marxism is being reshaped into a loose anti-liberal synthesis that abandons Marxism-Leninism’s core commitments. This isn’t development—it’s revisionist drift, and viewers should understand that none of this is required to follow the real Marxist path.  This is social media hype substituting for organization, political economy, and disciplined revolutionary Marxist-Leninism—by turning Marxism into personality, posture, and algorithm-friendly idealist and philosophy theory mashups.",

Namely, this is where it is determined who is \"daddy\" among them.\r\nThe dimension of the real in psychoanalysis is the dimension of the torsion of the symbolic. The dimension of something that constantly returns (the repressed).\r\nWhen we talk about the NATO alliance, it is convenient to note that the member countries of that alliance are simultaneously nation states with unconquered mutual animosities. Greece / Turkey; Germany / France; England / France; \"old Europe\" / \"new Europe\" .....\r\nIn other words, the NATO alliance is a bag full of horns in the dimension of the real.\r\n\r\nWe we are trying to be Marxists here, so I add a \"fourth dimension\", and say that when it comes to NATO, the bag is actually made of paper.

Comrades Raphael, Donatello, Leonardo and Michelangelo plan and execute guerilla raids to liberate proletarians from enslavement and brutality, and to seize pizza to fuel the ongoing people's struggle, although Comrade Michelangelo displays anarchist and adventurist tendencies and needs to be corrected by Commissar Splinter with self-criticism sessions from time to time to teach him proper proletarian and revolutionary discipline.  You need to read and understand the collected editions of their pamphlets and communiques from the beginning to the end, all 40 years of them, to be properly acculturated in the revolutionary imaginary and ideography of the American working class.",

So while I'm sure a lot of people in the Right are banned off social media and have their perspectives actively stifled and kept away from the public conversation, I don't agree that that was the case for Marxism-Leninism",

Heidegger mistook a political movement for something deeper than it was, confusing a historical socialist organization with a supposed answer to the crisis of modernity, and only later came to see that this confusion followed from the same flawed metaphysics he was trying to escape.",

Marx also proposed that only certain things are possible in certain historical conditions.\n\nHeidegger‘s flaw is understanding ontology only within a structural frame. This lead him into the belief that Nazism could lead to ontological fulfillment.\n\nOntology is the study of being. IMO ancient religious ideas actually deal with ontology in a far more sophisticated way than modernists do. The problem with religion is it becomes dogmatic and the meaning needs to be re-evaluated perennially.\n\nDoes anyone know the totality of their own being. No. Of being itself? No. The ground of being. No Religion assigns this to „God“ or „Atman“ etc. the ultimate.\n\nOur full ontology is ineffable. It can exist under any circumstances. Adverse circumstances is only an excuse, we can access it regardless of historical circumstances and strive towards it.\n\nWishing for a totalitarian society in the hopes of fullness of being is delusional.\n\nI can agree with the pragmatism of Marx but not the delusions of Heidegger.",

I think Haz has contributed much to Marxism-Leninism in the U.S. and the West in general, and a lot of this exactly because of his willingness to practical and theoretical exploration and experimentation.\nThat said, I chose the word idiosyncratic because wanted to keep it neutral (I could say original/innovative for positive connotations and deviant/heretic for more negative ones). I do think it is idiosyncratic, for better or for worse. I don’t think anyone before him incorporates Heidegger, Dugin and Plato into his Marxist understanding of the world. Žižek is an easy target for Marxist-Leninists, but Haz still finds value in some of his thoughts even though he’s aware of his weaknesses.\n\nI haven’t explored sufficiently what actual value Haz finds in these thinkers, and I haven’t actually studied any of these thinkers myself almost at all. I remain open, absolutely, and willing to explore more! But I have to admit that I’m also a bit skeptical.\nI have read enough of Marx, Engels and Lenin and certain Chinese Communists [including the CPC which doesn’t allow religious affiliation if you are to become a member of the CPC] to know that religion, though fully tolerated and respected outside party organization, has been seen as incompatible with dialectical materialism. And I have seen nothing in the works of the greatest Marxists any big focus on Plato (and Heidegger when it comes to Stalin and Mao among others).\nBut again, maybe Haz is adapting it to “Marxism with Western characteristics” / “westernized Marxism”.\nEven though I may end up supporting and defending Haz’s understanding, now I’m quite skeptical of his attachment to religion, and thereby probably also his interpretation of what materialism is. But I know that I don’t know enough about it.\n\nWhat do you think?",

But interesting what you said about it. For me though, it’s a great difference between tolerating and respecting religion and seeing it as compatible with dialectical materialism and a scientific world outlook. I may have a too narrow or strict (or wrong) understanding of dialectical materialism, but as far as I understand it now, I don’t see how religion (at least as a belief in God/gods, soul not as a product of the brain, or the afterlife/reincarnation) can be compatible with materialism.",

    "text": "Haz got a (disparaging but regardless) shout out in a footnote for zizeks new book (Quantum History). On that topic, I dispute zizek privileging philosophy as closer to reality or more authentic. Especially in Sex and The Failed Absolute, the chapter on the four ethical gestures is about moving beyond the immediate authentic reaction of alienation(which is what is really privileged by most lacanians) to something potentially intersubjective or political. What is important is that this myth making remains in contact with its alienated (non)grounding. So a more practical example from the new book(chapter title \"holograms of conflicting universalities\"): Zizek goes into russias past in order to reread the Old Believers(purged by the bolsheviks as an obsolete form of social resistance to the tsars) as pointing towards a new \"conservative communist\" future that is both against putin without backsliding into pre-putin liberal russia. But our ability to make these interpretive maneuvers mean that we are never free from history as a struggle, matters(beings) are never settled, we are always circulating around our(and the universal's) alienation from itself.",

        "text": "​​​​@mat_jthe amount of confidence with which you say all this proves you have not investigated any of the claims you just mentioned. \n\nThe ACP has reiterated multiple times that these would be CHAPTER ENTERPRISES with a preferred cooperative structure. You can take a look at ACP Michigan to see what this type of thing entails, where they bought some land to use for agricultural experimentation as A CHAPTER ENTERPRISE.  \n  \nYou have iterated multiple times that Haz and Jackson are using this entire thing a grift to find themselves. But there is never any mention of the other chapter executives like Chris Hellali or Kyle Pettis. One of whom is living in Russia due to his work meeting with Chinese, DPRK, etc. diplomats getting him harassed at airports and another who is a blue collar worker working with teamsters and unions to organize truck drivers. The ACP leadership is far more than just Haz and Jackson, there is a whole organization alongside these people.  \n\nStrange that two men all for a grift would travel to fucking Nasrullah funeral (let alone be allowed to attend by Lebanese leadership), BE INVITED TO CHINESE UNIVERSITIES (like Haz was recently) or travel to Caracas to PERSONALLY SPEAK with Maduro like Jackson has. None of which the pathetic \"PSL left\" has done. \n\n \nI used to be like you I watched all that slop from chemicalmind and Socialism4All and Fellow Traveler about the ACP. I actually believed all of it, but luckily I took one of Carlos Garridos classes, where in the zoom meeting you could visibly see blue collar workers and ordinary people taking the classes (not just blue haired liberal leftist stereotypes->preaching to the choir) being taught ACTUAL basic Marxist concepts. In fact they had a while lesson plan starting with William Z Foster then Lenin and more basic Marx Engels and then more advanced classes teaching Mao, Gramsci, Stalin, etc. This grifting junk makes no sense considering how MWM, ACP etc. is putting their actions in practice volunteering for communities and teaching theory to membership. A quick glance at chapter instagrams shows this foundational community building of dual power.\n\nBut once I actually INVESTIGATED what the ACP were doing it became a lot more clear what idiotic lies were being spouted about them.\n\nThe ACP doesn't even collect dues because they said it would make leadership lazy and membership less innovative to find funding sources. If you listen to their ACP podcast you would know this. If you read their documents on their website you would know this.",

    "text": "Somehow, Lenin and Mao, Stalin and Fidel all managed without studying Lacan and French theory.  They aren't for everyone: there's a reason why graduates in philosophy have the highest average IQ of all higher education graduates. As for Zizek, he's too disgusting to even think about. Dugin abuses his stature as a philosopher to promulgate counter-productive calls - like calling for a war to wipe off Israel.  Though Israel is a 100% genocidal state, such calls just generates mindlesness, fear, negativity. Dugin thus misrepresents Russia where he's denied even an academic position much less an association with Kremlin.    TO DO:  Exercise, develop skills, interact with people irl, guiding yourself with the prioducts of civilisation that have withstood the test of time.  Ask yourself what are the things scumbags do, and then avoid them consistently. That's pretty much enough to make you a man. Trust that you have all the access to truth even if you live off-grid and without a cellphone.  Reject the sentiment that just because you haven't studied Hegel, Lacan or Heidegerr, you're inadequate for the Communist movement or incomplete as a human being.  A Commmunist movement isn't for people who would have such a lack of confidence, nor get into the habit to find every solution in studying scholars.  Study rather your own life: an unexamined life isn't worth living. Be a simplehearted man of action.  That's what will make you a real Communist.",

Same as their dismissal of GR for criticizing zizek, it’s kinda sad they’re so hung up on this nostalgia for him. Seems all too common our formative heroes turn out to be opportunists, doesn’t mean on either hand that we have to cancel, or glaze them to recognize contributions of value they made in other circumstances. Any time I’ve ventured in the last couple years to lend an ear to MWM, I can’t help but tune out halfway through because I get distracted wondering how Carlos might title what I’d consider a theoretical venture more relevant to his trajectory; maybe “insecurity fetish: midwestern chauvinists’ weird vendetta against occasional soyboys”? I know I do admit it’s low hanging fruit. It’s just disappointing his whole “crisis of western leftism” turned out to be so hypocritical. Not that rainbow washing isn’t a problem, or even that liberal and ultra lefts aren’t annoying af, just that all he’s done is take an antagonistic stance along that same shallow line, replaying the same note endlessly in pursuit of farming that niche, or something? idk that is my best guess after failing charitably to consider ACP positions in good faith. It’s like they don’t even realize they’re doing the same thing a woke-scold does, only their version is good cause they’re… tuff and… edgy?

Very pathetic.\n\nWithout aesthetics it's literally impossible to say how Stalin, and Lenin the actual inventor of socialism in one country, wasn't just sending the revolution into retreat. You simply can't, you will try and fail.\n\nAnd why do you create imaginary rifts about the word woke, which today is politically insignificant and which the ACP never concerned itself with because everyone with half a brain could understand the woke thing was a bourgeois perversion for half a century during the time the post war monopoly capitalism searched for ideology to justify itself. And the ACP doesn't even say that, only I who am not American did, the ACP remains completely uninterested in the woke that you care enough about to draw lines. Well nobody cares about your lines. You don't even want to be taught, you aren't a student you aren't a communist. Why should we care? An escaped mental asylum patient is running around the streets screaming the word woke like a ritual mantra to himself and attempts to force himself into peoples face to recognize his efforts. Sorry I don't understand your word. Its meaning was forgotten in the last decade. What's the use of the psychosis you're attempting to force me to engage in if your psychosis is part of bygone history that left no mark nor impact? We are back to bourgeois dictatorial barbarism now anyway. \n\nI am concerned about people like you, not because it's sad that people can delude themselves with being masters resulting in them becoming much less than just students, but because you muddy the word communism by lacking every principle it stands on. You and the other million weird language model leftists from twitter mental gymnastics highschool. You feel no duty to heed the command of Lenin and educate yourselves.
