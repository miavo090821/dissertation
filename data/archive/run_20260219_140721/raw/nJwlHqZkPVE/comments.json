This is something that needs to be explicitly addressed because it is a real concerted effort to take away not only the rights of workers and roll back the last century of child labour laws, but it's also an attempt to bring in workers who do not even have political freedoms who can vote against the repeal of such labour laws. It's a calculated move to create a legally unprotected sub-class of labour.",

Private works are the most common types on employment in VN. \n\nIdk what you was expecting, but this is not Iraq where 70% of jobs are public sectors, or Libya for 90% of jobs are public sectors, with a strong Socialist government. In Vietnam, the \"Marxist\" but pro-GDP-increase government allows Private corporation, include domestically own Vietnamese private corps, and big companies, Foreign private corps from specific country and multiple-national corps to do wherever they like too, as long as it is in legal boundary, like classifying full time and half time worker as \"privateer\" to not pay them benefits while working them above 8 hours limit, which if they do works after 8 hours, the company are legally oblige to pay them extra, except they don't do that too, by legally avoiding the laws. \n\nSo call official and political personality from Vietnam don't talks about this, unless press enough, like Mr Pakman, whom will say the economy is doing great, and jobs are high. Yeah the Economy of Vietnam is doing great, for Multinational corporation shares owners from Paris and New York, working people got to works extra jobs because their basic wages, had been cuts.",
