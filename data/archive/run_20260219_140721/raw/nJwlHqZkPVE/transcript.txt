good to see you man and uh you guys have been doing big things at Midwestern marks you guys just got an achievement uh of uh having more subs and you guys are making your mark on the scene and really

Noah and Carlos and forgive me for I forget the names of the other members but you guys are doing the damn thing over there thank you we're trying we're doing what we can just like everyone yeah definitely definitely uh so one of the things that I wanted to touch base with you on was that as somebody that is a Marxist like yourself right there was some there was some um remarks that were comments on commented on by David Pacman now as anybody knows David Pacman is a wellknown uh person part of wants to say Independent Media but I don't know if I can say independent I say independent in ear quotes but he says some things that are regarding the economy to I guess somebody would say a right-winger that really just was was wrong in in many ways and I feel this is more of a teachable moment for somebody like uh David Pacman to will really to use him as an example and so have you ever watched any of his shows or any of his programs before yeah I actually used to watch Pacman quite a bit um when I was like doing the Bernie campaign um in 2020 Pacman had a good video talking about like how socialists could pay for all the stuff that they want and he basically went through the government and showed how much like wasteful spending there is in the government that could be diverted towards social programs and he used to do some pretty decent content like that and then it was like after 20120 at least pretty much he just became a Biden bro and all of his content focuses is on just you know the most vulgar um Trump bism just uh just pandering to liberals you know Trump bad Trump bad Trump bad Biden good Biden good Biden good and um another thing I I've noticed with Pacman and I've said this in in videos on our Channel and we've reacted to him is he has this condescending tone that he takes with people especially when he disagrees with them um where he he just really sounds like smug like he's talking down to them um and I think in the clip uh that we're going to react to today that really comes out yeah so I just as you said um there is a clip that came out uh I want to give a shout out to uh Greg versus uh crapitalism he's awesome yeah and he actually shares this actually let me show you guys what he says first before I share with you guys the video he says uh you don't hate these people enough you think you do but you don't so I'm GNA we'll listen this fully and then we're g to break it down step by step so here's what David says David why are you acting like the economy is soing and good because I look at the data this is not a show about my opinion my opinion is irrelevant I'm looking at the data and that's why I say the economy is good the economy is absolute trash oh there are no jobs oh we actually have record low unemployment everything is so freaking expensive inflation was zero in October 0.1 in November and year-over-year inflation is down to 3.1% interest rates are through the roof interest rates are down two points and coming down further kids can't even buy a house well okay kids can't even buy a house I don't know what age you're thinking of that part may be true what would you be doing if you weren't doing YouTube man I'd probably be working in finance to be honest I was all set to go into finance and then they pulled me into podcasting I did everything right and they indicted me no I would almost certainly be working in finance yeah I mean you have to sit there and talk crap about Trump every single day to put food on your table man I don't have to I choose to sir and that's a big difference if you didn't have that you'd be totally screwed man right but I'm telling you this right here there is no jobs nobody is spending money actually GDP has been up dramatically the economy is in the whole I'm not talking about Trump or Biden I'm not saying right or left red or blue I'm telling you the fact the economy is in the dumps I would love it if he was able to present a single statistic that suggests that we don't have a perfect economy and again you know we started at the top of the show by pointing out just because they're lying about oil production being down when it's actually up doesn't mean we like using oil as a source of energy they are lying about oil production being down and I wish it were and that we were getting off of oil and going over to Green energy in the same way just because the economy is doing really well by all historical metrics doesn't mean that we say heyy I'm satisfied we don't need to do any better there are people without access to healthare 40% of the country can't mean an unexpected thousand expense without putting it on a credit card or borrowing from friends and family or otherwise going into debt wages have not kept up with inflation over the longer period of time there's a whole list of problems but we are doing way better than we were we are not the be allend all of a northern European style democracy and economy but we have made improvements and we have to recognize that if you are measuring how well the economy is doing differently depending on who president then you're being [Music] sorry you're no first of all I would like to get your initial thoughts about just the tone that David Pacman used in this and then we can go down line by line but I would just like to get your initial thoughts of the tone that he used regarding this person because apparently this person is someone that's probably on the right correct but from in my opinion what this guy on the right was saying was correct and so please give me your thoughts yeah I mean we can break down the data points all that we want you know and we can talk about how the Biden economy isn't doing well and how capitalism is failing the majority of the country but like you said there's there's so much to break down just in in the way in the in the tone that David Pacman takes with that viewer I mean you clearly have a workingclass viewer who you know maybe can't explain with data and statistics that the economy isn't doing well but they know the economy is not doing well because they feel it every day they feel they're being exploited they feel that they're being trapped in debt they feel that you know the price of goods is out of control um and that they can't afford their rent that they can't afford their health care and that's the experience that they have and that their whole family has so David Pacman's response to that is to treat this guy like he's an idiot to treat him like his his feelings are are illegitimate um and like they're that he's making them up you know and complaining um and and then Cherry picks a bunch of data points to tell like literally talking about GDP which measures nothing except for corporate profits I mean the the money that we pay in in debt um to the big Banks counts as GDP so you know that's that's not a a a sign of a productive economy that's working for the working class I mean um this is so-called uh leftist like David Pacman calls himself a leftist we've known this for years that GDP isn't a good measure of how the working class is doing um yet here he is citing GDP in a in a super condescending fashion towards a workingclass person to tell them that their gripes about the economy are illegitimate and you know I'm I'm David Pacman's a liberal so I'm okay with liberals showing their asses and showing the American workingclass how condescending they are but if you're a communist if you're a Marxist you cannot act like David pman did in this video right you cannot act condescending towards people you need to be open um to the very real economic struggles that they're facing um if you want to win those people towards a a progressive movement like the struggle for socialism absolutely and this is one of the things that I think uh people like him get wrong is that there's this tone that he continuously has that is talking down to working people people and it is counterproductive to actually get people to your side if you're trying to win them over and the point is is people need to be talked with not at and I feel like people like David Pacman talks at people especially those of us who are working in working class uh those of us who are working poor right and so is as if because he this guy dare complained about the economy if and my question to David Pacman would be if we switched out the administrations and if it were Trump Administration instead of a Biden Administration would he be saying the exact same thing would he be backing it up with the exact same things that he been saying because a trump supporter could turn around will Trump's empow and say those exact same things and then you will be wanting to rebut them so what about the GDP like it doesn't make any sense so God I'm I don't I'll go on a rant and I will make this I will make the stream last three hours so let let's break this down because I don't want you to be here all night so because that's how I am so let's break this down David why are you acting like the economy is so booming and good that's a great question why is he acting like the economy is so booming and good because guess what the people who are rich that's what they act like and the rest of us are like no all right let's go because I look at the data the first he didn't say that it wasn't right oh my God the first thing they'll teach you in any statistics class if you take a statistics class the first thing they will teach you is that people can manipulate statistics for political ends that you can cherry-pick statistics and use them to make pretty much any argument you want right and and statistics and data are important right it's important to have quantifiable hard facts to back up your argument of course but what David Pacman's doing here is pret is something that only liberals do is pretending that he's objective right I'm not pushing my opinion into this at all I am objectively looking at the data in an unbiased way that doesn't exist every human is biased you have to be so incredibly arrogant to believe that you are the one true person who can interpret the data in an unbiased fashion but that's what David Pacman is saying here before he proceeds to interpret the data in an incredibly biased fashion and Incredibly biased fashion towards Biden and then at the end he has the gall to say you know you shouldn't be manipulating data based on what side you're on like that's exactly what you're doing bro yeah exactly and okay gosh this is gonna be difficult to get through I Can Tell Eddie H we're gonna be ranting on this one oh God yes we are okay let's continue this is not a show about my opinion my opinion is yes it is see I told you let JB shut just tell me to shut up Eddie just tell me to shut up I can I agree it's frustrating is irrelevant I'm looking at the data and that's why I say the economy is good the economy is absolute trash oh there are no jobs oh we actually have record low unemployment okay first of all hang on let me make myself Stu bigger first of all just because we have record low on employment doesn't mean that people are actually doing good because here's the thing you can give me a Ritz cracker with a piece of cheese a Ritz cracker with a piece of uh a Ritz cracker with a piece of pepperoni and a Ritz cracker with some cream cheese on it and be like hey you got a variety oh look how plentiful you have you have a variety there and yet you only gave me three wrist crackers with food on it David he like well you got multiple Ritz crackers that is multiple Ritz crackers but is that really GNA fill me up no and here's the crazy part it's like okay just because there is a whole bunch of jobs that are being taken doesn't mean that one person doesn't have more than one I could have two or three jobs guess what if you have 100,000 people with two or three jobs that's 300,000 jobs but only 100,000 people work in those jobs Eddie please it's something the capitalists always do they site it's another capitalistic um metric unemployment which by the way doesn't include people who are underemployed people who have given up searching for work because they don't have it and you know just because unemployment's low okay if the people who are employed still can't afford to get by that doesn't really mean much and under capitalism unemployment will never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever hit zero it'll be impossible because as KL Marx points out in the book Capital capitalism depends on um what's called the what Marx calls the reserve Army of Labor um so when feudalism goes away and when capitalism comes in in Europe there becomes this group of people who want to sell their labor power on the market they want to be wage laborers but they can't find places to sell it they're unemployed and that gives the capitalist a pool of Labor that they can pull from say if their workers go on strike so the capitalist workers go on strike they turn to The the Reserve Army of Labor the army of the unemployed and they say We'll you know um come work for us while our workers are on strike come fill up the workplace for so that is necessary for capitalism's existence that that Reserve Army of Labor so you know they can they can talk about how unemployment is slightly lower under Biden versus Trump but unemployment will never ceased to be a problem under capitalism exactly and so in layman's term for what Eddie just said so eloquently I may add by the way is that they need to have broke unemployed people so that when it comes to actually hiring people then if you don't want to have starvation wages then they're like well if you want don't want this job and if you want something higher we don't have to take you there's a whole bunch of other people that I can hire and take in anyway and on top of that this is why they need homelessness to exist because if homelessness exists that means that you'll be too scared to actually fight for actual workers rights and so then it's like they use homeless people as a means to say look at them at the example if you don't work for starvation wages you're G to end up just like them by the way homelessness is on the rise how do I know let's take a look so let me share this and I'll get back to Mr Pacman I gotta be respectful here because you know H geez I got her but this is from News 13 says homeless population increases in downtown Orlando I live in Orlando right says according to the homeless service network the homeless population increased 5% from Year from last year across central Florida Mar AR CEO of Orlando's homeless service network says unsheltered homeless is up 38% from last year those people did not change the housing market changed now it says for 75% of the people that experience homelessness it was their first time they have never been homeless before four most homeless people are newly homeless so by that metric alone what David Pacman said was bull crap I'm trying not to cuss because YouTube but that's the issue and so saying oh well the employment rate is actually low it doesn't matter for over 40% of people who are homeless have jobs they have jobs David they have jobs and so when people are homeless but still working that means that the system is crap I'm not gonna say the system is broken because it's originally intended to be that way there's not broken system it's intended to be that way so then it's like well maybe you should have two jobs instead of one so you won't be homeless then where's the line maybe you should have three jobs instead maybe you should have four jobs instead or maybe you should be a slave instead so you can actually have a home and food to eat Where's the Line man where are we going before I continue any thoughts on that please no I just I completely agree my friend said once like as a joke he said uh some people don't work hard enough for insulin you know like exactly like you're saying like where is the line you know how hard you have to work before you can get insulin when you're born with diabetes you know and who and who decides where that line is I think everybody who has diabetes should get insulin in our society we can afford to give it to him why wouldn't we Eddie I'm telling you dude I just came back from hanging out with comrades and one of the last things we did was and God God bless uh one of the members of my chapter SAA she had some warm clothes and blankets that she had in the back of her car and she was like can we deliver these to some of the homeless cuz it's going to be extremely cold tonight and I don't want them to be without and so after hanging out and bashing capitalism for you know a nice conversation we went to the area by the way there was a homeless camp on Terry Avenue here in Orlando gone they got rid of it and then there was this line of homeless people that we deliver it to clean us out right in fact one of the members shout out to you Cam if you're watching literally took his jacket off and gave it away too that was a nice jacket and so the thing is is some of those people have never been homeless before ever and it's growing I did a story uh a few weeks ago where boomers are increasing there are more homeless elderly people than they ever been in history so what is David talking about I don't know what he's talking about but I see this all the time and it's growing and it's sad so let's continue keep it together JB everything is so freaking expensive inflation was zero in October 0.1 in November and year-over-year inflation is down to 3.1% interest that's still so high the cost of goods is only going up 3.1% while wages are stagnant quit complaining that's still 3% the cost of goods are being driven up by capitalists so that they can maintain their profits at a certain level while our wages are stagnant so our wages are the staying the same and inflation's going up and Pacman's like that's okay because inflation's going up slower now under Biden than it was under Trump bro it doesn't matter the problem's capitalism the problem's not Biden or Trump they're just symptoms yeah and my thing is I I did a story uh a few weeks ago how on rbn how they were artificially inflating the price of chicken chicken and so guess what we can't afford it look here food prices are rising at the highest rate in decades says even as US inflation moderates for millions of Americans every trip to the grocery store is a pain in a pocketbook Supermarket prices have shot up in the fastest rate in decades putting Staples like eggs and bread Out Of Reach for some over the past two years egg prices have nearly doubled leading leting some customers to extreme workarounds to try to smuggle eggs from Mex smuggling eggs are you kidding me and painting Easter potatoes instead of dying eggs to save on household funds meat fish chicken are all substantially High pricier than they were two years ago as well as cereal and bread which cost nearly 25% more today than they did in 2021 look at this look at this what the cluck look at the eggs man golly it was like David's like oh inflation is only up this much we're looking at the data David we're looking at the data right and and a lot of us don't even have to look at the data because we see this in the grocery store I went to Aldi the other day and it was $7 for a 12 pack of eggs or a carton of eggs it's like what the hell's going on here but David Pacman probably shops at Whole Foods he probably shops at Trader Joe's in these real nice um expensive places because he can afford it and and the the price of of food doesn't really affect him so he's able to condescend um towards workingclass people who don't have a nice little job doing a YouTube show where they just bash Trump every day and make good money to do it um so he he's not feeling the price hike so he's able to act condescending towards those who are it's really sick yeah and the thing is like when it comes to people like us we're dying out here man that's I think that's the point we're dying out here and there's people starving I'm not even going to say kids because for some reason like there's you know over 10,000 kids that died in Gaza because of bombs but people somehow don't care about kids anymore so I'm just gonna say people so people here literally are starving and yet it's like well everything's good it's just like what what what Joe Scarboro was saying in in the top of the show people are happy everything's good the hell all right let's continue because I can go on and on and on and I I try I'm trying not to JB just keep it together bro interest rates are through the roof interest rates are down two points and coming down further it's can't even buy a house well okay kids can't even buy a house I don't know what age you're thinking of that part may be true um I I can't afford to buy a home Eddie the I don't know about you but I I know I can't the vast majority of people our age are renters I mean we have a nation of renters because no one our age can afford to buy a home and you know but we're all paying rent each month to landlords and that contributes to the GDP that David Pacman puts on a puts on a pedestal says oh look the GDP is doing well well that includes the the 25% of our paychecks were paying every month for rent to a landlord who contributes no value toh to society 25% dude I'm over 50 there you go and on top of it I'll be 40 this year David and I can't afford a home 40 yeah I know I look good 40 right so what about me oh I just didn't work hard enough is that what it is is that why I can't afford a home I just didn't work hard enough you could literally work in a diner back then and be able to afford a home and have a family on a salary as a cook in a diner back then now are you kidding me right now and and we're a society drowning in debt all kinds of debt you have student debt you have housing debt you have um um even 60% of the country at this point experiences medical debt at some point in their lives so over half of our country is is being indebted by the Health Care system and again the money we pay towards our debtors um goes towards the GDP that Pacman puts on a pedestal and says the GDP equals a great economy but 60% of the economy is a debt and this goes to the absurdity of his data of his statistics which he says are unbiased right he says interest rates are are lower so the econom is doing well we have 60% of our country is being put in debt by the Health Care System the system that's supposed to make us healthy the system that's supposed to make us well is trapping Us in debt that we have to continue paying back with interest for the rest of our lives um so how can you look at that economy an economy a system a society where the Health Care system is trapping people in debt and say that this is a good economy because interest rates are slightly lower under Biden than they were under Trump I mean it's it's absurd you're you're uh completely missing the root of the issue the root of the problem which is that so many people are in debt in the first place to say oh well it's not so bad because because interest rates are a little bit lower now than they were a month ago or whatever it's it's just total cherry-picking and manipulation of Statistics to try and tell working people that their grievances aren't legitimate yeah like we're literally suffering right now and uh yeah so let me continue on what would you be doing if you weren't doing YouTube man I'd probably be working in finance to be honest oh good for you good for you David not everybody can get into that field not everybody has the brain from Finance not everybody has the bandwidth for finance I could not be able to do Finance so what would I be doing David to be honest I was all set to go into finance and then they pulled me into podcasting I who pulled you the CIA shut up sh up JB shut up everything right and they indicted me I would almost certainly be working in finance yeah I mean you have to sit there and talk crap about Trump every single day to put food on your table man I don't have to I choose to sir and that's I thought they pulled you in by the way just to let everybody know I don't give a crap about Trump by the way Trump is hor just as horrible as Joe Biden so if you guys come here and thinking that I have some love for anybody on the right like Trump you are utterly mistaken because Trump is just as fascistic as Joe Biden the only difference is is that Biden doesn't know where the hell he is at least Trump knows where he is that's all I got to say two old racists geez Louise any who let's continue and that's a big difference if you didn't have that you'd be totally screwed man right but I'm telling you this right here there is no jobs nobody is spending money actually GDP has been up dramatically the economy now that GDP has been up dramatically we do not measure our bank accounts by the success of Corporations because that does not translate to us because we have a economy where all the wealth goes to the top here's one thing I want to give an analogy let's say me and Eddie live in a mansion right you and I we live in a mansion and when we go to the mansion we have to go through the basement every day and we live in the basement of that of that mansion in that mansion in that basement we only have about a you know a foot by foot square that we can operate in in that basement because it's so full of people and they throw crumbs into the basement few sprits of water and say you guys survive here on your own and you guys have to work down here in the basement of the Mansion somebody can come and say but you live in a mansion and hey look the household just got a $100,000 increase in their household and their household take home pay but how is that translating to us who's living in the basement and squalor how is that translate to us the United States is a mansion where the majority of the people that are living here are stuck in the basement and we not allowed to sprawl and go throughout the rest of the house that's how it is and yet you're telling me because the people who are on the top floor in the suit made more that somehow we should be happy no David we should we need to take over the Mansion bust down the door and live live it up and give everybody the rest of the house but you don't feel that's good right that analogy explains it better than I could with any kind of theory talk I mean that's perfect it's exactly what it is it's a mansion where the vast majority of people are living in the basement and David Pacman's telling them Shut up and quit complaining you live in a mansion that's exactly what it is so why why is it bad for me to complain about living in squalor in a basement when that's our reality see please stop doing the liberal thing where if I'm on fire and then you go well the Republicans will just say sucks to be you and keep on walking but because I'm on fire you take a spray bottle and Spritz me with alcohol thinking it's water and thinking hey see I helped you a little bit that's not helping [Applause] bro that's what you're doing and now and now don't piss on my head and tell me it's raining David because my wallet actually tells me more truth than you could ever do my wallet tells me my bank account tells me that no matter who's in office my life is still [ __ ] and that's that's what me and millions of others it is not just black people it's poor white people it's even undocumented immigrants that are coming into this country because of the foreign policy of our country that are dragging him here not dragging him but pushing them to come here so that they can be the new cheap labor and they pit them against us right this is what they're doing I hope yet we gotta stop complaining I'm sorry go ahead no I I agree with everything you're saying I I hope people understand to that's what you're saying is exactly what his interest rate argument is right he's looking at the vast majority of Americans who are drowning in debt and he's saying well your interest rates are slightly lower under Biden than they are under Trump so stop stop complaining I mean it's it is absurdity and and missing the core of what's wrong with our system the fact that the people at the top of our system benefit from trapping the people at the bottom of our system in debt and then the money that the people at the bottom of our system are constantly paying towards the big Banks and debt goes towards the GDP and people like Pacman then point at the GDP and say oh look the economy's doing great I mean it's it's such a disgusting um cherry-picking of data and Distortion of the the facts in order to to push an argument and then he has the gall to say you know people shouldn't be unbiased and cherry-pick facts like bro what do you think you're doing you're you have to be so arrogant to not realize that you're the one distorting facts here but dude it it's inhumane bro like it's inhumane to me like and the thing is is like e even though this guy is a trump supporter why is a trump supporter bro exactly exactly they never asked that question why do people fall for the populist right exactly never asked that it's like yeah because he's he's searching for something to overthrow the system and yes was he duped by by a a con man that can't even keep his hair halfway on his head yeah he was duped a lot of people were duped just like liberals were duped into voting for Joe Biden and staying within the Democratic party the Democratic party duped a lot of us just like the Republicans duped a lot of other people yeah but this is why we have to tell them the truth and go no they're both bad we gotta go completely the opposite direction because they're telling us to go into the furnace and say well it's really warm in there you're can really keep warm when really we're gonna fry the bits and we're like no going to the opposite direction man is in the hole I'm not talking about Trump or Biden I'm not saying right or left red or blue I'm telling you the facts the economy is in the dumps yes I would love it if he was able to present a single statistic that suggests that JB just presented about a thousand Mr Pacman we don't have a again you know we started at huh sorry no you're good I was just saying we've given him you know a million statistics and even that Joe Scarboro uh segment at the beginning about how Americans aren't that worried you can find um studies done by Gallup that say 77% of Americans are anxious about their financial um situation or one that says the majority of Americans are discouraged about their personal finances so yeah um it's just the cherry-picking of data and then they pretend like it's objective yeah that's the sad part and the single statistic that suggests that we don't have a perfect economy and again you know we started at the top of the show by pointing out just because they're lying about oil production being down when it's actually up doesn't mean we like using oil as a source of energy they are lying about oil production being down and I wish were and that we were getting off of oil and going over to Green energy in the same way just because the economy is doing really well by all historical metrics doesn't mean that we say hey I'm satisfied we don't need to do any better there are people without access to healthare 40% of the country can't mean an unexpected thousand expense without putting it out a credit card or borrowing from friends and family or otherwise going into debt wages have not kept up with inflation over the longer period of time there's a whole list of problems but we are doing way better than we were no we're not no no we are not David if we were then Trump wouldn't be polling so well but of course these guys don't understand that the appeal of trump is that he lies and says that he's GNA end the wars and bring the jobs back whereas the Democrats are being condescending and saying no shut up the economy's fine which you know that's exactly why Trump is probably going to win again and then these people like Pacman will act like they're shocked oh America's so stupid they voted for Trump no you were just super condescending towards workingclass Americans for the past four years whereas Trump um at least said he was going to do something for him I don't believe him I think he's a liar but at least he offered them something other than condescension and arrogance yeah I mean it's like having a partner that nags you and nags you and nags you but then you go to the strip club and the strip the stripper tells you they love you even though they're not telling you the truth you still rather go to the strip club because the stripper at least will lie to you like the the hell that's such a Perfect Analogy like golly man at you know that's the that's the thing like they're willing to go to the stripper and the stripper is gonna say well yeah I love you give me the money that's what this situation is and if you really want to actually you know uh square with the people you'll let them know yeah people are really suffering this is why the system needs to change and the thing is is like it's like yeah those metrics metrics are great for according to whom and according to what metrics what about the happiness level of all the Americans that you know that we see what about that what about our happiness level how many of us are now getting married David is a a millennial just like myself right how many of us are choosing to get married how many of us can afford a home now how many of us are having kids there's a whole lot more iuds there's a whole lot more condoms being sold because guess what we're like uhuh we we ain't bringing no kids into this world can't do it can't afford it part of is because capitalism is one of the biggest [ __ ] blockers of them all just ask any just as any red blooded person we we ain't getting it in like we want to let's just be real because we can't afford to but that's the thing right I love how Eddie goes yeah right you know all right let's let let let me continue because I I I talk too much I talk too much I'm too I'm too longwinded I know we are not the Beall end all of a northern European style democracy and economy no because a northern European style democracy also exploits people so that the people in their countries can actually have it good but the global South ends up getting shafted yeah and they're and they're being dismantled too like even even places like Norway where I admire some of the things they've done like Norway to to fund their Scandinavian social democracy they nationalize their oil company so all the oil in Norway is owned by the state and then that gets invested in social welfare programs for the workers which is a great program but you know even a lot of those uh social welfare states are being dismantled by neoliberalism like the the last 45 years in the US we've seen deregulation and more um unregulated capitalism what Ronald Reagan called trickle down but what some people don't realize is that's been a global phenomenon that's also been happening in Europe um so a lot of these social safety nets um have been been dismantled um to the point where even people in Europe aren't living that well anymore because of course the problem is capitalism David let me ask you this question would France be doing as good now that places like Mali and Burkina Faso have kicked their asses out are is France gonna be able to do that well what about uh as far as their nuclear power that they use to warm their homes now that they don't have access to that uranium anymore how are they going to be able to keep themselves up are they gonna be able to have that so that thriving social democracy like they did in in years past David now that the now that the people of those countries are kicking out their neocolonial masters so social democracy only works when you can continue to exploit people from afar yes so true so if you really want to have worker solidarity you don't even want a social democracy because the thing is that you need to still exploit in order to have these benefits that's the problem with these these uh European style democracies I don't want no offense to present company but I don't want anything European style because look what it did to the world no kidding I agree well I'm Irish so technically they got too you clar Irish too CLA DA's one of the homies so oh yeah yeah so let me finish this and then yeah I because my next story actually has uh something to do with this but oh hang on uh JB get it together man what the hell is wrong with you a lot don't answer that question eony but we have made improvements and we have to recognize that if you are measuring how well the economy is doing differently depending on who's President then you're being biased that's what you just you know [Applause] what D what you just that's what you just did bro that's what you just did it's unreal I need you to do something need you to do me a favor I need you to jump on a plane come here put me in a sleeper hold so that I won't have to and make me go to sleep because I can't deal with this anymore put me in a sleeper hole bro I know you know it I know you know it yeah it's insane I don't know and it's like that's the level of arrogance that we're dealing with here to where like he can cherry pick statistics for two straight minutes to make Biden look good and then end his speech by saying you know nobody should cherry-pick statistics to make one candidate look good like are you in a what world are you living in it's unreal do not put sprinkles on a pile of [ __ ] and tell me it's chocolate ice cream bro stop it it smells like it it looks like it don't tell me to eat it bro stop it look I can't tell you how many times perfect example ask somebody that's disabled my disability check is about equal to my rent once my disability check is pay was my rents paid my disability check gone how do I eat David how do I pay for my utilities David how do I pay for my health care David David I literally have a GoFundMe on my Twitter page I literally have the crowdfund just so that we can survive and my mother lives with me my mother's 72 72 David and she has never owned her own home what do you say to her oh you just didn't work hard enough is that what you're going to say see I can use myself an ex example because there's so many of us that are going through this and so when people say well things are relatively good for whom you're you got it good you're on Roku you're on uh Free Speech TV you have a huge YouTube channel yeah yeah you're good but what about the rest of us and I think that's I think that's the point and the point is is that we can't look at this from an individualistic point of view because once we start to do that then we start to divorce ourselves from the rest of the community and the rest of society right I think this is why sorry go ahead no yeah at the at the end of the day it's such an individualistic way to look at it too um his perspective and yeah I don't know it makes me emotional hearing stories like that because you know you know people who NE need medical care to survive and they're just scraping by and like I've heard so many stories like yours of people who crowd fund the one of the first ladies I met through the burning campaign told me she was sending her insulin in the mail to people who needed it which is illegal so she had to like sneak around law enforcement in order to help people get her insulin I met a couple through the Bernie campaign whose uh um mother was got cancer and then her job laid her off because she had cancer and then event they just watched her wither away and die because she got cut off from her health insurance because she had it through her employer um like there there are stories like this all over the [ __ ] country that I hate to get emotional but it makes me emotional and then you have people like David Pacman who are making a nice income to [ __ ] on Trump every day and give you know half-baked MSNBC Rachel mattow esque political analysis and they don't give a [ __ ] about the millions of people who are suffering in this country who can't pay for their damn Medical Care and I just can't wrap my head around it it just doesn't make sense to me like the the second I heard that story about the the couple whose mom died I was like okay it's my mission in [ __ ] life to make make sure that this doesn't happen to anyone else anymore to make sure that we can fix our system and give everybody in this Society health care but you know the these people like David Pacman don't care they don't give a [ __ ] they're they're never gonna have that Collective um working class spirit that we have as as socialists and Communists yeah let me share this with you guys too this video is entitled how much money do Americans need to be comfortable they need to earn 23 $3,000 a year to be financially comfortable $233,000 per year Eddie do you have $233,000 man I [ __ ] wish sorry I don't mean to swear but not even close yep but in 2021 American workers on average made only $175,200 3 annually Americans are sort of looking at how much money they would like to have to be financially secure and that ends up being basically three times what the average income is in this country and to be essentially wealthy or really successful it's magnitudes above that 72% of Americans said they weren't financially secure given their current finances and more than a quarter of Americans said they'll likely never be financially secur by the numbers they're debt is lower and their savings are higher coming out of the pandemic but they're more anxious about what's going to happen next if they have job stability if they're going to be able to have Secure Retirement with well over half of Americans living paycheck to paycheck many are failing to meet some of their modest financial goals there are actually millions of people struggling it's not something that people want to talk about but if you in a place where your financial security feels super precarious you're not alone and it's not your fault so how did it become so difficult to be financially secure in America and what what can you do about it let's do some budgeting Americans working full-time earned a median monthly income of about $4,400 during the second quarter of 2023 I wish I made that much no I really do I don't know almost anyone who makes that much I mean the cost of living in my in the midwest isn't what it is in like New York and LA but I don't know anyone who makes that much dude we literally have in order to afford a two bedroom here in Florida you have to make $32 an hour holy [ __ ] holy crap dude yeah yeah I'll show you I'll show you the numbers in a minute but let's continue the average worker takes home 75.2% of gross wages after taxes and benefits shrinking the take-home pay to about $3,388 and that just isn't enough to to cover the cost of living in America today the cost of healthare that has skyrocketed the cost of attending college has skyrocketed the cost of purchasing a home has skyrocketed but nowhere has anyone said wage growth is up 15% right take a look at some of the most essential expenses for Americans the median monthly rent in the US is $2,029 as of June 2023 that amount already accounts for over 46% of the Americans median preex tax income but most US Agencies classify spending more than 30% of one's gross monthly income on rent as being rent burdened meanwhile the median mortgage payment for a 2400t house was $1,957 per month however a common rule of thumb advises spending 28% or less of your pre-tax income on mortgage payments for the median grow monthly earnings that translates to just $1,232 as we talk to household holds and talk to Consumers out in the real world especially those say under 40 housing is the big issue you know rent rent rent mortgage mortgage mortgage it it is the biggest concern that people aren't going to be able to make the next payment GP really hurting individuals that's what helps the GDP go up all the money we're paying in rent every month it's a great sign of how the landlords are doing but not the working people of this country exactly having stability in housing and I think sometimes people we underestimate that if you have uncertainty in your housing it causes uncertainty everywhere housing is also the reason why cities have become more difficult to afford Americans said it would require more than $1 million in net worth to be financially comfortable in places like San Francisco New York and Southern California this is why we've seen some migration or Mobility around the country where some people say I'm living in a high cost State like California or New York we really want to sort of pack up and go to an area that's less expensive and one of the ironies of that is those places that were cheaper before are now becoming more expensive like Florida where I live because everybody's moving here everybody in their mama and what do we do because now we're being gentrified up the Wazoo now here it's crazy man it is my buddy's an aspen Colorado which is a hot spot for rich people to move and like it's like six or seven for a Snickers bar when I go visit him it's insane and he the only way that he can live out there is by teaching because if they didn't offer free Apartments to the teachers they wouldn't have any teachers because you can't survive on a teacher's salary in Aspen so he got his teaching degree and and started teaching so that he could get free housing and actually afford to live out there but it's it's insane the cost of living and some of these areas God hungry I'll wait I won't grab a Snickers geez man so due to the sake of time you know I I would like to um you know I would like to finish this video but due to the sake of time I don't want to uh take too much more of your time but I'll put this video in the in the chat as well but it just goes to show how people are really truly suffering and then you have a lot of people who go ah it's not that it it's not as bad and they're like it's improving when in reality it's actually getting worse it just you know it doesn't square right um so just uh checking do you have enough time for the next story yeah yeah let's do it okay um so before I get into that if you guys have not go ahead and give the

let's go to this tweet here this is actually from more perfect union actually hang on make sure I put this uh so your team here this is going to be an interesting subject as well I think that we need to pay more attention to what our state laws are doing regarding child labor laws it's going down here in Florida so let me share this with you guys on on more perfect union if you guys don't follow them I suggest you do give them a follow they put out great uh tweets regarding labor issues it says a bill allowing children as young as 16 to work in construction one of America's most dangerous Industries for workers has just passed a Florida Senate committee this is the second Bill Florida Republicans have pushed so far this year to erode centuries old child labor laws so Florida anti-immigrant law pass last year SB 1718 has exacerbated a labor shortage in construction SB 460 a bill written by the Builder Lobby would replace those workers with kids wow yeah during the hearings GOP Senator Corey Simon wasn't able to answer who would cover the medical expense of an uninsured 16-year-old who was hurt on a job children working in construction sites are six times as likely to be injured on the job as kids working other jobs let's take this look so I'm looking at is retains to um the medical treatment expenses uh if a a child is injured on the job so just looking at some questions that that I just kind of um want to ask based off the reading uh if a if we have a 16 or 17 year old uninsured child is injured on the job while working on the on one of these scaffoldings or a a rule for substructure who is responsible for paying the child's medical expenses if they and their families are uninsured thank you for the question I'm sorry Mr chair thank you for the question um I will consult um with the bill or the but uh but I do believe it's the responsibility of the employer just like any other staffer that that's working on the job Mr chair Senor Jones Thank You chair Simon um and I just I don't know if you um there's a New York Times article um that I had the opportunity to take a look at that spoke about um that found that contractors and subcontractors often refuse to pay the medical bills when someone is hurt on the job were you aware of that Senator Simon thank you Mr chair no sir I'm not Mr chair Senator Jones um so um if that's the case how will children injured on the job who are not insured and whose contractors refus to pay the workers comp or their or the medical bill uh have access to medical care if they need Senator Simon uh thank you Mr chair um I'm happy to work with you and making sure that those Provisions are tight and making sure that those those uh those kids are taken care of just like every other employ on the job site here's my problem as anybody knows and I know you know Eddie uh is that insurance does risk assessment and by such they know that is more riskier for kids to be on construction sites than it is for adults by that very notion there will be children who are 16 and 17 year olds that will have accidents which means that the insurance companies will have to pay out more often for kids than they do with adults so they're going to deny these kids Insurance period because they don't want to have to pay that out that being said then these kids are going to be under insured or uninsured so by that very notion because Insurance private insurance company their goal is to make money they have a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders so they're not going to want to ensure these kids so how do you ensure these kids when it comes to medical care if and when they have these accidents on the job that's that's exactly where my my head went I I work concrete for a summer and there was an 18-year-old on the job who smoked himself in the head with a concrete form and he was bleeding and had to go to the hospital and that's just the stuff that's more likely to happen if you have 16y olds on a on a concrete site it's dangerous work it's hard work um you're gonna have that so like the idea that we can have 16y olds on these job sites that aren't covered at all is UN unreal because you know you could get hurt and get slapped with a $40,000 medical bill um as a 16-year-old that your employer isn't willing to pay for and um so I mean that's a a really good line of attack here from the senator but I mean the fact that we have six that we're pushing for 16y olds on construction sites in general is is absurd like I'm not against um young people learning construction and learning you know these these skills and building but that's not what they're trying to do they're trying to get 16y olds in the workforce so they can maximize their profit so they can pay them 11 bucks an hour to do hard concrete work um and and make a bunch of profit off it and it shows like um when I did the Jubilee debate recently capitalism versus communism the capitalists were trying to tell me that capitalism is what abolish uh child labor it's like no class struggle is what abolish child labor the capitalists love child labor they were making bank off it until the workers got together and said no you're not going to throw our kids in the factory anymore but now after 40 plus years of neoliberalism um and the ruling class taking back all the power that the organized working class had gained over the years you see The Return of child labor it's just the natural progression uh a more unregulated system of capitalism means more children in the workplace yeah it's just like it's just like when Majin Buu and D Dragon Ball Z reverted back to his most evil form like that's what capitalism does exactly yeah so let me continue and share this it says as several oppon opponents pointed out the bill might also violate the federal fair labor standards act through an amendment in height requirements eliminated some Roofing work the F flsa prohibits miners from working in Roofing and any work performed on or about a roof says sb4 460 is part of a coordinated effort in Florida and elsewhere to erode centuries old labor laws that ensure kids have a fair shot at an education and aren't exploited at work says the sponsor of another bill 16year olds aren't kids but youth workers so that's like that's that's a bunch of BS it says uh oh okay so that was the end sorry but there was also this um video that I also found see keep shrinking it's okay about to go into this um so there was this video that I that I wanted to share as well well a bill weing Florida don't go ahead of me man all right so let's share this at the state capital A bill weakening Florida's child labor laws is now making progress in the state legislature it cleared its first Committee hearing on Wednesday but its future remains uncertain for 16-year-old employees like Logan shulenberger House Bill 49 is an opportunity I'm trying to get in the workforce you know it's more experience this is a 16-year-old looks like an adult wait what did they what did they feed this kid this is a 16 wait that's a grown ass man that ain't no 16y old he got a he got a chin of a 29 year old good God man f54 I'm like what are you sure that's wait that's not a 16y old are they gonna bring this kid on and just have him say like I want to work are they gonna say you know look it's good for kids to have them in construction jobs ah Eddie you ruined the [Applause] surprise I'm too good at sniffing out the propaganda at this point I guess yep yep let's watch it experience you have more likely you are to get hired in the future right he was among the supporters who spoke in favor of Florida's loosening of child labor protections on Wednesday it's up to the kid to know their limitations specifically this will remove it's up to the kids to know their limitations oh my goodness that's dangerous wait hold up wait oh so wait it's up to the kids to know their limitations not the employer who tells the kid what to do you know the kid the 16-year-old has to put their foot down if they're being pushed too hard man you know what I know my limitations no no more work this is where I draw the line what that poor kid that poor kid is just being utiliz it's up to the kids to know their limitations look that is something that is of that should be taken within reason because somebody can say well you know a 14-year-old can can date a 30-year-old the kids should know their limit they they know their limitations is that what you're good where's the line you know oh well I should be able to work at a meat packing plant even though I'm even though I'm 13 I know my limitations I should be able to work for Dupont chemicals I know my limitations 15 Eddie boy you you need to come down here and put put me in that hole bro because I'm telling you patience specifically this bill removes current curfew restrictions on 16 and 17 year olds letting them work before 6:30 a.m. after 11:00 p.m more than 30 hours a week Plus on days before class Plus on days before class oh here to go it also removes mandated 30 minute breaks after four hours of continuous work and limits city and county governments from circumventing the standards this does align us with the federal law and 24 other states mostly blue liberal states rep Linda Cheney listed the reasons she's pushing the policy saying it'll help bolster Florida's Workforce keep hazardous work restrictions in place and Grant kids who want to work a chance to do so they want to work this Bill gets government out of their way to choose the path that is best for them there were plenty opposed to the idea teens included we do not want miners who going to high school working 12:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. how are they going to function as school Democrats trying to to water down the proposed changes but lack the votes to make it happen no the amendment fails in debate those members warned approval would hurt kids more than help we just recently passed a uh a law having the school day starting uh later because teenagers need more sleep I don't see how this bill helps that right I really do encourage us to let kids be kids which is a phrase that my colleagues have loved to use these past several years and I don't understand why now they're a youth worker they're not a kid anymore H9 still has a long way to go Point too because Republicans have been saying let kids be kids um you know when it comes to social issues but when it comes to throwing kids in the workplace no kids are wage laborers now I mean this is just class struggle if you read the the um what's the name I can't think of the chapter in Marx's Capital it might be the chapter on class struggle he just goes through in England how there are all these debates in the courts and and the working class is you know fighting to get kids out of the workplace and get lower hours and get get higher pay and the ruling class is fighting in the courts to get kids in the workplace and get lower pay and this is just that in modern day there there it's a class struggle in the battleground of of the Courts of the legal system and and the ruling class the capitalist class is winning over the working class in Florida right now yep absolutely couldn't have said it better myself let's continue man before it even gets close to the governor's desk but momentum before session suggests it'll continue to move when lawmakers G in next month now here's something to keep in mind this policy does not have a senate companion bill just yet and the Senate President Kathleen pasido a fellow Republican told us recently she's unsure what to make of the idea she said she'd probably be more supportive if the bill didn't go quite as far that's a latest out here at the state C boy oh boy oh boy so that's what's Happ happening here in Florida they're literally trying to get rid of child labor laws so that they could have more teenagers work and I actually reported on um the law that was passed by Ronda santis making it so that undocumented workers uh would be essentially deported if they were found working especially in construction and things like that because that's what a lot of them were doing and so when that happened then next thing you know construction projects stopped here in Florida they were like yeah we're not working we're not doing this because we're not going to risk being deported and now they don't want to pay a competitive living wage so now they're like okay let's get the kids to do it instead of actually paying a competitive living wage and getting adults like you and me so that we can actually work in these industries no we still don't want to pay those wages so we're just going to get the kids to do it for us instead exactly that's all it is see this is why number one worker solidarity is so important number two we got to advocate for workers including kids because forcing them to work in these conditions is also anti-worker because a lot of them are not conditioned or ready for this type of work now I am all for them doing things that are more age appropriate type of work like if you want to you know like a 16 17 year old working as a barista okay cool right as long as you also pay them a living wage and then you also allow them time to be able to have enough r rest and so it doesn't interfere with education because that's also important education is also very important for the proletariat so they want to interfere with that and then they want kids to work starvation wages uhuh no absolutely not so I think that's important I think you know part of that is also making sure that yes let if you if you think let kids be kids all right in this case let kids be kids let them get their education so that they could be a well educated proletariat so that when they do get in construction once they're 18 19 20 years old then they have the skills because they didn't have to wake up at work from Midnight to 6 a.m. before school like a slave exactly so yeah I mean this is one of the reasons why I also say it's important that you know we built worker solidarity uh and joining organizations um just like wwam ter said make sure to join organizations I think that's important here in Orlando I mean of course we have the or rbn Orlando chapter there's also Orlando Mutual Aid chapter they're doing great work there's also real Orlando they're doing great work they're uh they also are feeding homeless people down here uh there's also different organizations around the country and I just want to use this time to encourage people if you are in if you are in another city or another state look up other organizations especially ones that are Anti-Imperialist that are doing work on the ground to help build up class solidarity within your area because that is what's going to happen help us change this nation so that we won't have to worry about child labor laws being pulled back Eddie absolutely I agree join join an organization get involved on the ground um educate people um because worker solidarity is how we fight back you know that's the the the the message of that chapter in Marx's capital I brought up earlier about class struggle is that the only way to fight back against stuff like this is to get organized but once we do get organized we have the power because they rely on our labor and we rely on them for nothing so basically basically so I mean um what's going on that's new with you guys at Midwestern marks so that we can wet the people's appetite so that they can tune in to you guys even more yeah check us out on Midwestern marks on YouTube and Tik Tok and Twitter we've got a book of poetry about Palestine coming out from Professor Danny Shaw he's pretty awesome I think that should be unique and cool and then Noah's book about repr proletarianization should be following that so got a lot of cool stuff going on um uh patreon.com Midwestern marks is the best place to support us financially and yeah appreciate you having me on I I love doing the show yeah definitely man and I'm so glad you were able to come on to break all this down because I think it's deeply important uh so thank you so very much for joining uh and I think it's good to have your analysis on this because a lot of times people will listen and say well I guess he's correct because you know he's a guy in front of a camera saying this stuff and it's like well no you're not crazy yeah you're poor because because of this system and the way it's operated this is why the system needs to change and you can't do it within the con you cannot overthrow oppression with the Master's tools basically so yeah so yeah so thank you so it was great so uh thank you so very much for joining and I will see you on the interwebs and oh by the way I just wanted to say this because uh I think this is important what you did on Jubilee was great and I just want to say thank you for that uh I thoroughly enjoyed it um the capitalists were just making me frustrated because I'm just like it's like guys uh capitalism has outlived its usefulness it's just it it has outlived this use usefulness it was it was fine when feudalism ended and it ushered us into a new age but now we're at an age where Humanity looks at each other and we're like no everybody should have housing everybody should have health care everybody should have good food everybody should have clean water everybody should have a liable planet and nobody should be going abroad to kill other people for resources we can all come together it's just natural progression absolutely all right time to move on yep thanks a lot bro have a good one yep thanks for having me JB thanks everyone we'll see you next time all right byebye all right so man these guys are brilliant man if you guys don't follow people at M Wester marks what are you doing with your life so uh I'm going to say thanks for everybody please make sure to like share and subscribe if you guys have not already uh so I'm going to go to the chat and let's have a conversation so I Mastermind era says JB goes we're fashion since where he's putting out the

that are watching and get you guys thoughts about some of the things that were said I know y'all got some things to say especially about what David Pacman said and I hope I at least did Justice in trying to debunk some of the stuff that David was saying it's just it it's it's sad because the things that he was saying is just completely devoid about from what a lot of us are going through Miguel H coming in saying peace good to see you Jacqueline coming in saying hey everyone Hi JB Miguel and Eddie Cowboy Kitty coming in saying hello sea Miller coming in giving me the hello catf face and love

the scar Bros are effing delusional yeah Jacqueline says so who did they ask on this survey the members of the top 10% that's what I'm asking because a lot of times what they'll do is they'll survey people who have a landline who do you know that still has a landline people who are established people who already own their homes people who are already retired people who have money so of course you're gonna say everything's good they ain't pull me LOL eliminate says Pacman oh here we go exactly right blue Marvel himself John keer AKA Adam Basher says peace love and solidarity good to see you

I'm calling that oh and I'm calling Rome too if I'm ever in trouble that's what I'm calling I'm calling I'm calling the Avengers good that is where it's at Midwestern Mark says is Pacman really the grandson of Nazi wait somebody said hang on Rondo said I mean David Pacman is the grandson of Nazis that's allegedly so his rightwing sensibility should be expected I don't know about all that that that that take was trash though but I don't know about all that but let me continue Joe Schwarz good to see you says this is going to be a good one thank you I appreciate it very much uh James Stark says wishing you a good revolutionary Health andan to your quest oh thank you workers of the world must unite absolutely black panther Alum 1947 all power to the people thank you so very much power to all the people especially workers of the World Unite gurug G says the stock market is doing good so F all you whiny surfs says the elite Absol you know and that's the thing a lot of times people are like oh well the stock market is doing good GDP is doing good so why are you complaining this like how many of us actually have stock and even if we do have stock how many of us actually have access ACC to it because some of us who have 401ks we get penalized for it by trying to take it out anyway and that's for us for retirement and look I don't have look here's the crazy part I have a savings account with no money in it is that because oh I just don't know how to spend my money no over 50% of my household income and I'm part I'm half of that household income goes towards my rent so guess what I ain't got no savings what about me how many of you guys have savings actually anything substantial in savings you don't have it I don't have it I know I don't have it emk says 67% of Statistics are pulled from my high oh my goodness oh and I usually don't like to go after people who are in this space but I felt this was a a a an opportunity to tell people no David's wrong because most of us are suffering that's the issue and it it pans out statistically that we are all suffering Joe schwar says Joe Biden kicked people off unemployment that's is also true that's something that a lot of people don't talk about there's a ton of people that are still unemployed that still haven't been able to get employed and how we talked about the quiet hiring I know sabii sabs talked about it quiet hiring what is quiet hiring quiet hiring is when you're now down to a skeleton crew in your Workforce and instead of actually hiring people the boss has realized that you can still get away with the production with a skeleton crew so they don't hire anybody but they'll make you think that they are still hiring Pro people they'll even put out uh you know for that they're that they're hiring they'll put it out on LinkedIn and all these other sites that they're accepting applications but then they'll do interviews right but they will never hire anybody and they'll say well we just haven't found the right person yet and they'll keep that up but they'll keep you as a skeleton crew working and making starvation wages and working your behind off without actually adding people who actually need to be part of that Workforce so that they can retain that money because guess what they need to keep that money so that they can give it to their shareholders to keep it at the top so while you're struggling they'll make you think they will manipulate you to make you think that well yeah we're looking for people to hire it's just we haven't found the right person when in reality they don't want to find them because they don't want to hire them that's what it's called quiet hiring ilh hanar says the quality of life has gone down despite the jobs in America like George Colin said we live in a country of owners and the own you don't own anything anymore when was the last time you bought a DVD when was the last time you bought a CD of music you don't actually own it because it can literally be wiped from your phone you don't own anything Alexis Anderson says David Pacman was talking about anything is like nails on a chalkboard to me Sean Miller says unemployment numbers are based off people currently getting unemployment payment if you run out or get kicked off number goes down yet you're still unemployment exactly so what about those people oh well they haven't got a job yet well they're just not looking hard enough is that is that where we're at now emk says I wonder what Pacman has to say about Black Rock and Vanguard but I can't listening to the sounds of someone damn emk damn emk you guys are ruthless man geez Louise man man you guys all right let me go to the bottom of the chat so that uh Sean Brock says having kids on a heavy industrial construction site is so dangerous yeah yeah that's true uh Hey the Willie BR show hey good to see you says JB F we have skeleton crew at work and they're pretending like they're trying to hire folks exactly exactly they don't want to hire more people because they want to save that money and the thing is it's not and it's not like it's not like they are are hurting for cash because a lot of these corporations they have record profit years they just don't want to hire people because they want you to slave more that's what it is Jeffrey Kramer good to see you Jeff he says no savings checking I keep telling myself I'm gon stock away for some savings yeah a lot of us don't have savings man like I keep asking myself like what's the point of even having a savings account if I can't even put anything in it I don't I can't because once it goes into my savings account guess what I have to do I have to go into my phone and transfer from my savings to my checking just so that or I had to pull for my savings because oh the electric got to be paid and the electric bill is higher than it was the previous month or my rent just went up so therefore that money and savings poof gone you know what I'm saying that's the way it is and a lot of times people don't realize like your life bill got to get paid they increased uh my Internet bill I can't do this I can't do this show without internet but they increase that uh sorry normal says so so you are extremely cost burdened with rent yes I am deeply yes so cost burden that I have to have crowdfunding Casey good to see if my savings account has 20 bucks in it how much does my savings account have I think I got like I don't think I have anything in my savings I think like once in a while it gets transferred and then it'll be like four bucks here two bucks there I really honestly just do not have like money in my savings like my my account is dog crap right now like am I checking I got 10 53 and my savings I have zero dollar right I would show you guys but it has a last four digits of my account number and I'm not about to show that but yeah $10 53 and zero dollars in my savings so when people look at me and go oh JB you're on you're on YouTube don't you have money no you see the size of my subscribers subscribe see theid of that I ain't got nothing I'm broke as crap man look I don't even have a car I don't have transportation people so yeah I'm with y'all anyways so yeah I wanted to uh you know talk about these things because you know I think it's I think it's important for people like David to realize that his opinion about how well we're doing is not reflective of the majority of us because if it was then we all would be backing him up but we we can't because our wallets says otherwise David tells me one thing my wallet's telling me something completely different my wallet is hyena laughing in my face my bank account is laughing like crusty the clown why because my money is funny so when people like David tell me that oh well GDP is is up David uh David we can't afford food we can't afford housing it you literally have to make3 $2 an hour to afford a two-bedroom apartment here in Florida homelessness is on the rise people are struggling people can't even afford their student loan payments some of us have foregone College chose to forego College because we didn't want to get into student debt because either or will still be shafted David this is going to be ASMR and we're gonna talk about what's going on as far as the class struggle David I want you to listen to the sound of my bank account it's very Hollow that's the way my bank account sounds it's fair hello um David Can you spot me two 20 bucks because I really don't have it I would really appreciate it I'll send you my cash app link that's the problem the hood is growing the hood is growing so that's one thing that and and the thing is is like and I don't want to say this without giving a solution but one of the solutions is to get to know your neighbors try to build community enjoying an organization like for instance like I said here in Orlando we have real Orlando they're a great group that's doing they have people's uh free kitchen which they're actually getting together and actually growing food in a garden and they're using that same food to feed the unhoused so get together with people like that there's also groups that are like for instance in uh in Nick of arbn he has you know their casec tenants where they're doing tennis unions and organizing to help people with housing because our desperation is literally growing as we speak and so as our desperation grows we need to have communities so that they can help us to stay afloat until we can actually change this system for the better so start looking in your city for different groups that are actually trying to help people on the ground and they may be able to help you on the ground as well and it also is helpful for you and your spirit to also help people on the ground as well because number one you'll find like-minded people and you'll build community number two you could probably find resources to help you number three you can also help use those resources to help others who are around you so that they don't continuously suffer because it's one thing for you to get help for yourself but it also hurts your heart to see other people suffer so you also are able to be privy to those resources to help others so try to do that so with that being said uh there's going to be some announcements here one of the things that I'm going to be doing is if you guys have not already I also did continuation of the reading of laziness does not exist by Dr Devon price on this channel so if you guys go to the playlist I just covered uh I think it was chapter six part two I think it was of laziness does not exist so go ahead and give that a watch that was a beautiful reading and I absolutely loved it it was actually talking about how a lot of times us dealing with family members and having to take a step back and not stress over when it comes to household duties and things like that being able to say no and being able to relax our minds and bodies as well because that's what capitalism wants us to do they want us to run ourselves into the ground and be robotic uh also covered the second part of chapter one of will the will to change men masculinity and Love by B hooks B hooks actually talks about some of the main motivators of why we men operate the way we do Bell hooks actually gets it and so look I'm going tell you right now men look 75% of my Watchers are men what is one of the things that we gripe about is that love for us is typically conditional that is actually part of capitalism because they want us to be robotic and our worth is only linked to what we can produce so therefore love for us is only conditional and then the only type of emotion that we are able to have that is acceptable for us to have is what anger this is why women tend to fear us a lot because the only acceptable emotion we can display is that and it does not allow us to be nurturers so guess what that's what capitalism thrives on and so because of our incessant need to feel loved we have to produce which means you're not a man if you're not producing well guess what that's what capitalism says that's why I'm reading this book so read that uh so that's also in the playlist as well as I read and discussed that also I will be reading uh sometime this week of water in the spirit ritual magic and the initiation of a life of an African Shaman we getting into this because guess what the indigenous and the global South they got some wisdom we're gonna be reading from that as well so I'll be getting into that and I just got this today I I'm G to try to get into this this is Gaza writes back short stories from Young Writers in Gaza Palestine this is from ra aler who is the editor the poet that was murdered in Gaza so I'm gonna be trying to get this and read this in honor of rat so yes uh so yes I'm going to be trying to get into to that as well so thank you so very much for everybody tuning in uh if you guys have not

and were lawfully entitled under the fairh labor standards act the federal law that governs federal wage hour and child labor standards two years later in 2021 the US State Department of Labor separately found Perry roofing contractors led by CEO ke Perry guilty of violating overtime and recordkeeping requirements under federal law it's unclear that this investigation involves employees who
