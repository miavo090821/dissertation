I'm a I feel like there should have been a bill pass to protect me for two years so I can get my foot it's not that we can't have anything it's that the black people that really be for black people that really care about the state of black people in community we think they're annoying we make them into jokes we we Embrace anti-intellectualism we want them to shut the up do it and what people don't understand you still got to pay bills like just because you believe and you want to work for a better Society doesn't mean you don't have rent you know where you don't see any cops in white neighborhoods what strikes me about just the whole defunding the police abolition conversation is just the lack of imagination the reality of it is is that it's a lot more conservatively minded and I think that we're willing to acknowledge like just because you vote Democrat it don't make you Progressive [Music] [Applause] [Music] let me tell you why I've convened you all here today so I put up a video on Instagram explaining why Governor Cathy hoko should support uh making prison calls from prison free right and that this is a massive amount of debt that is you know disproportionately placed on Black and Hispanic families paying for these prison calls I got a comment from this black guy uh who leaves me hate comments every day actually but this comment he said he said you are so out of touch from what the black community wants black people do not want this they do not want it easier for people in jail you are basically a liberal white woman so I said this is powerful this is powerful and I'm like I'm pretty confident I'm not a liberal white woman or divorce from black people but I said you know what I am saying I am seeing a lot of black people that are pro policing like Pro over policing and pro mass incarceration and spewing and like very supportive of these tough on crime black cop Mayors and stuff across the country I'm getting I'm seeing a lot of them not to say they're the majority or anything but obviously there is something there um and so I wanted to put that to the room we I think that black people are just as susceptible to copaganda as everybody else and I think that it's so pervasive now and I have to say um you know my my wheelhouse is abortion and Repro right so I did a I did some research on defunding the police and I think I was even surprised at how few crimes actually get solved and so I think there are a lot of people who sort of have this mindset that the police are supposed to keep you safe you know and what if there's a murder or there's a rape or they always go to those really extreme circumstances and I mean if that happens it happens the cops aren't going to fix it they aren't going to solve it and I think a lot of people in my in my mind I was very surprised at how few cases are actually cleared I thought they'd get at least a couple but they really don't and so it kind of raises the question what do they do I mean I think I think black people are obviously susceptible to copaganda like we are in the society re we receive the same messages like we're not immune to kind of like hegemony and how um how we're all constantly being programmed but I will say that what feels different is like we have the real world world experiences to know that the cops aren't going to do anything and also know that like they are more likely to be a threat to us like in my own kind of politicization it took me a second to like Rec reconcile the fact that I wasn't Pro like abolishing the police prior to say like six seven years ago but I was also actively afraid of the police myself um and like could kind of get down with the idea that like oh of course you need to call someone in a murder but then also would be like shaking uncontrollably if I got pulled over or was would never really feel like I would get the benefit of the doubt with police so I do think that like especially black people in New York especially black New Yorkers especially if you grew up in New York as a black kid like you have probably been harassed by the police in the Subway on the Block in school and somewhere in your kind of life or world so I do think that that makes black people be at a higher standard of of recognizing that the police don't do anything even if you don't have the ability to kind of do the research and look at the clearance rates and stuff but I do think the problem is like we don't have Alternatives so people are kind of like I know this is a [ __ ] option I know it's not going to help me but I don't have anything else and it scares me to kind of be in freef fall or have nothing which is why I think sometimes people who feel scared or uncertain about the future cling to this idea this like fairy tale of what the police are even when they know damn well like that's not how it works in practice and I get that right like I get and I I especially get when it comes to black people in copaganda and how black people could support policing and whatnot because everybody is being raised in a world that says that police are synonymous with Public Safety and Y yada y so I understand that what I understand less is like the active like I get a lot of black people people like actively like make life harder for other black people like they literally will be angry at you for proposing something you're like hey a lot of lots of black families are in dead and they're like [ __ ] that [ __ ] that no no we don't want that like I write a piece that's like hey all of these black Mayors you like so much are like specifically locking up black people like ex like especially so like a lot more than even the white person before them were locking up and they're like shut the [ __ ] up black Excellence yeah well well it's because most of those pundits or most of those political uh chess pieces are are people who have to overcompensate like I think we got to understand that like they overcompensate for um the political participation that's necessary for them to get in office and to stay in office right so we all have the experience of the black cop or the Latino cop that go or the Asian cop even that goes harder on the community than than even his white counterpart right so we understand that even on an anecdotal micro level you know that that reflects itself in the political sphere as well um but to get back to the actual question about are you out of touch are we out of touch um no I think the simple answer is is no um I and I do want to make the distinction between clearance rate of what we call a solve of a crime and solutions of a crime and what a convictions are because right the feds are like 97% at the line or some [ __ ] like that I know because as a person who has had a past life with CRI it and been associated with a community that's been criminalized since I was very young and and convicted of crimes that I did not commit and quite frankly past crimes that may have been committed that no one ever figured out right um I'm quite aware that the the uh I guess the solvency of Justice or the the uh axium of justice is not is not like a pure thing like that's just not the reality but people people need something to grab on to it's like hope or the Bible or whatever like they need something to to grab on to so I actually empathize a lot with those with those people because I know it just sounds like fear which is what works we know the politicization of fear you did such a good job um bullying the mayor about about such tactics so so to me I'm actually not confused about it I think that those people need to be treated like patients right I think they need to be treated with delicate care because they're clearly fragile and I don't mean that in a disrespectful way I mean quite literally like Reena said you know we had to rectify our own relationship with what we believe is protection for people of color in this country and the organization that is chartered to do so but clearly has not made us feel on an individual level that it has that it has been done to its highest ability so we can't be crazy if all of us are having the shared experience of like when I call a police I don't know what's gonna happen right the question of I'm not sure of if things will get solved as ammani said or if I will be considered a a a suspect than a crime that was committed upon me upon arrival just simply because of the way that inate bias is in mic in the system so I'm not confused as to why do would do that um he clearly is a part of the agenda he's clearly been appropriated and I feel bad for bro but I think it's it's not our job to educate him but it is I think we have to be if if the goal is to combat that level of um marketing right he's an agent of their marketing there is there we do have to be aware of how prevalent it is amongst us and why it exists and instead of fighting against the idea that like you know my personal belief is I don't I personally you know I'm little [ __ ] I want I want to be able to be like [ __ ] [ __ ] the Police get him off the streets you know that's kind of like my want but I also feel like it's probably not you know a reality for human beings who are stuck in a fearful system that they propagated in and so I just kind of feel like they have to be one over in another way I don't know what that way is because you know I ain't here to prophesy that ain't my job you know I get angry and [ __ ] so I just but you people who have the great job of articulation and and convincing people of things um you know people go to church get healed you're not preaching to people who already know the word so I think you guys have to have the unfortunate duty of figuring out how to access that fear calm that fear meet it with rational and reasonability and and and give them these these facts and these and these um these Alternatives that might be better I think that's unfortunately a task that y'all are are kind of propositioned with sorry y'all you [ __ ] I mean we're giving we're doing a lot of good faith interpretations of why people act like this and I think that's we should we should be acting in good faith but like there's also like the real Annoying thread in Black Culture of like respectability and like this feeling that like if you cap for the system you're going to be spared somehow or you're going to get some opportunities or your family's going to be treated better and it's like girl nobody when the cops roll up on you they're not like looking up your at and being like you're a good one we're not going to beat your ass like it's not it's not rational it doesn't actually work it doesn't actually help so I do think we need to have love and good faith and um trying to like meet people where they are but there's also a feeling of like a lot of people's survival mechanism is like I'm going to distinguish myself from other black people so all the anti-blackness goes to you and I get to like be one of the few people that gets to like wriggle through and get this privilege and first of all it doesn't work that way but second of all it's a whack theory of change it's a theory of change that like sacrifices everybody and not only sacrifices people but actively tries to undercut folks who are advocating for a better world for all of us based on some idea that like if you are the respectable one if you're the good one if you're the house negro or whatever then you'll get the first round of scraps um and not the second or third round of scraps yeah but they Pages always look weird so I don't even worry about them I think always got like black and blue police flags and [ __ ] you have to make sure it's actually a black person and not like we black people see in my comments Emoji yeah they be doing a lot they always like oddly placed amongst the group of whites I I think that we we we kind of just it really boils down to like the big picture of like classism in the black community I think to a certain stent and how look we live in America and in America if you have money you are better than other people right I mean Donald Trump's whole appeal is that he's rich and because he's Rich regardless of how he got rich people don't even care that means that he's better than other people that means that his opinion matters more that means he's smarter that means he's more capable but the most important thing to this conversation mean that he deserves what he gets and if you don't have that if you if you're not successful if you're struggling economically if you're if you're doing poorly then you deserve what you get because the fact that you don't have money is a personal fault and and that's the American value system and unfortunately like our community is not immune from that and and and and I do think that we resist that to a certain extent but the reality is that you know we're just not going to be able to to always counteract those messages that you see in terms of saying like Okay like why you think this person is not deserving because of the economic state and what what I've noticed is personally is that white people may do it because of racism and black people may do it because of classism yeah and so said the the black person is is is saying oh well yeah you deserve what you're getting because you're poor and the white person say you deserve what you're getting because you're black but the reality is that they both agree that this person deserves what they're getting right they may not agree why but they and so the person AG is well it's because they disagree with each other they think is a conflict if you're the person at the end of it you're going to be screwed no matter who's in charge because neither none of these people is acknowledging your basic humanity and so when it comes like that person articulating that call it's kind of like he he's questioning why why should we do anything for these people because because again people like that articulating as these people as the others as the you know the undesirables the people that you know are bad inherently wrong and evil and things like that and is that that's the hardest arguments I think to fight because it's not like it's not really a rational argument it's just basically saying that people are bad and irredeemable and we have no other choice but to put them in a cage and to lock them away because what else are you going to do because it's the presumption that the system works right system the moral High Ground of all of all right yeah if you if you didn't do it you wouldn't be there I know it's crazy right but but that's what people think yeah I get that in my I I literally get that in my comments all the time I of somebody being like this when I realized we were really we were really cooked I posted a video of a mother I held a Rikers rally a couple years ago and there was a mother of uh a man who died in Rikers and she was speaking and there were really and I mean like a tear jerking speech and there were really people in my comments being like if she was a good mother her child wouldn't be at Rikers uh that's their own fault oh don't do crime people say out on anything you could post the most gruesome horrific story and they are there blaming the people in this black I have I have black people in my comments right now saying things like oh we really need to take responsibility for our badass kids I'm like and I think that's the the thing that really strikes me often is the black people I hear say these things the most are the black people most vulnerable to it like it's always the black people them who are the literally the Target demographic for the like the oppression you're trying to battle that they're insisting on and they and they present you by you by trying to like advocate for them you or for for us but largely for them they say you are detached you're the one that's not speaking to a black reality that's their reality but you go I think that I think that it comes back to to to just the the nature of just living in this of such a hyper individualistic society that at the end of the day I I think that there's a consciousness that well at least that most colored people have that uh that there is some even if they don't want to call it racism you know trademark uh but there's some sort of implicit bias baked into the system but so long as sh don't impact me I really don't give a damn you know what I mean like and going back to what we were saying about classism you know as long as you listen I'll tell you the other day you know I got my car stole you know what I mean in my mind I'm not thinking about you know if I call the police on this [ __ ] you know he gonna go he gonna go to jail he gonna catch a charge I'm thinking about getting my car back you know what I mean so from the cops they're not gonna find your car say in in in that moment in time that's what I'm thinking in my head is what do I do is call the police and tell them to go get my whip because I got to get home from work you know and and that's just that and we we're just conditioned to think in that to think in that way is how do these systems serve me specifically you feel me if I'm a homeowner I ain't really concerned about you know uh how this charge is going to impact you know BR 10 10 years down the line I'm concerned about the fact that you know he jacked my TV from out of my house and that's the way that we frame it uh that's the way that it's framed and that's the reason why you have so many PE I think that a lot of people you know somewhat purposefully only look as far as the nose in front of their face you know what I mean yeah which is human I think that's a human yeah but you said something really interesting bill and I would love to hear back from you on it because you said like you know like you know the only thing you're we've been conditioned to do is call the police when something go wrong because they're the presumption of moral superiority of Justice superiority Etc I didn't have that experience because I grew well well look look look I'll tell I'll tell you what I did you know I'll tell you what I did without telling you what I did is you know I got some folks around that way and it got taken care of right you know I mean exact that's how you got your car back though if you had called the cops they would come in five hours most people don't think that way cuz most people don't grow up in a condition where they're trained you know to look to the community for uh for a solution they're trained to look to the system I just so happen to have grown up in an environment where we ain't really had that option you know what I mean I think I think I just want to make the point that there's two things going on right there's a thing of like I'm only worried about me so I'm GNA call the cops and and involve the criminal legal system because I'm trying to get mine and that really does make sense to me but there's other thing like that is not going to serve even your interests that is not how cops function they are not going to be like calling all officers and find your car you're much likely to get your cousins or your friends or your whatever to find your car so that's the part that feels frustrating to me because not only is it harmful it doesn't the the system does not operate in the way that it pretends to and black people more than anybody know that so then why are we pretending like if we call the cops they're going to run and get our car back they're not or they're going to get our bike back or they're going to get our TV back they will that will not happen for 99.9% of people and probably 100% of black people because I think police is the only thing in our society that we are we are quite literally indoctrinated to believe you just they your police are treated like water and air you know what I mean like kids are kid like little kids and it's like good go like good bad you know what I mean cops and robbers you you need to know 911 you call the police that's just treated as as synonymous and when you think about it our whole society right like every year people give they inflate police budgets and then they say they're not safe and then they do they continue to give more money for police and to everybody that somehow makes sense like to be to be critical of the police or to be against giving the police more money is seeing as being anti-public safety because that's so synonymous it's the only thing that can continue to fail by the admission of the politicians doing it every year and they and everybody's on board with to do that so I think that's a lot of the reason why people can have their own personal experiences where they know think about the time you called the police or you went to the police for something and did it go like the shows did it go like the movies and they still continue to trust the police well this was also always raised to not police I don't know about y'all but like I was not raised in a household where it was like the police are helpful to us it was like when we get pulled over everybody shook Everybody's scared everybody's shaking so I get I get the dissonance and like I'm not I'm not trying to be obtuse I'm just trying to be real that like we actually hold both of those things and extreme distrust of police extreme skepticism of police extreme knowing that police are violent toward violent towards us no matter what and then also like uh unability to kind of hold what Society has told us and like operate as though we believe it even though I just I really don't think that we do well that's because it's all we have so so the idea that my community is for me is to a superior level than the than the police I also can't subscribe to right because my environment was hostile so so if I'm being honest you know the anecdote I wanted to share with both to share both GRE and Bill is that like you know I didn't I was indoctrinated to have distrust of the police as Rena said like I was indoctrinated to have such a severe distrust of the police that I think the first time I ever called 911 in my life I was 22 23 years old and it was at my girl house and I had bought my first leg vehicle and I was such a [ __ ] I parked it in the back of her of her apartment cuz I thought it's closer to the window I could see it right and I fell asleep and they and no one even stole the car they just went through the car because I I think like they like they they went through the car they opened the car up they busted the window open came in went do all my [ __ ] and I remember and this is to show just how like indoctrinated I was the opposite of what we're speaking of I remember I was like oh [ __ ] they went through my car babe like what I'mma do she like she like oh man you got got to call to police I'm like yeah what's their [Laughter] number she might have said you gotta call 911 and I think I said what's their number and I'm not I'm not neurologically Divergent I just I just literally theyve been flattened into this um this symbol or or this idea that to her meant safety and to me meant problems so why would I call yeah my problems you know what I'm saying because I'm thinking oh [ __ ] they went through my [ __ ] like I'm I'm have a better chance trying to call the homies to figure it out than I am calling the police but then also my insurance paperwork the system that is in place requires that yeah right right she had to educated me she said well baby because I was like I ain't calling you know I ain't calling them she's like but if you don't call you can't get the insurance claim on whatever may have been taken and I said oh well it's been it's not just that the police are this are this like you know this independent agency that's operating in some capacity that we all bow down to they've been they are in they are intimately with the system that of large of our operations as a daily and to divorce yourself from that is is is a large thing to do because even if I don't [ __ ] with y'all I'm like damn I got I better call so I make sure my jewelry insured and I can at least write yeah so it's bigger than just I [ __ ] with the police but I got a C police it's literally they've made it so that you have to interface with them as a solution before you even have practicals if you don't want to go the streetway by the way and there's an innate distrust and I'm gonna pass it over to Amman there's an innate distrust if I don't trust the police well look guess who robed my car my community robbed my car the homies robed my car so or the homie sister or they crackhead uncle or some dude just passing through the neighborhood and they didn't clip them so somebody did something to me right and if I don't call the police and I take it out on my own well the police are going to get involved if I take it out on my own if if it goes that way so it becomes a kind of like a l lose situation to be to be completely honest even for people who haven't been indoctrinated which doesn't necessarily support the argument this brother was making on her page right the argument he's making on her page is more so closer to what I think Rena was saying earlier of there's there's a uh if I'm a I'm not like you Negroes like I think it's more that than anything but go ahead no I was just gonna say I think it's interesting because earlier you were saying that you know I'm not the one who's going to be able to talk to these people because that's y'all's duty but really you are the one that's going to be able to talk to people because you're doing the thing that abolitionists want to try like you're actually practicing what people are saying needs to be done you went to the community you you figured it out you know um and I think what strikes me about just the whole defunding the police abolition conversation is just the lack of imagination right like I don't have all the answers if someone wants to say well what if I get raped I'm not going to be able to look at that person and say well yeah we're going to have a community meeting about it and blah blah blah but because that's not going to satisfy the person but what I can say to them is what's going on right now doesn't work we are putting H like you know tens of billions of dollars into policing and we know it doesn't work for our community so where's the harm in advocating for shaving off a couple of million and giving it to some actual black people people who understand how Community solutions could work and let them see what come up with you know like it just seems like people don't even want to let people don't even want to give something new a try so that was the one thing I wanted to say and the second thing in terms of being forced to interface with the cops before you can get any sort of Justice like of course being the being the abortion lady on the conversation um it reminded me like if you are raped and there you live in a state where there's a rape exception to an abortion ban you have to go to the police and file charges and we know how that goes right like we know how that goes for white girl we especially know how that goes for black girls black women white women so I think yeah I I I really think it's the lack of imagination and the unwillingness to just give some money to some people who know what they're doing and let them see what they come up with get a pilot program going somewhere and see what happens well I think I think copaganda is so effective in kind of addressing his arguments because if you think about it if crime if crime goes up every is going to say you need police but if crime goes down every say you need police because the police are working right so the police have created this type of of of bubble where whether they're doing they're not never really do great at a job but whether they're feeling miserably or feeling horribly they are still going to be the solution to the problem and so what happens is that because they're always a default solution because they always have an argument whether crime is up or whether crime is down as to they should get more money then that means that there's never a room for a different opportunity or a different approach because the and and I also I also say this you know just talking about for politicians who are politicians are are are if there's a say there's a crime there's something happening in the Subways in New Y great example even though that was kind again that stuff is is is hyped up by the Press right the conservative press who wants to make a you know wants the to create the demonize you know the the black cities where all the animals are running loose and creating all this crime and Chaos so that the white people in the suburb are so thankful that you know they get the opportunity to vote Republican but the the reality is that the solution still is uh we have to add more law enforcement to the Subways right that all there so but but the thing about that is that no one's going to ever say if he adds more law enforcement that he's not trying to do anything to solve the problem yeah and when and when you're a politician that provides cover and that cover is so important because you're just trying to get through to the next election so you can win it right you don't really you don't really care so so if I so someone says add more police I be like well no one's going to say I don't care no one's going to say I'm not trying and you can you can always debate the whether's the efficacy of the solution but you're never going to say that I'm not doing anything and that provides me the cover that I need to wait another two years so that I can go in the ballot and you forget that the stuff was happening in the first place yeah then my question would be what do you what would you and this is not to be antagonist this is genuine um what would everyone prefer because I I feel like I feel I do tend to lean towards it's funny cuz I'm being I didn't think I was going to be the I'm the gangster on the phone call I thought I was going to be like [ __ ] the politicians [ __ ] their systems but um you guys are just so eloquent and so articulate and so well spaced in where you stand you know I'm not I'm not gonna pretend like I agree with everybody no no because I don't I like look do I believe that we should defund the police probably but my personal opinion is that I wish we had higher regulation on who were police like that's my personal like I wish that they were they were more well educated I think that I wish they were more Community or I wish that they before they got the check that's my personal I wish that we had I wish I treat them like the Marines if it was me and I buy the actual Mar the problem with that is again it assumes that it's a mistake who the police are and what the police are there to do like it's not right police are there as specific communities where you see police non-stop it's ours right is the specific people that they abuse and brutalize disproportionately it's us it's us who they're incarcerating they're there to do that to us it's not a mistake right the reason why the police can do this in play sight is the reason why they don't care about their body cam footage and all of this is because it's fine that's what they are there to do and white people know that you see how like those of us who are public defenders on this call you know how when you represent on the rare occasion on the rare occasion you get a white client they are [ __ ] outraged they cannot believe this [ __ ] is happening to them you see it like think about just like the the viral you see when these white women start crying and call the police and say that this is a black man they understand they understand how the police system works they understand that it's not supposed to be them and it's for us so it's not this and also I think something your to your own point you made initially um at the beginning of the conversation about the fact that we have to work much harder when we are in these systems like that's the whole thing about systemic why we say policing is systemic a systemic problem you'll say that and police people be like oh my Uncle Joe the police is a good guy ain't nobody disputing that the reality is there's a job right like mil little sister is like a Financial Manager uh for a a school she be dashing hopes and dreams getting promoted you know what I mean because because she has to that's what you know what I mean to do the best at to do the best of what the job wants you there to do so what they want from you is to be policing these communities as hard as possible they want that like think about the amount of police officers that you see get uh uh commit some kind of brutality commit some kind of crime and they get promoted I could think of several off the top most no most of them and and even in the in the back histories of some of the instances we've seen over just the past decade most of them have had instances of extreme brutality against people of color I'm not arguing an endemic issue I'm not arguing that it's not a system overhaul that needs to take place I'm saying for me at the at the when I talk about defunding of the police right it's like my thing is when we talk about Commissioners when we talk about uh certain political people that that are on committees that dictate the regulations themselves and the agreements we have that's policy like this is multi- prompt I simply say if we're talking about who's in my community policing me as a [ __ ] who been locked up and interfaced with a lot of the ground foot soldiers of the issue which you will not defeat the entire system fighting foot soldiers right like there's a head somewhere and that's the head you have to deal with and that's more political of voting and knowing who someone's background in and what policies they participate in I think that should absolutely happen that's why I leave it to y'all to handle that but if I'm talking about for me in my community what I've noticed on the ground just the ground stuff which you know is a is a a pebble on a beach i' I've noticed that the men that and women who are hired to police the community itself which is just an enforcement of those regulations and Agreements are they not the most capable humans they they're not the smartest people even the Commissioners that we hire even even if you go to the school system we look at our superintendant these aren't our best and brightest but but here's the gag but here the system like intentionally gets us to focus on part in order to preserve the whole right like we focus on police as though police are this wild you know wild [ __ ] running free and the rest of the the thing isn't a part of them the smart people the smart people who would go Be Cops the ones that don't seem like bumbling buffoons are the prosecutors the legislators and the judges that are sending them [ __ ] up that are that are fully a part of it the police are not doing anything like by themselves it's one band One sound you know what I'm saying like well and I agree but I think that it should be a harder I think that it should be a harder I think I I I I understand what you're saying but I also think and I mean it's honestly like this idea that police are there to protect the community to solve crimes is in itself copaganda because that's not their goal and and if you and if you that's why that's why so the the the about the Curren I'm about the system that's always been so so saying I think that's why when she touched wheni touched on clearance rates I think that's so important right because let's just like we we you can be a progressive you can have your ideology but let's evaluate them through their value system and purported value system they say that we're here to protect people and the AR arrest people and convict people commit crimes they're horrible at that they they let's be they are horrible at they will arrest I know like I'm I've just done this I'm laughing because I've done so many time they will they will they arrest random people they arrest people with no evidence they they bring horrible cases they have no idea who does anything they have like they if their job is to is to solve crimes are horrible at it and so so you either have to start looking at it say okay is that is that are they just that bad at their job and no one cares or is that not their job and I would argue that that's not their job I I would argue that their job is is to keep you know the community under control and to keep keep keep to keep that that that stuff that happens in your community and in our communities or whatever to make sure that that stays there which which is why there was a study early was when I was in law school but it was like they they sound some of the most stopping fris happened on Wall Street and that and that area right because because the issue was why is this black person here yeah you know why why you why are you in this neighborhood and we're going to aggressively come to you and enforce and enforce the law we're going to aggressively grab you and put you against the wall and start because you don't belong here but in your community in your community will let you do whatever like Poli if if if you generally think police care about black homicide then it's just they just don't they they just don't they don't they don't care and and and they'll put they'll put the same innocent person in jail for 25 years and they'll let the person who who did five murders is look I'll talk to you just talk value Sy of some of these Federal plea deals in terms of you know people kill 10 people and get and get you know the the the they they they also let a lot of predators not just sexual predators but you know violent Predators back on the streets and they could care less of course we they are the sexual predators the I agree I agree but you know but can I just really quick say because I think that I really do think the point about clearance rates is like a very good point to make for like talking about the purpose of police but I also get really nervous about that because all clearance means is conviction so it's like sometimes people really want to push cops to have higher clearance rates and like we don't actually as a society have any mechanism to do oversight of the police like we can ratchet them up we can give them more money we can hire more of them we can force them to do convictions we can ratchet them down which is what like defund the police is about but we're not we have no way to be like you need to do better quality detective work you need to be kinder to the people in the community so a lot of times when the clearance rates are high they're just wrongfully and falsely convicting hell of people so that's just something I always feel like I want to say when we're talking about clearance rates because I'm not GNA be like well cops are doing a good job but they have a 90% clearance rate because I know that that usually means there's a bunch of 15-year-old black kids who didn't do anything other than being the right wrong place at the wrong time on Rikers or in in these local jails but Malcolm what I really want to say is to your thing your first thing of like what's the alternative because to me that's like the whole point of abolition and that's the point that like is is hit less hard and less often we legit know what advances Public Safety like it really is not uh a mystery or a surprise so I can give you like some examples like for example summer youth in in New York is like this uh program that mayor Adam loves to pull money from that gives like teenagers jobs in the summer kids who are involved in that have like a 25% lower arrest rate and even higher than that lower arrest rate of felony arrest because they have jobs they have something to do they have money when uh Obamacare pass and expanded medicaid throughout the country that reduced uh arrests in the South by like 30% and people think it's because people had access to like Behavioral Health Mental Health care affordably for the first time giving folks Supportive Housing they did that in Denver about 10 years ago that uh for people who are like repeat offenders people have like a lot of justice system contact that reduce their rearrest rate by a third so it's like people don't believe it but like there's hella data and hella studies that show if you make investments in community if you cut poverty if you give people jobs if you give them access to health care if you give them access to housing that is like a cheaper than funding the police and a more quickly better tested Public Safety um intervention that like reduces crime reduces violence and increases Public Safety point and Ole's Point like that's not really what cops are for so when we're pushing more cops the people that are pushing more cops know that like maybe every American doesn't but like the people who are policy experts know that and there's a reason why they're pushing police and stealing money from those programs to make police seem more necessary because they're serving a different purpose so so the thing I think I find frustrating right is that I know that white people know that I know that because I have I went to school high school in West Virginia only black girl in my class went to college in Ohio I've been surrounded by white people and I've seen white people engage in a million things that would be crimes or criminalized if it if it had been us and never once is that the response they come up with when they were drinking this da d d they always pulling deals figuring something out you know blah blah blah they will never they don't they don't resort to the criminal system they know oh send this one to rehab do this this is and the next thing so they understand that the part that I find confusing is why black people act like they don't know like the fact that black people themselves are responding to the concept of defund the police or giving more resources to the th to things like like with the all this bewilderment blows me because I'm like crime is not divorced from anything or and even if you thought it was let's say you think crime is by itself and there's no root causes and all these other things aren't related you still at the very least in these communities know that these other things are issues you know you have issues with housing you know you have issues with with your education system you know you have issues with healthare you know this so why are you so proposed they defund that every year that is a normaly that every year they're taking money from that so why is that perfectly normal or that's not a problem you want to talk about to to Resource that why is that so crazy to you when we say hey instead of the only thing that gets address added for black people and that's how you know they're not addressing a black people issue they're addressing white America's issue with black people and how to deal with black why iser after the problem has gone toy after the root issues have been ignored I completely agree with holistic approaches and funding being alternative not even alternatively but redirected to the proper sources or with people but I I I think that that's where it gets that's where I agree with with the issue is like if we got teams and they fighting over funding right and these guys are really good at getting what they what they need and what they want to militarize and pinching pinching uh pillow and all that [ __ ] that they doing um I wonder how we can get our team to win more that's that I would like my team to win more I think a big part of it is I think a big part of it is is you know how we say all skin folk ain't Kim folk and that's and that's part of the thing that I think that that I think that's the bush that we kind of you know trying to skirt around and the reality of it is is that it's a lot more conservatively minded neg R and I think that we're willing to acknowledge you know what I mean like just because you vote Democrat that don't make you liberal it don't make you Progressive like if you ask the a if you ask the average person you know what how they really feel you know about wealth distribution how do you really feel you know about having your taxes bumped up just a little bit so that which I mean if we really want to get into the weeds of you ain't even got to do that but if you ask them you know what if we just bumped your taxes up just a little bit you know and everybody have health care everybody have some oh [ __ ] what you talking about what that how much we paying in taxes is where they putting the taxes I betl I know oh can't do this because she you know she she she super left gang member I am newly Rich I'm a new newly Rich negro and I feel like there should have been a bill pass to protect me for two years so I can get my foot in because because the idea right because I really that hood tax is real like my community tax is real right every dollar I get first and foremost I paid for I don't know how many in funeral services how much health care how many um bail oh knows how many how much bail out done paid my first year of making any kind of money so by the way because I wanted to put the money towards the causes that I believed in and the things that I believe help my community and deviate some of this criminality that occurs right because I know where it come from I'm from there I know that if you put my if you put my my little homie's little brother in a science program after school he not gonna be on the Block and if he is on the Block they gonna be doing what they learn in that Science Program like I know so I help bu them I like that's what I did now this is the problem um if you ask me you want to BM my taxes I have no problem with it I'm chilling I come from the community I'm with it let's redistribute but when they Redline who money gets money where depending on where you live and so the white neighborhood you you I don't like that I live in a rich neighborhood now and that them little white kids get my money I don't like it I don't like it they don't need it so I take my money I give it to my community um I don't like how they mismanage my money I don't like what they do with my money I don't agree with how they police my community I don't agree with what they do with even the roads being neglected but somehow my kids ain't got no books that are the books are 10 years old it don't make no sense so I like what they do with my tax money that's so what do we do about the amount of black politicians that we have doing all these things that we hate and they're and they have strongholds of black people who feel like hash black Excellence don't say nothing about them why are you attacking like I have all kind of black people in my comments like why are you trying to humiliate and bring down this black man this black man I'm like this black man is anti-black like I'm refer referring to the and to reena's point earlier when you were talking about um conviction or clearance rates um and and Reena said that that makes her uncomfortable when she hears that because she knows that there are a bunch of black children being locked up and accused of things it makes me think of the DC crime bill with mariio Bowser just the other day making it so they could decide any area is a high crime area and then the police are free to stop Frisk question any any black people in groups of two or more so what do we think like this is and these are black people doing this and when I put out I put out an OP ad for Essence explaining like yo these black men we have a conundrum of these black politicians that are like they not only are they anti-black but they have to be staunchly more so like there's a reason why cop city is happening in Atlanta why this this place that wants to present itself as a black Mecca feels compelled to go out it way to even over Poli to show we really got it under control as all these black people there so we even have extra more policing And yet when you point that out to black people it's black people telling you you are trying to bring down black people CA remember what I said and I'm and I'm I know I'm holding this particular part hostage because I called oh when baby girl I ain't gonna get on her because they already own her bumper but I call oh I was like it's not that she because she's presenting it as you know this Law and Order thing right like you know we have to preserve Law and Order for the good blacks and I'm just sitting here like listen mama if you truly felt that way if you truly felt that way there wouldn't be joy in your voice at the convictions that are going to be rolling down from this massive Rico for people that you know really didn't have nothing to do with whatever it is you're trying to actually convict trying to get some notches on a belt so even in the the lack of empathy in your voice the sadness that you should have is that damn this system failed these kids and now they're involved in something that I unfortunately do my job have to prosecute but I need to do something and I'm failing like this is a failure that we even have to do this that's not the perspective she took on that St yeah the perspective she took was we got to keep all the other other other good law-abiding Negroes safe and I went see the [ __ ] is a liar she's a [ __ ] liar care about [ __ ] don't care [ __ ] also also where that's cap is like the the black cop Mayors like they are not catering to black people and they are not listening to black people they are doing this for white people like they it's easy for them because they're black to be like I'm doing this for the black community but it's like I work in politics like that is not who they're selling this to they are selling it to like the white establishment the white Democratic establishment and the whole thing about like cops not creating Public Safety you know where you don't see any [ __ ] cops in white neighborhoods if cops kept you safe would they not be lined up the Block in Beverly Hills and Bair you don't see them even when like there's huge publicized burglaries or or crimes they do not put cops on the Block because people do not want that they do not need that and they recognize the things that keep them safe are their money are their safe schools and sending cops black community to keep their boot on all of our necks at all times so we can't even go over there so it's like I just don't like this idea that these like Eric Adams's are like I'm scking up for black communities because I'm like I've been in the rooms that you're in and that's not who you're talking to and that's not who you're catering to you are selling the dream to white people and white Democrats that like the city is so scary don't worry we're gonna keep all these black people in check and we're gonna throw them all in briers so that your neighborhoods are safe well that's it that's the thing right there is is is that's how you keep your job that's how you stay in office oh you see your nice little ly white G Community right you know why it's that way right cuz we keeping all the [ __ ] out you know how we keep the [ __ ] out you give more money to the police and they'll make sure the [ __ ] stay where they belong and away from y'all so at the end of the day and I think at the end of the day you know you got to come back to the historical aspect about it policing was never about us police or let me correct that policing was about keeping us in a state of slavery essentially even if it wasn't even if it wasn't by name that's what it was for even in the North was always about protecting rich people's property from the poor folk the color folk the immigrants and everything in between so if the foundation is rotted the building is going to crump the building is going to be rotted if you don't do nothing to address the foundation that's just what it is and so that's where we are now nobody ever addressed the fact that all the cops in the South was all clansmen nobody ever did anything to address that so now they just carried on them same tactics that same mentality that same philosophy and again you got a lot of you got a lot of pick me blacks that we just going to keep it a buck they fine with that because I can live with the white folks you know what I mean but the irony is that the bloodline the the the actual blood work for for policing right even if you start with slave slave patrolling and then if you go to property protection whether it was in England or whatever like they would cherry-pick those people they would pay them because the rich would pay for the people so it's actually very much so a part of the system it's a part of the the the the makeup of the entire system is to grab people from your people to and give them a little bit of something to make them participate and and I think that what what but what do you do like what how do you how do you convince somebody when you give them a little something and Elevate their status in this community right to to look back and go no I'm not going to help you protect your property whether or or to sequester my people I'm not going to do that and get voted in office well we have to participate and make our vote count right what ola does such a good job of doing I don't know if you really that doc the doc that you did that I saw before it came out put out yeah we need to con that that's that like because I was you know I'm a non-believer in voting because I was a criminal for a long time and I couldn't now I can um and so she really inspired me because I was like yo I was so you know we they win with apathy with us right they build apathy within us like calcifies I don't even want to participate this is stupid like what we doing um but I think that the the if they can get our people to come and and and um uh how you [ __ ] against us in lack of a better terminology well then we have to be able to mobilize forces to put our dollars our votes behind the people who are actually going to get in there and have a history of policies that are for us but we can't do that if we don't want to participate and I know I was a hardhead who did not want to participate for the longest and if it wasn't for o you know really having the the um patience with me right to to to inspire me to participate in vote and well I mean I was always a local election guy but the bigger elections that I thought don't matter um you know I was always a local election guy but you know if without that I wouldn't feel like I couldn't see the correlation I couldn't see the correlation but once you start drawing very clear lines for people like easy is ABC the way that these cops Market is very ABC hey look we got all the police in the [ __ ] areas and they stay over there and they go to jail and like it's very like a through it's very clear I think that with liberals we get caught up in these like these nonse arguments that like Veer off it's like the marketing is terrible like we need to study Disney as something because this is crazy I think a messiah and I have I this conversation a lot um with like we talk about the fact in in the legal system a lot of it's like yes it's black people the the is disproportionately black people in the criminal system but it's also it's poor black people in specific like let be with black people there it's not every black person's experience right um and the thing about that is it's like you have all these different people these different demographics in a court like even the kind of black people that are there that do not relates to these lived experiences that are that are judging this in in in a way or assessing how you respond to life circumstances that that we cannot relate to right right and but then here's the flip side of that the the black people that have experienced that or live in those communities will then who you would think is the only Outlet to truly have some understanding and to be sympathetic y'all be the main ones Malcolm interesting I wasn't I wasn't born the hood so like but being but if you're going to say you're liberal and Progressive like like a lot of dudes that I know from the hood are going to be the ones who are going to be adamantly like aggressively arguing against your positions right so I I and and I and I I was like so at a certain point you know and this is I guess for anybody you're like you're like I'm I'm a little confused about what's going on here but I but I do think that just have thinking about it it's like okay it's just people's lived experience right I think for for me it's like I Associated I um I I could see have when you have certain things you can other people don't have those you understand how people act because they don't have it and I'm talking about basic things I'm talking about you you're not worried about food on the table right I I never I never had to wor you're not worried about where you're going to sleep or home or environment or anything like that right you don't you don't have to worry about any type of you know uh violence happening to you like like just obviously freak accidents could happen but you don't have to generally worry about violence that's not something that you have to particularly worry about right so you you and and then so someone who doesn't have the work and you see you see people what these people what people have to go through and you're like okay like you understand what's going on here I mean it's a completely different Dynamic right you don't and but but because I think when you grow up in that environment you think you normalize it and you start to think like okay this is what everyone goes through it's like no bro everyone's not going through that you know like you you you don't understand that like you you like what what people around you are going through is not is not right what what people are being deprived of of they're not you should have a place to sleep every night you shouldn't have to worry about you know paying rent right or you know doing all these type of things in order to have a place to live you shouldn't have to worry about food right you shouldn't have you should you should you should have to you should be able to go to a public school and get an education education that can get you a good job you should you shouldn't have to it's by design that you I agree but it's also that the day I'm look at it like this is just normal like that's not normal that you have to understand that people are taking away what what you're entitled to which is why I'm a big like human rights person in terms of like looking at human rights in terms of like what are we as a human being entitled to we're entitled to food we're entitled to shelter we're entitled to education we're entitled to like a certain standard of living we're all entitled to it because we're all human beings and it's that that Dynamic that I think that maybe that can bridge that that Gap and start to say like look man if if you if everyone in the community these things would be real different right I mean like you got it would be different right every especially when you're when you're older because you're old when you're a kid you may not know about the econom economic problems but you know that you know maybe maybe your mind was yelling at you because she's worried about the rant and she stressed about she got eviction notice and and and she's stressed and now and now you're getting you're getting all this FL and you think it's because she's just being mean or whatever you don't understand that she's trying to figure out where we going to live in seven days I mean I also want I think we're all saying this but I feel like it makes sense we need to it's helpful to say it out loud which is like also obviously there's a lot of people that are like squarely impacted by this that are on some [ __ ] and most of them live in Pole's comment section like that's where that's their address but I also think it's important to remember that like a lot of this like radical um ideology came from that exact same Community like it was poor black folks who were very much at the Crux of this that like thought of a lot of the concepts that led to abolition people like Johnny tman who did who did labor organizing so it's like there is a class element to the way that it manifests now but I do believe that like some of the best most radical um thinking did not come from the upper class black people had like definitely did because you need the tools to implement it through a system let me push back though because I think there was all like a lot of a lot of people that you're talking about like it used to be you could come from you know humble backgrounds and you could get that education right I mean the education system it wasn't it was never great but even my my dad's time I I've had a very fancy education not to brag what the [ __ ] did these people teach me other than how to indoctrinate me to hold up their Injustice they weren't teaching me critical thinking to undermine the system I'm not talking about that I'm just talking about disturbs of presentation that's all I'm talking about like because that's important that's important when you get when you get into these spaces it's important that you know people you you know like what what you learn going to fancy schools is how to talk to people who go to fancy schools and that but they don't value in it of itself because when you're in the the space and all the fancy school people are talking all the [ __ ] it's like you're like I can talk some [ __ ] too let's talk some [ __ ] you know what say me tons it afforded me tons of privileges but to your point of like back in the day people could get a decent education I just don't think that our like educational system even when it's like good and Elite gives you the skills to be able to be critical of the system so I don't think good education be like a radical thinker and I think often times having those good educations actually indoctrinates you further to be like the Pik me type reproduce the logic of the oppressor because that's what they're teaching but you're talking about culture the education not the Merit of the arithmetic so I think it it's it's a cyclical problem right because I think to what Ma I think everybody's different points I'm about to bring in because to what Mah was saying earlier is that what happens often is when you are raised in these communities and you're having this experience it becomes it becomes normal Li to you and so that's a lot of what you're seeing from the black people that are pushing back against these things that you think are in their best interest so at that same time that's why it makes sense for people like Malcom to what immani and Raina were saying it's like you say it's supposed to be us pontificating or trying to into uh um uh educate people but it's actually you because what happens is those people then those people in those communities either they have two choices right it becomes they don't want to hear their experiences pared back by us who or people who who don't experience that so they don't want to hear it from you right but then the flip side to that is what happens why so many even though yes the school of thoughts and abolitionist thoughts and a lot of these things to organize and on the ground a lot of this Theory comes from the people themselves who are actually in these communities but here's the gag it's a privilege to be able in order to be able to go go to school go pontificate go get the jobs and have the luxury and stuff to be able to do these things but out a certain element of danger because of what class protects and stuff like that the people like the people who actually grow up in those communities even when they do understand and they are the ones the organizers they're in the Forefront of that they're the ones who are the quickest to get criminalized you know what I mean they're the quickest ones to end up in the system the quickest ones to lose something like there's a certain I'm not nothing I can put this out we can have this entire conversation and I can put this out with my colorful backgrounds and Olay and friends and put this out on Sunday and everything is fine and I can keep doing that but if somebody who doesn't have the name or the background or the fancy degrees or whatever and that in the community goes and says that right now at a community meeting then ypd is is regularly going to be watching them you know what I mean trying anything and look you you know we had that conversation the other day because Kanye is crazy but he's half crazy like you know where I told you when he was in the car like he's like well I ain't kill nobody so they can't do [ __ ] to me and it's hilarious it's so hilarious it was so hilarious I mean look mental health is not hilarious but I said that when they started taking a particular interest in you because of how you verbally assaulted their leader um I was like well it's well it's up for them cuz going to have to fabricate some [ __ ] you know they gonna have to literally come up with something because you are clear and free of any real issues at this point and um someone like me or someone like my homies or the people I'm connected to it's very easy to take out a mouthpiece that someone because none of us are dirt none of us come out clean from you just don't come out clean it just don't happen and the ones of us that do come out clean is because they were preserved by a system or they were to of tokenism right so they don't have like you got to do something you got there's there's a maslo hierarchy of need and you know if you are not allowed to to to to go attain those things in a legal formal fashion not even illegal but just a formal fashion you gonna get something on you and they gonna weaponize that against you the moment that you try to tr try to Rail Road them because then on that moral high horse thing so for me it's always like I preserve my little homies the best that I can I try to provide and the community Alternatives the holistic programs that I've literally started and funded and continue to do because seems like the only hope and um I do believe that redirecting those resources to where they need to be will be the eventual um corrosion of this system right it's the idea that like no the systems are getting like my community is getting better us individuals who do happen to make it not abandoning our community and I don't mean just living in the same zip code but being participants in the uplifting of that itself uh politically right uh legal legislatively in in whatever capacity but we do it it is tough it is heavy I've watched you do all this good work and be like Malcolm I can't even make as much money as I should be able to make to survive in the way that I should be able to survive because I've chosen this path and that's how they beat us they win every time you know because we because you gotta literally be a miracle Reena gota be a miracle Messiah gota be a miracle gotta be a miracle Little Bill gotta be a miracle literally and that's what you told you advised me was my point of view when I went to Cambridge to speak right which was I was like what's what is my contribution to a discussion because I don't just want to sit around talking about [ __ ] with no real solutions no efficacy to these things right and you was like well your perspective is Academia has no real very very seldom has a real life applicable you know situation and and and my very existence is is is is not a symbol of how the system works my very existence is just to land a plane then go ahead do it is you you said this so I'm gonna quote you he's like my very existence is the problem right like the idea that I had to be magical to survive this yeah was is it is not a show not to show that the system works it's the reason the system doesn't work and um that's been my crusade since having that conversation with you please go ahead I I think that just reminded me of of the other thing the other flip side to this is there the side is very the formal aspect of where a lot of not only do a lot of the black people who are most experienced in this the people who who live this are boxed out in a bunch of different ways from being the actual people that are leading these things even though they should be and should be speaking to things there's also an element of this is the the the nonprofit industrial complex this world that does this work in a formal way is very white it's white as [ __ ] it's white as [ __ ] so that's also a thing and they don't want to hear from they don't want to hear from those people very often they like to pick like black avatars black people that they do like they pick the those of us that they you know what I mean and yeah symbolically CA it it like it it sheds light on how much they don't know what they're talking about like if there's someone in the room that really has like lived experience or actually knows what they're talking about it shows kind of that so many of the white people in this space that are experts are not experts in anything other than like enjoying to hear themselves talk yeah right well not well not even the not even the white I've been on campaigns where I've had you know uh quote unquote fly in the milks and I'm like I'm from I'm not from here literally but I'm from this I know what's going to work you I've had proposals that have been shot down because oh we don't have the infrastructure we don't have like what you mean we don't have an infrastructure to put a shoe box in a barber shop and just tell them you know to just drop something in the box like what you talking about but because you know because I'm not a part of that cabal right because I had to be magical because I had to be one of those exceptional few I was one of those had one of the the uh the hashtag gifted child that the community came around and said we gonna get this [ __ ] out of here cook or by crook we gonna get him out of here and I was just one of the few that came back and said well I ain't gonna leave y'all hanging but then when I got into the room the very people that supposedly supposed to be you know the Messiah is you know the great white hopes or whatever they don't want to listen to what I got to say because it's not really in their interest their interest is to do whatever and it was a good point you brought up about the I I once I got involved in nonprofit I realized that it really ain't it the only difference between nonprofit and the corporate world is that the stakeholders are not stockholders it's the feds so we just gonna do whatever we got to do to put on a good show for the feds we couldn't care less about and so that's what turned me off to that so then that made me take on the mentality of I literally have to do it myself you know what I mean I literally have to crowdfund myself to do it and to make it happen and to make it work because and I think that that's part of the issue that a lot of people who do come from that environment feel like is that just if just enough of us can get out then we'll be good but I want to reverse that word because that get out once again that's part of the problem to get it out right that's that's the thing it's it's not getting out ofour and brour so that we to get out we just make iten right where we at but but but then okay but to to that and I'm Messiah you talk because I feel like you g said the thing yeah there is also an element of the black people that do do that instead of leaving I think of the young dols you know what I mean like and yeah and they get killed or something happens to them and people have the attitude well what the [ __ ] did you were you doing staying there right yeah well well it's only the [ __ ] sorry go ahead but it's it's we it's only we the it's the only [ __ ] that stay if you notice we all have a similar pedig the only dudes who decide to stay in the trenches that they came from after acing resource said resource all of us are what ex-criminals people who've had high stake situations where death does not scare us right like that's the only type of dudes that you ever see come back and stand in the center of the neighborhood and try to build something and then of course we're proving you know we get clipped um that's just how it goes um but I'm say I was like we we so the one thing that I that you know maybe I I do have a problem with like is that you know black people don't and I know money's tight but black people don't financially support these black institutions that are in the community that are trying to do to to do good and there are a lot of them there's so so many brothers and sisters out here who are are are trying their best and trying to to do it and what people don't understand is that you still you still got to pay bills like just because you believe and and you want to work for a better Society doesn't mean you don't have rent doesn't mean you don't need health insurance doesn't mean you don't have a car no and so if we want people who do these jobs are willing to take less but no one's going to do this job if they can't survive and and what we as our community we got to understand is that we have to financially if you have ility I understand right I I know so many people like I I understand right because you know I deal with it but I but I'm saying if you're able to if you're capable you you you have to be one of the people who are who are reaching out and helping out these local nonprofit communities that nonprofits that are ran by the people in the community ran by people who come from the community the people who fund and I think we kind of know like you know we talk about the white people who fund nonprofits are not funding black Le nonprofit black women L nonprofits they're not funding a nonprofit Le by someone who comes from the ghetto they're not they're not funding a nonprofit or someone who comes from the hood the the you said what who they funding so there's a lots of nonprofits I mean you know uh the N some of these nonprofits like nonprofit my dad shair the board for like you know you have a $30 million annually annual budget right that's like that's considered a midsize nonprofit some these nonprofits have $100 million $120 million annual operating budget I mean they are getting heavy donations right and they're taking that $100 million do every year and they're doing whatever programs or whatever they're doing with that that's going to be funded by usually you know it's going to be white Executives white you know corporate people yeah yeah people who come in who donate whatever and so we if if we want our institutions to have that same impact to have those programs we have to provide people the opportunity to do this for a living and to do it for a living they they got to you have to pay bills I mean it's just so that's the only thing I push back because not not you guys obviously but it's like some people had to like oh why you need to get paid why I need to get paid like what so so now do that's the infrastructure that little B Wasing the real infrastructure is being able to provide for people like oh Reena you Bill to to do the to be able to not be because that's why we end up um cherry-picked by the system itself right because it's surv I keep some black guys who s up it it's they're broke people people won't tell you look let's like some we got to have a real conversation that you know because everyone after like everyone got money some people some people broke and it's it's a tough call look I I that's why as I get older like I understand I don't I don't agree with it but I understand it because you know so many people try to do the progressive they try to do the good things and they and they're and they're broke they got no money you know they can't pay the rent they can't pay the bills they're struggling huge credit card debt you know you know can't pay electricity and it's like oh oh you seem to have some skills I'll pay you uh you know $800,000 $150,000 to to go to go you know tell this Banker that he needs more money from the Federal government I I I left campaigning to drive a forklift for four years cuz it wasn't paying me so it's real it's real I mean that is why I think that's why it's like hard to talk about any of this stuff without talking about anti- capitalism and capitalism because it's like so much of the so and going to your point Bill about like a hyper individualist individualistic culture so much of like why the people who have the most capacity to kind of reimagine this world and fix these problems haven't been able to do so is because they're busy working with 16 jobs to try to survive that's why I brought up hash black Excellence because that is black people's belief black people are very invested in capitalism and this idea that like we'll be successful if more of us just be in the positions that they're in if more of us acquire mouth if more of us have business owners more of of us is this so like innately that's what I'm I think is like the fundamental underpinning like the problem everything right is like when you try and challenge black people a black Authority or the black Representatives that we do have that are very much so like aggressively holding up the status quo or overp policing us or taking resources from us it's black people who believe in this like black excellence and this you know what I mean even though they're the ones most situated not to be able to achieve it because of these systemic issues expence thing I want to be educated on that too this this kind of buzz just like it really let me know hold on but it is what lets me know know that were're different kind of negroes this when like Malcolm wasn't like a big inag fan and I knew and I knew what he was because the fact question M's like I don't be hearing that all the time what's that Black Excellence meanwhile every black person that I know on law school black Excellence black Excellence it's it's hashtagged on every gra black graduation picture there is it's the idea that like in individual black achievement is is like black black achieving at a significant High ree is a solution to the problems facing the black community I look I think symb goes hands in hand with representation matters oh I hate that too and by the way look I like symbols too I like pictures and shapes as well but all like you all like symbols I mean like like you you feel good but it's like it's not really doing anything but you feel good about it like it makes you like you get PR you're proud right you're proud to see it like you know you you someone like you is is is there maybe not like you per se but like you know like close or know hold on now I think the people furthest away from black Excellence don't un because they don't they're the furthest away from it they don't see how ineffective it really is an application to recognize that it won't save us at all and those closest to it are benefiting from it personally and recognize how difficult it is to actually do anything for the rest of black people and they abort the mission do third I'm a third because because you know I'm a Storyteller so I realize the importance of stories and symbols they they're very important to marketing they're extremely important to marketing I do not think that they're important to problem solving right they're just like they just they give you a good little sheen on the car but they're not gonna get you there right so for my thing is like I ain't got no problem with symbology and [ __ ] I do think that there's a problem when symbology overtakes actual solution because then that then it becomes non effective but has right that's like what Derrik Bell talked about that um in in faces at the bottom of well Derk and by the way that you know you know I'll be mad at these symbolic [ __ ] too I'm simply saying you know you know there's a reason that that it works so well in marketing and and I think that if if like you know me I hate symbolic [ __ ] that's part of my even in my own profession I get mad at the people who look shiny and look like they got something going on and speak for Blackness and whenever it's convenient but then never around when it's really going down you know what I mean like I I listen I I my IR is expressed to O offline all the time um but I wouldn't do away with all of them I keep them I just don't want them in control of [ __ ] I don't want them running anything you're the mascot we they do but they do but that's thing but they do because because while you might recognize it as a symbol the things that are recognized as symbols the people that are clinging to them do not see them as symbols they see them as substantive things that really matter like there there a lot of black people [ __ ] most of black people who felt like you know Obama being president it means so much so much I know that we not tou not touching you you get in trouble no that's what I OB talking I'm sorry I stop talking Obama talk about Obama I do no no we can use you as do I got too many aunties and uncles that I need to be wary of I'mma keep my I learned my lesson the hard way hey look I'm GNA be real with you I'm I'm pretending like I'm scary on this fallone call because I'm the first I'm a guest but in real life it's [ __ ] all that [ __ ] to be completely honest like drone strikes all the [ __ ] not fixing actual [ __ ] not having policies that are really meant for us like don't get me started like I don't even be mad at OB I'm not mad at Obama or anything I just and I don't think any I'm not saying that I think people should be I just think is it's the difference between not being mad at somebody but also thinking somebody somebody's personal success or an achievement or something that might be symbolic and be great I think black people are allowed to appreciate that receive the moment and and hold the Obamas and whatever esteem they want but it's the mistake of thinking it me and [ __ ] for the rest of us but it's ego reflection like we have the like people thirst for hope it's and and the symbol gives them that because it makes them see themselves in that position people kind of hopeless too I mean it's it's it's tough it's tough sometimes sometimes you just it's like it's just negativity negativity negativity and you just want something positive and you know it's like okay I know I know all these things but for right now I just want to see you know like they just want to see a nice family you know nice you know respectable black family in the white house that's just you know you know doing their thing and representing the country great you know I like I don't I don't really care what politics they do I that's that's all I care and I don't think any of us it right because like for the criticism that we have for like black Excellence like there's black girl magic we love that black boy joy and all of those things they have their meaning they do have their like there is something legitimate to like black man posting black man being excited being a community having friends and po some black boy Joy like that is something that has meaningful I think meaningful um um results so I don't think all these things are meaningless I think it's just about when I think black excellence in in particular is harmful like like I think I can I think everything everything in moderation my baby everything I think to me the problem it's a it's a theory of change that I disagree with right that like dates back through Black Liberation from jump which is like they used to call uplift which was the idea that like if we prove to white people that we're not Savages then we will get equality so it's like it's that's your theory of change that's fine I have not found that to be true and so I think think black Excellence is great it's great to be like oh yeah these black people are doing dope [ __ ] like o was saying or black boy Joy I think when it's a when it becomes a problem for me is when it veers into like the solution it's continually trying to um uplift a certain type of respectful black person and and say that that a is all black people and B if we can prove that that's all black people then we're going to be free because I just don't believe well as a budding cyst symbol myself right um you know my complaints to O are often very much so that deep right because even who we choose to be our black stars to be our black representatives in sports media whatever Communications which is the largest right expression of of the pamphlet for what what should be the problem um we end up getting these very safe Negroes and you know it goes down to even casting it goes down to even even like who's chosen to be in the role from the from the dribble and she knows I've been in here trying she knows I'm I'm I'm kick everything over kind of [ __ ] so she she spends a lot of time telling me Malcolm shut up and get that get get in there right because the hope is that someone who gets blessed with the magical designation of Coronation of of negro that is that is allowed in these spaces your whole jug is to both you're supposed to be I hate black the The Spook that that by the doorstep you're supposed to be siphoning from these from these people and from these systems to bring back to the real [ __ ] to properly organize and distribute and and accelerate um and I think that that I really you can't do that when everybody don't read when everybody think they they just glad to be in the position they want to keep on hold on to the position don't want to be educated because how magical of a moment truly magical how excellent would it have been for Eric to listen to O right for the mayor to listen to all be like damn actually I might have been [ __ ] up out here in these streets what can we actually what do you see or what kind of initiatives can we Implement in my small little time left in this [ __ ] can hopefully revise some of the [ __ ] that I've been off right that would have been magical to me that would have been excellent to me um but them Negroes just want to hold the [ __ ] baton for as long as they can and I I I you're right I do agree with you that that's some [ __ ] um we just got to stop buying their [ __ ] and voting for them and going to their movies and watching their we also celebrate people who exploit the their own their own Community right and so so our heroes a lot of our heroes in the community are people who have gotten to where they are because they've you know um exploited other members of their same community and so and so and so we so we're looking at it in terms of when we see people when they're talking about this capitalism it's a capitalism built on and I'm not I think all capitalism too you could make an argument that all capitalism is to se that this but I think there is a difference between like you just Mom and Pop small business owner which technically is capitalism but you're just you're just you know selling a product and you're doing something versus I'm going to make my money by you know by exploiting you and by making sure like I'm GNA I'm going to do real estate and I'm going to have make sure you're in a slum and I'm gonna and I'm G to use the laws against you and I'm gonna keep going keep getting new people in the apartment at and I'm not going to make any repairs I'm not going to make any Renovations and I'm going to have you you know suffering inside there and then if you complain I'm going to kick you out I'll bring somebody else in and I and I did that all over the place and guess what I'm I'm a huge millionaire and everyone's like oh this guy we I want to be like him and it's like well if if you're like him like people like him are the people that are do actively doing things that are hurting and destroying the community and so and so that's we're celebrating the figures that are doing the things where allegedly need to dismantle yeah yeah so so it becomes more difficult because if you're hero is person and and you know like Diddy was the same way I mean Diddy Diddy's not going to get cancelled for exploiting black artists for 30 years right you know he's not going to get even though I mean he's economically exploited so many people right and again he does deserve to be Kel for what for what he's done I'm not saying he has but I'm saying that the fact that he that everyone knows that he's been screwed over so many artists and that's his public knowledge and nobody cares you know what I mean like like so he's still a hero in the community even though every all the artists all the people who work with him has said he screwed me over he screwed me over he screwed me over he screwed me over you hear because we don't see that as bad because it's perfectly acceptable to black people to exchange black people in favor of like monetary or success because again peace and black Excellence is like that's what we we it's like normalizing the innate investment we have in capitalism is that we think it's okay and it's right what we these billionaires and these people do to get there that's what you got to do that's what it is and it's just us trying to do it and so we excuse that we have and it shows how much like it shows a lack of a lack of uh belief in our own worth the fact that we're okay with that like that that was all right the fact to messiah's point it's like that was okay that Diddy was this and we all knew this and we all knew this and we never no one the community never decided it was a problem like we gonna rise up against them but now that these things happen well we have a low Bar for our deities you know right low we have a low Bar for our deities because but once again it goes back to maslo maso's hierarchy of needs because it's just so difficult to just get anything and get anywhere we celebrate the moment anybody got it and the thing is the people ain't gonna change they like that so my my question is always well how do we compete because Master P was doing right by everybody at first at first I don't know what the new [ __ ] is because you know apparently him and Jess be arguing but I know that fundamentally nine times out of 10 you know he was heralded for doing right masterp one doing right by everybody Master P first started first of all it was Master P's wife her family had the rec had a record store and they had the connections and she started it she's the one who started up no limit she was originally rapping I thought his Grandad died and money no it was his his wife it was his wife his wife and his family gave the capital to start all that [ __ ] and Master P been dragging out they've been having like I will link the video in the description box I will link the video in the description box I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm tell verified yes they took got that cereal they just dropped that cereal stoop you heard about that yes see see this the problem we can't have nobody see this is what the problem is I got you took it I don't okay [ __ ] take him but Master we can't have Bout It Bout it but you know what it is there's a lot of listen it's not that we can't have anything it's that the black people that really be for black people that really care about the state of black people in community we think they're annoying we sick we we make them into jokes you know T this we we we Embrace anti-intellectualism we want them to shut the [ __ ] up we say they making everything too serious why everything got to be that deep blah blah blah so it's not that we can't have anything it's that we don't want be better with your marketing be better with your marketing I agree I agree with 100% I agree 100% in terms of like like if you think about what the right does they got they got these think tanks they have these like they will like they will they will practice these terms and these phrases and they will put them in front of an audience and they say how does this perform and they'll get another audience how does this perform we and I I say a good way because like we're genuine we're sincere we're about like honest expression and so we're not trying to like we're not trying to sell people on something we're just going to be honestly say what it is but the reality is that this is America and that you know you got you got to know how package ideas in a way that's going be more efficient and try to get across and that's my favorite with your with your with your YouTube I was gonna say to somebody who's like more explicitly in that work in general we do try to message and we do it there it isn't that there that doesn't exist on the left on that side of the spectrum of people trying to message and package and be more like intentional where I'm really like this is a stronger way to talk about this versus this the difference is on the on the other side it's easy for them to be United on one band One sound one message because they don't have a genuine they don't care about the stuff it's like white supremacy and whatever the general you know they can all rally around that and they know they're not bought in what happens on our side is like one not only is there a massive difference of opinion you know what I mean across the board but the people in charge of who when the messaging gets out isn't me it's the white liberals and the white leftists who hold the money and again they pick some avatars but if the avatars are dependent on their money and their job and their income and all this stuff for for usability we don't always get to choose the winning message like even sometimes like a lot of times I I I help support movements and local organizers and stuff like this all around the country and people will make their entire campaigns like they do their entire organizing or whatever advocacy thing that they're doing for however long no one calls me I don't hear [ __ ] about it I don't know nothing about it they decide that they know what is a good message even though they are not The Messengers they don't have the vehicle to get the message out they have no proof that they can message well but they will come to you the actual messenger at the n hour to try to get you to to Parrot their message rather than let you message it you know what I mean and so and then they're shocked that their [ __ ] isn't successful in one day of a shitty ass message that nobody who actually is able to do that cosign so you know a big part of it is that the the white folks on the left uh don't want to the diff a big part of the reason why there's such a big difference is that the white folks on the left don't want to be real about the fact that they part of the problem the folks racist they just they just saying let me get some crumbs from table they don't they don't want to hear all of that they you know they just want to hear you know Marx and Hegel and all that other garbage they don't want to hear you know a [ __ ] tell them about [ __ ] issues and say y'all is the problem they don't want to hear that they just think oh well because I'm listening you understand they just want to be padded on the back you know for just giving you the space but then they don't really want to you know take and absorb the message because then that forces them to have to you know deal with some demons that they got going on internally again the folks on the right they don't gota worry about that cuz they cuz you know they tokens have already said you know oh uh boss you ain't gotta worry you know you know they don't got to worry about that over here we ain't playing that you know I mean either you GNA be down for real or I ain't getting down with you at all and they don't want to hear that they just want to hear you know thank you thank you for giving me a platform and that ain't good enough that the the uh the centrifugal force of collective conservativism is far stronger than what y'all got it is there's no you can't you can't sell out on the right the question is like everyone on the right is a sellout like it's just the question is how much what's the number you know what I mean well I guess they sold in depend depending on like whether you need the money or not you sold in or sold out but I guess the question is like everyone's for sale like they they and they're open about it they are open about oh you want me to push this right wi stuff you know what's was Crowder getting like 30 I mean like the number the numbers they're getting on the right is insane it does make you it does make you like like these guys have no Talent no ability and they just just out here making $30 million a year is about nonsense every day on YouTube and and it's crazy so so so it's like the amount of money that they're getting and they'll be open about like I'm not going to spread anything until you come up with that $20 million check you know but if if you're elti and you say that people are G to be like and I I actually agree with that principle because I don't think you should be debating a$2 billion check but the point is that on the left you know there well I mean who's because who's paying you who's paying you the check who's it for no I don't that's the problem I don't give a [ __ ] how big the check is where's it going I we gotta be honest that there's no there's no work like you got to be paid a reasonable value for what you do you know you're only going to be paid that type of money no you don't well marke I but you're only gonna be paid that type of money if you're if if you're trying to go over on people No One's Gonna Pay you $30 million to tell people the truth I mean you got you got you got to be good at like you got a lie to people to get $30 million and even if they did even if they did black people would then distrust them because when black people like when black people are like Messengers or they do this work or they do good work or they do this kind of advocacy or all this or whatever if they're successful at it if they're successful at it and that comes with any kind of notoriety or money or opportunity immediately black people have this energy and people in general but we're talking about people in our community this energy that is like it's no longer sincere or Genuine you should be doing this for free you should be struggling it's this idea that like your genuiness is thing about the nonprofit how God for you know like you out here saying like oh I'm I need my bills PID they're like oh well this you're doing the work you shouldn't have to worry about money why you talking about money you should be doing the work well they use that dirty word capitalism in that moment yeah when you when they don't want to pay you money when you you have bills to pay you're a capitalist right when I was like I gotta I'm not talking about trying to get rich over I'm just saying that like I I got bills and I'm trying I'm trying to do the work and I can't do both I can I can go do something else and get some money or I can do the work but you know if you want this to work then you know come up with some cash and I and I hate to say that like it sounds so bad when you say that as I'm the left and I'm like bro you can't you look this is real life this is real life you have people don't understand coming out of law school I like and I was in a better position than Ms Ms became a public defender before years before me and but when I came out of law school the the salary that I had before you get admitted to the bar my salary was $53,000 I think 53 or50 $ 44,000 as a public defender repres and and my rent so my paycheck would be $1,500 and my rent is $1,300 in New York City yeah as an attorney as somebody who done gone through undergrad law school took the bar pass the bar and you're in the most expensive place you have $200 after you pay your rent like you can't even what the [ __ ] that's not even that's not even cover your monthly Metro pass like so and you get an incremental like that's what it C like that's what you make when you decide you want to do things like directly in service and that's what people don't get like it's very easy for people to [ __ ] on those that need to make money you know what I mean or or try to make money through through it or become successful or pivot but it's like what are you going to do because at the end of the day it it'll put put you in the same place in the same way we originally said the black people who are most live these experiences cannot afford to be the ones doing taking these jobs and stuff like you said it's the tax of trying to help your community trying to get out and all the other different bills and burdens and also being poor structurally keeps you out of it because like even as somebody who like my parents my like I'm not somebody I would say I come from a deep a very upper middle class in the Bahamas life experience and still like just to get admitted to the bar they were on my head about what bill I owed and what Collections and I had to clear all these things up so what happens to the person who is in much more debt than me much more collections that their mom was in their daddy was in all these things become things you have to explain before they even have you admitted so then you end up in the same position as like the original group of people who were boxed out of it because now you're working a job that you cannot pay you to live in survive to do it and then that impacts you and that also impacts your representation and the kind of advocacy you can do for black people because like there's so only it's only so much you can do for for if you're trying to advocate for the community and you and the community are like a half off in terms of your living circumstances you know what I mean it's like my broke too like none of us none of us got any money like is there any way we can do something to get some bills pass so we can start so we can start improving people's lives cuz like like I'm right there with them you know what I'm saying I I was I was I was in the hood when I when I first started as a p that's why I lived at I see my clients on the way to work it was you know I was in the basement for years in the living in basement apartment for years that that still brings me to you know um the vetting process for who we choose as our leaders as our speakers as our Advocates who we put in position where the money goes where it's distributed I genuinely believe that structured is needed for our movement and I and I genuinely believe that better discernment is needed for who's going to lead it and an agreeance on is determined on what you believe in and if the community believes in all the tenants that are oppressing them like even if you it's like what the standard by like the standard with which they're choosing people you see what I'm saying like they're exercising the discernment they have it's not like they're not making the choices that they think makees sense to them and what but it's based on what they value is a reason why it's not going to be some some organizer a activist or civil rights attorney or public defender or whoever that the community celebrates but they are going to go celebrate whatever the [ __ ] Rapa that's really rich you know what I mean that's but that's why I think the mark That's why I think that public um public consent are they really rich though but that's that's a differentation no I think no I think it's I think it's the I think listen you know we have to be able to understand that that that public consent can be manufactured I with you I think this conversations are important though because I think like we don't we have to like form we have to like get our get our stuff together and then kind of branch that out to the community and and kind of just like but we don't even talk to each other because I understand everyone's kind of like trying to do their thing and trying to survive and and so like we don't really take the time A lot of times just like hey man like and also we you know that's that support is necessary too I think whenever you when you do do the work and you're and you're in involved in the type of stuff it's it's a lot it's stressful I mean leg it's way more wor way worse anything that I that I experience you know mean this just be D you boyfriend of 100 th000 people you know you know and and Americans are I look like that's amazing I appreciate her she's so valuable to the movement and and God bless her but we also got to support that because a lot of people don't understand that like me like I I do I do I want to to to have to get that typ a blowback person no I'll just do my job like it's so so you appreciate people who do it but you also got to be honest with yourself like yo like it's a lot it's a lot to put up with so you provide that support and you provide that um assistance because you understand that people are kind of like taking the brunt of these attacks uh and and some of these attacks are just absolutely ridiculous but that's why we appreciate platforms like this and and because of people like her and like y'all coming together you know you do some good out here I just make videos on YouTube I just make videos and raise and raise a couple of dollars now then iisten them YouTube [ __ ] making a be over there soon so I look I'm just saying y'all y'all the new you know what I'm saying like y'all the new the new crop y'all the new the new voices and the new vision and I and and I and we spent a lot of time critiquing but I do want to spend just as much time celebrating even the young ladies that that that have that have had to go immani and and Reena just like all of y'all are this is the work this is a part of the work I know sometimes people like oh y'all just talking in a vacuum of ideas that you already believe like no because I've I've left here with a broader understanding of certain things I've got to you know get on my little so boox and be like I think we need to Market better we need better marketing tired of this y'all gotta get just as good as ice spice this is time you know you know and because that's I I don't hear that's my addition to the conversation and being and being as a budding symbols as all of us are budding symbols because what media deemed as a focal point for people's attention is changing every day whether it's YouTube Tik Tok you know whatever anybody can end up at the front of the line now then then it is important that we are seasoned with these viewpoints their stances what they mean why they mean what they mean so that when a [ __ ] like me get asked to speak some somewhere right I can go in there and even if we don't agree there's a general point that we understand that we need to stay on which is Hey listen this [ __ ] ain't working it need to change specifically point a point B Point C how do I know there someone far more educated than me to tell me if she know also that it's not an attack right I mean the the the goal the all our goal is to like materially improve the condition of our community like we just want people's lives to be better so if if if if if like what we're doing isn't working it's not cuz you're not good like it's because we all have to try throw some darts at the wall and and we all gotta try to hit before we can hit that Bullseye we have to we all got to try it and I think sometimes look it's like anything you know ego gets involved what I will say like I even on YouTube just watch it it's it's too much like you know someone name dropping this and someone someone said that and someone said this and so and and like I don't I think substantive critiques are important that's not what you know saying but gossiping doesn't help anybody you know like again I don't know bro I don't know bro that marketing that marketing you see you [ __ ] up that marketing if if you try to get views you try to get views yeah it's a good way to get views I'm just saying like in terms of like you you try to move in Progressive forward like say substantive critique is important and and introspection is important but just being like you know you know like look this person ain't [ __ ] you know look at that they you know like you're right I I I I don't agree but 5050 Cent all is doing is more money I saying like I mean I Bean like no no no I'm saying no no I'm no no I'm not talking about I'm not talking about the right look at look at what o did to to to the to the mayor that's you about that may I understand I agree with that but I don't consider that gossip though because I that's that's a that's a you know intellectual interview yeah it's it's it's only controversial because no one else does it it's not but it should be controversial because all you're doing is asking your elected official holding them aable for what they're not doing to the Comm for the community so substantiative controversy we can agree Asar correct
