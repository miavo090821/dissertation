Her work has been cited as the source for the claim by publications as diverse as The Conversation, Snopes and Pew Research Center.\n\n“In reality, about 11% of all serious crimes result in an arrest, and about 2% end in a conviction,\"  Baughman wrote in Snopes, \"the number of people police hold accountable for crimes — what I call the 'criminal accountability' rate — is very low,” \n\nI say we need to at least overhaul the police.  If any other service provider had a 2% success rate they would've been cancelled.",

    "text": "As a black Marxist Leninist, I am of notion that the police only have two fundamental functions. 1. To protect private property and capital 2. To maintain the the capitalist/imperialist/white supremacist hierarchy. The first purpose the police served within the construction of America and liberalism was to maintain the slave the state by capturing run away slaves. That essential function hasn’t changed all that much, it just goes by different names be it under tough on crime/broken window policies, the crime bill, or the war on drugs. The police also maintain white supremacist imperialist power structures overseas. Far right US backed dictators such as Pinochet and Batista were trained in American police departments. This is just a small sample of my impromptu thesis. The police under the current institution and existential conditions cannot be reformed or changed. That is a delusion of bourgeois liberals who actually profit off the existing hegemony and counterintuitive to what reactionaries expect out the the police institution and the police state which is to protect private property/finance capital and maintain white supremacist hegemony/hierarchy",

A majority ruled that the individual mandate was constitutional, but a majority ruled that the Medicaid expansion was unconstitutional.\n\nThe result of the latter was that states had to opt into a Medicaid expansion to get federal funds for it. Predictably, multiple Republican-controlled states refused to do the Medicaid expansion.\n\nI thought this was important to bring up since I know the discussion has come up before that a lot of times, we don’t understand how our state and local governments impede or embrace federal policies that may make measurable differences (both positive and negative) in people’s lives. A more recent example of this is how multiple Republican-controlled states have refused to accept recent federal funds to aid with combatting child hunger.\n\nAnd because it’s probably necessary to say this, no, I’m not shilling for Democrats.

You can never make generalizations like that. \n\nI strongly believe that your observation bias is a result of the people in charge of hiring in that department wanting a specific type of soldier to turn into a cop. \n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum the soldiers I served with lean towards either constitutionalist or if it's not a capital crime it's not worth the paperwork. \n\nTo be clear the constitutionalists are die-hards for freedom of speech, right to film (the police), right to bear arms, right to privacy, property and person. Basically the opposite of what a questionable department would want in a future hire. \n\nTo piggyback off of Olay around 29:29 the militaristic ex-military cops you witnessed are functioning exactly as they were hired to act.",

        "text": "@noneofya9081  Yes, we are both suffering from observational biases. I thought that was clear when I explained it. I'm not trying to insult you, but I was reinforcing my point: people are people they come in good and bad flavors. \n\nThe ex-military cops you observed are the way that they are because they were hired for that purpose. The military veterans I observed were the way that they were because the ones that are like the people you described are almost always filtered out. \n\nWhat I didn't tell you was I served in the Special Operations community. Filtering out extremists and people with racial biases is a big part of the selection and qualification process. It's taken a step further when the soldiers are assigned to a unit. Leadership are required to \"retrain\" or remove any racially biased people from operations. They end up on the administrative support teams or kicked out of SpecOps all together.\n\n^^That's my point... It's not that there's a problem with ex-military cops. There is a problem with police leadership specifically seeking out \"door kickers\" with a certain attitude.",

    "text": "what a great convo. I grew up the poorest jew on the outside of a white christian suburb, when I moved to a bigger city with more black people I saw right away the way that poverty is used in conjunction with racism in policing. I was trespassing and being a hooligan and doing weird shit in that white town, because I didn’t want to be home I didn’t have things to do, and I was fine. I went to a rich black friends place and we did that sort of stuff and  we got some weird looks but it was fine. but the moment we went to the wrong neighborhood I could feel the eyes on us, i saw the patrol cars and i felt a piece of that fear and I knew I had to behave or something awful could happen because of my friends skin color. \n\nour communities are set up to hide all of that, to naturalize the bullshit everyone puts up with and hide the hypocrisies. the fact that I got to see those different sides is a aberration. unless you are able to be immersed in both sides, it’s really hard to convey how weaponized classism is against poc and how weaponized racism is against all poor people. both the poor as dirt white racist hick, and the classist rich black pick-me, are being tricked into putting their boot on their own neck. those separations need to come down in order for it to click for a lot of people. racism and classism are part of the same system and both reinforce each other so both need to be tackled for any real liberation to happen, otherwise you end up reinventing the same bullshit",

As for the police, I think I huge part of the problem is that American police receive very little training.  Anyone who is given a gun and told to be in control of the situation without good training is gonna kill someone.  It takes a lot of training to have the confidence to take control of a situation without hurting anyone.  And of course, its not the rich who are suffering the consequences of poor police training, so they don't feel like paying for it.  So I'd like to suggest the possibility that it might be less about racism and more about the wealthy not wanting to pay taxes because they aren't seeing the consequences of poor training.  The police for their part, would enjoy getting the opportunity to be better trained.",

Through the London Metropolitan Police Act seven years later, Britain established a local police force that was intentionally different from the military and whose mission was focused on prevention of crime rather than repression of disorder. These models became major influences on the development of policing in the United States in the 1840s. The Royal Irish Constabulary model is used to police non-whites and their neighbourhoods while Met (community) policing is used for whites and white areas.",
