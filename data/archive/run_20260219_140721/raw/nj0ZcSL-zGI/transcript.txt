a surprise attack Saturday by Hamas left dozens dead in Israel Gaza militants launched thousands of rockets a month of Relentless bombing has decimated the territory this is the chaotic aftermath of an Israeli air strike on the maazi refugee camp the bodies of more than 100 Palestinians who died at shifa and B hanon hospitals have been buried in a M grave in Kanan Yunis and Southern Gaza bodies have been stuck at the hospitals for several days as the Israeli Army refused to allow them to be moved the Gaza Health Ministry says 14,1 128 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli [Music] attacks on October 7th 2023 Hamas launched an attack that killed 1,400 people since then the Israeli government has killed over 10,000 Palestinian people at least 47% of whom were children at least 1,270 children are missing and assumed to be under rubble and at least 41 journalists have been killed 36 of whom are Palestinian but this conflict does not begin with Hamas or on October 7th in 1948 the United Nations defined genocide as quote any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy in whole or in part a national ethnic racial or religious group as such killing members of the group causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of Life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part imposing measures intended to prevent births from within that group and forcibly transferring Children of the group to another group make no mistake about it we are witnessing the genocide of the Palestinian people in the Bahamas we have a saying a liar is a thief and a thief is a murderer a liar is a thief and a thief is a murderer it's something I've said my entire life without ever considering its Origins how far back it must go what a colonized people must have seen must live with daily to regularly say a liar is a thief and a thief is a murderer now I find myself wondering who the first Beaman was to say it was it the first ARX slaughtered or the last one enslaved because colonized people know all too well that before you are murdered before you have your land culture and resources stolen you were lied to and about by the people who intend to Rob and kill you and it doesn't happen once it happens in perpetuity so that you experience theft and murders that began as a century before you even came into this world Palestinian people know that Britain a colonizer that I a bamian and citizen of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas knows all too well took control of Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire during the Great War from 1917 to 1919 Britain not the Palestinian people then ruled Palestine under a League of Nations mandate that established that Britain was committed to establishing a national home for Jewish people in Palestine all of the world had already been con ConEd and divided by Colonial Powers there was no else in the world left to be conquered or divided by Colonial Powers this is the time when Zionism comes to rise Zionism comes to look for a state when everywhere else in the world is already dominated thus in order for Mr Herzel to get a country for Zionist what he did was to attach himself to imperialism British imperialism in this case The Legal Foundation of the state of Israel is what is known as the bow for declaration this de aration was issued in 1917 a man in the government of Britain named balur wrote a paper and promised the Jews a national home the national home he promised them was an area which Britain was colonizing Palestine Palestine didn't belong to the British just like Ireland doesn't belong to the British even though they have troops there but here these British imperialists gave signed a note and gave it to the Jews and they accepted it where is the morality for this if you say that Israel belongs to you then you don't go to a thief to get Israel you go and take it once you go to an immoral immoral being such as British imperialism and this is the basis for you getting the land then clearly here those who are truly Liberation Fighters must question this Palestinian people Fe displacement and engaged in non-violent protest in 1939 Britain anticipating another war in Europe and wanting the support of the Arabs States who wanted their freedoms announced that the Jewish National home had been fulfilled and that they would cap the Jewish migration in Palestine at 75,000 over the next 5 years while they came up with a plan for the Palestinian people to govern themselves and become independent what happened instead was World War II Jewish people became the victims of one of the greatest atrocities in human history the Holocaust and as a result Jewish people needed somewhere to go they needed a safe haven they decided to migrate to Palestine the problem however is that Palestine was already occupied by the Palestinian people this is what Palestine looked like in 1946 as you can see there were Jewish people already living in Palestine with the Palestinian people the problem is that the Israeli government didn't and doesn't want to live with Palestinian people they wanted to they want to they did and they do expel Palestinians from the land the Israeli Defense Force was founded on May 26 1948 as a military this is what Palestine looked like by 1949 this is what it looks like today the conflict in Gaza did not begin on October 7th the Palestinian people have been victims of violence and settler colonialism for generations and generations they have been resisting for generations and generations at least 2,544 Palestinians have been killed since the year 2000 the Jewish people have been persecuted throughout history and that persecution persist today there is a very long and deep and intense and Real History of anti-Semitism not just in this country but around the world you go back hundreds of years you go back thousands of years and you see that the hatred of Jewish people is something that unfortunately has not only not wavered but in some ways increased at various moments in history and certainly at this moment we see another Spike so I think that the concern about anti-Semitism is very real and I think the mixing of anti-zionism with anti-Semitism creates a space where people who legitimately have a critique of Israel as a state as a government are being conflated with people who hate Jews because they're Jewish and I think that we can't allow those things to mix but we have to be resolved to fight both of them simultaneous L that is to say we can't ignore anti-Semitism but one oppression does not negate another having experienced oppression does not give you the excuse to oppress another uh we also can't allow our fear of being called anti-semitic to stop us from challenging the occupation of the West Bank or The Siege on Gaza or a largely illiberal Israeli government that's moving more and more to the right every week every month every election cycle we got to be able to do all those things at once and that is something that thousand thousands and thousands of Jewish people all around the world and right here in America have been saying as they protest call for peace denounce sanism and stand in solidarity with the Palestinian people uh I'm Jewish I'm Israeli my parents were the only survivors of their families from the Holocaust they both survived aitz I'm not going to support genocide am I I'm here with maybe a thousand others a lot of us Jews but we are here to protest the genocide that is happening in our name and they're getting arrested for it which is both an example of the danger and illogical silliness that comes with conflating anti-Semitism and anti-zionism as well as it demonstrates the danger and power of an American police state I wholeheartedly believe that colonization is an evil that should make the most fervent of Believers question whether there is a God and I'm not privileged in many ways but I believe that the Gen side that we are witnessing requires that I a person who can speak without fear of losing my life speak plainly the Palestinian people have continuously been robbed of autonomy Liberation and Humanity you know I I begin from the place of saying no matter who we are um no matter what the issue is we got to begin from a place of Justice we got to ask the question you know what what does Justice require and we have to we have a duty to speak out on behalf of of of everybody who is catching hell for me that means that we speak out against anti-Semitism it means we speak out against islamophobia we speak out against transphobia we speak out against police violence we we speak we speak out against all the things and we can't allow there to be an exception for any issue the stakes of the issue the political danger of the issue May shape how we organize or how we speak and and it may shape our tactics they shouldn't Shake our resolve um to do the right thing zoral Hurston warned us that if you're silent about your pain they'll kill you and say you enjoyed it recently I've been feeling like we're living the consequences of a more dangerous iteration of that quote that our silence to the Palestinians pain is what Ena the Israeli government to kill them and expect us to enjoy it as generations of Palestinian people are wiped out I know that a government doesn't just wake up one day confident enough to genocide a people on the world stage with billions of people watching without having first been given indication by those people or their representatives that we would applaud or at the very least close our eyes to it and indicated we did each and every time the US government annually supported to Aid Israel's militarized occupation of Palestine each and every time we stayed quiet while someone was fired or punished for speaking up for Palestinian Liberation each time that we let our fear of being erroneously labeled an anti-semite prevent us from speaking up each time we refuse to challenge the intentional conflation of anti-Semitism and anti-zionism if I'm critiquing the state and it's a Jewish State then it can very easily be seen as critiquing the Jewish State because it's Jewish which would be anti-semitic right if if I approve of a state except for the fact that it's Jewish in character that would be a problem but the critique of the Jewish state is not because it's Jewish I have a similar critique of um every state that not a state of all of its citizens I have a a critique of religious governments I have like Islamic republics I have a critique of secular governments like the Israeli government is not a religious State per se it's a secular government secular Democratic state but everyone doesn't have the same rights and access despite the fact that they say that they do that's the criticism but it's very easy to conflate those two things and again part of the the the project of political Zionism has been to conflate those two things so that it's so it's not a coincidence it's not like um it's not a bad faith interpretation uh on the behalf of critics rather it is that there's a movement of Jewish nationalism into historic Palestine and the national identity is not Israeli it's Jewish right you we when you when you have an israeli's passport you your your national identity is is Jewish or Arab or Drews so again so Jewish isn't just a religious identity and it's not just an ethnic identity right it's it's it's it's an ethn national identity so all of these factors make it create a context where you can have a legitimate critique of the Israeli government and still wrongly be viewed as as being critical of the Jewish State because it's Jewish or of Jewish people because they're Jewish um and those conflations make it very very challenging but please make no mistake about this anti-Semitism is real and it's a function of white supremacy and we need to call that out explicitly now more than ever Follow Me Chris Rock has an old joke from his standup the bigger and Blacker where he argues that black people do not differentiate between different kinds of white people that we do not hate Jews we hate all white people and all white people whether Jewish or Romanian are still just white in the eyes of black people I a never been in a barber shop I heard a bunch of Brothers talking about Jews black people don't hate Jews black people hate white people we don't got time to dice white people up in a little groups I hate everybody I don't care if you just got here hey I'm Romanian your Romanian cracker and he's right most black people do not distinguish between white people we don't see the distinctions that groups of who we perceive as white people make amongst each other many black people are unaware of their prejudices histories or how certain groups of today's white people were not always considered such think Armenians or that anti-Semitism is a specifically white supremacist belief system like if you were in high school history class and you had to list what groups white supremacists or more specifically the KKK targeted Jews would be on that list right next to black people and homosexuals although we as black people see Jewish people as just white people and their whiteness is real and actionable in many ways the white supremacist movement has always racialized them and vilified them as a threat to the true white social and political dominance think Hitler and his Aryan RAC [ __ ] the central feature of anti-Semitism in the white power movement being to position Jewish people as an all powerful secret owners and controllers of the world media entertainment and as people manipulating black and other non-white people to challenge the true whites dominance if you can't decipher white from the true whites you're going to miss the white supremacy they're actually pedaling to you when you hear people telling you that Jews control everything and that's often why so many black people fall prey to anti-semitic white supremacist talking points when Kanye West starts viewing them and don't see the connection between those anti-semitic viewpoints and him ping around without out and proud white nationalists and Holocaust deniers like Nick Fuentes it's easy for folk to just uncritically soak up the idea that Jewish people control everything but it's much harder to show them how that fundamentally empowers white supremacy and in turn hurts us I'm afraid that that intentional conflation of anti-zionism and anti-Semitism is going to unwittingly lead to more anti-Semitism down on the line and Fracture solidarity between our communities why do I say that because people already uncritically ate up the idea that Jewish people control everything and that you can't say anything to or about Jews without fear of losing your livelihood or having your life destroyed if they were already partial to that idea and now they're being told that Jewish people are synonymous with the Israeli government and they watch the Israeli government genocide of brown people and everybody especially the black people that they see just speaking up for the Palestinian people's rights not to be wiped out of existence not against Jewish people are equivocated to an anti-semite and stripped professionally it will be impossible to divorce people from the white supremacist Notions that have endangered Jewish people all throughout history and will further endanger them in unimaginable ways if other marginalized groups that have historically stood by them stop and none of that is the fault of the Jewish people this is not a Jewish conspiracy this is a political formation that we have in the United States where the United States has a political interest in certain things we have political interest in the Middle East looking a certain way we have political interest in Africa looking a certain way we political interest in Latin America looking a certain way as a country the United States our relationship with Israel is an important one and so the United States protects that that interest so again this isn't about Jewish power conspiring that's that's an anti-semitic myth Trope and lie this is about American political interests at play and America's political interest is to be uncritical of Israel and to make sure that people who are are marginal we dropped the ball by not challenging this earlier by not standing together loudly to make it easier to challenge this earlier and we owe it to each other to the Palestinian people and to the Jewish people to call this out Palestinian people Jewish people deserve to live all people do every single person who is allowed to draw breath on this Earth has a right to life to dignity to self-determination and to not be murdered blow to bits because of Wars politics and ideological disputes between governments regimes or anything in between working back from that endpoint means that we got to figure out how to get people organized and together I think that we can get a free pal when I say free Palestine just you know to be clear I'm talking about um Freedom safety dignity Justice and self-determination for everybody in that region it's not as I don't think the Palestinian Freedom comes at the expense of Jewish people you know I don't think it comes at the expense of neighboring countries I don't think it comes at the expense I think we can figure out a model that works they have that right not when or only if they are mothers or children they have it because they drew breath on this Earth Earth if you can only extend sympathy or the desire to spare the lives of the children or you feel that you can only appropriately invoke sympathy or Grace for your position by emphasizing women and children you simply do not you cannot recognize the humanity of a people whether they be Palestinian or Israeli you do not care for a child whose home you would destroy whose parents you would kill whose family You' let them grow without and I don't say this to you as an expert on the Israeli Palestinian conflict I say it as as someone who has come to the conclusion that our silence enables the murder of the Palestinian people I will be damned they say I enjoyed it about a year ago a woman approached my daddy in the bank at home in the Bahamas and told him he needs to tell his daughter me to be careful about all them things she's saying in America and my daddy decidedly told her not to worry about his daughter or get in her business because I know what I'm doing that I'd been in America a long time and that America was not like the Bahamas we could speak on things and openly Advocate and challenge the government and authorities in a way that we could not or was not commonplace or so likely to be supported with the social media following in the Bahamas and that has always been my father's stance he follows me on social media Twitter believe it or not he reads my articles he watches my shows and he has never ever offered me criticism or instruction about what he believes I should or shouldn't do without being prompted my daddy a man who never offers his two cents or worries about my advocacy me profusely not to comment on what's happening in Palestine the WhatsApp messages from my daddy read quote the best place to watch and get the accurate account and perspective of this Israeli Hamas conflict or war is on Al jaer all the US stations are biased or censored you can tell a few commentators on MSNBC like all shopton or Joy Reed want to tell the truth but they are gagged if they truly speak their minds they will be fired instantly and they cannot afford that cap lock please don't touch that subject on your show stay away from it or they will destroy you if you are ever questioned about it just say your thoughts and prayers are with the innocent victims on both sides and say no more end quote I hold my father in incredibly High esteem and I know that if he stops working long enough to fire me off six WhatsApp messages in the middle of the day he is worried that I'm going to make a grave mistake and he wasn't alone in that worry or in his inkling that he had a daughter who would open herself up to the firing squad by weighing on this issue because in addition to already firing off more than a few tweets I had been thinking about doing an oay and friend episode on Palestine if you've never seen oay and friends it's a segment on my show where I get five black commentators content creators thinkers or professionals to discuss specific issues in depth when I attempted to organize that I had confirmed what I already know what we all already know that you can be an advocate you can be a loud radical you can speak against colonialism imperialism fascism War racism and genocide and you can even have a platform and a following for doing all of those things for any number of issues but you dare not do it in service of the Palestinian people dare not do it in service of Palestinian Liberation you dare not express compassion for the Palestinian people you dare not recognize them as a people as deserving of Life humanity and self-determination my friends people who spend their lives being Advocates rocking the boat saying the things no one else will begged me not to talk about Palestine but that if I must to please not sacrifice the careers of five other black people my friend said YY please dog people already getting in trouble losing their jobs being black balled and now they won't be able to advocate for black people and do the work they were already doing and that they need to do and I mean what can I say that they're wrong I could fix my mouth to say that when I know that my friend Mark Lemon Hill was fired from CNN for speaking in support of Palestinian Liberation at the UN as Black Law students lose their Law Firm job offers while NYU students get targeted when I myself explicitly warn young black students that I know who are in vulnerable positions with everything to lose to be careful about seeing anything that could cost them daely I I think everybody's to make their own choices um there are people who tell me every day hey you got fired from CNN and now you can't be a a sane critical or radical voice on CNN and advocacy of black people or or poor people in the United States or queer people in the United States or elderly people in the United States or whatever the thing is right because you you you you you got fired taking a principal position on this cause that you can't talk about anything else and I get that and and there AR I can't say there aren't days where I think about that and where I'm not frustrated or sad those are the stakes but I I'd like to believe that if we organize properly and we all speak up we can't all be canceled we can't all be fired we can't all be marginalized I mean even right now when you see 300,000 people in DC and you see the voices get more normalized the radical voices get more normalized what happens now you can turn on MSNBC or CNN or or maybe not Fox but MSNBC or CN or mainstream outlets and you hear people saying calling for a ceasefire which was impossible before right now seven members of Congress between the House and Senate are calling for a ceasefire but two years ago it have been zero I'm claiming the victories and so I think it it it's only a divisive issue it only is a a career-ending issue if we continue to allow people to stand by themselves everybody got to make their own decision but I will say and I never want to tell people to make a choice that they have to pay for right I be like that was you lost your job well you know like I can't I can't replace that you know what I'm saying I can't support you know I can't but I firmly believe that we're going to see a free Palestine before my life is over and I'm not sure that I was certain of that 5 years ago or maybe not even one year ago so I D the idea of doing an O friends or an episode on Palestine but it bothered me deeply for several reasons the first thing I tried to tell myself was I mean well I don't need to speak on everything there are thousands or millions of people speaking on Palestine me speaking or not speaking won't change anything but I know that's not true or at the very least I know that I don't believe that it's true not in my heart if I believe that I wouldn't do any of the work I do would I because I believe generally that we're all being intentionally misinformed and indoctrinated by Propaganda from a government and its media so that we continue supporting systems and structures that oppress us and so most of my career in life revolves around speaking out and educating people in the issues that matter to me and hopes that I can help shift social Consciousness and we can can make a collective request for change and I know that that matters if no one does that we never know better and we never do better and that's one of the main reasons that so many of America's progressives seem to be Progressive about everything but Palestine because one they don't know better and I'm not a m almost three years ago I tweeted quote Angela Davis commented that people often don't advocate for Palestine because they don't think they're informed enough or that they need to be experts admittedly that's been my exact reason for staying out of that conversation but I'm going to reflect on that position and reflect on it I did but I I realize I think that there are some topics like or some causes some issues where I am required to to speak up even if just to be a part of the collective where I am not the expert and I don't I don't know enough to to be the expert but I know enough to know what position I should take yeah I mean we can't be an expert on everything but we but that doesn't mean we we can't speak I mean first of all most of the people in Congress who are supporting this legislation and who are funding through 34 billion a year aren't experts on this issue but I don't need to be an expert to know that thousands of babies being killed is a moral atrocity just like I didn't need to be an expert to know that 1400 Israelis killed on October 7th was a moral atrocity you know I just as a human being can make certain determinations now that we get analysis and we get you know smarter and it helps us make decisions about what policy moves to make but what people are seeing what they're feeling in their gut they're not wrong you know we study we learn to get a a more comp ated analysis but when I see a school shooting I don't have to be expert on education guns weapons or anything else to know that this isn't okay and no one as expects us to be all these people marching to be pro- lifers they're not biologists they're not scientists they're not doctors they have no expertise in this issue but they know enough to feel morally compelled to make their decisions but in addition to not knowing any better because they're uninformed people are too scared to inform them because two anti-zionism has been intentionally and falsely conflated with anti-Semitism to scare people out of of ever criticizing the Israeli government or speaking in support of Palestinian Liberation and that is how the status quo is maintained how the powers that be keep that power how millions of people can blindly and vehemently support oppression and I know that so I couldn't justify my silence on those grounds that speaking didn't matter so that brought me to my friend's second point that the cost of us as black people in America whose core work is focused on liberating black people in America speaking on Palestine could cost us our ability to do that and that's a much more serious point I couldn't so easily dismiss and it's something I continue to think about because it's complicated there are black people who think black people shouldn't concern ourselves with the plight of Palestinian people because they wouldn't or don't care about our plight as black people I hope the Arabs in the West Bank in Gaza I hope they get all they get I hope they are protected I hope nobody dies I hope those babies lives are safe I hope the women are cared for I hope that there's no Bloodshed no violence but if you think I'mma take time out of struggling for African people if you think I'mma stop my agenda to liberate my people to go cry for people who don't cry for me if you think I'mma stop what I'm doing and pay attention to what's going on over there when y'all don't even pay attention to what's going on in Africa y'all don't pay attention to what's going on in Ethiopia y'all don't pay attention to what's going on in the Congo the greatest humanitarian crisis in the world is in the Congo not the West Bank I said the greatest humanitarian crisis in the world is in the Congo not the West Bank not the Gaza Strip not Israel but in the Democratic Republic of the Congo so don't tell me I got to cry for whites and Browns I'm crying for black people while I am sure that there is anti-blackness in Palestine as the entire world is anti-black including even most black countries which have been colonized and had systems and schools of white supremacist thought downloaded on to us one that does not make our struggles as colonized people any less connected there's a large increasing number of dark skinned people uh swelling the PO the dark population of France and Britain and it's is giving them a great deal of cause for worry no effort has been made to unite the afroamerican community or the American Negro Community with the uh West Indian Community and then those two communities with the African Community and those communities with the Asian Community this has never been done and this frightened many power many interest in this country many people in this country who want to see us the minority and who don't want to see us taking too militant or too uncompromising a stand are absolutely against the successful uh regrouping or organizing of any faction in this country who's thought and whose thinking pattern is international rather than National and then if this man over here plays too rough we got some brothers who can play as rough as he there's a world worldwide Revolution going on it goes beyond Mississippi it goes beyond Alabama it goes beyond Harlem what is it revolting against the power structure the American power structure no the French power structure no the English Power structure no then what power structure an international Western power structure and in keeping with that two there was a long history of the Palestinian people standing in solidarity with black people fighting for Liberation in America and actively helping us resist oppressive police states that resemble and are made possible by the same forces as their own I'm thinking specifically about the Ferguson protest after Missouri police officer Darren Wilson murdered 18-year-old Michael Brown and left his body drenched in blood in the streets Angela Davis writes in the case of Michael Brown in Ferguson Missouri we quickly learned about the militarization of the police because of the visual images of their military Garb military vehicles and military weapons the militarization of the police and the US forces all over the country has been accomplished in part with the aid of the Israeli government which has been sharing its training with police forces all over the country since the period in the aftermath of 9/11 as a matter of fact the St Louis County Police Chief whose name was Timothy Fitch and St Louis of course is the setting in which the Ferguson protest and violence took place Ferguson is a small town in St Louis County this Chief received counterterrorism training in Israel County Sheriff's police Chiefs from all over the country agents of the FBI and bomb technicians have been traveling to Israel to get lessons in how to combat terrorism she continues what was interesting during the protest in Ferguson was that the Palestinian activists noticed from the images they saw on social media and television that the tear gas canisters that were being used in Ferguson were exactly the same tear gas canisters that were used against them and occupied Palestine as a matter of fact a US company which is called combined Systems Incorporated stamp CTS on their tergas canisters when Palestinian activists noticed these canisters in Ferguson what they did was tweet advice to the Ferguson protesters on how to deal with the tear gas they suggested among other things quote don't keep much distance from the police if you're close to them they can't teargas because they would be tear gassing themselves I offer that excerpt to illustrate not just that Palestinians have supported us or to counteract allegations of anti-blackness but to demonstrate just how related the creation and maintenance of America's Police is to theirs and just how the concept of one's Liberation being tied to the liberation of another functions and application I think part of it one is to make sure that we're precise in our analysis um I think sometimes the lack of precision can it doesn't lead to anti-Semitism but it it can reinforce anti-semitic narratives that then can be seized by people um in ways that undermine a principled struggle I'll give you an example uh we talk about the deadly exchange often right which is that police officers in the United States are trained in Israel some and some Israeli officers both in the police and and the military force the IDF are training the United States it's important to think about that relationship because the two countries sh sharing information sharing tactics strategies Etc and I talk about this in my book we still here it speaks to the way that we're entering a security a moment of hypers security in a Security State and surveillance and bigger weapons and all these things that both countries play a part in but when we first started learning about it people started saying oh well you know police officers right right in the height of our kind of abolition and and and defunding you know conversation post Mike Brown and then post George Floyd people saying well you know police are in being trained by Israel here and and so and the it was like whispered down the lane before you know was like oh yeah all these cops that are killing us are getting trained in Israel so then that becomes what you would call a blood liel right which is sort of cuz effectively we be saying Israel is the reason why black people are dead right the black people being Israel taught America how to kill black people and it's like America been killing black people long before Israel was formed right America didn't need no help learning how to kill black people people and to blame that on Israel again like a good faith interpretation would be well you know we're saying that Israeli training tactics did but another interpretation would be that you're blaming Israel for the death of black people which is a blood liable but either way it's not precise it's not accurate the accuracy is in talking about the exchange that we we're teaching each other stuff and and and and and it's not just that we avoid looking anti-semitic although you know of course that's not a bad thing we actually get more a deeper analysis when we understand what does the United States have to teach Israel and what does Israel have to teach United States and what does that say about how not just those two countries function but how broader countries function but being precise in the analysis helps us helps us be mindful of that right cuz and even in political education telling people well that's a blood liable and here's what that means is important um I think we have to be intentional about fighting anti-Semitism speaking out against it um I think sometimes doing this work you know you will encounter people who will say something anti-semitic and we might be insufficiently vocal in the same way that we might be insufficiently vocal as men when we hear something misogynistic or sexist or or what have you um we have to be intentional and vocal about that you know when synagogues have been bombed I've been on the front line talking about not just my outrage at it and denouncing it but saying what can we do how can we help how can we heal when Elon Musk a few weeks ago was sort of doing this defund the ADL thing and again I'm not a friend of the ADLs you know I have critiques of the ADL for islamophobia racism smear campaigns Etc I have legitimate principal critiques of the ADL although I share their goal of fighting anti-Semitism but when Elon mus something that I thought was anti-semitic even though the ADL and I aren't homies it didn't matter I still had to be principled and say hey what y'all are doing is wrong Elon Musk the the adl's complaint against Elon Musk on this issue is correct and so I'm going to push back and challenge Elon Musk so it's about being morally consistent right when someone in our movement it does something anti-semitic and there have been moments in palestin resistance movement and the BDS movement and other movements where a a prominent member has said something anti-semitic or done something anti-semitic where you got to go okay we we can't endorse this person we can't support this person but also we have to publicly challenge this person and denounce this person that that's part of the work you know we shouldn't be afraid to speak the truth but we also have to be mindful of of the pitfalls you can also see the similarities with how our movements are treated remember when black lives matter first emerged as a slogan for lack of a better term and white people and oppositional forces bent over backwards pretending an aspirational goal that black lives would matter in America that they would be treated like they matter that police and white supremacists could not kill us with impunity was haste speech designed to exclude white people and the people not experiencing our plight the people that are being excluded from the daily suffering of being killed each and every day by police of burying to Mere rice Latasha Harland Rihanna Taylor Elijah mlan Dan Roy Henry dejon KY Alton Sterling Eric Garner and countless others that's the same treatment defund the police got and it's the same treatment that from the river to the see is getting if you ever find yourself struggling to decide who is the oppressor versus who is the oppressed I'm going give you a quick litness test because it's more obvious than you say you have to look at who is co-opting the language follow me starting off strong we had black lives matter and shortly after that it was co-opted to be all Liv matter I have many examples follow along we have the Black Power movement this is a movement that happened in like the 80s '70s like started the Black Panther Party was to advocate for more you know power for the black community than they were powerless that was shortly followed by this movement oh boy I'm not finished there's the me too movement you know that was started to bring light to sexual harassment and assault that was happening um all over the place really that was shortly followed by the him to movement which is a movement and yes it is a thing that was started because people are afraid of men being accused of grape unfortunately I can go all day with examples but of course there is pride which was followed by Straight Pride yes this it's a thing I swear I'm not lying if you want to know who is the oppressor look at who is co-opting the language from The River To The Sea you know just got to pay attention that's it the deliberate and Shameless attempt to paint an aspirational goal that Palestine would be free from The River To The Sea as a call for genocide is disgustingly insane what's worse is centuring the only Palestinian member of Congress for saying that while billions of dollars are being sent to Israel to actually Aid the genocide of the Palestinian people it is calling for the destruction of Israel what does it mean to say from The River To The Sea first of all the phrase from the river to the sea is not a Hamas slogan people say it's a Hamas slogan well does Hamas use it sure I'm sure they do right Hamas didn't create it Hamas doesn't own it and Hamas doesn't use it exclusively what does it mean to say from the river to the sea from The River To The Sea means from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea it's referring to all of the land in historic Palestine when I say in historic Palestine I'm referring to not just the West Bank and the occupied territories but what is now Israel what is the West Bank what is Gaza uh the Golan the Sinai I'm talking about all of it when people say from The River To The Sea Palestine will be free they're saying that Palestine needs to be free not just in occupied territories not just in the West Bank but also in Gaza it also needs to be free inside for Palestinians inside of Israel it's a call for everything now has it always meant that it's meant different things to different people in the 1960s the PLO the pal the Palestinian Liberation Organization were calling for at that time a single Palestinian State that's absolutely true from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea to take up all the historic land that was 1964 and even then it wasn't calling for the destruction or the killing of Jewish people it was calling for a single state the lud party this is important was founded in 1977 for those that don't know the lud party is Benjamin netanyahu's party it's a conservative party it's a nationalist party you talking about nationalism it is a self-identified conservative party and a nationalist party and when they talk about Israel they're talking about based on the Bible all of the land given to the Jewish people being Israel and the lud party in their original Manifesto in 1977 said that Israel is everything from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea so River to the Sea ain't just the Palestinian thing Israel's netanyahu's party has been saying River to the Sea since 1977 the call River to the sea is not a call to kill or remove Palestinians or Jewish people from the land when I said it at the United Nations it didn't mean that and when Rashida Talib says it right now it does not mean that what it means is is that when you say River to the Sea you're not conceding that Palestinians will just live in Bonin you're not going to allow them to live in a couple hundred ghettos in the West Bank as the oso agreement provided and say that that's Freedom that's Justice no no no no no justice also means ending The Siege in Gaza no no no no justice also means creating equal rights for Palestinian C Palestinian citizens of Israel in every place that was called Palestine in historic Palestine from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea everybody should have justice peace freedom safety dignity and self-determination not only is there a long history of the Palestinian people standing with black people so too have our black civil rights leaders of course as an African who suffered under the heels of British imperialism I can have no love for it and certainly I cannot love anyone who attaches themselves to it and attaches themselves to it for the foundation of a state and then call this a Liberation movement Liberation movements fight against imperialism the Zionism is certainly not a Liberation movement because it never fought against any imperialism as a matter of fact today Zionism is the baby child and infant protector of imperialism in the Middle East it carries out the interest of American imperialism as a matter of fact Zionism in American imperialism is like this if our tax dollars would stop giving money to Israel the state would sink tomorrow and certainly no one can deny that American imperialism is the leading imperialist nation in the world the Palestinian struggle is not just a cry for justice it's a blistering battle for the most fundamental human rights that every living soul on this planet should inherit by Birthright it's an unyielding resistance against the oppressive suffocating grip of occupation and the callous denial of the most basic human dignity just as the civil rights movement in the United States fought against the chains of racial discrimination so too do the Palestinian people strive to shatter the chains of occupation and tyranny never forget my friends that the Palestinians much like African-Americans in the United States have been subjected to a heart-wrenching history of suffering and torment the birth of Israel in 1948 brought forth the mass expulsion and dispossession of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their ancestral homes and land this is a historic Injustice that continues to haunt the lives of Palestinians to this very day the situation in Palestine serves as a brutal reminder of the consequences of colonialism and the ruthless dispossession of IND people it is an agonizing reminder that the fight for justice knows no borders and we must stand United in solidarity with all oppressed Peoples Let's Be unequivocally clear advocating for the rights of the Palestinian people is not synonymous with denying the rights and security of the Jewish people the fight for justice in Palestine is not an assault on any particular group but an unwavering stand against the policies of a Zionist state that has for far too long stripped Palestinians of their rights but just as there is a long history of solidarity between the Palestinian people and black people in America so too is there a long history an existing relationship between Jewish and black people in America as Jewish people have always fought alongside black people for civil rights and I believe that that plays a large role in the perceived outrage of some Jewish people towards black people who are expressing their support for Palestine and I think I think uh Je Jewish brothers and sisters who speak out against Israel on political issues are also dealt with pretty harshly um and I think there's a few reasons for that I think black people in general just get de dealt with more harshly in general just in the world right I you know this ain't no ex this isn't exceptional right um I think again there's a long-standing black um relationship with the Jewish community in the United States um and so I think there might be a sense of we stood with you and you see this with some of the angry tweets that we that came out right we stood with you back then or even now like I I March for black lives matter why are you all not standing with us right right so there's a there's a sense of reciprocity and mutuality um that makes people say okay you should be standing with Israel because we stood with you um there are longstanding relationships with groups like APAC and the black church and HBCU so there are all these kind of cultural and political line operation understanding where we take the young kids and and and send them to Israel on a tour I mean all of these things are part of a relationship that isn't complicated but it's a relationship and so I think part of it is like how y'all going to be speaking out against Israel right um and again same thing with our Jewish Brothers and sisters who who join groups like jvp Jewish voice for peace again it a sense of betrayal I think maybe the black Jewish Alliance critical during the Civil Rights error it was critical for civil rights gains it was critical for organizing the NAACP Jewish Americans still what black people was they fought for civil rights you know there are coalitions there are relationships that were forged and so again the idea of saying well we're going to Buck that tradition and do something different again makes people question why and then there are organizations finally that weapon ize anti-Semitism quite intentionally um they know that the smear of anti-Semitism or anti-semite is so intense and so vicious and so dangerous at so high stakes that it will stop people in their tracks from making what is a principal critique of isra I know people who whisper to me or they text me all the time yo I hate what Netanyahu is doing but I'm not saying nothing cuz I don't want people to think I'm an anti-site even though I'm not and I'm sure that for some there is no internal dilemma as to whether to vocally support Palestinian Liberation at the risk of one's career and ability to advocate for black people here at home they probably feel as MLK did and that's that no one is free until we're all free or that Injustice anywhere is a threat to Justice everywhere and they would be right and they would be right but I'm sure that there are also people who share MLK's sentiments and that made them arrive at another conclusion I've heard people like Dr Umar Express that we don't pay enough attention or any attention to the genocide happening in the Congo Ethiopia and other African countries but we want to pay attention to what's happening in Palestine you got 27 million Africans in the Congo displaced environmental issues hunger poor health care you got a million Ethiopians who' been murdered you got sudin who have died ain't nobody said nothing about the sudanes ain't nobody said nothing about the Ethiopians ain't nobody said nothing about the congales but you want me to Cry tears for the aabs and then there's another thing that I want to add to this which is that there is a longstanding narrative about black people and brown people and Muslims that we are anti-semitic unless proven otherwise and so if the default presumption is that if you are a black person that you're anti-semitic and you're critiquing Israel um which is a Jewish State then it's very easy uh for someone to presume that you are anti-semitic particularly uh when people would argue you have no Nickel in that quarter right this ain't your business so the fact that you are not talking about Uganda or not talking about Kashmir or not talking about about you know uh the Western Sahara Morocco whatever um and you're only focusing on this place it must mean that you must have a reason for it that extends Beyond a political criticism and I don't think he's wrong that there are more people black people included paying attention to and supporting the Palestinian cause that's because people really don't know what's happening in the Congo or Sudan or Syria people don't know the average American doesn't know what's happening here in this country let alone what's going on in countries they've never heard of never been to and maybe can't even identify on a M they know what they're told about what the media and the government make it a point to force feed them or what we speak up loudly enough about that it permeates their bubbles and yes the fact that the people in the Congo Ethiopia are black has everything to do with why the media and the government doesn't give it the same attention but that's not grounds for us to disregard the Palestinian people we're all victims of propaganda and white supremacist systems we don't seed to their suppression of information and control of the media we do our part and that is why my next video is going to be examining the crisis and violence in the Congo that has persisted since 1960 with the direct help of the American government but for now we're talking about Palestine so often the song of my heart is one that I worry we've all heard so many times that it feels offensive to sing it sometimes I want to speak but I first ask myself am I saying anything worth saying do people need me to tell them that the sky is blue grass is green and that America is a pillar of racist hypocrisy I genuinely wonder whether it's even worth pointing out the difference how Americans reacted how Americans were allowed to react when Ukraine was invaded versus the response to Palestine do people needed pointed out how support for Ukraine was never met with the history between Russia and Ukraine is more complicated in Nuance that it's not that simple that you need to know about NATO but anyone who expresses even the faintest support or even just Sympathy for the Palestinian people are at best met with it's more complicated it's nuanced you're uninformed and at worst call anti-semitic terrorists even in spite of the thousands of Jewish people condemning the Israeli government calling it apartheid genocide and calling for a ceasefire is any of that really going over anyone's heads that's what I asked myself I ask myself whether anyone in good faith really doesn't see what's happening and what America's role is and has always been in it America is a nation of gaslighters and I mean that seriously if gaslighting is defined as manipulating someone using psychological methods into questioning their own sanity or power of reasoning I can think of No Greater example than people sitting in a country that has been at War 226 of its 244 years of existence that celebrates its violent battles for Freedom annually that has killed countless people in the name of maintaining its own dominance as a world superpower since its Inception and finding the audacity to condemn colonized people of the world as it aids their colonization and genocide for decades to be surprised that America would fund and support the colon ization and or genocide of a people is like being surprised at the sun rose today but still we must resist and lend our voices to the cause because there is always strength in numbers and the people can be more powerful than the governments we Empower if we choose to be and that's why at this juncture I understand people refusing to vote for Joe Biden unless he stops funding Israel's genocide of the Palestinian people or refusing to support the Democrats unless they provide a different nominee and ask Joe Biden to step down I myself cannot vote at all because I am not a US citizen but I understand and can support people leveraging their vote in that way right now because there's still time because there's still time for the Democratic establishment to do something different to choose someone else to give us someone else because it's very clear to me at this point that Joe Biden has already lost this election that if it's between him and Donald Trump he is going to lose and I'm not saying that because I want that to happen or because I think that'll be better for us I'm saying that because everything I can see and hear from the people is telling me as much and I am not going to be blindsided again 2016 is not going to catch me off guard again I have more complicated feelings about this than we have time for right now because I cannot say to people who are rightfully incensed and refuse to vote for a genocidal president who won't call for a ceasefire that American Presidents the American government has always supported and funded genocides long-standing rebellions and internal conflicts and wars in other countries that the American government is part of the reason the Congo has seen nothing but War authoritarian regimes and poverty since 1960 and cost hundreds of thousands of lives and that it's still not true that there's no meaningful difference between a democratic Administration even a Joe Biden one and a republican one more specifically a Donald Trump one for many many people in this country and abroad I do worry I do worry that people take for granted having elections even getting a choice because I am not always sure why people believe that Donald Trump a man who incited an Insurrection who bucked the peaceful transfer of power who held himself out as having won the election has any intention of continuing to even entertain the democratic system or process that he'll allow for another election should he get a second term in office it makes me think of a thing David Dole of rational National said to me one thing is in terms of just a transfer of power like if one party you're questioning are they even going to have another election I mean at that point why are we even having a discussion like you want to make sure that part is not going to be in power if one part is just anti-democracy but for now it really doesn't matter whether I or anyone else thinks Democrats and Republicans are the same or to browbeat anyone about how much worse it'll still be for Palestinian people and everyone else if Donald Trump and the Republicans come into office and have their way because the fact of the matter is Joe Biden's not going to win whether we like it or not so it is the perfectly intelligent and practical decision and choice for the left and liberals alike to voice that now and to demand that the party give them something else someone else that they can vote for do something they can vote for so that they don't lose to Donald Trump and plummet us into an authoritarian fascist ass regime that we cannot so easily escape from it's one thing to have a frustrating system where you can only truly choose between two parties it's another thing entirely to be void of choice to have choice and civil liberties entirely ripped away from you and the Republicans keep telling us and showing us as loudly as humanly possible that that is what they intend to do but people are not wrong that the Democrats not truly fight the Republicans back that they have many of the same corporate capitalist white supremacist and imperialist interests and I mean it's not like it's the Republicans making the Democrats refuse to call for a ceasefire or for 22 of them to join the Republicans in centering Rashida to leave the only Palestinian in Congress at this point it'll be the democrat's fault if they don't listen and switch course and end up losing this election it will be their fault but that does not mean that we won't still be the ones that suffer but that's the Democrats risk not ours and it's important that people fight resist and use their voices and their vote whatever they can leverage to make the powers that be sto doing what they're doing if you're thinking to yourself well people were able to recognize how the Democrats were different or the lesser of two evils before they knew what they were doing in Gaza and they were always doing this so what's changed well what's changed is that people know about it and when people know better they do better and more importantly they are demanding that the Democrats do better A lot has gone on online since October 7th we've seen a lot of crazy posts and comments from all sides from polititions from celebrities and I chose to ignore all of that for this video because dog who cares who really [ __ ] cares what I want to do is recommend the following books for everyone who's made it to the end of this video because when you know better you do better did you know that Palestine national animal is the gazelle and that their national bird is the Sunbird or the orange tufted bird as they call it
