Welcome to our uh second class um Anti-Imperialist greetings to everybody and these classes are different than the reform or revolution classes these are not strictly historical classes and Analysis because um today is day 18 of an unfolding situation which unfortunately I don't think we can really say we have good news to um um report so what we've said from the jump is that these classes will go deep into the history it will go back to 1948 and 1900 and we will unpack all of this history but that we would also be flexible we would report back on demonstrations we would talk about Civil Disobedience if necessary if if need be we would talk about uh legal help before all of the bullying and and censorship that the movement has been subjected to and we even had some self-care on uh uh in in our first session so thanks to everybody for allowing this uh flexibility we really want to take our cues from the leadership in Gaza and the Palestinian leadership here in New York City and uh across the world the first thing I want to do is an exercise in media literacy and I want to compare and contrast today's top stories in the US versus Iran so here we come to CNN and um give me a sec I'm just trying to got it so first of all CNN they're starting to bury stuff so it's no longer even front page uh news so you got to scroll down you know first we have Anderson Cooper kidnapped American he didn't recognize him until he interviewed his parents US military officials are trying to steer Israel away from an allout ground assault in Gaza so they're trying to present the US is the restraining factor which is different Zionism could never get away with all these crimes against the Palestinian people without um full us support we do see you know it's not at the very top but it's it is in the top headlines they're now talking about 2,000 children killed in Gaza they'll never use the word murdered you know if it's the Israelis um if it was the Palestinians of course they would say murdered kidnapped abducted they would use a different vocabulary I would say that this number is extremely extremely low I would say any serious demographic study I mean just look at at at Gaza City just look at Gaza uh what what what child 18 days into this horrific Annihilation campaign um could have survived so I would put that number five to 10 times s higher according to the experts the journalists the the historians who I've I've talked to and then to see any more Palestine headlines you got to go pretty far down um unless I did I miss it was there anything else about Palestine up here you missed one it quite literally just says Egypt is afraid of Hamas as well so tend to use headlines that Garner more attention towards a completely different topic that steers away what's actually happening in Gua itself such as even Egypt is scared because then that brings attention to Egypt's part in the rafath crossing and everything that is involved with that so that's another headline that they tend to throw out and involve it's a little bit further down I think it was below the um like the shoes and the the line all about cooking but um I think a little bit further down as well so you'll see headlines like that often too I feel that's important to make mention of fake place names with anti-israeli messages flood Google Maps depiction of the Rafa border crossing between Gaza and Egypt they're so desperate you know fake place names with anti-israeli messages well how about the Israeli bombs that are anti- Palestinian that would seem significant so again the role of corporate media complicit in whatever we're calling this and then of course more Sympathy for the Israelis but I saw on Democracy Now that these women who who were released by Hamas uh yesterday actually had extremely positive things to say that they were treated professionally and um so now let's contrast to National Iran's national news so in Iran on press tv which is their English speaking Outlet United STS by Muslims could have deterred Israeli atrocities in Gaza from president RI president RI says the US the West are directly supporting Israel's horrendous crimes in Gaza Iran calls for emergency meeting of the Human Rights Council as Israel genocide rages Iran Israel's killing of journalists IGN ignominious blot on face of Zionist regime Al AXA storm so you see how different the coverage is and this is all front page stories so as you as you read and you do this analysis always draw from different sources and see the perspectives that they um share not sure if there's any other um political updates um we could also ask as well was anyone who missed the first class that is joining us for the first time that might want to uh introduce themselves I think we met Mike Mike we met you with the reform and Revolution classes right once upon a time is that correct actually I kind of missed all the classes that um I paid for the 20 bucks for those reform Revolution classes but I've been having some child custody uh problems and uh like depression I'm on disability for mental health so I've been having a hard time uh with everything flooding in the news even for the past few years but especially the past few weeks or whatever like need to be there with solidarity but I kind of struggling taking care of myself kind of thing so 100% you know thank you for that uh introduction and we extend our you know profoundest solidarity to all those very human struggles that you uh articulated I was just doing a show in in Ohio it was kind of a local news program and the host was saying that he's never experienced anything like the past 18 days and that's something that you all have heard me say now you know once or or or twice a week so thanks everyone for joining us who feels that urgency uh anyone else who hasn't introduced themselves who's here for the first time you just want to say your name this would be the uh time to to do it um I'm here for the first time well I missed last week's class um Diana nice to meet everyone hey Diana nice to meet you hey Danny how about Ron you want to say hi Ron can you hear us hi yeah I can hear I'm excited to be here and just benefit from this series yeah were you you were here at the first class or no I wasn't actually but you're you I saw you in Brooklyn on Saturday or that's another that's you right yeah yeah say a few sentences tell tell them who you are it's very exciting to have you here I was actually um a student of Professor Shaw's back at John J I'm at New York law school now um and Omar Samina is actually a friend of mine um he's a Palestinian Voice or an organizer and a part of mola and he's a great great friend of mine so I'm excited to have um both perspectives thank you Omar and thank you Ron for uh joining us and I will say the class that rone was in it was 2019 and all of the different um Community organizers and student organizers from the Palestinian organizations and the Muslim organizations all came together into my class so John Jay has never seen in all of its existence such a revolutionary anti-imperial class so I have the Fondest Memories of um of Ron's class and it happened in such a spontaneous organic uh beautiful way and for me as a professor like at John Jay right now I'm receiving um you know the the zionists have tried to uh come after me and um it's tough you know John J is not always the friendliest place to us Progressive Anti-Imperialist people so that's why I have those fond memories and in going back to something that Mike shared the importance at this moment of bursting out of our isolation bursting out of powerlessness and that was why we wanted to create this uh this community space so we have um two historical readings before us today that hopefully everyone got um some of the readings are going out kind of last minute we're trying to figure out the the email list and thanks to to Daniel and to kayn you know we've said from the joh Sam we've said from the jump that this is collective that will support one another so thanks to everybody who's uh who who's helped out so the readings today are going to take us deep back into some history back to revolutionary Yiddish land very excited about diving into this and then we're going to do some reading on the first intifa um out of this book I believe it's chapter what chapter did we say maybe 20 was last week this was um inti father peace talks then intifa because the peace talks never changed anything this is like 1987 it might have been chapter 22 let's figure it out what chapter is the chapter on the N5 11 11 thank you so before we get into the readings into the class class part let's just go in a in in in a circle and in in Omar and and and and ran can can perhaps lead us off since they've been involved in this struggle for so long but let's just throw out a few updates whoever's been at marches how did the marches go what were the numbers what was the posture of the police you know any any details let's just do a check-in um from this weekend I saw you all last Thursday so four nights ago um what's happened in the past four nights the the floor is open Omar you can go first if you want to tell us about the Bay Ridge demonstration and any other happenings in New York city so I haven't actually been to any of the um the demonstrations yeah I've met other scheduling conflicts at the same time as them I'm also not I I want to like preface this I'm not an activist in the sense of organizing as much as it is being a Palestinian you are sort of an activist just being who you are so I feel I can offer more of like a historical and just everything that's going on as for like the protest thems I have seen massive numbers I've had a lot of people go and they've sent me the photos and it's a beautiful turnout and oftentimes it's people are a lot of my my family and cousins go as well and it comes from a place of it's it's it's a builtup thing that once we have these protests you see the sheer amount of people that show up and you have to acknowledge at a certain point that this is beyond what a country speaks for the people are obviously of a different mindset and the people have a different desire and keep up all the good work that everybody either organizes participates just continue on in what you're doing you don't have to go out of your way to advocate in a way that goes against what it is when you stand on the side of truth the truth is going to back you up no matter what in the end and um yeah that's that's that's my little Spiel to uh make up for not being president at any of the protests yet but hopefully I can make it out to one of them at least beautiful Omar thank you the the floor is open any other report Backs from across the us this weekend in terms of resistance I called into George Galloway show it's like a live show and I spoke to him about the 29 United Nations workers that were that were killed in RDA and we talked a bit about how no one's holding Israel accountable and I also mentioned the upwards of 1,500 and then probably far more that have not been reported kids that are also killed so that was fun George Galloway longtime Scottish Anti-Imperialist uh voice in member of British Parliament thank you any other uh updates I mean the energy in Bay Ridge Brooklyn on Saturday um officially they said 30,000 people Mar mared um IO Daniel Ryan myself many of us were there the energy was amazing we took up many many many city blocks um the police got violent as they do at the very end when thousands and thousands of people had left many of you probably saw on social media that the NYPD helicopters almost landed on people to intimidate them to try to break up the demonstration and it's it's amazing when there's tens of thousands of us how the police stand down but the moment that the March officially ends but there's still kind of a splinter group a few thousand that March this way that's when the police will intervene because they've divided you and it's easier in that moment to conquer you um floor is open or we'll go into the uh the readings unless there's any other questions or updates before we get into the class part I just want to say for international um I have friends good friend in Paris as well as a good friend in Spain and hundreds of thousands of people marched this uh weekend in um you know for Palestine so the numbers are unprecedented thank you Diana and I'll just add to that by saying that the German police and the French police have been extremely fascistic but this weekend I noticed and like Diana I talked to comrades over there and the comrades said that on on Sunday in Germany the police were completely hands off so how do we read that that could be that the European powers are trying to act as a stpe a type of restraining Factor on Zionism on Israel if they're no longer in the most fascist ways Banning and outlawing the CFA and the Palestinian flag could there be a slight shift in quote unquote you know when they say the International Community that's a ridiculous term because they're not talking about Indonesia and Nigeria and Palestine and they're not talking about the true International Community when they say the International Community they're talking about the collective West they're talking about the imperialist countries and their ruling classes and in the most arrogant way they've appropriated that term but I I I I don't I mean how much longer are they going to do this at this point they've let allowed some Aid trucks to trickle in through the Rafa uh border crossing it's clear that the Israelis the the Zionism in in in command wants to push the Palestinian people out of their Homeland and into Egypt the Egyptians are refusing to open up the Rafa border crossing and the people of Gaza are saying This Is Our Land we're going to stay right here uh and and and and re liberate this land by any means necessary so I think that's where where we're at unless anyone else wants toh chime in yeah uh in Canada the turn out has been surprisingly pretty large um I finally got to go to a protest last weekend cuz all the ones that were organized before were um on weekdays and I live an hour outside of the city so I wasn't able to make it but um yeah I mean Canadians are known for being quite complacent so it's actually nice to see um quite a few thousand show up in Ottawa uh multiple times there's been multiple events and there's big turnouts and really big turnouts in uh Toronto as well where they like blocked a major highway so yeah really great to see beautiful thanks Emily we we marched today in the Bronx against our uh House of Representatives rep Richie Tores had a few hundred people was more of a local Bronx March but uh went good diverse uh uh rally and solidarity with with Palestine okay so we'll close this uh section unless anyone else wants to add anything oh one one last thing um just wanted to say that there is a march on November 7th in Washington DC and so I think it's it's going to be a very big one so if anyone is you know able to it'll be great um I know some organizations like for example the people's Forum um is organizing some buses so different things like that are are going on thank you a saw the Tweet with your mom Danny that was fun the what the Tweet you put out with a picture of your mom oh yeah my mom has been resurrected by she she she's always you know Palestine always no matter how sick no matter how exhausted she is so my mother was back in the streets today as a good mom should be you know tell tell your moms and your parents the same thing all right so let go ahead question so I remember somebody sent this to me earlier there's going to be a rally on Thursday at 5:30 it starts from 3 though they begin info sheets and distribution there's a teaching at 4 and a rally at 5:30 on um Wall Street right in front of the stock exchange if that's anybody's interest I can send it to Danny to send out to everybody it's on my phone so I don't know how to without sending it to my computer and then uploading I'll try if I can get to you guys in theat it and if not I'll send it to Danny 100% thank you Omar cool so let's go to Palestine Israel and US Empire by Richard Becker um page 79 chapter 11 wait it's not chapter 11 did we say chapter 12 here we go yeah chapter 14 chapter 14 intifa peace process say in fire so before we begin reading what I said in the first class was that we would bite off different chunks of Palestinian history so last week what were the two big chunks that we uh tackled together we covered the nakba as kind of like a prehistory not prehistory but we gave context to what's been going on the the first big chunk was Palestine and the anti-war movement and we looked at how within the anti-war movement for Iraq for Afghanistan even going back to the anti-war movement in defense of the Vietnamese people in defense of the Vietnamese resistance there was a part of the anti-war movement the liberal wi not the Anti-Imperialist left wing but the liberal Wing that didn't stand for Palestine so we studied that history last week these liberal forces who would never stand behind Palestine in the past 75 years because of their relationship and their unconditional support for a settler state for an apart side state for 48 in the other big piece of history that we bit off elnaka came up but remember we studied normal finlin and we studied the weaponization or the miss use of anti-Semitism that's an important talking point because right now that's how they're trying to attack me and not just me but thousands of activists and academics and journalists across the US and across Europe they're trying to say that because we stand against Zionism that makes us anti-semitic which is of course historically uh quite ridiculous so we studied uh a chapter of D Dr normal finklestein's work in the two pieces of theor iCal historical knowledge that we'll bite off today is the intifa the first intifa and how that eventually led to the second intifa and then we're going to get into this is going to really take us back into the true history of the Jewish people the true working class history of different Jewish communities in Poland in Eastern Germany in Lithuania in lvia in the pale of settlement in St Petersburg in Russia uh so we'll we'll dive into one of of my uh uh favorite books revolutionary Yiddish land a history of Jewish radicalism and it's precisely because all of this historical knowledge in books that they never want to debate us and if you check your inboxes How come every DM from a Zionist is an insult or a threat or bullying or intimidation if the truth is supposedly on your side invite nor Dr normal finlin invite the Palestinian leaders invite Omar in in in invite Dan Cohen invite any journalist any anti-zionist journalist or or intellectual and have the conversation publicly on MSNBC on CNN on Fox on Democracy Now of course they will never do that because the truth is always on the side of the oppressed on the side of the colonized on the side of the underdog it's truth that is our greatest weapon right now and that's why we called for these emergency classes given what trans inspired 18 days ago who's our first uh volunteer reader on page 101 the 1987 in fire raise your hands all the volunteer readers so we can just read a bunch all right Sam and then Andre go ahead Sam all right intifa peace process intifa the 198 7 intifa began in the Gaza refugee camps in December after four Palestinians working inside Israel were killed when an Israeli tank transporter hit their vehicle within days hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in the West Bank inside the 1948 borders of Israel and in Gaza took to the streets and the largest demonstrations in Palestinian history hundreds of thousands more marched and protested in the palestin Ian camps in Lebanon Jordan and Syria solidarity demonstrations erupted in countries around the world an underground National unified leadership was formed made up of Representatives of fata pales popular front for the liberation of Palestine and the Democratic front for the liberation of Palestine the Palestine Communist Party other organizations within the Palestinian Liberation Organization and Independence the national unified leadership issued Flyers calling for various actions including demonstrations strikes and boycotts out of the antifa and the N came a new generation of Palestinian leaders including Maran barotti apologies on pronunciation AATA and Ahmed Sadat of the popular front for liberation of Palestine who today are both among the most popular Palestinian leaders ERS they are both elected members of the Palestinian legislative Council and both were illegally convicted and imprisoned inside Israeli jails the Israeli military used the most vicious means to attempt to crush the intifa early in the uprising Israeli troops employed CS a highly lethal brand of tiaras firing multiple canisters into homes and other enclosed areas cusing many deaths the Cs gas produced by federal labs in Western Pennsylvania had an especially deadly effect on the very young and very old pass go ahead Andre Israeli Army Chief of Staff Yar Rabin would later become Prime Minister proclaimed the policy of breaking bones of demonstrators which was taken up by the occupation forces video images of Israeli troops holding down and breaking the hands arms and leg arms [Music] um video images of Israeli troops holding down and breaking the hands arms and legs of Palestinian Children and Youth inflamed World public opinion despite the Savage repression which included the arrest systematic torture and imprisonment of tens and thousand tens of thousands of Palestinians ttif could not be defeated a situation of dual power existed for nearly four years hitting the Israeli occupiers against the organized resistance under the leadership of the N Palestinian American activist MAA kupti characterized the importance of the intifa in January 2005 issue of socialism and and Liberation the Palestinian intifa had few precedents in history it was an ongoing general strike of an entire people as a consequence of their heroism many Palestinians were deprived of employment education and access to the essential necessities of life the image of school children confronting Israeli tanks with nothing more than Stones became emblematic of a people whose very survival and identity was dependent on their capacity to struggle that that sentence right there reminds me of Omar's introduction to be Palestinian is to resist I mean what what choice do you have right that's what makes the Palestinian people organically intrinsically a revolutionary people and Anti-Imperialist people you can keep going Andre there uh three more paragraphs here the 1987 intifa transformed the situation in Palestine it put to rest any and all versions of what was referred to as the Jordanian option proposals for Palestinian autonomy on some parts of the West Bank linked to the regime of the US client King Hussein seeing the writing on the wall Hussein renounced Jordanian Ambitions to rule over the West Bank in 1988 the breadth depth and intensity of the uprising proved to the world that there could be no solution to the conflict without self-determination for the Palestinian people a prolonged 1987 to 1991 intifada forced the US leaders to rethink their position became claim clear that all the killing bone breaking torture house demolitions and economic deprivation that the Israelis inflicted had not succeeded in crushing the Palestinians right for the next section I'm going to move a little bit quick so we can then get to uh Al AXA and TI that breaks out in uh in in 2000 so the relationship of forces changes here we learn about the oso Accords this is the famous image that you see on page 105 where the Palestinian leadership the PLO a yaser Arafat meets with um Israeli Prime Minister Yak Rabin and because uh Rabin sat down with I forget if it was Perez or yat Rin maybe Omar omaron can correct me but because they sat down with the Palestinians um I think it was Shimon Perez was was eventually murdered he was assassinated because they considered him being too soft on the Palestinians the fact that he would sit down and actually negotiate and actually see this people as a people as human beings he was murdered by um uh antical um zionists who were way to the right wing of of of him so 1991 mark this uh this this this big hope the oso cords uh it's in it was in Madrid ultimately it's signed in in Oso uh Norway uh it tells you a little bit about the history of of Hamas the Islamic resistance movement um in its active uh resistance um the assassination of rabine was in 1995 by the extreme uh Zionist maybe similar to how John F Kennedy was assassinated in uh 1961 because uh big parts of the state department um of the US ruling class thought that Kennedy wasn't the right-wing cold warrior against Cuba and against International Revolution so they settled the the Kennedy question that way though they've never opened up the classified uh archives I think they're supposed to open them up in uh 200 uh 40 or something like that um right away the Israeli leadership uh breaks the Oslo agreement they continue their settling into the West Bank uh is if we had any doubts of of Zionist plans for the West Bank it's a slow dismemberment it's a slow social dislocation everything that's happening in Gaza right now we could predicted we could predict that they would use the events of October 7th to justify just like in the wake of 911 the US Justified its wars in Afghanistan in Iraq in Libya in in in Syria um on page 106 going down a little bit more in fact Israeli authorities had continued to treat the Palestinian is like a conquered people rather than as one would have assumed after the oso Accords were signed at the White House as a peace partner so the Israelis gave kind of this International face before Bill Clinton and then as soon as it was back to to to Palestine they continued their same unfettered uninterrupted ethnic cleansing plans um it says a little below that at the bottom of page 106 um during the course of the talks us negotiators led by Clinton's Middle East Envoy Dennis Ross often posed as neutral when in reality they were delivering Israeli proposals so whenever you hear that the US or or mron Emmanuel macron is in is in Israel right now so first you have Biden then you have the British prime minister then you have macron I mean they're tripping over one another to go to Israel and pledge all of this support because Israel functions as their Frontline battle attle battle Ram what's the first thing they did uh on October 7th they went into Syria and bombed both Syrian uh uh airports they're threatening Lebanon every day they've promised that if Lebanon gets involved in any way as they parade these massacres in the face of the world that's exactly what they want they want Hezbollah to make a move they want Iran to make the make a move they're doing this so provocatively so they can try to provoke potentially a regional world or Worse World War III I don't know if it would become World War III I don't see Russia or or China getting involved I think there's 1.5 million Israelis um the ashkanazi who are from Russia um and if I make a mistake you know in terms of the ethnicity in the background anybody can uh correct me but these 1.5 million Russian Israelis have a close Affinity to Putin to the Putin leadership and these are often like Israeli Society is very stratified and these more recently arrived Russian Jews they're kind of like the soldiers here who are conscripted who have to join the military because they're poor all of our poor white Latino African-American Filipino Hawaiian Cho sisters and brothers who have to join the military to make a living similar in Israel so the 1.5 million Russians in in Israel are usually some of the most downtrodden kind of like our version of poor white trash if you will it's not a perfect comparison but I just share this because Israeli Society is not a monolith I think a high percentage of the society is is Zionist minded and has been so fully indoctrinated we should not expect any intense resistance from within Israel if we're going to stand with with Gaza if we're going to save Gaza it's because of the International Community it's because of us it's because of Palestinian resistance um according to the studies that I show that that I touched upon last week it's 90 to 92% of Israeli Society right now that supports this allout total war against the 2.4 million civilians of of of Gaza just going to take a deep breath and open it up if anyone wants to ask a question or comments on anything I had no idea that they bombed Syria's airports and I'm like I'm like crazy about like news and researching so like that's just mindboggling to me um and also what is their endgame with like egging on a war like that I don't understand is it just solely money or power or yeah I I mean if one would have predicted two three months ago that the US was going to open up a second uh International war in addition to the US NATO proxy war against Russia bleeding the people of Ukraine who are trapped in the middle one would have surely thought that the us would have weaponized Taiwan as a proxy power and used Taiwan to justify an assault on China we can debate back and forth whether Israeli intelligence uh knew about um hamas's uh attacks prior to October 7th but we're not going to have an exact Smoking Gun answer what we can conclude Diana and everybody is that this played into the Zionist hands because this gave them the ideological justification to go uh all out against the Palestinian resistance I mean we're already hearing of of over a hundred uh West Bank Palestinians who've been uh assassinated and targeted for execution as well as the imprisonment I mean there's thousands and thousands of polit Palestinian political prisoners that had that are held in Zionist uh jails you have to understand the US economy and you have to understand that the military-industrial complex is in the driver seat of the US economy so if they couldn't provoke the the the war on China in October 7th exploded in the way that it exploded the US pivoted and was able to then funnel their resources their attention their soldiers their battleships uh over towards uh Palestine because that's big money and all the bombs that Israel uses well the us then has to produce more is Israel is one of the biggest arms exporters in the world so capitalism is intimately intertwined with war you cannot have capitalism without Wars without expansion the expansion of markets so it's the war drive and that's why they're beating the war drums and that's why we're also facing huge constitutional First Amendment issues for those of us who desent and exercise our rights to freedom of assembly and freedom of speech to say we don't agree with this war that's why we're coming under attack from different Zionist entities to try to present us as the ones who are not peaceful but we can clearly see who the non peaceful ones are so if they can provoke Iran or Hezbollah and get all of the US you know go get the bad guys those are the terrorists there's no context that's big big money and the first thing you saw on October 7th if you paid attention to the stock market the stock market as soon as those attacks occurred within 48 proper within occupied Palestine and in the south when Hamas broke free uh from from the ghetto um the stock market the Dow Jones skyrocketed because of this intimate connection between the economy and War to quote Eduardo gallano um the US needs enemies to justify its Wars the US needs boogey men to justifies its Wars like our human lungs need oxygen to breathe so in some ways it's highly predictable that every 3 four five years the us is going to create this insane Boogeyman one day it will be mad Gaddafi in Libya the next day it will be Basher Al Bashar in Damascus the next day it'll be Putin in in Moscow and now it's the Palestinian people who they've equated with a with with terrorism when's the last time we heard one positive word about Palestine about Palestinian children and horrific to think that they'd be willing to be so brazenly racist and islamophobic against the native people just to cash in on more profits so truly this is a system that prioritizes uh greed over human needs are they not concerned with Iran like dropping doesn't Iran have the largest arsenal of nukes in the Middle East Israel geez nothing can touch Israel and nothing can touch the US Iran Iran can put up some resistance and could do some damage Iraq Iran is a country of some almost 100 million with a deep history of Anti-Imperialist resistance but all the bombing would be done on Iran I mean it's not like Iran's going to reach they probably can't reach Zionism or or or the US so the Iranians have definitely talk tough but the Iranians have been subjected to a hybrid war from the US since 1979 since the Islamic revolution so the Iranian economy has been nailed has been really hurt by us unilateral uh uh criminal sanctions so it's not that REI and the Islamic Republic of Iran their leadership wants a war it's just that it it it it pangs them so much to see what's happening to their Muslim sisters and and brothers and there's also the Sunni Shiite question as well which can be very sensitive in the West Bank in in Gaza this different brands of of Islam which imperialism historically has used they used it in Iraq at times they weaponized they armed Sunni militias uh uh to turn them against you know Saddam Hussein's government or or vice versa I may have mixed it up but they have at times of course resorted back to the old British colonial model of dividing and conquering if all Muslim people are united and that's what the Iranian leadership is saying right now all Muslims have to unite you know in Iran I mean I'm getting in trouble because I've used the word Zionist and Zionism publicly that's part of the censorship you know what they call Israel in the US and Iran is everybody seated big Satan and little Satan like on the official Nightly News if I'm speaking and they're translating it's translated as big Satan and little Satan so it's very interesting it's very interesting how different cultures and civilizations articulate themselves in Daniel's Emoji right on time um so let's finish up this uh chapter El AXA intifa breaks out I think uh Diana wanted to read do you have the reading in front of you um is it the PDF file that was emailed to me yeah the one that the one that's um from from this book The Palestine book okay um I have to pull it up so you have to time you can read after who has it right in front of them I can read thank you Zen you're muted sorry no it's okay it's automatic like I don't want to make a lot of noise okay there we go so seven years of declining living standards Relentless repression and great frustration led to the 2000 ala and which began September 28th 2000 the event that triggered the new Uprising was a visit by Ariel Sheron to the Ala mosque in Jerusalem it was no ordinary visit the Sharon oh sorry Sharon was surrounded by 1,500 armed police for his provocation provocative intrusion into one of the world's most important Muslim religious sites another factor in the new Ina was the withdrawal of Israeli troops from South lebdon after 22 years of occupation it was clear that what was ended that what ended the occupation of Lebanon was not negotiating but armed resistance led by Hezbollah and its allies the new antifa began with massive Street demonstrations and thousands of young people throwing stones at Israeli troops the Israelis were positioned in their tanks and armored vehicles in the Palestinian cities towns and refugee camps that were supposedly under Palestinian Authority control as this writer witnessed firsthand the Israeli soldiers fired tear gas so-called rubber bullets steel bullets with a hard plastic coating live ammunition without plastic coating and tank shells into the Palestinian crowds within a few weeks the Israelis began using air power f-16s and attack helicopters Israel's hugely Superior Firepower was deployed indiscriminately against Palestinian civilian areas in the West Bank and in Gaza thousands of Palestinians were killed thousands more more wounded and imprisoned and immense damage was deliberately inflicted on civilian buildings businesses hospitals homes schools churches and mosques it was clear to this writer who participated in a delegation to the West Bank and RDA a month after that Alexan began that Israeli troops sought to cause maximum damage to the civilian infrastructure new housing developments that had been constructed recently on impoverished Reza were damaged or destroyed by Israeli fire these new buildings had built had been built with intentional funding and Were Meant to help relieve the acute housing problems in Gaza where 70% of the population are refugees having no tanks Air Force or regular army the Palestinian resistance forces responded with a variety of tactics including a wave of suicide bombings inside Israel hes carried out the great majority of these operations but other organizations including the pflp the Islamic Jihad the pop the popular resistance committees and the dflp also engaged in armed resistance only the Palestinian actions were labeled terrorism by the United States corporate media between 2001 and 2004 the suicide bombings caused significantly more casualties on the Israeli side than were seen in the 1987 to 1991 into father still the Palestinian death toll between 2000 and 2008 was Far higher than the Israeli 4,997 on the Palestinian side 1,62 on the Israeli side sorry a62 on the Israeli side the lightly armed PA Security Forces attempted to defend the cities against Israeli assault but were soon overwhelmed by the massively Superior Firepower on the Israeli side all PA security positions were destroyed but the resistance did not stop in March 2002 a member of Arab governments proposed a settlement plan Israel would withdraw from the West Bank in Gaza which would then become Palestinian state in exchange all the Arab countries would recognize Israel the aial Sheron L Israeli government reacted in predictable fashion by launching a series of new assaults on the Palestinians leading to the full reoccupation of all the West Bank and Gaza cities and towns PA president yasid aret M compound inala was bombed and bulldozed he was forced to live in what remains of the compound until his death in 2004 right let's pause for a sec you all can appreciate that no matter what no matter what is offered zionism's plan is very clear and and they've been saying this since 19 48 since the original Alba they have no intentions of sharing anything with the indigenous uh population uh IO you have your your hand up to read or do you have a question oh just to read cool uh before IO finishes off this chapter any any comments or uh questions yeah I mean exactly kind of what you're saying recently I I don't know how i' I've seen reports where it says that Netanyahu has refused uh to take back some of his hostages and that even if they got all the hostages back they would not like stop their attack on vda so that just goes to show that they're not after getting their hostages back so much as they just want to destroy Kaza if they had all the hostages back they wouldn't have the you know media justification to continue destroying life that's why we all have to be popular Educators use social social media conversations with co-workers to and that's why we called this series educating against apartheid and educating against uh genocide okay go ahead uh a particularly devastated was the Janine refugee camp in the northern West Bank after several days of bombing and shelling Israeli militarized bulldozers supplied by the us-based cap uh caterpillar Corp worked day and night for 72 hours to demolish the camp dozens of Palestinians died many l laid under piles of rubble for weeks undiscovered the extraordinary brutality of the Janine Massacre was condemned worldwide but once again the United States this time under the administration of President George W bush protected Israel from suffering any type of intern International sanction despite its ongoing and obvious violations of international law the Israeli military also La launched a campaign of targeted assassinations against the leaders and caters of resistance organizations those who were not killed were arrested today more than 9,000 Palestinian activists remain locked away in Israeli prisons in 2002 the her own government began building an apartheid wall inside the West Bank the wall separates the main Israeli settlement blocks from the Palestinians while effectively annexing large chunks of the West Bank the walls separated many Palestinian Villages from their agricultural land the international court of justice the un's highest judicial Authority declared the wall illegal in 2004 aining that it should be torn down Israel and the United States ignored the ruling decrying it as unfairly biased in fact the second Bush Administration made no attempts to disguise its unequivocal support for Israel the murderer Chiron Israel's prime minister from 2001 to 2006 visited the White House more than any other foreign leader only in Bush's last year in off office was the president of the Palestinian Authority Mahmud Abbas invited to Washington and then only for symbolic talks yeah so that's a little bit of history of the in fathers you often hear in the uh marches Ina in Father how would you translate intifa in Arabic would you say Rebellion or what's the word someone who speaks Arabic shaking off whome okay um it translates shaking off is more the formal it's more Uprising uprising like Uprising or going against or sort of pushing off okay thank you thank you so floor is uh open for any questions comments clarifications I think one one thing that's interesting to debate or or to listen to the Palestinian leadership um we should of course be taking our leadership from the Gaza leadership from the West Bank leadership from the occupied Palestinian leadership and from the Palestinian leadership in Exile in the diaspora but just to throw this out there for us to think about what should be our slogans in the streets right now if we're marching through downtown New York what should our slogans be if we're in Bay Ridge Brooklyn in the heart of the Palestinian and Muslim Community should our slogans change and this kind of came up on Friday on Friday we marched from City Hall down to uh Wall Street um it was pouring rain so there was only maybe you know 500 to 800 people if that in the course of that that event um I kind of just throw this out there for us to reflect it's not in critique of any leadership but I often wonder for in S with with such a in such a dire moment with such a strong islamophobic campaign against the Palestinian people if we're in downtown New York or Midtown and we're walking down 7th a or Broadway and we're yelling in in is that going to win over like like new ignorant Americans who first of all most ignorant Americans is going to be very very difficult to win over but at what point do we pivot more in a quote unquote humanitarian direction to try to describe accurately what's happening in Gaza right now because if you read Fox News CNN is bad MSNBC of course the liberal wing of the media is horrific but Fox News let's just go to Fox don't take it from me look with your own eyes I want you to see how they describe what's happening us positions fighter jets plans to send iron domes to Israel as War rages I mean they'd make you think they'd make you think that it was like George Foreman and Muhammad Ali in round 15 in the middle of of the Congo when when the Congo was called zier by the dictator um mabutu coverage of Israeli War they always want to make the Israelis look so brave the poor Israelis and we even learned from social media this week There's a new verb in the English language to be Israeli is to uh is to be bullied and beaten up and intimidated but then the person who was the bully and beat you up pretends to be the victim that's what we've seen now for 18 days and for 75 years gaza's Israel ground Invasion looms well they've been saying that now for a long time you know almost since day two or three of this campaign I mean they probably want the ground Invasion because they probably want to provoke Hezbollah because then that gives Netanyahu and the warhawks the extreme right wing an excuse to bomb the the the heck out of uh Southern Lebanon in in Beirut and all of Lebanon see if there's any other headlines here but you all get the uh okay so uh the oval offices uh representative here kjp she's actually from Martinique another colonized country how she became a mouthpiece for imperialism well a lot of people will sell out for $100,000 kjp says she missed anti-Semitism question following backlash so you know no articles on islamophobia but they got to keep highlighting this word so again following the role of the media in this criminal asymmetrical war in in in operation I'm going to transition to the next uh item unless there's anything else from uh from you all okay the next thing I want to do I want to make a quick insert if anybody has questions about the broader ideas that were discussed in the um in the readings I could try to help if I know somebody put in the comments I don't know if it was meant to be sarcasm or not like where they get the Weaponry from much of it is US based Weaponry so I know the the professor mentioned earlier that a lot of these states act as a proxy State for the US and a lot of it comes from historical basis for it so I know you mentioned Russia before as well much of the support for Ukraine that the west and Western media the US and have shown for Ukraine themselves a part of it does come for the idea of resistance but the major part of it comes from historically Russia has always been a nation that stands to pose a threat to the Western World so you can imagine a lot of these places such as Ukraine now becomes a proxy State Israel is its own proxy state in the Middle East as the Press mentioned they tried to do it with Taiwan and China and then they flipped their attention to Palestine much of Israel is you'll notice a trend in these states where a lot of them go from having nothing to becoming such a superpower that there can that they cannot be touched so we often draw the comparison from Palestinians to Israelis as it's and this is what it is it's villagers throwing stones at tanks and you will often find that the US will supply them they've supplied their the stock of Weaponry right away they manage to ensure that they have the world's largest warship aircraft carriers fans trucks tanks Weaponry shells before the first trucks of eight even entered heza after like the first two weeks so a lot of it does trickle down to there's major Western support for the state of Israel because it's centered around the ideology of ethnonationalism paraded as a religious Mission which it's not and N chomsky's even mentioned it before I don't know if anybody's familiar with his works but he had made mention of the West's and like the larger religious picture of it the west and Christianity's greatest failure was The Crusades not being able to capture this holy land and a part of it comes from that too because the issue itself is not a religious one it is a national problem I I'll say it as always it's an issue of Zionism and Zionism is a twisted form of Judaism which is more it's a national movement it was founded by an atheist from Austria and it's a nationalist movement and it's important to always remember that it's a national movement but it will parade itself as a religious Mission because European guilt plays a large part of it as well it's easy to sort of condemn that which you don't know about and I I sort of forgot my point I'm not going to lie I forgot my point while I was making it Omar this the question Omar in R would it be correct to say Zionism is to Judaism as the KKK is to White America exactly there's no difference from it the ideas of Zionism are of Zionism is based on judaic values Twisted to fit a national narrative there it is an ethnonational State even though it parades concepts of religion and that's why at a lot of the protests you'll actually meet Orthodox Jews and other types of Jewish people the values in which they go about and they commit to whatever actions the state technically does often goes against judaistic judaic values and I always like to make it a point to people because I see it at a lot of protests too and just people in common conversation it's not a religious issue and that the pro a lot of people tend to think of it as and this is the way the Western media portrays it it's a Muslim versus a Jewish issue and it's as far from that as it can be yeah exactly somebody commented not in our name protest it's the values of Judaism do not diff they they differ from other major religions but they're within the same line but if you can parade this nationalistic movement under the idea of religion the European guilt from World War II and what comes from the Holocaust ends up becoming the responsibility of the Arabs and the Muslims as the Western media portrays it and that's why there's so much animosity towards anything that involves the Middle East often times you see there's a focus in the media on flaring anti-Semitism but it doesn't touch upon the islamophobia and the anti-arab sentiment that's actually going on now there was a six-year-old boy that was killed in the first week by his landlord you've had people in New York City they're getting their hijabs ripped off of a boy was pushed on his campus off of like the sixth floor balcony it's it becomes rampant but once you can parade it as something that it's not it becomes harder to distinguish it and actually condemn it and that's why anti you get accused of anti-Semitism so easily because it's parading itself as a religious mission one of which goes against the religious values of the religion itself if if that helps anybody or if there's any other questions that people want to ask about that it's always important to distinguish it's not Jewish people and a lot of people tend to make this mistake and I don't like this especially as a Palestinian because we we're not arguing or we're not angry we're not doing what we do and saying what we say because we don't believe in Judaism or we're against Judaism it's it's not an issue of Jewish people it's an issue of Zionism which corrupts and almost twists that idea of Judaism to something of nationalism and that's why it's important even in the protest and everything to distinguish because I I've seen in a few protest people categorize all Jews despite even if they'll be standing next to a Jewish person at a rally you have to be able to make that distinction of what is the actual issue here where does it stem from and that's why I think I love this class is great because education is such an important factor in you know you can always raise your voice and you can always yell and you can always fight back but for those of us that aren't aren't in the land anymore or even on that part of the world your voice becomes your strength and you have to approach it from an educated aspect you can't speak emotionally you can't you can yell yelling is always good and you can be angry but you have to be educated on the matter because if you're educated I said it earlier the truth will always stand by you people can twist your words but if you know what you're talking about there's only so much that can actually befall upon you yes whoever wants to Sam I think you had your hand up first Omar put your social media contact in the uh chat so people can follow your your work and other Palestinian voices go ahead Sam and then AO yeah thank you for sharing that by the way that I learned a lot out of that um I did have a question um for you and if anyone else can can answer it um I was watching Richard medur show and he was mentioning how even though it's a Jewish State there's still levels to it and that there's segregation amongst Ethiopian Jews um like white European Jews and then some group in between uh so I just wondering if you could speak uh about that uh that's just my very limited understanding it's not just one Jewish State Jewish state for all Jews there's discrimination even amongst uh Jewish people within absolutely absolutely and that's why I always make it a mention of it's it's an ethn National ideology so the issue with the Ethiopian Jews is and even just General people of color if I remember correctly they went through a mass forced chemical sterilization of Ethiopian Jews when they first came to like occupi Palestine and it goes across the whole board like this it's not just about all the other specifics I can't really speak on but Israel has tailored laws to either specific groups so Palestinians fall under different laws and they are applied to different laws than even and Israeli so a lot of the time even the Israeli demographic will say oh well we have Arabs in I'm going to say Israel for the meantime but we all understand to be the occupation so the occupation has laws and they will count Arabs as their as in their citizenship but a lot of these Palestinians or residents of Jerusalem or they live in Jerusalem or the outside areas in these occupied they're considered Arabs as well or a lot of these Palestinian Jews are considered I'm sorry not Arabs they're considered these Arabs are considered Israelis Palestinian Jews become considered Israelis but they're isra Israeli Arab and a completely different set of laws apply to them so a lot of the times you could have Palestinians with say a green identity card whereas Israelis will have blue even if they're Israeli citizens they have a different driver's license they have a different license plate oftentimes you'll see when the settlers go on protests maybe Rampages or they go through whatever that they do you'll find a lot of Palestinian property damage because there's notice like noticeable identifiers of who's a Palestinian who's not who's maybe not a specific type of Jew maybe they're an Arab Jew they can tend to get different treatment it's it's a wide variety of just a lot of it is run by what the occupation forces feel like doing too so if you're say an Ethiopian Jew but you might be albino and you pass as a white Jew maybe they'll let you go do whatever you want but the second that there's some kind of color involved the I the IDE the idea for the occupation forces they always promote diversity of any kind often times it's mainly propaganda it's very extremist in their ideologies very extremist and what they're based on and that's just kind of how they go about it's the best way to describe it is that it is a land shown as a land of democracy and law but it is as much of a lawless land as I think it could be thank you thanks for sharing that it's also interesting that uh Israel has like one of the highest skin cancer rates in the world so you want to talk about indigenous white people you know thanks for that yeah no problem even I didn't even know about the whole skin cancer thing but it makes sense when you have a bunch of Europeans coming to that new it's a whole new geographical location and if you say it's your land but you're not really meant to be there I don't know what to tell you can you uh provide a source on that Sam just because uh if any of us say that publicly I don't want to be you know well you don't have to say something like Israelis have skin cancer but you know you wouldn't technically be too far off yeah I just want to read about it before I talk about it so uh hi uh I I'm sorry this is Emily um I had just a quick question for Omar that was so like just amazing I really appreciate everything you just shared there was a phrase that you said and I'm trying to remember it was something ethnocentrism parading as religious mission was that nationalism an ethnonational okay parading itself as a religious Mission so that are those your words I mean they're beautiful regardless everything you said was like so I think people them but I I came up with those on the spot thank you okay yes thank you so much to you and Danny for this yeah but even if you go back all the way to like the 1930s and 40s the Inception of Zionism and I say ethnonational parading itself as a religious mission is because I personally am a Muslim but I know many Jewish people and I know many Christian people and we all share such core values and in Palestine alone we have Christians we have Jews we have it's it was such a diverse land and culture beforehand and from the Inception of Zionism it had come about from as I mentioned this before Theodore Herzel is one of the founders of Zionism and he was an Austrian atheist so the Nationalist it's a nationalist movement because even even sticking true to values of Judaism and I I remember I watched this in a video with a rabbi and he was questioning a Zionist and he had said if this is a Jewish State for the people of Judaism and they follow Judaism then you would have no courts because the Torah is sufficient you would have no oppression because the Torah is sufficient and you would have your rules set out because the Torah is sufficient so a lot of that comes down to Western influence and Western politics playing into the whole idea of this is an ethnonational State parading itself as a religious Mission because it has to do with the Holy Land mainly before IO goes Sam's question was a great question in our next class we're going to be reading from Goliath life and Loathing in Greater Israel and this is an incredible sociological look at Israeli society and it walks walks you through uh Israeli thinking the socialization of young people in Israel this book is called Goliath so we'll probably draw from this book uh on Thursday in the next class let me give you an example in 48 in Israel um let's say there's a Ethiopian you know everyone is is forced to do uh military uh service notice how they always use the word serve I mean who are you serving you're serving Empire you're serving the ruling class you're serving a Zionist mission right so the Ethiopians who have joined well often it's kind of arguably it's not a perfect comparison but think of like in the 1980s when there was still not many black cops in the LAPD and you're a young black cop and you have to put out for the white cops you have to prove you're just as tough that you're tougher so I've heard a lot of stories that Ethiopian cap captains than the military and West Bank will often try to put out for the um the other quote unquote Israelis to show that they're just as tough on a brown people on a Muslim people on a on a occupied people as the generals in the upper brass of the military so there's a lot of those different Dynamics the Ethiopians in Israeli Society have been the survivors of police brutality and police terrorism that's been been big demonstrations similar to Black lives matter here so there's a lot of fissures in Israeli society and many are wondering Benjamin Netanyahu had some of the lowest approval ratings of a president in in in Israel's uh in the past decade or so but we all know that war and fake enemies and this contrived invented nationalism or or patriotism always goes good uh for a president when they can hide behind the smoke screen of war and paint themselves as the victim so uh Netanyahu is trying to pass himself as the Messiah of of the Zionist people right now go ahead uh aou oh yeah so um just touching on what you said about the Ethiopian Jews um a lot of they themselves are you know they're fleeing poverty and very you know dire situations in Ethiopia so it's almost not surprising that there some of them are in you know in Israel trying to prove that they're just as much um you know for the state as as anyone else or even more so um but my original question was I was watching a program where someone um a brown Puerto Rican visited um Palestine and he was describing all the different um checkpoints and the constant you know military uh presence and just just really how awful it was and it just it seems to me like even for Israelis that's just not a way to live you know and it it just baffles me that why would they want to live that way and I was wondering maybe Omar you know are there parts of Israel where they don't have this sort of you know complete militar militarist atmosphere I mean is it just in like the settlements um or is it everywhere that's sort of under threat because it just seems like an awful way to live so in Palestine the only people that aren't subjected to the checkpoints and all the military checkpoints are the Israelis themselves so they have different roads they have different sidewalks they have different streets that they can use and they're not subjected to any military checkpoints a lot of it does come down to so you have soldiers everywhere the occupation forces are absolutely everywhere in Palestine they're in Jerusalem they're in East Jerusalem West Jerusalem every part of Jerusalem they're in they're within settlements you have a lot of settler activity that's taken to the extreme is often done backed by soldiers so often times you'll have Palestinians who stop to protect their land they have to fear that if they react to any of the settlers either destroying their Farmland destroying their homes or whatever it is they will have to deal with the Israeli police the occupation forces maybe they get arrested their kids will get arrested their family will get arrested a lot of times it comes down to that so Israelis thems even though there's like distinction between Ethiopian Jews and Israelis have come to like Israel itself so long as you are of Jewish origin you are typically still treated as an Israeli but the indigenous people of the land and often times the Arabs in the surrounding area some of them can go but the indigenous people to the land the Palestinians are mainly subjected to they're the ones who are subjected to checkpoints they're the ones who are often subjected to random checks outside ala mosque there's a little military box at like the Damascus gate where you see like all the steps often times you'll have Israeli soldiers holding weapons guns so a lot of the times these Palestinian children they they just grow up around soldiers and weapons and guns that often times you see us laughing because it's just we're used to it you know what I mean and the only people who aren't subjected to the military checkpoints or occupations are typically the Israelis even as a Palestinian I personally have never been able to go out of fear my parents have always feared if I go maybe I never come back or there's four boys maybe one of us never comes back it's always been a big fear so we always said maybe one day we all go together but if any of you who aren't Palestinian choose that you want to go and say you're 2% Jewish you have more of a right to go by their laws then I can go even though I my family is from Jerusalem and we have a house there we have property there just you being 1% Jewish even half a percent they will give you a birth right they give you the right to fly right in my family cannot fly right into Jerusalem they give us problems even as American citizens they'll give you too many problems they'll turn you away and send you back they have to fly into Jordan and then go from Jordan through the checkpoints through the check more checkpoints going from Jordan into Palestine and then where are you going what are you doing who's you with they used to ask my parents when they would go why aren't your kids with you why did you come without your kids you have four children why don't you bring any of them out a fear that maybe they're going to do something crazy so a lot of it is just comes down to there's there's just it's an extremist ideology that just has so much centered focus on a specific type of people no matter how diverse they try to promote themselves that is yeah it's just it's just an absolute oppression and apart everywhere you go and it's funny you mentioned that specific sorry I don't mean to interrupt no you're fine you can interrupt me um before it was allowed for pal means to go through the benorian airport my mom was born in the West Bank and so last time we went they gave her a really hard time because they wanted to force her to denounce her citizenship and so this time when we were planning to go before the they opened the airport they we were planning okay so my dad was trying to convince my mom you go through the normal airport because technically you still are a citizen you go through that and then we'll go through Jordan through the through the crossing at Jordan and so she refused to do that and they gave her a hell of a time and it was really difficult for her because they didn't want her to stay in the country because they were afraid that she would like become a resident or something something like that like that she would choose to stay for a long time they wanted her to leave but yeah it's it's tough because you can have like the same family obviously the same nuclear family some people could be like my mom who's born in the Westbank and my dad who was born in lifa but that's gone now and so I'm from ramala and I'm a Palestinian citizen but even though my mom is West Bank and um like she has her citizenship from there I could never become a an Israeli citizen at all just because I personally chose to become a Palestinian citizen so that's one of those things where even though my mom is a citizen I can't become a citizen of Israel if that makes sense and they wanted her to denounce her Israeli citizenship I think if that was the case yep even on my mother's side I believe it was my uncle when they renewed his passport it used to say festine on it and then once they renewed his passport in Canada they had gone to Canada after the n they had changed it to Israel and he may have to fight them for almost 5 years just to change it back to Palestine like the original document said and often times they'll hold you by some random relation just based on your name so on my mother's side my last name is habes and George habes is the founder of the PLO I have no relation to him but they will hold my mother in confinement just for the sole fact of that last name regardless of relation they just think just because she has the same name she's going to go commit some highness Act of terrorism maybe not come back maybe be up to no good so often times you find any reason they will turn you away and stop you whether you are as as um Zena mentioned whether you're a resident whether you're a citizen they just they don't care it really is like laws are just for show essentially there's there's no I know it says they're the only democracy in the Middle East they're not that's everything that they do is by military roles it's anything that you do you just can't do it once you as a Palestinian ad you can go there you will have a hard difficult time you will be stopped all the time it's just I don't really know how to explain it in terms other than it's almost as though you can walk where you want but you always have strings attached to you there will always be an eye on you and you will always have strings attached to you if that makes sense to people this is horrifying like listen listen listening to you guys speak about you know I've read about it but like and then I see you know a lot of my Jewish activist friends and Israelis that I know all saying oh no like this is they have a good life and it's like no they're living in an apart-- tied State and so I don't understand how Israelis especially think this is normal or this is how people should live do you have any like Insight on that like I just don't understand it but it's just it's it's just an extremist ideology and often times there's this is why being educated I always insist is so important because the ideas of propaganda and just the amount of propaganda in media persuasion that Israel has over everybody is ridiculous like I mentioned earlier the birthright so if you are any% Jewish you don't even have to be Jewish you can go on What's called the birth right and Israel will pay a full expense trip for you to fly out to the occupied territories you go to Jerusalem you go around they show you this is the city of David this is the old Temple they show you the mosque and they say this is where Temple Mount used to be and this is where it will be they'll give you Flyers they'll give you maps and from as long as I can remember and as long as like I've studied and seen it there has never been a map shown on a Birthright or any Israel that acknowledges any other Palestinian territory even during the Saudi Arabian peace deals that they were talking about Saudi Arabia has Palestine L something but Netanyahu would go to a meeting and he would show a map the whole land will be Israel and the Zionist ideology is that this land of Israel extends out even into the Jordanian Peninsula and it expands Beyond just what is mon what is Palestine so just a lot of it just comes from essentially propaganda miseducation even because even they'll send celebrities out to Israel you'll probably hear this on podcast and stuff some people speak out when they come back they don't ask you for nothing they just ask you to post on your media talk about how great Israel is talk about how good it is because who are they going to believe at the end of the day and yeah that's what they call Greater Israel y yeah they do those highly publicized trips they try to get NFL athletes and often they get you know who who are NFL athletes and NBA athletes there black Americans who know all about oppression so they come back and often they'll speak out and it'll it'll play against is really uh interest but those propaganda tours are are truly sick all right I want to introduce you all to a phenomenal anti-zionist uh historian but first the man the legend George habash the founder of the popular front for the liberation of Palestine I am indebted to my Jailer who kept me in solitary confinement for nine or 10 months thinking he would break me I spent that entire period res reading all of the collected works of Marx and Engles of Lenin also of hoi Min and Ma it was after that that I wrote the Declaration of the popular front Second National Convention so that's a common theme for us whenever we study about occupied Ireland and Palestine and the bass country when we studied about the Mexican Revolution so many times the books and the Declarations of The Liberation organizations were written in people's universities and what are people's universities they're the prisons where they lock us up for fighting for our people's self-determination so always notice the internationalist connections between the struggle in Ireland the struggle in paltin the struggle against imperialism across South America one more George habash quote since we're on the subject as long as you are still fighting in defense of your dignity and for your occupied land all is well just in case anyone was thinking about getting a tattoo and wasn't sure with the tattoo across their uh their back or whatever other body part all right so I want to introduce you to one of my favorite uh historians here we have Elon Pape I'm not sure if he can still go back to 48 because this is like the anti-zionist uh Israeli historian um they probably still let him back to have the pretense of democratic freedoms and that's one thing that boils my blood I'll be in an airport in Brazil or I'll be on an air airplane who knows flying from where to where and I'll bump into um Israelis or zionists and they just brag to me over and over about how Democratic their country is and I have to go to Israel and I'm like just you know so nauseous inside listening to this but they just think I'm you know your typical white guy from New York with my accent or whatever or Boston um they truly do believe uh many times their own lies um I always come back to the Soviets when the Soviets liberated trinka and aitz and Saxon hous and death camps they made the local Germans walk through the concentration camps but because the local Germans Up Until the End denied that any Holocaust had ever occurred against the Jewish people against socialist leaders against Community leaders against the poles against the Russians against the prisons of war against the elderly I mean the Nazi war machine was killing everybody so I can't help but think and this speaks to the typical Zionist arrogance any leftist activist any anti-war activists even left liberal right now are in hiding are doing interviews within Israel within occupied Palestine in in in hiding so that shows you just how Democratic it is as well as here so many of us are now under attack only because we spoke the truth uh against Zionism in this um War so let's share some of uh Elon pape's work he wrote a book called uh the 10 myths about Israel which is a mustre so he's interviewed here by Max Blumenthal for the real news good you that um and an event on the Israel Lobby and I'm here with Elon Pape um Israeli revisionist scholar I guess we could call you that um and you're coming out with two new books and I just got a galley of your latest which is called the 10 it's the 10 myths of Israel that's right um so what is the biggest myth about Israel would it be um you know a land for a people for a people without a land uh Israel is um the only democracy in the Middle East I mean what what do you think the biggest myth is I think it's very difficult to choose and that's why I didn't have like a top 10 I didn't have I I I chose chronology as the main uh regulator for the for the myths so I began with the land without people and people without land but I really think that the biggest Mist uh of all has to do with how each of this myth does not allow uh us to understand the real nature of Zionism and the project of Zionism and the nature of Israel to date yeah I think uh when you listen to Netanyahu and he's sort of this master of expounding on this myth that Israel's not only not a settler colonial state but that it's sort of a normal democracy that has flowered out of the Middle East almost organically because of the Jewish ancestral connection um and then when he talks about the conflict or I wouldn't even call it a conflict i' call it a crisis he always goes back to the Hebron riots he goes back to these events that um occurred before the state of Israel was founded for example um attacks on Jewish communities in yafa and never explains how those communities came there and what the real story was um so how do you challenge netanyahu's Narrative of um Jewish Arab relations in historic Palestine it's I think it's deeper than and Nan in this respect represents a very deep Israeli Jewish conviction that they are the indigenous people of Palestine and the Palestinians are the settlers they are the aliens yeah uh and and and this is the starting point the starting point is we are the indigenous yes we have we haven't been there for a few hundreds of maybe 2,000 years but we are the indigenous people of Palestine and from there everything else emanates and I think the way to challenge it is is really by using this Paradigm of settler colonialism because it was it's not exceptional for a settler Colonial movement to claim to be the indigenous people of the place that they occupy colonize and by often genocide it happened before uh in other places and I think that's something that uh allows people who either were victims of settler colonial projects or people who are part of settler colonial states like the United States but are very familiar nowadays with their own history and understand their own Origins to to understand that actually it's not exceptional it's not exception the only exceptional part of it is the denial not the very historical act itself yeah I mean a lot of these myths are actually just hbar arguments by uh in many cas cases morons for the consumption of morons but I found that in our world there are a lot it falls on fertile soil I mean the education system isn't very good in the west um so you have the um Netanyahu and I think you know this is kind of a common feature of hbor trying to draw a distinction between settler colonialism and traditional Metropole colonialism and you'll hear him say you know we're not we're not the uh French colonizing Algeria we have nowhere to go back to you know this is our homeland and we can't go back anywhere um you know what how do you how do you respond to that and you know I think you know one of the things that we um we've failed to do is explain how settler colonialism is in many ways more pernicious than traditional colonialism absolutely the exceptional part of the story is that settler colonialism made certain connections or made certain assumption which were accepted in the 19th century but looked ridiculous inhuman and non-democratic in the 20th century and yet in the particular case of Israel they still remain valid for instance the claim that the only way you can create a democracy in a country which has settlers and natives is if the settlers are always the majority which is the argument of the liberal Zionist not the uh not the right-wing Zionist the liberal zionists the whole peace process is based on the idea that the only way democracy can be sustained in Palestine is if the Jews are a majority in their own Homeland right so this is a ridiculous assumption that in any other uh context would be rejected as racist but in the case of Israel is accepted right and and I think that that's where the interesting part of the analysis comes into I think also in my book in the 10 minutes why educated well read people in the west did not see this or did they see it and decided to accept it for reasons of guilt uh anti-Semitism because they didn't want the Jews to stay in Europe God Knows Why everyone had their own reasons for that for the second uh uh point that you were making I think that it's very important to highlight when you talk about any settler Colonial project what Patrick Wolf called the logic of the elimination of the Native that you cannot create a new settler colonial society or a settler Nation State uh from the settler Colonials perspective as long as there is an indigenous native population there so you have to get rid of them genocide genocide them as you did in America or impose aparte and B them as you did in South Africa or ethnically cleanse them as you did in Palestine the means vary from one historical case study to the other the logic is the same logic and what is amazing is that this logic is still legitimized in the 21st century in the case of Israel under the guise of slogans such as the only democracy in the Middle East uh a country that wants peace but doesn't find the right partner for it and all the other mythologies that are connected to the peace process yeah all right Elon Pape you know why don't they debate him he was a professor in hia for years for decades I always wondered how he wasn't uh repressed he was also a leader in this left uh Coalition which I think is called hadash the acronym in in Hebrew of the Le leftist within occupied uh Palestine and if you ever have the opportunity to meet Max Blumenthal and and and talk Palestine um these comrades again uh prove that this is not about whether you're Jewish and not this has nothing to do with race or nationality or religion it has everything to do with the Haves and the Have Nots the colonizer and in the colonized as we just heard from this tremendous historian Elon Pape has been teaching in England for um the past few years if I'm not uh mistaken floor is open for any questions or or or comments um that's another book 10 myths about Israel that we can uh draw from I think what's going to end up happening in terms of um readings I think some of our studies of the true workingclass history of Jewish communities will probably flow into um Thursday and then so we're not always scrambling because as I said I'm often coming straight from the streets and straight from teaching and we need more hands on deck with with this book um I recommend you really read any two chapters that you want because it's going to begin to to give you more insights into Israeli society as well as uh haza and and in in the West Bank so I'm not going to assign a specific chapter but these are short chapters five to 10 page chapters mostly five-page chapters so any two um chapters that you decide for for Thursday that's that's one assignment um just so me and Sam aren't scrambling in in Daniel last minute and with this book I want to do the appendix um appendix a Israel base of Western imperialism so these will be the two big readings for Thursday just so you know beforehand and you're not stuck waiting on us to be able to scan it and everything so appendix a at the very end of the Palestine Israel and US Empire book appendix a is Israel base of Western imperialism I'll add it to the syllabus as soon as I can sit down and uh and and write any um any questions on the syllabus I put it wasn't required reading it would be very extra reading but on the syllabus for this week I put a reading on the history of of the uh Communist party in Israel and and and this goes back to the different strands of Zionism historically because many socialist Jews and that's what we're about to read on many socialist Jews had this idealist Vision that they would have their kabut and they would have their Collective and they would go to this Promised Land but then they arrived there with their socialist ideals and they saw Al akba that's that's the interview I did last night last night I interviewed um po Amos po he's a well-known film maker here in the United States in Amos po his family left it was an anti-zionist Jewish Family Israeli family his mom was from Czechoslovakia his father was from Germany or vice versa they fell in love in 1937 or 1938 ANUK kabut in uh Palestine but then realized that if they were socialists if they truly believed in equality how could they take the land of another people so they became anti- Zionist Jews and in protest well at first this is all in the interview that we did last night at Midwestern marks with um with Amos po but his his parents um no longer wanted to be in the military they protested because first they had to join the British army the British army was using all these recently arrived Jewish people from Europe who had survived the Holocaust or preh Holocaust and they were forced into the the British Army and then one day overnight it became the Israeli Army and many anti-zionist Jews rebelled and said they wanted nothing to do with this colonial ethnic cleansing Mission and they protested they went to jail or they left in protest so that was the story that we told last night so that we can keep bringing it back to this this this question that this has nothing to do with Judaism so the the the floor is open before we transition to the um what what are you saying Sam you can say it in human words I if I look at the chat I'll be gone I'll be distracted um there's this interview clip I mean you don't have to show the whole thing and maybe after the class is officially over it's just an interview clip of uh gasan kanafani from the popular front uh being interviewed um he's just he's able to just lay out very simply uh misunderstandings that the West has um and of course straight from the mouths of one of the more uh influential leaders in that that organization all right great find Let's uh queue it up and and here we go let's see what you all think so this is one one of the leaders of the popular front for the liberation of Palestine um there was recently just an interview with their leader who is I believe in uh Beirut now so let's uh listen to this leadership Beirut is the most westernized of all can you hear it how's the volume yeah it sounds fun d yeah we can hear it thanks Beirut is the most westernized of all Arab capitals the evidence of the French Colonial period here is as starked as it is in Quebec in the days of the French Beirut was a Mediterranean tourist Paradise still there are traces of this slowly disappearing past splendor but as surely as the Middle East turmoil keeps away the tourists it keeps away the business too especially the banking business that had made Beirut the financial capital of the Middle East now the Lebanese Army has tanks and Armored Cars permanently stationed on the foot paths outside all Bank buildings in the capital taking the place of the timid business executive in Beirut a new business has developed Revolution Palestinian Revolution Palestinian guerillas in Beirut are not like the Viet Kong here they're in no way elicit they're totally legitimate in beirut's Main Street the biggest Guerilla movement has a three-story office building complete with all amenities it's as modern as any in Sydney but the machine gun toting gorillas standing guard outside told me no photos and there was no arguing of the 11 Palestinian Guerilla movements the most radical of all is the popular front for the liberation of Palestine the pflp the popular front is now so well organized that it even has its own Daily Newspaper with a claim daily circulation of 23,000 it was a popular front that hijacked and blew up three jet aircraft at Revolution airport in the Jordanian desert and it was the popular front that dynamited the Pan-American jumbo at Cairo the bayout leader of the popular front is gasan canaani he was born in Palestine but fled in 1948 as he puts it from Zionist terror since then he's been plotting the destruction of both the zionists and the reactionary Arabs I know what I know really that the history of the world is always the history of weak people fighting strong people of weak people who has a correct case fighting strong people who use their strength to exploit the weak turn to the fighting that's been going on in Jordan in the recent weeks it's your organiz ation that's been one side of the fight what has it achieved one thing that we have a case to fight for that's very much this people the Palestinian people prefer to die standing than to lose its case we achieved we achieved proving that the king is wrong we achieved proving that this nation is going to continue fighting till victory we achieved that our people could never be defeated we achieved teaching every single person in this world that we are a small Brave Nation who are going to fight to the last drop of blood to put Justice for ourselves after the world failed in giving it to us this is what we achieved it does seem that the war the Civil War has been quite freak not a civil war it's a people defending theel against a fascist government which you are defending because just King Hussein has an Arab passport it's not a civil war well a conflict not a conflict it's a Liberation movement fighting for justice well whatever might be best call not whatever because this is where the problem start because this is what makes you answer all your question ask you all your questions this is exactly where the problem start this is a people who is discriminated is fighting for his rights this is a story if you will say it's a civil war then your questions will be justified if you will say it's a conflict then of course it's a surprised to know what's happening why won't your organization engage in peace talks with the Israelis you don't mean exactly peace talks you mean capitulation surrendering why not just talk talk to whom talk to the Israeli leaders that's kind of conversation between The Sword and the neck you mean there were no swords and no guns in the room you could still talk no I haven't been I had never seen any talk between a colonialist case and the National Liberation movement but despite this why not talk talk about what talk about the possibility of not fighting not fighting for what not fighting at all no matter what for yeah people usually fight for something and they stop fighting for something so you can't tell me even why should we speak about what stop fighting or or talk about stop fighting why talk to stop fighting to stop the death and the misery the destruction the pain the misery and the destruction and the pain and the death of whom of pales Ians of Israelis of Arabs of the Palestinian people who are uprooted thrown in the camps living in Starvation killed for 20 years and forbidden to use even the name Palestinians they're better that way than dead though maybe to you but to us it's not to us to liberate our country to have dignity to have respect to have our meere human rights is something as essential as life itself you call King Hussein a fascist who else amongst the Arab leaders are you totally opposed to we consider the Arab governments two kinds something we call reactionaries who are completely connected with imperialists like uh King Hussein government like Saudi Arabian government like Moroccan government Tunisian government and then we had some other Arab government ments which we call the military pji governments that's like Syria Iraq Egypt Algeria so on just to end with let me go back to the hijacking of the aircraft on reflection do you think that is now a mistake we didn't make mistake in hijacking them the contrast we did one of the most correct things we ever did wow thanks Sam thanks everybody anybody want to comment on all of that I mean great talking points if anyone ever shoves a microphone in your face bring it the interviewer was so deliberately dense it so annoying just hearing his questions he's just trying to like op you skate and change it and like that was ridiculous indeed with uh Clips like that you know if you can ever a screen record you know 30 seconds one minute and 30 seconds whatever is educational and then put them in the WhatsApp group we can share those on social media that stuff is phenomenal it's inspiring it's pedagogical anything you come across like that throw it in there screen recorded if you can yeah Danny if you were looking for a slogan he kind of said one in there the conversations between colonialism and National Liberation are conversations between The Sword and the neck like that's like you even you let out a whoop that was a good one yeah it's so funny the double standard uh you know how they say oh we don't we don't negotiate with terrorists I think they're justified in saying that but when they say it you know oh why don't you want to talk yeah same same logic yeah um someone put in the chat here uh yeah can you post the um WhatsApp somebody so people can jump in the uh WhatsApp an ongoing WhatsApp group that's always uh growing it's called reform or revolution with a big question mark until we find a better name for the WhatsApp group all right it's up to you all you ready to transition to yish land you're gonna love this history I promise so if we can open up to the introdu uction of this book um yeah don't dkl uh don't don't send it to me send it to uh Daniel or kin or somebody it's it's so much to keep up with or maybe there's an invite where you just click on it and then you become a part of the uh WhatsApp group okay thanks so I want to preface this by saying that myself I grew up with a ton of uh stigmas and stereotypes about Jewish people but I was always searching like the white working class is very backward in the United States I grew up with all types of uh racist language coming from cousins or siblings or whoever it was in the family I mean the older generation even worse so I heard the n-word from my aunt from my father from and of course the dominant um tropes you know you know about Jewish people were often things to do with money and and and and and being greedy and these types of things so we should always look at this history of anti-Semitism which is very real and all of the pgms which culminated in uh the largest pogm of all which was the Holocaust and there's a few amazing books on this that go into more of the history there's Isaac deutcher the Polish revolutionary who wrote the non-jewish Jew this is a phenomenal book if I just read the title of these books to Zionist today just the titles would freak them out so you can kind of hold this up like you hold up a cross to a vampire of course the invention of the Jewish people by schol sand another Israeli historian this is a phenomenal book this is a very academic dense book maybe we'll reference it in class three or four you know haven't decided yet the Jewish question by Abram Leon I referenced this in the first uh class but definitely the Jewish question is another classic because Jewish leadership workingclass leadership before the Holocaust they're trying to figure out these very questions what is the righteous Way Forward for different Jewish communities because it's not fair to say the Jewish people because some people who identify as Jews identified first as revolutionaries or socialists or internationalists or marxists and then they identified as polish second because they were born in Poland and they spoke polish but they also spoke Yiddish so some would say well first I'm an internationalist second um polish third I'm I'm Jewish others came from a more rabinal background a more religious background and said I'm Jewish first I'm polish second you know I'm leftist third or or whatever it was or maybe they weren't leftist so we should never think of Jewish communities as a monolith historically because they weren't and it's an absolute fabrication to say that every Jewish person was a financer or a money lender or a banker those are the stereotypes that were created by zaris Russia by Royal England by these ruling classes throughout Europe who historically used the Jewish population as a whing boy as a scapegoat so um a history of Jewish radicalism this is a book that I discovered because I went on research because another thing that I couldn't stand I always heard in seventh grade and sophomore year in high school that the Jews were always LED like Lambs to the slaughter by the Nazis but I knew in my heart of hearts that no people acquiesces before oppression Jewish people fought back the most famous example is the Warsaw Ghetto another famous example is the Red Army and the partisans and the role that the boond in different Jewish organizations played historically uh in Europe fighting against the zaris army fighting against the the Nazis so I went to Munich and I went to Berlin and I went to Dresden to research these very questions to challenge these different narratives and one of the conclusions that I drew was that there were different strands of Zionism and there were frustrated zionists and there were zionists who were Zionist idealists quote unquote until they saw the material reality in Palestine and they turned on Zionism but again they weren't monoliths some went saw that it was wrong but kept going because they had nowhere else to go and that's why we have to talk about the Zionist death trap I I mentioned this in the first class I think it was after the 1 p.m kind of official cut but the Zionist death trap even if Zionism succeeds in expanding and taking all of Palestine what about the Egyptians what about the jordanians what about the Lebanese what about the Kurds what about the Iraqis what about the Iranians Israel as long as there's one Arab person as long as there's one indigenous person as long as there's one Muslim person as long as there's one person like Max Blumenthal or Elon Pape or who ideologically knows the truth Israel can never be at peace and that's why it's such a militarized society no different than cesil Rose when they when they took Zimbabwe which was called Southern rodesia for a while when they took mosambi the aparti state had to be armed to the teeth by definition because a settler Colonial project exists in diametrical antagonistic relationship to who to the native people hence why you can never have peace with the oppressor as the representative of the PF LP uh laid out for us so uh in the introduction here uh I can read first and then let's get some uh hands up for volunteer readers introduction from revolutionary yish land on page Roman numeral 17 out of the 11 million Jews in the world as a whole Russia held more than five million scarcely a tenth of these in the countryside are outside the pale of settlement the pale of settlement is where the Zar the ruling class of Russia said Jews can only live there they weren't allowed to live anywhere else except in the very western part of Russia their movement was controlled sound familiar Anthony Montero did a lecture last night comparing um Israeli Society to Nazi Society so more and more Scholars are drawing those those links and around four and a half million pressed into the cities and towns of this uh territory then there's a ro footnote there that I think is worth reading the pale of settlement comprised 26 governorships where Jews were allowed to live but only in cities and towns Elie erlin and George deash G um so a lot of this literature came out in French and this was translated from the French but that's a book published in 1904 about the Russian Jews sour cited in this book this French Edition does not give page references um behind the double wall of this Territorial and urban ghetto the mass of Jews lived thought suffered and acted a whole world a complete Society with the requisite variety of elements workers and intellectuals Scholars and financers managers and laborers Etc so now we're back in Russia we're back in Poland we're back in Eastern Germany we're back in lvia we're back in Romania at the top of the pyramid a financial Bourgeois is in the west but without any influence below them a middling Basi intellectual and Commercial and finally an immense Jewish proletariat and unknown proletarian if ever there was one for this largest and most homogeneous class the mass that was truly characteristic of the nation the Jewish proletariat had all has always been ignored Bernard Lazer was quite correct in writing that only The Bu Jewish Bazi has been studied and the Jewish historians had only written their history of the Jewish Bui bisi for readership of the bgea Jews of their day so like all histories the poor people The Peasants the workers were ignored and if they're not WR written about and if they're not recorded how is that passed on then you have the arrival of the Holocaust where all of this history and the people who lived it were wiped out not all of them but a high high high percentage and that's when so many workingclass Jews were duped in into this Zionist uh uh nightmare so but it's important to go back to this history and that's why they eliminated the Yiddish language and reintroduced artificially the Hebrew language no one was still speaking Hebrew ex except for Torah Scholars the talmuds so Hebrew didn't have a a direct link to whatever Hebrew was because they always talk about we lived here 2,000 years ago the ancestors of the Palestinians lived there 2,000 years ago how could a Russian Jew in 1904 or 1917 the year of Revolution ever prove in their DNA that they could trace their Roots back to this this this this this Palestinian area just look at their DNA look at the color of their skin there's nothing that proves historically because they have a a certain belief system which is Judaism but they can't prove an ancestral connection to this land so that's why Elon Pape and if you listen to Omar speak that's why we're constantly battling against Zionism Zionism like capitalism it's it's it's wicked stepfather is a myth making machine so we educate ourselves so we can go to these arrogant individuals and point out the historical truths so um does someone else want to read on the on the next page let's get a few hands up yeah page two yeah I can read Danny thank you the Jew as trafficker dealer and money Merchant occupi the whole of the historical stage anti semites attacked him Jewish historians pleaded attenuating circumstances but no one wanted to see the proletariat the Jewish mass and this is still misunderstood these lines were written by uh Ellie eberlin and published by Charles pagui in his Cay in the text from which they are taken abin emphasizes the powerful organization of this unknown proletariat stressing that that this is where where the best fighters in the struggle waged in Russia for a better future come from he describes the organization and activities of the Jewish General Workers Union the boond that concludes governmental and public anti-Semitism systematically seek to reduce the Jews and especially the Jewish proletariat to the level of Paras despite this it is the Jewish proletarian organization that the Russian authorities view as most dangerous a few months later the decisive part played by this Jewish proletariat and its organizations in the strikes and insurrections that broke out right across the pale of settlement in the course of the 1905 Revolution would confirm Erin's observations the boond then reached its Zenith and Lenin himself paid homage to the combativeness of the Jewish workers whose struggle entered history but what is the position today as regards the Paradox mentioned by eand and that of the unknown Jewish proletariat and its struggle has history rendered its due has history rendered it its due quite the contrary this Paradox is today immeasurably greater reflected by the tragic dimension of the history of the last century the Jewish working class of Eastern Europe has disappeared swallowed up by this history and this disappearance is now duplicated in historical consciousness leaving a blank page it is not the stuff from which official histories and history lessons are made apologetic myths and images for popular consumption this working class this wretched overe exploited populace several million strong concentrated and very homogeneous in terms of its conditions of existence its traditions and cultural references its language no longer exists except through its survivors and Scattered traces this is a unique Paradox in contemporary history the 20th century is sadly rich rich in historical defeats blood baths of the working class from Germany in 1933 to Chile in 1973 not forgetting Spain in 1938 and Poland in 1981 but there is no other example of a proletariat that after defeat does not raise its head again one day and rebuild the network of its organizations its historical consciousness and its combativeness just this one the working class of Yiddish land erased from the map disappeared at the same time as the human continent in which it was the most numerous and most dynamic element set on a different future so let's take a big historical breath there because the Holocaust wipes out the Jewish proletariat it wipes out Jewish resistance it's one of the great tragedies not just of the 20 20th century but of human history the German capitalist system and the European capitalist systems fail the Jewish people and a lot of this history was never written because it was wiped out I mean Abram Leon got this book out at 26 years of age before he was deported East to Poland to the death camps so the zionists were able to take advantage of this Gap in historical memory in weaponized the Jewish bodies the Jewish survivors who walked hungry Starving in tatters with nowhere to go and they were able to say you'll never have peace here in Europe but we have a land where yes you will have your own land and your own you know it's like a military recruiter if you're going to go to sign up for the Navy or the Coast Guard you say well I want to be a mechanical engineer and the in the Navy or the marine recruiter says well there you go and pushes the the recruitment book back at you you're going to have scholarships and you're going to have this and they promise you the world so there were Zionist recruiters who had this Imperial foresight and this Zionist foresight that they could deceive these original Jewish workers and can you believe that the great grandsons and the great granddaughters of of of of of these people of this revolutionary people have been duped into being the foot soldiers today of the IDF and of an ethnic cleansing AP paride project just four or five generations removed a generation is roughly 25 years so we're talking a century or less this is still recent history so what we're doing right now is an act of collective resistance by resurrecting a history that the Netanyahu in the herzog's attempt to repress it's not enough just to repress the Palestinian people people who are a reminder of this history they have to repress the history itself including the carrier of this history which was what language Yiddish hence why the name of the book is revolutionary Yiddish land so this is a struggle for memory history is contested ground how do we reach the masses of workers across the US with this history because history is on our side but they control the media they control the the misinformation and they control the high schools which should truthfully be called Dropout factories next uh paragraph I'm just going to skip one paragraph in the interest of uh time there is no longer a Yiddish Land There is no longer a Yiddish land working class a point that it has long been unnecessary to emphasize but the many and sometimes Vivid traces of this vanished atlanti in the present is a blank aoid in Abyss created by the earthquake of History which no work of memory no testimony no scholarship is able to fill and so the imaginary the emotional and the symbolic necessarily enter into the composition of our attitude towards this vanished World an attitude that focuses a sum of his historical passions and emotions obstinately held positions sometimes still Vivid which very often and stand in the way of work of a work of Truth I'll just say another few things because uh like I said time is against us on the next page on page four beyond the historical trauma that dynamited their existence very sweeping language to describe the cataclysmic events of the Holocaust and in a new Paradox this remark seems particularly app appable to the witnesses and actors who speak in this book because they live in Israel in the historical geography of this country ironic and tragic Israel stands in many ways as the polar opposite of Yiddish land especially for a revolutionary Jew from Eastern Europe so some of the Revolutionary Jews who somehow ended up in Israel and were able to be interviewed for this book some of the revolutionaries became zionists some of the revolutionaries stayed because they were so old and they had nowhere to go and they were resigned but they were against the Zionist project so they interview all these 80 90y old 100 year olds who were born in Yiddish land who could still remember so I think this book is is is such an important one the Earth shall rise on New Foundations we have been not we shall be all that was one of the Yiddish land uh uh slogans of course there was armed resistance a rifle in one hand against Hitler and and in the pogis and a leafin and the other to free the Jewish people from capitalism and a symptom of capitalism or a tactic of capitalism which is anti-Semitism the three major currents of red Yiddish land they even called it red yiddishland remember Hitler would always say the Bolshevik Jewish comp conspiracy because many Jewish uh Fighters were leftists and that's why Hitler also targeted them um the three major currents of red Yiddish land the Communist the boond and the pole Zion this is on page uh six in the pole Zion were the ones saying we can build socialism in the promised land in in in in Palestine this double instability I'm on page seven now this double instability the danger in simply being Jewish in Eastern Europe This misery that was the everyday experience of the great majority of these communities if you want to watch this on film watch Fiddler on the Roof that's probably the most classic film which will show you what it meant to be Jewish in Eastern Europe during the pgms clearly formed the roots of the availability for revolutionary commitment of a large faction of Jewish youth in the early Decades of the century the enforced nomadism of their commitments expressed its lack of roots in this unstable world but also all the isolations of the Century's history uh Jewish fighters who joined the supposedly trist pum um they're talking about um the Spanish uh Civil War uh on page nine we will not make a fetish of the particular of the particularity of this red Yiddish land whose archaeology however partial and limited we undertake here they're saying how tough it is to write this book because most of the protagonists were were killed I'm GNA stop here at 10:16 because I have a hard stop in in five minutes I have another meeting that I have to uh attend I can't go till 400 am tonight sorry to break the news to you um I have a life tonight so um in our in our last minutes uh uh any any last questions any logistical things we're going to pick up on Thursday where we left off here I'm going to let leure from this book for a while if you were to return to this book because you're enjoying it I would say go right to chapter one so once you finish the introduction which is not a short introduction you can go right into the immense pool of human tears um chapter chapter one I don't know how much we'll we'll get to maybe some of the other readings will get pushed over into next Tuesday but next Tuesday is Halloween we're not going to have class on Halloween night I imagine people will be out and about and have social activities unless it's like a resounding demand we must be here on Tuesday night Halloween night I'll follow you you all's lead I don't have any big Halloween plans it's it's up to you all I'm just trying to be considerate the floor is uh open I don't know oh sorry go ahead I was just gonna say one quick thing uh why do we refer to rhia in the past tense you know someday hopefully we can refer to Israel in the past tense you know and you know for me I can't say Israel I always say 48 or Palestine occupied territory but if if I'm in like a formal meeting where I'm under attack sometimes I have to you have to give a little ground just to take another breath you know what I mean like same when they try to trap you with the whole stuff about Hamas you know you have to know who your audience is to contextualize is not to condone that's what I always do any any any feedback any comments any any clarifications do you see why it's important to come back to this suppressed history imagine when we throw this out at Zionist uh just two points um I don't know if people are aware but I was speaking with a woman from Turkey the other day and Israelis are buying up like whole parts of turkey and building communities for themselves this has been ongoing for many many years now um to the point where Turkish citizens are getting like pushed out of you know not being able to buy property in certain areas etc etc so Danny have you heard of this or anyone on the call I've heard of a few of those those different things yeah I've heard I've also heard of Israelis disgusted by what's happening andan if they have dual citizenship they're leaving to go back to the Netherlands or Germany so it's kind of their form of protest of course we would say please Pro stay to protest protest
