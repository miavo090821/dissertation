Bowman pointed out earlier on here, white supremacy and nationalism [and by extension it's extreme essentialist and fundamentalist and fanatical form, known as nazi-ism, whether in Germany or in the U.S. or in Israel where it's called zionism] and settler colonialism\n\nthese are just the M.O., the go-to modes of obvious and direct application, of capitalism's extremes and class-based injustice and classism 101, where it's everyone's plight being crushed, and the racial modes are the modus operandi, the quickest and most blatant and easiest to over-simplistically apply\n\nbut you/I/we can't fix the symptoms, if we never cure the cause of the disease and injury, it will keep being repeated over and over and over if the cause remains, which is rooted in the same depraved anti-human way of doing things, whether the most obvious forms of it are racially oriented attacks or otherwise, and as long as the forms that are otherwise are ignored for the sake of *only* addressing the ones that are *most* racially obvious (white supremacy and in its most egregiously clear form of anti-blackness, and all that means going back to anti-african-peoples and and being anti everything about the reclaiming of blackness as a vital and real culture now etc.), the solutions and victories in the realm of anti-racism will only be superficial, and will never last\n\nit's so hard to see this past all the scarcity-based crushing oppression that we all live through day in day out, but it's so important to realize, it's *humanity* that we share and that we are fighting for, in *all* the fights, and if we leave out any humanity we leave out all humanity, simple as that (in the good way of simple principles, sublimely true, proven over and over by history and experiential existence)",
