representative Bowman the first thing I have to ask you is who's an icon to [Music] you an icon uh Pauline Bowman my mother um she is an absolute icon no doubt about it for sure um who else is an icon um Malcolm X uh is an icon um Harriet Tubman is an icon uh John Brown uh is an icon uh gabber mate uh is an icon uh Angela Davis um man there's like a million of them but those are a few those are a few that come to mind beautiful I like that answer what made you get into politics it's where the money is uh and that's where and that's where the power is um and to be clear not money for me I mean the salaries aren't great in uh in in elected office I was making pretty much the same amount I made as a middle school principal uh in New York City but the money in terms of uh budget decisions as it relate to policy so money for affordable housing money for child care money for climate Justice money for Education money for you know substance abuse and harm reduction uh mediation uh money for mental health supports money for all the things the kids and families that I have served over the last 27 years of my life money for the things they need they're they're in they're in government and so one that's where the money is two that's where the the power and influence is you know when you think about why concentrated poverty persists in certain communities why we're not responding to the hurt and Trauma of communities why we don't even talk about reparations for black Americans it's because the the so-called leaders or elected officials in our government aren't leading those conversations aren't talking about it and so um I got tired of you know serving children and families who you know were completely ignored by our political system and I thought I could run for Congress and maybe win and possibly do something about it yeah I I'm glad you brought up your background in education because I was going to ask you about that because I think you were you're a principal and a teacher in the Bronx for like 10 years right or more 20 years overall uh yeah teach teacher and counselor dean of students for 10 years and principal for 10 and a half years beautiful and I know you had a restorative justice policy and of course like as an abolitionist that's everything I want to hear about to try to avoid the school the prison pipeline so tell me more about that yeah you know when I was a dean at MLK high school for Arts and Technology it was at the same time when Michael Bloomberg was uh mayor and Michael Bloomberg implemented this very Draconian very punitive very heavy-handed militarized uh police approach to our high schools and I was a dean at that time and so was pretty much following orders from my principal to suspend kids left and right whenever kids did something you know wrong um I also had to monitor metal detectors as kids walked into my school which was a freaking nightmare because you know MLK High School is right across the street from laguadia high school and in laguadia they ain't got no metal detectives you know kids you know I I take I used to take the bus and the train with kids and they be on their their I their iPods playing their games you know relax chilling and then go right into school without incident the black and brown kids on the train they a have none of that cuz they knew they would it would get confiscated um or they would have to turn it in before they went in so a little thing like that just adds a extra level of stress onto the lives of kids who have to go to school with male detectives and so I just got tired of that and then I had the chance to open up my own school and when I did I really tried to learn as much as I can about restorative practices and restorative circles and restorative justice it was already in me kind of innately based on my personal experiences but I wanted to learn as much about the practice as possible so that we wouldn't get into the habit of only using punitive measures to quote unquote discipline kids or to create a a quality uh School climate and culture and so yeah we we we got to the point after a few years where we didn't suspend any kids at all uh from our school um and it was all about restor of practices it wasn't that we didn't discipline kids but discipline is about teach and learning so they don't do it again it's not about disciplining and then over and over and over again that creates recidivism and to your point leav to suspension and leads a school of prison pipeline yeah how did you how do you try to bring that EOS to Congress and what's your experience been like in Congress because I know people like me have been really happy to see you there but then I also see when I think of the foolishness you've had to deal with when I think of like the alarm situation with a margorie Taylor green tell me what it's been like yeah it's been uh stressful frustrating interesting and empowering at the same time you know to come from where I come from you know single mom you know Addiction in my family you know all kind of violence Around Me growing up to you know being here now it gives me a lived experience that is really important to be in Congress like we People Like Us who come from where we come from need to be in Congress to inform those conversations and fact that I get to you know talk to you and you I just was visiting a school earlier and uh you know I Mentor young black boys you know a lot to be able to do that is empowering inspiring and very very important on the other hand the fact that we're not able to pass basic Common Sense human rights pieces of legislation like raising the federal minimum wage to $15 for example is very frustrating the fact that after the world rose up after George Floyd was lynched right in front of us and we still couldn't pass the George Floyd Justice and policing Act was infuriating the fact that if it's a bill supporting police or Israel it moves through Congress with the speed of light at the speed of light but anything related to food security or housing security or reparations for black people forget about we can't talk about any of that so that's that's been a frustrating and stressful part um and then big money in politics you know you got you got big money which is money from corporations money from the wealthy pretty much controlling how we govern like whether it's rooted in history or or rooted in fact or rooted in research I mean we have a system where corporations are seen as people and money is seen as free speech right and so how do you have a democracy when that's the case and that's why our democracy is hanging on by a threat right now oh that gives me so different I have I have so many different questions questions planned from you and that honestly touched on so many that I want to ask and so now I have to pick I have to pick which one that I that I want to jump off from there what do you what do you say to the people who feel like with all these threats that Dem democracy is hanging in the balance and they feel and the people who do feel like there is this Rising uh threat to democracy democracy especially with the possibility of a Donald Trump getting back in office but to those people who feel like the Democrats aren't doing enough to fight off the Republicans or to protect to Pro protect democracy what do you say to that I get it you know I understand right like it that's real like when people are saying that they really feel that way and they have evidence to feel that way and they are completely exhausted like they they are tired of people like me not like me personally but people you know people in my party or elected officials you know being incredibly articulate talking a good game talking about all the stuff that that they have that they have done and people are like yo I can't even afford to pay my utilities this month um I can't even I could barely I'm rent burning I'm paying 50% of my salary towards rent you know I don't even want to have a kid cuz I'm afford child care you know I I went to college I work 40 hours a week and I can't even afford to live right that's crazy and so they are right like I completely get it and Democrat I would make the argument that Democrats are do do let me say it this way Democrats govern better than Republicans like there is data to show this however it is not just about data it's about people's lived experiences so while we could say we govern better than Republican vote for us we we we can't say that we got to we got to listen and really understand what people are going through and then figure out how to govern better for them particularly most vulnerable people and just real quick back to my frustrations you know and you know I was I'm a I'm a child of Hip Hop I think you know that um and I always go back to the Tupac quote we got money for Wars but can't feed the poor and we spend $900 billion doll a year on war we spend we spend several hundred billion dollars a year on jails we give billions tens of billions if not hundreds of billion dollars billions of dollars in rebates to uh fossil fuel companies and and and and big Tech the private sector but we still don't have paid leave for families and we still don't have Universal child care and so we're not taking care of which is our responsibility in my opinion as members of Congress as elected officials we should be able to help provide for the basic needs of people and then they will contribute to our economy if we don't do that we're just going to continue this uh cycle of um poverty uh trauma depression violence hurt and lower life expectancies for poor people and people of color and I think we could just do much better that is beautiful and I wish more people were hearing that or hearing from people like you on the main stage because I think a lot of people are experiencing a lot of apathy a lot of voter apathy and a lot of like outright and rightful um rightful indignation about uh Joe Biden's handling of Gaza right now and to to that you were one of the first like I think one of the early the earliest people to call for a permanent ceasefire and you've experienced some real backlash as as a result right so I have a I have a lot of questions on that and I really want you to speak to what you're experiencing right now in your re-election campaign but what I want to ask first was when you made the decision to come out and call for that permanent ceasefire did you did you think beforehand this this is something that could cost you a re-election or something that was going to have an extreme backlash for you I mean I didn't really care um I'm not going to support a genocide and it was very evident very early on that that is what Netanyahu was trying to do it was either going to be ethnic cleansing which means move them all the hell out of Gaza so he can Annex Gaza and and in his mind Annex the West Bank he wants Palestinians gone whether that's through ethnic cleansing or what's happening now which the icg has called a plausible genocide um whether it's with missiles or with famine they are using both to kill the Palestinians not just Hamas the Palestinians so there was no way in the world um especially based on what I've learned over the last few years in Congress that I was going to support uh what Israel was doing right now and when the ceasefire resolution came to my desk you know led by my sisters Cory Bush and Rashid T of course I signed on as an original co-sponsor um because the other resolution that they were pushing was a complete APAC written uh resolution and and one of the first lines was um you know condemn Hamas for this unprovoked attack and and I stopped reading at that point I'm like well if we're calling this an unprovoked attack that means we're going to ignore 18 human rights organization calling Israel an apartheid state and we're going to ignore 75 years of military occupation which is illegal or 700,000 settlers expanding into the West Bank which is also illegal now I am not justifying the killing of civilians by Hamas on October 7th there's no justification it's just an explanation of what the circumstances were uh that led to October 7th and I believe then and I believe now if you want uh to end extremism we need a free Palestine so don't talk to me about you know two states solution we're not doing anything to to build a Palestinian state right right why do you think the Democrats and the Republicans are in such alignment when it comes to the handling of Israel right because you see this large large like public like out outpour and outrage towards and and it's not even just the people they call radical leftists like me you and me right but it's the it's the Centrist it's the Liberals it's people who originally started out being very uh Pro supporting Israel in this who are now like whoo so welome it is that despite all this backlash and this election happening we still see Joe Biden or the people making the moves that they're making yeah feels like to me the upholding of white supremacy and what white supremacy represents and the upholding of nationalism and the upholding upholding of sett colonialism which is what the US is Right which is what uh Canada is which is what Australia is um it it seems like they're upholding that idea uh as it relates to our support for Israel and they're couching it um and masking it as a support in a fight against anti-Semitism it's not um criticism of Israel criticism of Zionism is not anti-semitic uh I don't have a hateful bone in my body towards anyone I just don't like uh anyone who tries to harm me or people for no reason not because anyone's a particular religion or ethnicity or ethnicity or any of that that um and so we you want to fight anti-Semitism hell yeah I want to fight anti-Semitism I want to fight all forms of hate all forms of discrimination but that includes discrimination hate towards Muslims and Palestinians but we're not doing that we're choosing one over the other and when you look at this from a global uh perspective it's usually white Nations and people siphoning resources and land from black and brown people and this is not Jamal Bowman saying this these are historical facts if I didn't say this or you didn't say this it would still be true the problem is they've wanted us to be silent about it you know forever and for the rest of our lives be silent on it when you're not silent it's what's happening in my race is what happens you get called anti-semitic you get called anti-israel people think you want to eradicate Jews and all this stuff that is like come on man a nobody's saying all that it's about human rights and it's about our Collective Humanity period and and what are you experienc right now maybe tell the people who APAC is because I know some people are are not as informed as to the details and what happens in this and are not realizing like all of what you're experiencing or maybe the extent of um a role APAC plays and I was actually watching your breakf cup interview where I heard you break it down really well so tell people what's happening right now with the the backlash you're facing and what APAC is and the significance of them specifically going after you so APAC is a pro-israel lobby as a matter of fact Israel is their number one and only issue they want to make sure that the US continues to support Israel with military and economic aid for all time that's their objective and so anyone who is critical of Israel they uh Target and Lobby against so for example when I first got into Congress I signed on as a co-sponsor to a bill that just simply uh required Israel to give us an accounting of how our money is being spent when we send our $3.8 billion over there and uh and we wanted to make sure that that money was being wasn't being used to detain women and children and uh you know without without trial or without charge in the West Bank um when we signed on to this bill this is a bill that didn't even go to committee for for a markup didn't come to the house floor for a vote was never going to even be sniffed to be passed they sent over a thousand letters to my office uh forcing me or or or bullying me into standing with Israel quote unquote they shut down my office to the point where we couldn't could even do our jobs we couldn't even serve our constituents because of their letters because of their calls because of them protesting outside the office etc etc etc that's just one example right recently um not only did I boycott the president of Israel's address in congress not only did I vote against a bill that said Israel is not a partti saying Israel is not racist I had the audacity to call for a permanent ceasefire right and so they recruited um someone in my district someone a county executive in my in my community my district to run against me and they are spending more in this race more in this primary race than they have ever spent in their history to get someone out of Congress they have a 60-year history and they have pledged to spend a100 million to not just get me out of Congress but to get Su out Cory Bush out Omar out and me out summer won her race thank God she's incredible I knew she was going to win I'm next and my election June 25th early vote in June 15th so we need everybody everybody who's Progressive everybody who care about human rights particularly people of color particularly young people under 50 we need y'all to come out and support wow tell me wow it's incredible you know because I know about APAC and I obviously know about the influence in the the power APAC has but it wasn't even until recently I heard in an interview you talk about um how APAC has supported like funded many of the campaigns of people in Congress right on both Democrats and Republicans and so that influence is huge that influence that influence is is huge also I know um you you've also had like these attacks these mailers right where they've been darkening really darkening your image please tell us about that yeah I mean that's That's a classic uh racist attack in um campaigns it us comes from right-wing Republicans but it's coming from a uh Democrat so-called Democrat now who's running against me but yeah the mailer uh with the darkening of my skin to make me look scarier um but it hasn't only just been the mailer it's also been you know after our first debate there were um people from my district commenting under my opponent's Facebook posts saying that they hope I have a stroke and that and they refer to me as a thug and he did not condemn what they said and all he did was simply take it down he also said that I take money from Hamas which is a terrorist organization right um to which he when someone told him to show proof he sent them a Free Beacon article which is the most right-wing crazy psycle article you could get so you know the credibility there shot but you see where he's getting his information from but then also APAC targets 85% uh people of color in their in their uh in their campaigns and they're funded by right-wing magga Republicans who supported 109 uh election deniers in 2020 so APAC is a magga racist organization right now right um that is that is who they are and so because I had the nerve to speak of a Palestinian humanity and and and let the world know which everyone should already know that Palestinian lives are sacred and precious as well you know APAC is pushing back and pushing back hard $10 million in three weeks they spent on ads in my district that's more than President Biden has spent all year wow on his campaign so that's how much they threatened by the black man you know how it is and and it's interesting right because I see I see that especially like being in New York I get to see a lot of the ads like literally before we started this interview my boyfriend was at the gym and sent me a video like one of those campaign ads attacking you in blink playing at the gym so it's interesting right because you're part of the squad and so you get a lot of criticism from all angles you have the the right who the right and a lot of the centrists and liberals who think you're leftist radicals and then you have the actual left who thinks you're not Leti is enough who who wish you were a leftist radical even though you are getting all of this criticism and all of this backlash from even like you said like a lot of this even like the apack is from your own competitor on the Democrat side so how do you deal with that how do you navigate all that criticism uh I do what I'm doing now uh I smile uh I smile because it because it's fascinating I mean on the one hand you know if I weren't standing up for the right things I wouldn't be getting attacked yeah so the fact that I'm getting attacked reminds me that I'm standing up for the right things um and thank God you know I I try to eat right and exercise and spend time with my wife and family they keep me grounded that keep me happy um but like we got to stand up for justice we got to stand up for Humanity we got to stand up for equality we got to fight for that it's our job it's our responsibility like we we are taking a Paton from civil rights leaders they took the Baton from abolitionists like we we they took the Baton from slav rebellions right that's why I talked about John Brown you know what I mean like so so it's kind of our responsibility to take the Baton and move not just America but Humanity forward um in a direction that helps us to evolve you know I mean I just want to live in a world without War you know I want to live in a world um where every child has access to clean water and and and and health care you know and education I want want to know what that world looks like what that world sounds like what that world feels like the world we live in now man is a world especially with social media just accelerating it's like a world of apathy and despair and and and and and oligarchy you know and so we got the wealthy powerful Elite controlling everything and the rest of us we're either accepting of the Matrix and plugged in and just going along with it or people like you and me where Freedom Fighters with the people their resistance who are super frustrated and stressed by this whole thing yeah what do you I'm not of this mind but I see this uh uh comments a lot from black people in my comments so I know there is at least um a population of black people who feel like what's happening in Gaza or what's happening with Palestinian people is not our fight not our problem and that they not only should they feel like we shouldn't be dying on this hill but they feel like we are hurting um black people being able to get our issues to the top or if our Messengers or our Advocates are getting you know attacked or cancelled or losing their spots because they're speaking up for Gaza what do you say to those people yeah I disagree um I I think that you know we are we should not we should not have a scarcity mindset right it is not you know us versus them it there there is enough there are enough resources in this abundant world to fight fight Injustice on multiple fronts right but even bigger than that and more important than that fighting for Palestinian lives and rights is a fight against white supremacy yeah and the ideology of white supremacy and so it is a collective fight we are not going to defeat white supremacy or The psychosis of whiteness if we uh take a crab Barrel deficit scarcity thinking approach yeah I understand and I get it because you know white supremacy has made things s so scarce that it seems like you know we got to get ours before someone gets theirs but that's playing right into the hands of of of of white supremacy and so we could fight for a free Palestine and fight for an end to the genocide in the Sudan we could we could fight for free Palestine and fight fatig uh we can fight to end child slavery in the Congo but the thing that the thing that the in order to win that fight we have to beat white supremacy right and so and so we need a coalition of people to defeat that um but I get the frustration it's the same argument where we're like immigrants are coming taking things from us well even before IM the new recent arrivals got here we a have nothing anyway so it's not like they come and take from us it already wasn't there they already redlined our communities they already won't give reparations we already deal with mass incarceration we already deal with police brutality we already deal with housing discrimination through appraisals and home values and and and taxes and other thing we already deal with that that's not the immigrants doing that that's white supremacy doing that yeah yeah absolutely right and because you brought it up I I now I got you brought up the immigrants and now got to say something about the migrant crisis because you know our beloved May Adams is a big vocal proponent of a lot of this kind of xenophobic rhetoric that's been fed to us on feeling like the migrants are taking from us right like that's a lot of what he's offered for why he's cutting budget cuts and because of the migrants what do what what is your response to that like what are the J what kind of job do you think our mayor Adams is doing and what do you say that people who've been embracing this the xenophobia hey you said you said you was GNA ask about migrants now you want me to assess the mayor's job you open the door I disagree with the mayor um on this issue uh we have a very different politics um and so I don't I don't I don't think he's correct on this issue and I don't think he's correct on many other issues I think our governance should be rooted in human rights and I think if we root our governance and human rights that means we take care of all vulnerable people at all times times and then the people have a responsibility the people's responsibility is to give back to society and they give back through taxes paying taxes they give back through starting businesses um they give back through helping us to keep our community safe all of the above but his thinking in my opinion again that def deficit thinking that scarcity thinking that thinking of someone who's a certain type of form of law enforcement um person um is all about you know Crime and Punishment US versus them you know good guys bad guys is very binary and so when you have binary thinking you seek Simple Solutions through a binary and and and the world is more complicated than that 50 Shades of Gray you know one of our most famous books and movies and nothing to do with gray but metaphorically it did right so but you know so I disagree I I just think we weren't doing well for black people before the recent migrants got here let's talk about that and let's be honest about that and let's use our resources collectively city state country to make sure poor people brown people black people vulnerable people have what they need if we did that the American economy would would go up by 30% because you have less people in jail and you have more people contributing you have less people uh you know needing Health Care Services because they're healthier because they're less stressed they have a better quality of life right yeah so America has only scratched the surface of what it's capable of because it's it's been mostly a nation for white men to to to to reap the rewards of their own genocide and enslavement right and so we have to reimagine America rooted in our Humanity rebuild it in a way that doesn't require continued genocides like what's happening in Gaza right now that's a beautiful answer that you um I think I think a beautiful way for you to to evidence that right because a lot of people when they hear you talking about one issue especially talking about a a Gaza they think okay that means your energy is focused here and you can't do this and you're not thinking about black people or other groups so what have you done while you've already been in Congress what have you been able to do for black people specifically but also just your District in general yeah yeah I mean my district is a majority minority District you know so I'm very proud to represent a majority minority District especially as a Blackman in America so we brought in just to give you a few examples um over $40 million to reduce gun violence uh in the district which is a major issue in 2020 because of covid and it's still a major issue today so we invested directly in violence interrupt interrupting programs violence reduction programs excuse me to deal with that issue gun violence we brought in several Millions more to bring to the school system so they can Target as risk kids and families to support them so that they don't pick up guns in the first place right so that's in Newell uh School District that's at the newelle um YMCA Boys and Girls Club you know we we've done that there we've supported Workforce Development programs uh in the Bronx in Yonkers areas that have been historically marginalized historically nor we support food Security Programs in the district we support mental health programs through a a program called youth here with the Westchester Youth Shelter um as well as the Andros program in yers uh we put in 2.5 million to million to build a new uh Bronx Health Community Network uh in in on White Plains Road in the Northeast Bronx and I just came from visiting uh another program that we gave $2 million to to help children who live in shelters in the BRS and you know those kids are mostly black as well so that's what we've done locally nationally I'm a I'm the co-sponsor and Lead author of the African-American history act you know uh these Republicans all over the country trying to ban books uh in schools and you know and and and suspending kids because they got dreads in their hair and all kind of stuff the African-American history act seeks to ensure the accurate teaching of black history in our country um I'm an original co-sponsor of the uh reparations resolution led by my sister Corey Bush which seeks to invest 14 trillion doll uh to give African-Americans reparations which comes out to 330,000 per person it's very interesting how much I've been criticized for this bill um of course mostly by non-black people but they're like oh you know how we goingon to pay for it we can't afford it it's unrealist even my opponent is like it's unrealistic how my opponent is saying it's unrealistic and black people still thinking about voting for this dude it's really uh really unbelievable so that's those just a few things I've done uh since in Congress what limitations have you been surprised about in Congress right because like we never know how these systems are going to work once we get there what were you shocked to find out yeah I don't know if it was a shock because I didn't really know what I was walking into you know I just kind of went with the flow um but in terms of limitations I think that's a good word and good way to ask the question so we we I don't have a budget as a congressional office right they're not like here take $50 million a year disseminate it how you want that's not how that works I wish but it doesn't work that way um so I don't have a budget and I'm not an executive and and I think people uh sometimes get confused by that so the mayor is an executive office the county executive is an executive office the governor is an executive off office so as the executive they can set the agenda agenda for the state county or city right and they can set their budgetary priorities for every level of government members of Congress can't do that we're only legislators and so whatever we do we do in the confines of the entire Congress and through our own hustle and elbow grease and you could definitely leverage say it again you slinging mixtapes yes exactly to get stuff done all day all day right and so and that's fine I'm a middle school principal that's how I used to do things and that's just what that is but that that was that that has been like you know a learning curve and and part of my frustration that like damn I wish I could because the reason why I ran for office was to like do stuff right like get stuff done not just be in Congress for 30 years and become chair of you know a committee and then maybe move the needle forward a little bit on a particular Bill like no like like I mentioned federal minimum wage is still $7 and something an hour uh we still don't have Universal child care we need to invest in affordable housing we haven't done that in 30 years right and so we got things we need to do right now and so one of the frustrations is Congress moved too damn slow and and and because of its uh institutional discrimination and racism uh it doesn't move fast enough particularly for black and brown people what do you say to the people who hear that and think yes exactly that's why we shouldn't be engaged and we shouldn't vote and we shouldn't participate and we should give up on election Al politics altogether yeah the opposite is true like one of the reasons why institutional discrimination continues is because not enough black and brown people are voting um and and I'm not blaming you know our people for this because often times you know we don't have the information to be an informed voter like we don't know who's running we don't know what they stand for we don't know when the election day is um you know people don't go out of their way to tell us who they are are um and we working we going to school we got families like we we run all over the place so part of it is that the other part of it is um you know this idea that the system doesn't work for us so why participate but the only way to make the system work for you is to participate because if you know for if if if uh the white Community is voting more than the black community just to just to make it a binary so people can really understand and that White Community is then actively engaged in our democracy that white Community is going to get more than right and so I tell you my colleagues don't pay no attention to people who ain't voting like why would they like I'm not going into your community I'm not walking your neighborhood I'm not doing any of that for what y'all don't vote these people over here they vote all the time so I'm going to them I'm doing whatever they say so that I could get voted back into office by them yeah right so so you gotta you got to participate and you got to vote but it's not just vote it's accountability once you vote me in how are you working with me to hold me accountable and then to help me do my job as a member of Congress that's that's our Collective responsibility I promise I only have a few more questions you keep giving me like good questions to ask based on what you're saying right um what do the what do we say to the people who feel like listen I voted for a Joe Biden who I wasn't that excited about I voted for a Joe Biden because I was Voting against to Trump but now because of what Joe Biden's position is on Gaza I feel like Joe Biden is indistinguishable from the threat that I'm supposed to be worried about from a trump what do and I now see not voting for him or at least proclaiming that I won't vote for him as holding him accountable right what do you say to them I understand um I respect and appreciate that because uh especially if one is Palestinian right or or Muslim um by extension and even Christian Arabs uh it's the same family right um so I I completely get that and understand that and I actually don't know what to say to y'all because I really get it I can't even you know I watch it on Democracy Now Al jaer social media you know you see bab infants burned alive right and rashita T is not just a colleague she's like my friend you know she's like my sister and she's the only Palestinian voice in Congress and I and I experienc her pain with her as she goes through trying to work with my colleagues who don't care anything about Palestinians so I 100% get that um it is not it it is different as it relates to domestic policy specifically Trump has said that he he is in favor of mass deportation he's in favor of Muslim bands he's in favor of using military to respond to Peaceful protests he's in favor of quote unquote getting rid of the radical left he's in favor of being dictator for a Day quote unquote some of his heroes are Putin and others right so Trump could be the Hitler of our country for black and brown people if he got in so I believe he's incredibly dangerous incredibly dangerous and I also worry about um militias and how empowered white nationalists will be under Trump you know they may be you know he may give birth to another a thousand Dylan ruths you know um and all these other people who commit mass shootings in black churches Jewish churches Muslim churches right um so so he's he's a he's a clear and present danger um and then the last thing I'll say is you know again selfishly as a Democrat if Democrats have all three you know house senate and white house we can actually govern we can like we can't govern right now with with uh with Republicans in control of the house and then last time Trump was in there like his major accomplishment was the Trump tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans trillions of dollars and how does how does that help us the check that black people got from Trump last time uh that was a check that was negotiated by democrats who controlled the house and the Senate they we passed the bills that that gave the people that chck but Trump put his name on it Trump is the ultimate you know snake oil salesman you know used car salesman like he's a he's a colonizer right and manipulator and so you know he makes things seem like they that they better than they are and because he's so anti-establishment and many other people know the establishment needs a change he gets a lot of support I agree I I I really I really do agree with you and I I guess what I want to ask is what do we do or what do yall plan on doing and how do we move I guess a Joe Biden more left when it comes to policing when it comes to how they respond to Gaza because I think there are specific things is unfortunate because I know a lot of democrat politicians or a lot of people who are running who are politicians under the Democratic party who are doing good work who have who have values like mine like yours right and what they what they do and what they fight for especially on the local level gets overshadowed when what becomes the representation of the Democrats is what a Joe Biden is doing is what you see with uh these college campus protests where you have in blue cities where they're sending in um police and so I think when you see a Joe Biden say okay we need to give more money to policing or do these things it makes it harder for people like us to make the argument like oh there's a difference between what uh um Donald Trump plans to do so what do we do how do we move what do you to do yeah that's another thing too so if he's there and I'm there after this particular election um you know the longer you work with someone on the more of a relationship you have with them and the more you can engage them and push them on a particular issue I know my colleagues have talked to him directly about this issue um and I know my office is talking to him directly about this issue by this issue I mean Gaza specifically um on the policing thing yes we need to move him on this issue however he's 80 and he's been in office for 60 years and he kindy of setting his ways on a lot of this stuff but this is where the Electoral politics comes into play there are 30 Senate seats up for grabs in November 30 yeah and you know my race is getting a lot of attention and it is an important race because it means so much uh in terms of what I represent and what they represent but yeah if we don't win more Senate seats as democrats for example we don't have a shot to pass anything related to police reform or voting rights or anything you know the president might be able to move a senator or two with some leverage but can he move 10 to get a bill I don't know if he can move 10 I've been in rooms where I've heard and seen people on my in the house tell President Biden no and you know like no I'm just not going to do it and so you know in the Senate you got you got it's 50/50 but you need 60 to pass a bill that's another thing I don't think people really know it's not like the State House State House you need a simple majority in Congress is 6040 which is the filibuster which is why we got to get rid of it um so so to your point I understand why we spend a lot of attention on the president but we got to look down ballot and we got and we got to be engaged in down ballot races because if we instead if we instead of Joe Mansion if we had like a Jamal Bowman or someone even in the middle of us we could have had Universal Child Care Universal prek pay leave affordable housing we could have so many other things and so don't just look to the president you got to look down ballot and we got to hold Senators accountable just like we hold members of the House accountable okay I promise I have two final questions okay got you my my my last question is is just going to be a good one for you to go off but I I I I thought about so one more question is to the people who say okay well when Democrats did have the majority when Democrats had it and they didn't do enough to protect Reproductive Rights or to codify a row or something like what do you think to that and what do you think to people who feel like the issue of the Supreme Court is I guess too far gone our Democrats are not willing to do to to have a drastic enough response like a pack the court or something what do you think yeah so um the issue of Reproductive Rights was completely gutted by the Supreme Court not by members of Congress um Us in the house we in the house uh passed um the Women's Health protection act to codify ro Wade in the house it did not move in the Senate because once again in the Senate we need 6040 not 5149 which is why we need to get to get get rid of something called the filler Buster in the Senate um which we could save that conversation for another day but that's what stops us from getting from having a 5149 simple majority to to pass legislation in the Senate the Supreme Court needs needs complete um completely completely be revised um reimagine redesign complete completely redesign um it's too small needs to be larger um they we need ethics reform so someone violates ethics they need to be removed or disciplined Thomas yeah exactly right and and we need term limits in my opinion um because these lifetime appointments uh rooted in a a particular way of thinking over a lifetime is not is not helping the American people expanding it is critical because this non-member supreme court has been in place since like 18 something like the late 1800s and that's when the United States was 30 million people we have 330 million now so they don't even have the bandwidth to uh to respond to the cases that come before it they have to pick and choose right and so Supreme Court is is as it's currently constituted is obsolete our democracy as is currently constituted is Obsolete and too controlled by um corporate interests um so we need to get big money out of politics like right now you could have someone could put $20 million against me they don't even have to report where the money's coming from that's crazy wow right so so that get big money out of politics end the filibuster so we don't have um minority rule in the Senate and minority rule simply means the Democratic senators represent more people than the Republican Senators because they're in smaller States yet their votes in the Senate carry as much weight as the Democratic votes that's minority rule that is not uh democracy um and and then and then Electoral College reform you know in terms of you know one one person won vote um and and one person one vote would mean that Trump would have never been president in the first place right and I know we got our problems with Hillary but I think she would have been you know better than Trump and and we could have moved her uh to the left as well even though she also you know sometimes you know sometimes I hate trying to defend the my party quote unquote cuz uh man yo they be saying some wild stuff boy I'm like come on man why are you Wilding right now that's wild cannot say that it's crazy okay my last question my last questioner what are the core values and missions of your platform that you want voters to keep in mind when they think about you on the 15th and the 25th um Equity equality Humanity um Community love Vision opportunity um you know we have a democracy that is hanging by a thread because we don't govern from the perspective of humanity or Equity or equality um we have no vision for what's possible we don't have radical beliefs about the future of the American people that's rooted in uh equity and equality for all people and so that's what we need like we have to you know I talk about reparations reparations is about repairing the harms of the past right to build a new future that's what we absolutely need to do and you know because of my background because of where I come from you know uh that shapes how I govern right like my raised by a single mom and she worked in the post office and I was a teacher and my wife's still a teacher like we work in class with you know that's what we are we're working class and so I govern from the perspective of the working class and helping the working class is what's going to move uh the district and the country forward my opponent is a puppet for APAC like he's he's literally bought and paid for by them and their Republican donors and he'll say or do anything to win for them and then number one issue is Israel not the Bronx not Mount Vernon not Yankers not new relle it's Israel and so we got to elect someone one who um you know did Inc I've done incredible work in education even before getting to Congress versus a lifelong politician who's bought and paid for by APAC hey you know so yeah beautiful thank you so much representative Oman this was wonderful thank you
