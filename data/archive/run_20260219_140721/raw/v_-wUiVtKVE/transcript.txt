all right do we have Sean what's going on oh we do Adam oh all right I am sorry okay um yeah yeah just bring it okay uh ladies and gentlemen Sean Fitzgerald is joining us uh Sean I was just telling the story of um uh before we got into the fun half of of how you you were on with uh when Emma uh viglin went on to a temple show uh you were there I guess um as a third guest um and my understanding after I got back from a wedding I saw on Twitter that I was not responding to you apparently and I guess ultimately found out that you had challenged me to a debate on Tim's show also asked me to go out to dinner but yeah and I figured you know 50 you know uh baton 500 percent is pretty good uh baton 500 so we do this not so much in the dinner uh but um and uh I asked you I I reached out to you on Twitter and I asked you what you wanted to debate me on and you said my main issue is that I've seen you downplay the significant increase in crime in New York City and Nationwide since 2020. the excusing of crime by blaming poverty uh Emma did so in person I do not have an example of you doing this offhand so your position can be different and then individual cases Daniel Penny and the Jordan Neely case uh and or the Jordan Williams case um so uh you know we will we'll we'll have a debate about that but let's just uh let me in let you introduce yourself uh you you call yourself the actual Justice Warrior and my understanding is you are a uh you're you're you you're a criminology expert have you uh so I I don't have a degree in criminology uh I have two degrees in criminal justice it's a like Petty distinction but I don't I don't try to get into qualifications that much because I don't think they matter I think if you're a learned person you studied it you studied you're an expert on crime I I know a bit about crime I wouldn't call myself a like perfect expert or anything of the sort okay I mean I I just I I bring that up because I don't I I have not uh spent uh you know uh I think probably the time that you have looking at this and I just want to give you uh credit for that no thank you and as for the people hitting you up listen I apologize in the DMS in advance I did not I did not Stoke that other than issuing The Challenge on Tim's show but you know it is I was not complaining that you were not responding I still get tagged by people saying that you didn't respond no matter how many times I clarify that's how the internet works but we're here now no I uh believe me I don't that you don't you don't need to explain that to me that that's uh it happens all the time yes we are here now and actual Justice Warrior how did you uh come up with that uh moniker um so I I'm I'm a big believer that any qualifier to like justice tends to invert it and make some kind of Injustice at the time that I created the channel it was when social justice Warrior was the term du jour among the right and I made the name I kind of regretted it immediately but I've stuck with it for years because you know you got to commit to something yeah and so economic uh justice you don't like that uh that that terminology either no okay uh what's that um all right uh all right fair enough okay so um uh make your case here about um what what is the issue you have in terms of me downplaying the significant increase in crime in New York City and Nationwide since 2020. what uh give me a sense of what uh it characterize how you perceive my uh how I've downplayed that and uh what's problematic about it so I've heard I've heard this point from Emma and specifically from you on your show in response to the recent uptick in crime that crime is not as bad as the 1990s which is true by the way compared to the peak of America we're significantly down from that Mark however we've had a giant increase in crime since the black lives matter riots you can actually trace it in a lot of places to the month of the riots where we had certain criminal justice reforms implemented that I believe are really driving the uptick in crime so Nationwide we had a 30 year-over-year increase in the homicide rate this is the largest increase in American history the second largest increase in American history is actually 2000 to 2001 and what's significant about that is that's only 20 and that includes three thousand people killed in New York City on a single day so it's the largest year-over-year increase in American history New York was actually ahead of that curb they increased 47 year over year and to get into the raw numbers for New York City it went from about 312 homicides we were in and around 300 and 300 murders in the city of New York per year to 489 I think that's a significant increase I think the argument that it's not as bad as it ever has been is a terrible argument and I've heard a lot of people repeat this in response to what is a notable increase in crime okay so um I I will agree that if from in 2020 and in 2021 um we saw increases in crime uh certainly year over year without doubt um you're you're you're neglecting to say that those numbers are now going down I mean because when we talk about the most recent figures really those numbers are going down so we have this this peak of crime that was pretty big um like you say in 2020 and in 2021 you um measured it to uh the black lives matter protests yes I also noticed that during 2020 and 2021 we had a once in a lifetime pandemic that sure um also created massive uh unemployment that also created massive spike in pedestrian deaths uh that um also provided a massive spike in inflation there were all sorts of phenomena that and also massive spikes in deaths uh around that are attributed to the pandemic but from your perspective the pandemic was not this is not a function of the pandemic this these spikes in crime were a function of the black lives matter protest is that do I understand it's really the after effect of the protest but to be clear the after effects we can we can talk about the decline but this is important because what you said is like it's misleading so crime has declined since the increase in a lot of places from 2020 to 2021 but it's declined in comparison to the increase so New York as an example no no no no no no you're misstating that it is I said it it decreased year over year at this point yeah year over year because you're talking about you're not like you're discounting when the peak of crime in this country uh or a decade ago or or or two decades ago and you're using a year-over-year increase and I'm saying that we're now in 2023 and I think you you you wouldn't you wouldn't argue against this we have experience now a uh a year over year uh decrease both in New York and nationally in uh like five out of seven measures of crime I think in New York the only crime that has really gone up is uh car theft uh but homicides down uh but down compared to what year over year yeah but pre-2019 we're still up if you compare it yeah no there's no doubt in fact we're also up in inflation but inflation is going down so I just want to make sure that people understand the Dynamics also during 20 uh 2020 and 2021 we had this huge spike in deaths from covid and that's also going down we still have more deaths from covid than we had in 2019 but we're talking about a trend in terms of it's going down and the reason why this is important is because your argument seems to be and and I wanna I wanna get back to the cause of this Spike according to you your argument as far as I I can tell and what you just said was because of the black lives matter protests we had police reforms you would call them not reforms but no they're reforms Okay police reforms that created this Spike so to measure whether a this Spike was a function of police reforms we would have to believe those reforms have been reversed this year for the things for the crime to go down now I I'm going to take issue with even the fact that there were police reforms that caused this but that's why it's important that we all understand what's going on here in terms of crime it went up in 2020 it went up in 2021 and now it is starting to go back down it's still not at the level it was at 2019 and I can see that but it is clearly going back down you will concede that yes uh well yes depending on the area but also nationally 22 numbers because the 2023 numbers are incomplete well yes but at this point six months in seven months in in New York are they up or down from last year year over year it could very well be true that they're down in comparison very well true this is a hard number these are actual hard do you want NYPD puts out their data at the end of the year and we're at the summer and that's usually when the spikes come out take it from June just the six months I do you really not know those numbers you know those numbers if I have those numbers you have those numbers come on 2023 what crime am I looking at look at the top seven crimes I mean I don't understand how you don't have these numbers if I could find these numbers this is not what I do I don't talk about crime that often like you say I downplay it as far according to you and uh the fact is is that crime numbers are down I mean people can Google this uh look here's here's a story from patch nearly every major crime in New York City dropped shortly new stats show this is from the concept yes there's a decrease in 2023 and homicides are down three percent from June 2023 to last year June 2023. um what you're looking for I can go find it okay well I'll read I have it here New York Times uh shootings in New York City dropped this is July 6th so this this is this data is uh you know three weeks old uh shootings in New York City dropped by 25 through the first half of this year compared with the same period last year extending a downward Trend after a spike in violent crime during the the pandemic um what else do we have murders rapes burglary burglaries decreased by about 10 each robberies fell nearly five percent but car thefts increased like I said by almost well it's 18 but nearly 20 percent felony assaults by six percent don't I can't tell whether that's class D or Class B Transit crimes uh have fallen nearly four percent uh this year um I mean you know this stuff so I I just want to be clear what we're talking about the the yes we have a slight decrease after a dramatic increase that is true okay it's the overall crime index appears to be down total I think it says three point something percent but Major Crimes obviously greater disparities right okay so now since we've and we should say this is a nationwide Trend it's not just New York City true but the homicide Spike was ahead of the Nationwide curve in the city of New York and we cannot we can talk about other cities like Philadelphia is a good example they're actually at their P homicide rate all time so there it actually is worse than the 1990s okay and uh but also again going down um but with that said let's talk about now your theory that there were all sorts of well that there let's start with just there were reforms uh after um after uh the the 2020 because your argument is it has nothing to do with the pandemic right not nothing I'm sure it's a factor but what level how big of a factor would you say because you clearly think that the primary factor is the George Floyd protest yes the George Floyd effect would be a better a better phrase for it yes okay the George Floyd effect how much just give me a sense of um of like how you break it down 50 George Floyd effect in 50 pandemic no right it's more uh I would say a good portion I don't know if it's specifically like 50 if there's a hard number but if you want to say I don't know 50 to 60 I think that's totally fine because there were some reforms that were instituted prior that combined with reforms afterwards probably made individual areas worse okay so uh all right so what what reforms are you talking about so in New York City we had raise the age which was actually passed before prior to George Floyd and year over year we actually saw and raise the age if you don't know actually makes it more difficult to prosecute youthful offenders in the city of New York when was that uh instituted I believe it was passed in 2017 it could have been passed in 2018 I'm not exactly sure no wait a second and when was it instituted I guess is really what I meant I believe it was I believe it was instituted in 2018. so but but your whole argument is I mean you pegged it literally to the month for sure if you want to talk about what caused the increase in shootings in my opinion removing the answer he's going by what you said and when you said there was this big spike in crime in 2020 well it was because of the George Floyd I just said that there were some reforms that were passed prior to and combined with new reforms I think created additional problems so use the race the kid the the the the age thing had like a delayed effect like uh no no so raise the age made it more difficult to prosecute youthful offenders now we had bail reform which actually came into law in 2020 which made it more difficult to hold people on certain charges including gun possession when combined with raise the age that led to a spike of youthful offenders carrying guns however this didn't really come to fruition until Bill de Blasio got rid of the anti-crime unit which was the unit designed specifically to Target illegal guns so it's a Confluence of factors that led to an increase in youth shootings and youth homicides in the city of New York what now how did those um I'm just going to stipulate for the just the moment that that's why we saw this spike in New York how did those reforms in New York implicate the spikes that we saw Nationwide because we really did see spikes Nationwide didn't we so there are different reforms that we can we can go to that are passed in different individual areas so every reform that was passed around and this all these reforms went when right at the George Floyd protest we were talking about New York but there are different reforms that were passed Nationwide some areas talking about causality and I'm asking you we know that crime went up Nationwide and you say it was in June of 2020 specifically in June July of 2020 when they got rid of the anti-crime unit in the city of New York okay no no but at the beginning of this entire debate I mean if so Nationwide one of the biggest factors I think driving crime Across the Nation would be the decrease in the police force so we had a lot of officers retire early this is something that we're seeing across the country the NYPD seeing it the LAPD is seeing it rural departments in Middle America are seeing it and a decrease in recruitment because they're not pulling the numbers that they actually want to see so I think Nationwide if you're talking about a blanket thing that happened that led to an increase in crime then I think the decrease in the overall police force is definitely a factor okay so I I okay I just wanna I'm trying to like zero in on this because you said at the beginning of this debate that you Peg the spike in crime as a the George Floyd effect yes and it was the George Floyd effect in your mind that caused the decrease in Staffing uh police Staffing and that's why crime went up in the in the nation in New York it was part partially the Staffing and then partially these other reforms that some of which were two years earlier and had a delayed impact yes some of these reforms well it's not a delayed impact combined with other reforms it's like breaking a it's like breaking down a house there are certain support beams that you could take you can knock them down and the house will still stand the structure will still stand but if you knock down enough of them they'll fall and New York specifically I was talking about the difference that I see between the National Crime increase and New York specifically okay so yes there would be additional factors there so you're you and and really what we're talking about is causality here right because my argument is that the pandemic led to a spike in crime largely there may maybe other uh factors uh but but I would say overwhelming the the overwhelming factor in the spike that that led to the spike of crime was the pandemic you would argue it was these police reforms particularly in terms of Staffing Nationwide well the Staffing was just officers retiring Bloomberg okay okay Bloomberg uh uh from Bloomberg this is uh this is a report from uh January 31st of this year okay Bloomberg News analysis shows that even as Staffing levels drop during the pandemic nationally Police Department headcounts exceeded those of 15 years ago when crime was higher okay now how can you say that the causality runs that as you drop to Staffing levels um things Spike when in fact you're you're still at uh levels that are higher than they were 15 years ago in major city cities Staffing levels Rose and fell over that period with some changes corresponding to economic downturns and local crises which you'd imagine but between 2011 and 2019 police Staffing levels in more than half of the 20 largest cities grew according to fbai data and across the country so if we're to use your standard of like don't compare crime rates today to the way that they were when crime was really high in the country then why are you doing that with Staffing levels well you can compare it to the peak if you want but if we're talking about a recent crime Spike I don't think that's useful on top of that you just read maybe you didn't realize it that CR that officers went up between 2011 and 2019 this would be before the pandemic and crime was dropping Nationwide during that period of time then we see an officer shortfall and to be clear what we're experiencing now we're still staff we still have more but we still have more not all officers who's retiring it's disproportionately older seasoned investigators and they are not so easily replaced by new recruiting classes and I've gone over this specifically in the LAPD exactly who they're losing and they've lost between six and eight percent of their police force now I believe it's six net eight total and most of those are seasoned investigators and so okay so the the reason why so that's why we're not solving crimes is that what you're saying it's not preventing crime investigators don't prevent crime right they solve crimes I mean they're not only investigators a lot of times either I'm sorry I'm just going by what you said you said investigators and that's why this is an investigators they're seasoned investigators understand you know this stuff better than I do I'm just trying to understand your logic you say seasoned investigators is why crime went up that's because it's a harp on like an individual term and all that because you think oh I'm gonna get him pinned but I'm speaking very clearly I think everybody can understand that I'm doing that but you're just playing dumb no I'm not playing dumb you say investigators and I say well wait a second they don't prevent crime they solve crimes is that Am I Wrong it would also be supervisor positions and all that yes so it'd be very like Savvy seasoned officers and investigators and so if you need that specifically clarifying reforms what reforms were a function of the George Floyd protests that got seasoned investigators to retire it's not a specific reform but the effect of driving these officers into retirement is undeniable just look at the numbers since the George Floyd riots it's also covet right no a lot of people are tired across I mean a lot of people they're still retiring at similar rates you think they're all afraid of covid well did George Floyd uh uh protests ended two yeah there's still effects of that Protestant and sentiment in the country yes oh I see the it's so it's the sentiment that has an impact for sure officer morale is very important and so their morale is down because of the George Floyd protest yeah because of the George Floyd protest people are very anti-police officers a lot of them had their funding cut and a lot of officers left when the funding was cut and they're not so easily replaced by a restoration your argument is that uh funding has been cut is that it yeah funding was cut in certain places yes I've got a story here from ABC 7 New York it says funding was restored yes funding claims police funding has increased in many cities and this was in October of last year yeah so what do you think that increases attributed to what do I think it's attributed to yeah why do you think funding increased when they initially reduce budgets ABC owned television stations examined the budgets of more than 100 cities and counties and found 83 percent are spending at least two percent more on police in 2022 than they did in 2019. yeah so what ended up happening was post the pandemic post the George Floyd riots you had a defund the police movement and cuts were made to budgets like for example the LAPD now their budget was cut a bunch of officers left the force like I said net six percent possibly eight percent again the numbers update monthly and then you have officers to supplement for that working overtime and now you're less productive when you're working overtime but if you look at the lapd's budget it says defunding and there's stories about this how defunding the police actually led to an increase in payout of overtime so you still have less officers working and now they're working more hours so you're investigating investigating you're also getting poorer results well again it's also driving down recruitment so yes less officers less overall staff at at these places so yeah they might have and and again some places cut the funding and then in 2022 notice how you skipped over 2020 and 2021. no I just read what it said here because we're comparing 2022 to 2019. but that doesn't bring people down that doesn't bring people out of retirement no no you said 20 this this current fiscal year compared to 2019. there was a funding reduction in a lot of places in 20 in 2021 right and the restoration of funding and an increase in funding in a response to an increase in crime but that does not make officers I understand no I understand your your argument is and I think there's there's definitely something to that that uh stat Staffing levels uh dropped and so we made up for it on overtime again I I go back to that Bloomberg report that Staffing levels are still significantly higher uh than they were um uh 15 years ago okay and there was even uh uh more crime at that time um yeah there was and we have 80 percent of the city's largest increase their funding uh and like you say that I guess is uh a a function of uh of overtime cops still on the beat but you say that they're not as good you cover a lot of workers issues when you actually have mandatory overtime and people are forced to work more and more hours it's not productive well I mean you would you would say the same thing here we talked about it in other labor context that's correct what are historical figures of police uh solving crimes solving you're gonna have to Define that metric uh clearance rate so clearance rate it depends on the crime homicide is typically higher in terms of clearance rate because it's easier to solve most people are murdered by somebody that they know there's a dead body you don't have to worry about a lot what are those rates um I'm I'm not sure Nationwide I want to say maybe it's 60 to 70 percent for homicide Nationwide but it varies greatly depending on the city and have those dropped in certain areas for sure Nationwide I'm not 100 sure but I do believe that and what about the other uh violent crimes that we're talking about ones that don't involve people that we know give me an example well um uh assaults what's the Investments would be assaults would be lower for sure I'm just curious historically I mean if your argument is that the the cops are less productive I'm just curious is like can we see that in actual numbers I mean I can look up real quick the drop in clearance rate Nation why'd I know that it is significant in certain places like Baltimore but uh I don't have those specific numbers on hand it's weird I I mean um FBI said five percent of police arrests uh on on violent crime that's what the FBI figures are so in in 1980 71 percent of homicides were deemed solved or cleared and it dropped to about 50 in 2020. in 2020 and what was it in 2019 I'll have to I'll look it up right now I mean because that's the whole premise right and so will you uh work I mean well you you're looking that up I'll give you a moment okay so it would be down from 61 percent it's down in 2020 from from uh 61 from 2019 and where are we at uh like give us like give us the the range so that we can actually see the pattern that you're you're uh suggesting I just said that the the clearance rate went down to 50 in 2020. and where was it 21.3 degrees 2021 should continue right I mean if the theory is correct the that that should continue I mean there might not be updated numbers for it but I will I will let you go I will look for them all right well you know don't worry about that let's we do we do tend to get some criminal justice related stats later okay now uh okay according to NPR which is not the same as I was using for the source it dropped below 50 which is considered a new historic low and in certain major cities like Chicago it has dropped till around 30 percent now why doesn't that correlate with the Staffing drops that we see what do you mean well there's just there's no correlation between the numbers that you're talking about I'm just curious because you're arguing that there was something happened in June of 2020 that caused this spike in crime and we don't see any correlation between and and and you're not suggesting you're suggesting the George Floyd thing cause how would there not be a correlation if I say officers are retiring an early recruitment is down and then we see a dropping clearance rate to around 50 from 2019 61 and now NPR is reporting that the 2021 numbers how would that not be a correlation on murders which is the the the uh murders which you say is the is the easiest one but the and is it back up I mean we have the Staffing levels are returning correct no they're not they're not is that right the spending is returning but the spending does not make officers materialize and again there's a difference between an officer that is a veteran of the force versus a new recruit I mean I just read the MPR thing that said the clearance rate is at historic lows now again that's according to NPR initially I was looking at the FBI stats they could be pulling from a different number and therefore it could be less reliable so I will I will leave that out there but you know you did ask me to pull it up on the Fly and what reforms uh do you attribute to uh the George Floyd effect I mean you mentioned uh two reforms that uh that took place uh prior to the George Floyd protests uh what what what uh what what uh what what are the reforms around the country do you see that took place I mean that you're saying that there was a retirement and you're blaming it on the George Floyd thing you don't blame the mass retirements that we saw across the board on George Floyd like in other professions like in teaching professions for instance like we're seeing a lot of uh retirements in teaching you don't blame that your retirement's comparable to that oh in terms of the numbers oh I think they're right because they're there's an overall increase in retirements in the country because we have a bunch of baby boomers retiring for sure that exists but officers are typically younger and there's a lot more early retirements then teachers I think you'll find that with teachers uh people are retiring before they're actual they're leaving the profession um and so they're they're you know retirement may not be the right word they're going to go on and work other places but you don't attribute that to the George Floyd effect um unlikely right um and and the same across the board with like all the the uh the great resignation that we heard you remember that term yes that that's not a function of the George Floyd effect yeah I mean that's typically young people not wanting to work it was at Peak when unemployment was paying actually it wasn't that they didn't want to work it's that they were quitting jobs yeah and they went on to different jobs I mean I'm just saying like you are zeroing in on on the the George Floyd protests for this uh for this decrease in Staffing in police forces across the country yes and you're completely in an increase in recruiting pool and you're uh you're ignoring the the pandemic as uh an effect although the pandemic has this effect everywhere else I think I think the pandemic plays a role and sure you would have had officers leaving maybe earlier in the pandemic when things were starting to lock down like that's definitely a possibility but there's a continuous decrease in officers in early retirement that is coming even till today and I don't think that they're worried about covid and what are we August 2023 right now um like it's possible they could be they you know they could be masking up right now what percentage of uh police in New York City quit because of uh vaccine mandates are around the country was it I think the number for police for vaccine mandates was extraordinarily low I remember a lot of right-wing people saying that oh all these officers were going to be gone but when push came to shove when the Mandate was implemented and I think you even covered this on your show a very few people actually quit the fire department and quit the NYPD now if you're saying that's different then I mean you know I I could no I I I go rewind it it's a genuine uh it's a genuine question okay so and your argument is that less police causes more crime but you're also arguing that we haven't staffed up how is crime dropping if there is a causal effect in terms of numbers of police why did it go up in 2020 and go up in 2021 go up in 2022 but now is dropping despite the fact that we haven't hired all these police back so in the preliminary numbers for 2023 we've seen a slight decrease is that what you're trying to hang your hat on right now yeah I'm saying that we know that the trend is going down and you're making a causality I mean it's still up in comparison to 2019. I understand but the Staffing isn't back up are you saying the trend is going down you're looking at it reliable numbers that you can grasp on to to say it's going down let me ask you this okay I turn on the air conditioning in here let's pretend our air conditioner works and I turn the air conditioning unit on I turn it to 66 let's say and the temperature starts to drop in here and so I say hey that is why the temperature is dropping because I turned the air conditioner on and then the next day the temperature keeps dropping because I have the air conditioning on but the third day the temperature starts to rise and the air conditioner is still exactly where it was before does that make sense that the air conditioner is the cause of the temperature dropping that the air conditioner caused the temperature dropping yeah because it goes up if the temperature goes up on day three and the air conditioner is doing the exact same thing it was doing before how is it possible oh it could be the external temperature and that maybe the air conditioner hasn't been working at all and maybe those first two days it was actually cooler and on the third day it was actually warmer and that's what's going on so you're saying that he says if like covid was acting on on well again you keep trying to hang your hat on covid-19 I didn't say covid-19 played no role I said exactly the opposite but I think no no I'm hanging my hat as it was on this once in a lifetime pandemic that has caused all sorts of learning deficiencies in kids that has caused uh increase in stress that has caused mass resignations mass retirements increase in in in in deaths increase in pedestrian deaths increase in inflation increase in uh in destruction of of uh of of all sorts of sort of elements of society and you're making a difference different argument that that had less of an impact and I'm asking you if you're making a causality argument about these reforms that supposedly took place in the wake of the George Floyd protests or the effect that it caused Staffing then how come it's reversing itself without any of those changes again it's not reversing itself you're overplaying your hand it is reversing itself it's going in the opposite direction that is the very definition of reversing what we could do is actually look at the City of New Orleans because I happen to know that New Orleans cut their police funding well before the rest of the nation now this had nothing to do with the George Floyd protest or anything like that this had to do with budget uh implications and for the years I believe preceding 2016 they froze their budget up until around 2019 where they actually cut their budget now all the experts and nerds say that the New Orleans PD needs about 1100 officers in order to maintain order now now they were at around 1200 before these budgetary Maneuvers ended up going into effect and now they're in the high 900s and they saw a crime increase from prior to the pandemic and they went from a city that wasn't the top 10 most violent cities to on Pace last year for around the number one or number two slot I have not looked into exactly where they ended up so they had a dramatic increase in crime that preceded the pandemic due in large part to the fact that they cut their officers 911 response times went up and all of these other issues associated with that so we have a beta test that we can look at a specific city in the United States that implemented these policies before the pandemic if you want to go into that well uh let's look at let's look at a broader sample than just uh New Orleans in 2016 uh we had a group of criminologists who did a systemic review of 62 earlier studies you're aware of this right and of this specific thing you're bringing up right now no they were between it was a four size police four size between of crime between 1971 and 2013. they concluded that 40 Years of studies consistently show that quote the overall effect size for police force size on crime is negative small and not statistically significant okay um I mean that's that runs contrary to your theory right that yeah at least four size all numbers it's how you utilize them for instance New Jersey had their police I believe it was the uh the Trenton police and their Union had negotiated a deal that was so absurd that they could only put 12 officers out on the street and in any given night they actually had to dismantle this this was cited by John Oliver as an example of defunding the police reincorporate as the Trenton Metro Police Department so they could put more officers out on the street and we've known since the Kansas City experiment and you can look this up that sending officers to a targeted way can just disrupt disperse and drive down crime rates so yeah obviously it's how you use them if you just have more employees remember a lot of these places have non-officer employees they have Administration staff and all that that's not going to have an impact and there are other policies that you can Implement that also play a role um okay I mean you have these specific things about different cities but you can't explain the national Trends in any way nationally before you cut me off way earlier I was going to talk about the first step act now this set a tone in the nation it was signed by Donald Trump the evil orange man it's one of his stupider policies and it sets up incentives and of course any change in culture federally tends to trickle down nationwide for to for people to go soft on youthful offenders to release non-violent offenders early which is a term I absolutely hate because non-violent criminals can be more devastating than any given murderer depending on the circumstances I always like to say Bernie Madoff never punched anybody in the face but he ruined more lives than most serial killers in the United States of America with this financial crimes so yeah I don't agree with that policy which was a nationwide policy and I believe the first step act may have been slightly before uh Floyd I don't remember the exact date but I have a feeling it was after when it was signed by Trump you don't know when that took I could look it up right quick but but Sean how can you pause it to me that this had an impact and it all happened and you don't even know when it was implemented well I said it's in and around that time I don't remember exactly when it was passed it could have been in and around that time um what do you mean what do you think about that there were certain reforms that were instituted prior that were combined with other reforms or terrible district attorneys or similar that made them go into effect remember the analogy about the house and the support beams yeah no I remember that analogy um what is your answer and I'm sure you have one um we all know that uh this guy uh kids of Boudin right in uh Chase uh boudin in San Francisco was one of these reformists right yes what do you make about um what do you make about the uh the the rise in crime in San Francisco since he was replaced by the police Union's uh Choice the new district attorney yeah well there are some state laws in California that they have to get around like one of the stories that I covered recently was a man that was arrested for 77 burglaries or I'm sorry convicted are those are these new laws since uh Chase of Boudin has been I believe I believe that they are yes so you believe that they are what laws are they uh I forgot I don't know the name of it but in California if you're a non-violent offender they don't if you're categorized as a non-violent offender they actually don't put you in prison you have to go to county jail but County jails did we see similar rises in crime in LA and Sam Yeah we actually saw we actually saw a dramatic increase in murder in La as well since since the time that kiesa Boudin left office since Chester well I'm talking about since 2020 I didn't realize that's what you were specifically asking well I mean because Chessa Boudin is an avatar uh and and he left in a year ago he's an avatar for the reformist he leaves and then crime pops up across like four or five different measures categories are you referring to in San Francisco violent crimes I mean we can pull it up here in a second hello hello yeah I can hear us vehicle theft two attempt 0.5 homicide 23 robbery 13 percent yeah there are other problems in other factors for sure and again when Chessa buddhim was in office he fired and I believe it's called the Friday night Massacre or something like that he fired a bunch of seasoned district attorneys or assistant district attorneys in his office like you know that happened right and again you know those people took other jobs and again you know they don't just materialize out of thin air when they replace the prosecutor right so there are impacts that go beyond that I mean if we were talking about any piece of legislation like you know you you talk often about the impact that Ronald Reagan had on this country well if I said well Bill Clinton was President in the 90s therefore that Ronald Reagan impact doesn't exist you would not accept that argument but weirdly you're trying to put that forward right now for me well I mean for you the impact happened in June of 2020 right around the time of the ride not for me for the statistics that's actually when it started to spike right that would be accurate and just the moment that people started protesting but George Floyd crime goes up because of its Downstream implications like time flattens and expands for you in terms of the winter officers are afraid to do their jobs because they feel like they're being they're going to get prosecuted unwarrantedly and you know like officers that do commit crimes should be prosecuted to make that clear then yeah that that could have impacts if officers are leaving the force at record numbers if early retirements are up and you're losing your most seasoned people investigators are not Sam then yes that would cause an increase in crime um and you're going to ignore the meta-analysis about uh the the from police Journal about the uh this relationship between uh well you said it was a systemic review and I'm not ignoring it I don't think just expanding your officers or your staff and police on its own is any is anything it's what you do with that like one of the great Innovations in New York was that they became one of the most data driven police departments in the entire country so yeah they had a lot of officers because it's New York City it's the largest city in the union but it wasn't until they implemented programs like comstat that they really were able to be effective well what do you mean by effective like I'm I'm producing crime in reducing crime but I mean have they reduced crime like how do you uh assess that I would use statistics to assess that right what statistics what would be your metrics because we know we know that like for instance during like uh when before marijuana was made legal we know that for every four times you know uh there was like four times the amount of arrest for black people over uh white people when they smoked a pot right I mean and I know just from like you know the uh um uh it's anecdotal of course but um I see uh you know some people get away with stuff because they live in a wealthy area let's say and there's just not as many cops around they're still still doing the exact same uh crime right maybe it's underage drinking maybe it's a smoking pot on the street uh I mean they're still involved in the same thing but they're not getting arrested okay so as for the Marijuana arrest the Manhattan Institute actually released a report where they broke down the neighborhoods in New York City specifically which you know the four times number comes from New York City but it is elevated in other places which I will address later on and what they ended up discovering was that the biggest indicator on whether or not people were going to be arrested for pot is if they smoked outside and neighbors complain so while disproportionately a lot of Black and Hispanic neighborhoods ended up with higher rates of marijuana arrests very notably a story of Queens which is a younger population that is not typically a black population and was also elevated due to the fact that they had complaints so for that specific arrests which you're talking about arrest now not a measure of crime uh that is actually explained and one of the ways it's also explained is by the fact that if you have areas with higher rates of violent crime you know Murder assault homicide rape Etc and you deploy officers to those areas the officers have more opportunity to see and smell things like marijuana thus would indicate an increase in arrest so you know I wasn't talking specifically about marijuana when I talk about crime I'll usually talk about the crimes that are measured by The Uniform Crime Report or by the National Crime victimization survey or homicide statistics specifically because you know I'm not somebody who's in favor of the drug war or whatever so if you want me to say people shouldn't be arrested for pot sure but that represents a small portion of what the police actually do and again it's not what we're talking about when we're measuring Major Crimes okay um all right so let's just we can we can move on I mean your argument is that uh it was the George Floyd effect that created uh the spikes and crimes and that the drops in crimes are a function of what the drops like I said we have a we have a slight drop after a dramatic increase so you know it's within uh you know a lot of these drops that you're talking about the NYPD I pulled up the data is something like total crimes is about 3.9 as compared to last year so that would be like a normal range that flows year over year that's not like so you're suggesting that this is that that crime's not actually dropping that it's it's more No it's it's it dropped it happened and I'm glad that it happened I'll wait for the completed data the victimization surveys at the end of the year but yeah I'm glad that it's happening of course oh no I didn't say I didn't I didn't say that you weren't glad but again increase no I understand it's a drop after a dramatic increase but there's been nothing there's nothing has changed for you if the cause in My Story well certain things well but this is Nationwide my story is my story is covid did contributed to this Nationwide spike in crime your story is that the George Floyd protest were they were the uh primary function in the journey during the lockdown crime actually dropped okay and well yes during the lockdowns but covet still was still around everybody I'm saying before the people got out and started rioting crime was dropping during the pandemic I understand okay you know you're making your argument I think it's clear and I'm saying that the reason why crime is down nationwide and it is down you say it's not much but it is trending down is because that coincides with Society returning to some measure of normalcy after covid is not killing as many people and hospitalizing as many people and causing the same measure of stress you say the reason why crime is is dropping a little but definitely statistically measurable is because I need to wait to the end of the year to see if it's real no no it the say it's dropping but it's like within a a normal range it's like if if I were on your show and I said I don't know in 2019 homicides in New York were 299 and then they jumped to the number 312. that's an increase but that's not a significant increase it's within the range we're talking about 13 people now on you know obviously those are lives lost and we should consider that but we also have to take into account that New York is the largest city in the in the world now you're pointing out a similar decrease to that increase and claiming that it's like this dramatic drop but it's just no I'm not claiming it's a dramatic drive it seems like a normal trained as we would see year over year I hope it will become a trend but one year it's not a trend yeah the trend is dropping yet the problem that you attribute the spike to is not changed at all well in in specifically in New York City which is and hold on specifically in New York City which I was just referring to we had a situation where they elected the most tough on crime Democrat now I'm not a big fan of Eric Adams but that is how he ran and he ran about putting more police off onto the street we also have nationwide a lot of these District Attorneys like Chessa Boudin now you said crime has gone up in San Francisco uh I don't know what I said it is but they got rid of him so they're trying to Institute some levels of reforms but obviously San Francisco police they're down in terms of recruitment obviously California state law sometimes state law has a dramatic impact on these specific things even though it doesn't have it on others hold up the house of of the criminal justice system so those need to be changed but yeah so it depends there are some reversals I think those reversals are good but in places where they're doubling Down Like Larry krasner in Philadelphia they're still at record homicides they're not record in comparison to 2019 record all time worse than 1990s the favorite talking point of the crime denialist the uh the okay the um yes people who deny crime yes that's who I'm sorry what do you mean by deny crime that they'll try to minimize and deny that the increase is happening do what you did with Marijuana arrest where you complain where you assert that it's possibly due to arresting bias even though that's not how we measure crime we measure crime in reports and then we do victimization surveys and then we have homicide statistics we're actually really good at measuring crime so pointing out arresting bias is wait a second you just said like we're really good at measuring crime but if you see the statistics are trending down they're really that's not I didn't say I didn't say they're nothing I said that they're there but they're within a range that we have now gotten into a new normal so they're good I'm always going to root for Crime to go down but what I'm interested in is getting to that all-time low way back in time in that far off year of 2019 and I think you have to Institute the policies that existed in 2019 we haven't even talked about incarceration you know that prison population is the in the United States of America and that also seems to be tied to the increase in crime uh not in Connecticut not in Connecticut in terms of population decreasing or no no not in Connecticut in terms of as uh their prison uh population has dropped dramatically they have instituted all these reforms and crime is also dropping dramatically in Connecticut how do you explain that I would have to look up the crime sets for the state of for Connecticut because you tell me that I well here let me uh four percent decrease after a dramatic increase is a dramatic drop and that's just not true but I'll look it up well let me uh let me just uh uh pull this up I have this somewhere here this story about Connecticut uh it's pretty dramatic people are pretty excited in Connecticut my understanding is um here let me get that for you you can look that up too I think it's a pretty well known story I'm surprised that you I anticipated that you would know about that one yeah I don't know every single state in the Union offhand okay I'm in Connecticut's right next door to us okay um where is my Connecticut story bear with me one second in the meantime what's that probably Sunday oh okay um violent crime in 2021 uh down 43 since 2012. a reported crime mostly burglaries fell by 29 during that period uh but get me that uh get me the I had oh wait here it is sorry this is uh from uh oh this is from yesterday all right July 27th uh in 1999 Connecticut had so many people in prison had to send 500 of them to be incarcerated to Virginia that's uh part of the story there uh the state's uh um uh rate of 155 people in prison per 100 us that residence is now the ninth lowest in the country well below the national average of 350 people per 100 000. uh violent crime decreased 43 from 2012 to 2021 property crime sank 29 during the same period the state Unleashed a range of changes this is under uh Governor Malloy in 2011. so it means long-term trend State unleashed the range of changes including repealing the death penalty bumping the age at which juveniles could be charged as adults from 16 to 18 for most crimes I think you were against that one in New York eliminating some sentencing guidelines that affected predominantly people of color um they have now been able to close I think a bunch of Prisons um he said this is Malloy who's now I guess a um Chancellor of the the University of Maine system not only the state built too many prisons but had a mix of old buildings and new prisons Built For maximum punishment instead of facilities where people could be rehabilitated uh in 2016 Malloy they went to prisons in Germany and they came back and they did this I you must I would imagine you would hate this uh it led to the creation of a true unit at a correctional facility truthfulness to oneself and others respectfulness towards the community understanding and elevating into success it was all programs to Mentor people and uh they have been sending less people to prison and they have less crime so why would you think I would hate a rehabilitation program I just seems super soft now uh first of all I want to do smart things on crime I don't want to just be cruel for no reason if you told me if you told anybody in this country that you could take a criminal and make them a productive member of society they would sign up for that easy like obviously the problem is that Rehabilitation programs that have bad data around them one of the things that I'll actually commend London breed for over in San Francisco is in a recent emergency crime Bill she actually pushed for you know studying the way that these programs work now in terms of the state of Connecticut they might have had the crime drop according to you I'll take your word for it but I do want to point out that the report that you're highlighting a big editor's note in it is that it glosses over the fact that clearance rates have actually dropped in the state of Connecticut it was 16.7 going into 2020 and now it's 24.4 oh sorry 23.4 so it's had a dramatic increase in clearance in the unsolved crimes okay so there are problems but you know yeah not like everything has a marginal utility so just because reducing prison oh just because increasing prison population to a certain point can reduce crime doesn't mean you will continually benefit in crime reductions just by arbitrarily increasing the prison population we uh by by sending more less people to prison and uh crime reducing I don't know if there's a causality there but it seems to be a long-term Trend you're saying that impacts the clearance rates no I just said that their clearance rates are up it's not all Rosy I'm looking at this like Lamont why does their what why does their why would that affect their clearance rates well I didn't say well maybe some of the reforms or losing officers like Nationwide Trends would affect their clearance rate I didn't say decreasing the prison population did you decided all this positive data from the state of Connecticut I pull up the report that you're referring to and they're like listen there is a caveat the police are actually less productive in the state of Connecticut which could be attributed to some not all the reforms I'm not saying the prison population reduction necessarily makes officer clearance rate going down I'm just pointing out that this is happening like producing the number of incarcerated individuals inhibit the did I not just say I'm not saying that reducing okay you just brought it up when I was talking about some you were talking about Connecticut overall and you were painting a very Rosy picture of the state of Connecticut I think the crime being down 25 is I think it is rates are not as high because there's two reasons why you want higher clearance rates right one is presumably because you want to take people off the streets who have committed a crime a because they've committed a crime but B you don't want them to commit a second crime and uh B obviously for some type of closure for the victims but we do see um significant drops in crime uh as we have less incarcerated people and these reforms which you had said you had a problem with but I do have a problem let's get to the causes of crime let's get to the causes of crime I think we've we've examined this well spam again I said this a million times pillars in a building you can knock down one pillar but if Connecticut has other things institutionally that are working to reduce crime then that might not bring down the whole building so in this instance but nice uh pulling out one specific state after coming down on me for doing that it's just it is just an article I found that was in the news two days ago so that's why it was there but um let's uh let's talk about the other thing that you wanted to discuss and that was uh the excusing of crime by blaming poverty now I I I will admit that I did not um see this exchange with you and Emma and I did not ask her I've never heard her say that I excuse um excuse crime because of poverty uh I I would suspect that she would argue at least in part that crime is a function of poverty right not not you get a get out of jail free if you're poor and you've committed a crime uh you live in poverty but rather that crime is a function of poverty I would imagine that's what she was saying and specifically when I brought up that 327 people in the city of New York are arrested for a third of the shoplifting arrests in the city of New York which represents over 6 000 arrests she said that those people are the most desperate and they're doing it because they need to survive or to to sustain their lives so in other words that sounds like an excuse to me so yes that would be excusing crime with the poverty excuse but to me it sounds like an argument as to what is driving crime but I did like I say I'm not familiar I I argued and I'll argue here what do you think that we're not able to hold repeat offenders is what is causing that if you locked up those 327 people guess what you have a third of the retail theft arrests gone because they keep committing the crime how many people would you have to lock up to make sure that you got the right 327. well it would be the for that specific issue would be the 327 that are arrested a grand total of 6 000 times so it'd be the 320. when would you when would you lock them up and throw away the key to save from the shoplifting uh well it wouldn't be it would be charge them seriously hold them in blue in waiting for their trial and then convict them prosecute them seriously yes but uh but but but you're saying if we lock up those 327 essentially in don't let them out we're going to have less shoplifting that's what you're saying right all right now you don't know where the data says when do you know that it's those 327. the first time they shoplift no I mean if I'm talking about repeat offenders so it would be when they have reasons that's what I'm asking how many so two two shoplifting offenses gets you locked up for as long as you want to prosecute shoplifting and retail theft seriously from the jump the idea that this is a victimless crime is nonsensical but let's say if you're arrested for five times which by the way again it's 6 000 spread over 327 people then we don't let you out without bail like a judge would be able to have judgment to determine that your repeat offender and you are whole held you're held uh in in like where where would you put them in like a Rikers or something in a jail and there's no uh there's no dollar a figure right we just uh well aren't you against cash bail because you know poverty yeah I I am against cash bail yeah so I would want the judges right now they can't assess dangerousness in the state of New York I would want them to shoplifters dangerous is it I mean according to you yeah they're repeat offenders and eventually a bunch of these people when confronted get into physical altercations and people have been killed over that I've covered multiple stories of Home Depot workers being killed we find out that the person behind the theft that led to killing that worker was arrested a bunch of times for these so-called Petty crimes you could have got them off the streets and then somebody dies over it some poor person who works you know for whatever 15 an hour at Home Depot gets killed by somebody wanted a power drill so yeah I want those people off the streets for sure so what do you think uh drives crime what I think drives crime yeah well I think creates I think policy I think public policy has a big impact there are people that are opportunistic that will commit crime if they think there are no consequences whether they be social or whether they be through the criminal justice system and I've broken this down you can think of it as a pyramid with three layers the lowest part of the pyramid is the criminal justice system the actual consequences and the reason why this is one of the lowest deterrents is be and by the way I'm not making this up this comes from like you know criminal justice theory the reason why this is one of the lowest deterrents I was assuming I'm giving you the benefit of doubt that you're not I'm just I'm just saying it's not my it's not my theory but the the deterrence doesn't really work it's not really that effective because most people when they commit a crime don't think they're going to get caught the next stage in that pyramid would be the social consequences so if people will treat you like a pariah if you are arrested and convicted of a crime that is a stronger deterrent against you committing crimes and then the third the top of the pyramid the number one thing is if you believe that the law is moral and or just that is what's going to prevent you from criminality okay and so um if you live in a society where like you everybody lives in around you lives in extreme poverty uh do you think that um numbers I think like was it uh two and three on your pyramid I mean in other words like so what would you do if I put you in charge of uh of of social policy and you could be you could be king for a day uh or you know a couple of weeks or whatever it is uh what would you do would you what would you do to to what do you think the most effective thing we could do to fight uh like you say there's always going to be some uh folks who I don't know uh like uh living on the edge and uh committing crimes but but broadly speaking what would you do uh how do you mean well you just uh worked out a a pyramid for us and so put that into practice if that's the pyramid that you believe in again like how do you how do you mean like I just told you what prevents people or what prevents people from committing crimes like how would I put that into practice are you talking about from a law enforcement point of view it would depend entirely where I am because crime is different depending on the city it's very much down to the local municipality so if I was designing an intervention for New York City it would be completely different than an intervention for the city of St Louis or the city of Chicago so again like what do you mean okay what would you do in uh in New York City let's say to deal with the crime I mean you're like I've I I mean I guess like when we're looking at the the causes of crime here and and you just laid out some type of uh of of pyramid it sounded like you discounted the the punishment one which was the widest one right I mean my understanding Insurance actually but yeah yeah but that doesn't deter you you don't think that deters because people don't think they're gonna get caught yeah a lot of people don't think they're gonna get caught so that's why not a function of cops no no I was like no no you you misunderstand it deterrence is not that effective of a strategy from a law enforcement level but that doesn't mean incapacitation is not an effective strategy so incredible people would be removing repeat offenders and and so uh locking up more people but how would you get there I guess is what you're talking about uh the first thing I would do in the state of New York because again it is dependent on the area is that I would get rid of bail reform law and allow judges to have judgment I think it's ridiculous the way we operate in the city of New York if we're concerned about people that are poor that can't afford their bail for lower crimes I understand that I would reduce the bail amounts but what I need is for the judges to be able to assess dangerousness dangerousness so you're only talking violent crimes um or repeat offenders you know like the original bail reform and they've amended it to remove certain things uh didn't even factor in Bale jumping as a crime that could get you held so if you didn't show up for court but now that's changed when did that change they might have changed that specific portion but I know they removed they used to have aggravated vehicular manslaughter as a charge that was not bail eligible and they did change that so like yeah there have been some changes to it they actually updated every year around April when the budget comes in so I'm not exactly sure which specific crimes but I want judges to be able to assess repeat offenders I don't want to be in a position where they cannot hold somebody as long as they commit this crime and then they're incentivized to recommit the same crime over and over again so you want um so you want let's say uh you'd be okay with like uh uh judge's discretion on bail if it's someone who has been arrested for uh five times on the same crime is that it yeah depending on the crime of course right it's jaywalking I don't care about jaywalking you don't think people should be arrested for jaywalking do you I mean even ticketing it's New York City I mean everybody crosses every which way you know um and uh but you think that's the most important thing bail reform I think bail reform is a huge deal in the state of New York and it impacts almost every County I believe when um the governor's race was going on we had something like uh like 98 of counties or 98 out of uh out of like 101 counties I don't remember exactly how many counties so it might have been a percentage that saw an increase in crime so uh you discount the bottom uh part about deterrent on that uh pyramid what was it insurance is the lowest and lead and one of the least effective yes I don't get why that's on the uh but uh so on the bottom that you think is the least effective and then the middle one is what's the next one that would be like societal pressure if you feel like you're going to be an outcast from your community or treated like a pariah like the social pressure that keeps you in line okay and then social pressure right and uh so um how would you increase um how would you increase that social pressure well I think we should do more to stigmatize criminals for sure how would you stigmatize well I would I would stop treating them like they're Aladdin like your co-host does where they're just like thieves with the Heart of Gold uh I would I would stop like sympathizing with them and somebody guys with the victims okay so you so we in in the case of shoplifting we should sympathize with like Walmart or something more and we should we should sympathize with the community who has to pay for that in higher prices or the people who lose their jobs because of these stores uh shut down we should sympathize with these people scores shut down because they end up traveling further due to the fact that there's less grocery stores in their area yeah we should sympathize with them rather than the opportunistic thieves okay and so um and so you think that um that uh there's there's thieves out there that um Emma's you know walking amongst and uh they're all like that I was walking amongst no I would never see say that I would never think she would actually I think the thieves are watching the show you think the the thieves are watching the show and they're going it's okay it's not just the majority report per se but there's this General dismissive nature towards these retail thieves like you can see it on every on every reply in the video it's like no there's definitely has that changed over time I think yes people have become more sympathetic to people and possibly due to the fact that we have the pandemic so the excuse is that these people wait a second why was there this huge drop in crime uh uh why was this huge drop in crime why did that take place so in 1990 for instance let's say or 87 people were too sympathetic to uh shoplifters and then in the 90s later in the 90s they were less sympathetic to shoplifters and that's why it went down well no there is an overall sentiment change I mean for you to not acknowledge this is ridiculous like go look at Joe Biden on the floor of the Senate pushing the crime Bill and listen to the way Joe Biden talks about crime now I'm into it my Queen's crime was high 1990s Joe Biden yeah passing the law 1990s Joe Biden was harsher on crime and kind of began to drop precipitously yes crime started to drop or dropped Nationwide after that crime Bill yes oh I see what you're saying and then and then uh and then crime shot up like when when did we start as a society just in the past two years have we gotten more sympathetic to to shopping I do think people have become more sympathetic to criminals and less sympathetic to the police a hundred percent uh I I don't know about yourself is it about the police or is it about the criminals I thought it was we're talking about cultural attitudes related to crime in the criminal justice system so yeah when I talk about retail that's there's a lot of excuse making I'm sure you have people on your staff that have said it's no big deal or my favorite one where it's like wage theft actually is more than the the retail theft you know why is it wasted it's spread out over the entire economy as if that has anything to do with what we're talking about in the first place wait a second wait a second you just said the problem you just said the problem I with um with shoplifting is what it does to the community you don't think you don't think wage theft there is there's something like what are the numbers that you understand wage theft to be on an annual well I know that you guys like to use the 2013 chart because it has a very big disparity that comes with the economics well I mean it's not just the economic policy Institute but what do you what do you put wage theft at I I would put it at the tens of billions I think the number that you guys often cite is around 50 billion even though what you're studying is the wages recovered but you know the wages were clever wages recovered was to was was closer to I think uh 20 billion but the the annual I mean the estimates I've seen are anywhere from like three to six billion dollars annually because you don't always recover it I mean at all um but you think that that one would be 20 billion but the annual 20 billion over the course of 10 years um of course of 10 years yeah that's the stat that the doj puts out the um but the the the the point is is that you I just want to be clear on this shoplifting hurts a community more than um anymore it's just a different problem so what you're doing well so what you guys do is I talk about a problem or someone like me talks about it oh wait Sean is that and then you say hey look that's another problem don't don't get meta just address the issue this is Wade's theft right we both agree it's a crime yeah you shouldn't do it and I'm in favor of it but it's illegal it's illegal okay and in fact we're talking about the same people too right like because when you say well people don't uh sympathize with a corporation when there is uh there is shoplifting and it's gonna hurt the workers there and the community because of high prices and presumably you know uh high prices are going to hurt low-income uh people more than others to to be clear I just want to be clear I just want to be clear what you're saying it is that is how is that really not hitting the exact same place Sam we're not talking about the same people because again wage theft is spread out over the entire economy when we talk about retail theft that typically now I'm not a doctor I'm not a scientist involves the retail sector so what you're actually doing is highest I would think probably in government contracts a lot of these have issues with the Davis bacon law where they're underpaying it probably is in major corporations with unpaid overtime I think it's in a lot of different places but I do know that a lot of illegal immigrants in the United States of America are entitled to the wages under Davis bacon and they often get cheated and it is a great moment years later although sometimes their lives are ruined when investigators find out that they're back dated pay and they give them a huge check so I would think it happens in multiple different sectors not just retail but yeah and it has multiple different forms I mean uh all right so uh you're just keying in on shoplifting that's the crime when we talk about retail theft we typically we talk about retail theft no I am you're doing a two wrongs mix of who cares no I'm just saying I'm just curious but that that's that's fine uh you the one who brought up wage theft I just want to clear yeah because it's a common retort by people who are trying to do I get so better then we won't get hung up on these things it's also you know nobody talks about stealing from your employer which many years is actually higher than wage theft but you know there's that too okay um uh I yeah I don't uh I I guess nobody talks about that not on the charts that you present from the economic policy Institute I I mean dude you brought up wage theft yeah because I'm in retort and I've seen it brought up on your show well yeah wage theft is an issue um also brought up uh you know that the corporations lie about how much they're getting um uh how much they're they're they're suffering from um from uh uh from you know uh petty theft I mean the Walmart I think Executive admitted that on a call with the finances they're always talking about a Walgreens executive where he said or she I don't remember I think it might have been a woman that it was uh that we may have overstated this in this specific Walgreens call but I do remember when Walgreens got into it with London breed who claimed that it was completely overstated and they clarified about four times that they closed due to the increase in Theft specifically in San Francisco and honestly it should be it should be alarming that these stores are closing in left-wing cities disproportionately considering the giant subsidy that they got from the vaccines remember these corporations were essentially given Welfare by being able to be the Distributors of these vaccines that draws people into the stores and yet at the same time there's a giant reduction in the number of storefronts in these areas so you would think in places where covet had nothing to do with uh with the closure of those stories covet actually had everything to do with the Boost in business because these were the Distributors of the vaccine no I understand they were to distributed vaccine but you're also aware that like you know uh people's uh purchasing patterns uh changed dramatically during covid there's a lot of like uh restaurants that uh close there's a lot I mean close to restaurants and if you weren't able to ship to delivery you're pretty nice and so um uh you um criminals for sure 100 criminals more and that will uh do it and how do you think we how do you think we stigmatize criminals like what what part of society like we know that there's and you don't believe do you believe there's a correlation between poverty and extreme poverty uh with with crime yes I I know for a fact that crime drives poverty in the United States of America and the world over so yes there's there is a correlation uh do you think that there is a correlation between uh that the poverty drives crime yes I'm sorry crime drives poverty yeah okay I'm asking you specifically I know that you you're you're arguing that you think crime creates poverty but I'm asking you now do you think that poverty creates crime I think in certain circumstances I'm sure it could happen if you go down to a certain level for sure but I think that in order to go down to a certain level what is that if you're like well we have like um well actually even that is is a bit of a dubious notion so like American poverty like you would acknowledge is relative poverty compared to poverty in like the third world I mean he like you understand that somebody in the United States of America in poverty would be under twelve thousand dollars which would be different from somebody who's living on a dollar fifty a day like that poverty is really a function of purchasing power right sure purchasing power could have an impact I mean that's I mean that's yeah we all all poverty measures yeah yeah you can you can adjust it for yeah sure I mean you you yeah I mean if you had no stores there would be no uh uh there'd be no theft of stuff in there and that's not really relevant but okay yes I understand that you typically need you are in Living in America and you are poor uh theoretically um well you you have access to more stuff than let's say you live somewhere else yes okay okay all right and yeah so you're talking about relative poverty so I'm saying at a certain amount yes when there's like genuine desperation like I could see circumstances where that's happening but what we typically see is that crime is driving the poverty like when these people steal from their areas when they damage that drives crime what I think drives I think people people uh certain percentages of the population is going to be criminal they need to be removed from society so I would say human nature would be a would be a good example Human Nature yeah it's a small percentage of the population that exhibits like a deviant kind of behavior okay so what do you think drives the majority of crime I just said that oh you you think it's just people who are born criminals I wouldn't say born criminals but people who when you don't have the proper deterrence in place will commit crimes yes and those deterrents could be police deterrence like I said earlier okay but whatever not like everybody is subject to the same deterrence right are not necessarily explain this because so I'll give you an example so in New York City disproportionately the people who live in public housing happen to be Orthodox Jewish people right they do not commit crimes at the same rates as other demographics they're in fact among the lowest they commit crimes near around where Asians do so they're probably better than your average middle class white person in the city of New York I think that they have a stronger social structure than other groups in the United States of America even if they're equivalent in poverty levels so if I was to look at like the incarceration rates of black people for instance relative to white people your argument would be that there's something fundamental about their social structure that is uh that is uh why that we we see those incarceration rates high oh it would be based on their behavior for the one to one but if you're asking me for like an underlying cause to the behavior which by the way I don't care about because root causes are not more important than any other cause let's be clear about that so this is just like another Rabbit Hole pointless like argument that has nothing to do with the subject matter in my opinion it's not useful or productive but yeah I would say that there is there are definite cultural differences between what were the groups you said black Americans and white Americans uh yeah yeah between there's definitely cultural differences between black Americans and white Americans and more tolerance to criminality and by the way there's differences between black New Yorkers and black people in Chicago and that's also reflected in the rates and I think that does lead to different outcomes in terms of Criminal Justice and you think it's unrelated to um uh things like uh poverty or systemic racism or well if we have so so if we're going to use poverty As the metric and we compare poor black Americans to poor Asians or poor Hispanics and by the way Hispanics commit more crimes on average but less than black Americans then obviously poverty is not this determining Factor if the crime rates vary wildly I have an analogy for you um when you're building a house and you have different uh um uh you have different uh foundations and you pull one out so I mean poverty yeah I think might not be indeterminate but maybe when you mix poverty with other sort of like structural factors in society peoples have less reason to uh feel a stigma about crime or less reason to be invested in society but you don't can you give an example can I give an example yeah of this other Factor well I mean I think that like um if you have been stuck in extreme poverty for extended periods of time if you live in a society where it is harder for you to uh to find housing or loans or to get out of a specific area in which you're living if you have been subjected to um a a socialization that labels you as a criminal uh or that your activity just walking around is criminal that it might create that's being arrested for walking around well not arrested but harassed I mean I think you you wouldn't deny I mean your argument would be there's more violent crime in certain areas and that's why there's more cops but we also know that I mean if if you're a black teen and you're walking uh the the streets in some neighborhoods uh you are far more likely to get stopped and harassed by the cops than if you're a wife I wouldn't say harass but you are more likely to interact with police yes okay there's more police there I I mean I think from the perspective of that person who is interacting with the police after having done nothing they would perceive it as harassment for sure if I was if I was a law-abiding person in a black neighborhood and I had to interact with the police due to the fact that you know criminals are acting up in my neighborhood then that would get under my skin I mean I have what if you were like pulled over uh in like your car I mean I I've told this story on the show many times but I was an actor uh uh back in the day and I'm just full an actor buddy just because of the strike doesn't mean that they're not going to resolve that no that's true I do do some Voice work but uh nevertheless I would I was on a sitcom at one point and um uh it was a majority Black cast and uh one of the Buddies it was uh we went back to his uh place and we we pull in uh into the uh underground driveway uh parking lot and a buddy of his pulls in behind us and he's got one of those Range Rovers and at that time that was a very popular car uh in LA with like uh the Hollywood set and this is back in the 90s and he pulls in he's like thank God you're here I just got uh I was getting followed Again by the cops I've been pulled over four times in the past two months uh and they checked to see if I own the car and I called the police department to see if I could get a sticker or something in the he said the sergeant literally said are you black and I said yes and he said there's nothing I can do now if you're a law-abiding citizen and you're driving the car that you earn to and you bought the car and you're getting that type of harassment you don't think it impacts your perspective on society no I think it does and uh this is Los Angeles in what time period was in the 90s yeah I mean there's obviously you know there but you just exceeded to me that uh conceding yeah no I think this happens I don't think uh boys uh I mean you could call me crazy but I don't think you're saying that your friend turned into a criminal because he was pulled over he seemed like he was really annoyed I think if I I think if I think if if I I think if that happened to me and I didn't have a nice car but rather I just got stopped every time I I walk out of my house or stopped I don't know once a month every time I'm out of my house which is not hard like I don't know I would start having a far less uh um respect for society and uh far less uh uh a perspective on that yeah I definitely think that I mean look I I mean but I I understand you don't watch my my uh like you don't watch any of my videos or anything like that but I said repeatedly I think the warning needs to be brought back in terms of policing I think writing tickets for expired registration when you're in areas with elevated rates of shootings all that does is piss people off and turn the community against you so there's definitely better ways to implement policy to get the community on your side like I've been a huge advocate for consent searches which is if and this started in St Louis in the 90s which is if you're afraid that your kid is involved in a gang or might have a gun or might get shot they have a high rate of Youth homicides still high to this very day then you can call the police consent to a search they'll look for Contraband but they won't arrest your kid I think that and they'll send your kid to a diversion program before they get into a shooting and all that so I think that is a good policy to build community relations with the police like the way that you're speaking is as if I don't believe in that even though I think that's absolutely crucial to the police being effective okay all right well I think this was uh was uh productive Sean all right and I appreciate you coming on um uh are you are you happy oh yeah on the big debate and I think it's uh thank you for having the conversation listen I know you want people that have been ducking you and all that and uh this is what prompted me to just ask for the conversation I appreciate it yeah no I say yes to just about everybody it may be too much but yeah and you didn't have to do it like a lot of people immediately presumed because I issued the challenge and like they didn't hear a like direct announcement on a billboard or something that like I was somehow entitled to it I obviously not entitled to it I thank you for your time you've been quite gracious during the course of this conversation even if there were Parts where I felt like you were trying to get you get me and I gotcha but thank you for your time well I mean uh I I was just exploring I don't know what you mean by I gotcha I've never seen any of the the other stuff you've done but okay I appreciate that actually I got a question for you if we're gonna do a gotcha sure you're into Criminal Justice right uh or to you don't like the Criminal part actual Justice right you don't like the adjective beforehand what did you think when when uh and and I I will concede I did not see the the the whole Tim pool interview uh with you guys with you and Emma did you think that she was a pedophile after that uh conversation no so do you did you see that when Tim accused her of being a pedophile from what was said in that conversation I didn't see that specific clip but I I have heard about it and if he said like she's a pedophile or whatever then that's totally uncalled for and unprompted yeah that's what I thought that sounded weird to me but I don't know you're saying I I appreciated Tim having me on but I don't like I'm not an employee of his or anything like that even though on the later show I said I moved into his property and I did not see that but uh have fun there I heard he's got a great skate park I think he does I'm not a skateboarder but it's a skateboarder's paradise you know presumably yeah let's go to the YouTube Studio yeah it's already on Max guys I don't know I could I could do the uh the thing where I um you know like say words louder like I could talk like an idiot if you want but uh yeah that was fun I I enjoyed that um I I was I was waiting for the racism trap I thought it was coming at the end but it did not appear to be prepared properly which was fun um you know I I think I pointed out a bunch of things that Sam was doing when he was like changing up his argument and that was also fun um you know like I I genuinely enjoyed that my you know but then again I am like Psychopathic and a YouTuber so I enjoy these kind of things but uh you know obviously you guys will be the determining factor of whether or not it went well or not and then his audience you know you know you know that's that's how it will work uh it was nice for them to not be able to deflect to Tim Poole all right so let me just drag this window within view I'll move this over here so that way I could see myself I still have a video to edit today which is you know this is not exactly what I want to do but uh yeah as long as it's all coming through though for you guys then that's great um okay so I'm gonna read these super chats I'm gonna try to power through them if there's any questions Jesus I just see the second one um so orok a-u-r-o-c-h sent two dollars no Super Chat make the transition for five dollars says Anna kasparian just announced that she's pregnant I don't believe that's true because I'm seeing it in a super chat but to be clear her husband would be the father okay and I am not her husband for all the all of those of you who think that we're gonna start dating um three x three nilo you guys with the names did drink every time Sam attempts to reframe ajw when ajw attempts to make it clear make a clear and direct argument or inquiry I predict constant reframed arguments I think you would be dead if you drank uh on those intervals I think I I disavow because I don't want you guys to die I care about you guys so yeah um the next one is uh Vector mephititis who says I hope we can watch it from here I hate the thought of giving Sammy bucks a view yeah um I'm glad we got it to work out they did not provide me the link that I needed there's an embed link with the software that they utilized and they were not turning that over they said it was a security issue and all that but here's the thing uh there was a way to work around it but they decided not to but I got permission to do the stream snipe so that is there I did the stream snipe and it only took a few minutes to uh set up so that worked out great I'm glad you guys enjoyed it it was a little delayed from Sam's thing but you know what the OBS software actually came through in a big way to make this happen so um for voice of the people don't give Sam an inch keep him on point against the ropes let's enjoy watching this pathetic excuse for a human squirm and listen I appreciate him doing it but I do think that when he tried to say oh it's just this Factor like very much try to straw man my argument I made a point to say no I do say it's a it's a Confluence of factors he wanted like a specific percentage you know it is a good debate tactic to say you know ask for specifics and all that but I think I avoided those traps for the most part uh Julian gear Gian Gian Grande you know for somebody who's half Latino I don't speak Latin words very well says Sean what up my man for five dollars Kumi 2 for five dollars in a currency I don't understand uh says nothing uh filthy casual says your volume is low you Muppet uh thank you for your kind words and contribution X 3x3 nilo says Sam seems to have a history of being uninformed well I knew that right away where he was talking about how um you know he was like appealing to my credentials it was a way to like kind of puff me up before he took me down but I think he only got step one of that not step two so you know but yeah I was I was aware of that coming also like to be clear I've never really mentioned like the degrees and the education and all that because I don't think it's that important uh the only time or the first time it came up is when vosh was asking if I was a lawyer or something so yeah that that was not that's not something that I ever do uh because I don't think you know you could have a degree in something and be like completely worthless in communicating that information and I feel like I learned maybe where to look but like my curiosity is what like led me to find these sources and all that so I don't think anybody like it's not beyond the grasp of anybody um for Nico Arcadia uh common sense says low crime equal civilization honesty honesty honesty that was for ten dollars thank you voice of the people again for five dollars the numbers are going down because Alvin Bragg is downgrading and dismissing charges so this would be inaccurate because the reports not the charges determine the crimes now uh the numbers are going down but they're like within a you know reasonable they're within a similar range like I wouldn't be on this channel complaining about an increase of that range so you know um and we have big time who says Larry krasner doesn't charge the cat blacks with gun charges in Philly yes I would love to harp on Philly versus the crime is not as bad as the 1990s 3x3 nilo Sean doesn't know how to deal with interruptions I feel like I I interrupted back a couple of times a long story short Adams did bring back the plain clothes the last year yes I do think that has an impact Spencer Harmon for twenty dollars says Sam but spelled s at sign is garbage just garbage I think he was doing an Anna kasparian you are garbage uh black blast radius uh listen to me blast radius says trust me Cedar will cedar would not be a crime denier if this crap was in his community daily trust me on that this is how leftists like him operate uh Joshua 029 for or ten dollars USD says that dude on the left is going to have back problems from carrying around this gigantic brain uh thank you I think I was on the left I don't I don't know I don't know uh me mellow for ten dollars thank you Marcos for one dollar thank you uh 3x Halo every time I pronounce that name I pronounce it wrong for five dollars Sean is coming off bad good luck moderating it out of the chat thumbing the scales of the audience perception makes you seem like a fragile makes you seem fragile and bad faith I don't think I did that but thank you for the five Dara anyway uh blast radius how did the pandemic lead to a spike in crime when the lockdowns and curfews were were happening uh everywhere in America Cedar yeah so during the initial lockdowns crime went down because nobody was outside so I you know obviously there was a change post the right diets Mike fuss says investigators solve crimes that actually puts criminals in prison that prevents crimes that was actually one of my favorite Parts where I brought where I brought up that a lot of these people were seasoned investigators and Sam was like well those are only investigators it's like no no not only investigators I'd address that point about four times to not let him get away with it uh critical wit says for five dollars law if funding was restored then it have to it had to have fallen in the first place Sam is silly I brought this up again these are a lot of things that I talked about I've talked about on my channel Ad nauseam like there was nothing new in terms of argumentation uh William Staley says Sam can you actually prepare to debate rather than constantly engaging in sophistry this shows Sean is punching well below his weight skill wise thank you for the kind words uh I'll pass that message along to Sam vigatron says well done Sir with a heart emoji I appreciate that Lord Osterman says why why would crime drop if prosecutors are letting many criminals go these days again it depends on where uh John for five dollars says 15 years ago does he know this was the Great Depression it was actually the Great Recession of course um the head of Clint would would have been what would have been lower in 2008 insert Soulja Boy name uh yeah crime actually went down in the Great Recession by the way a blast radius for 10 says the leftist like Cedar will light a match defund the police in America and afterwards try to play dumb like him and his Progressive buddies had nothing to do with it uh alternate Keck for five dollars says take some money for dealing with this clown he can't stop talking about nonsense I will say that story about the Range Rover such a waste of time it was it was I I wish we didn't end basically on that note um you know this happened to my friend in 1995 when he was driving like a hundred thousand dollar car like okay okay Sam I'm sorry I'm sorry like you know I'm sorry about your friend I'm sorry that you feel guilty about that let me see if I could adjust this so I could be less Orange there we go um uh as put by Anakin Skywalker we don't need cops the Second Amendment uh for a reason uh yes I believe in self-defense rights thaw says for twenty dollars ajw can't win uh Sam has buckets of proof he can guzzle proof in buckets and quotes uh from buckets and uh just buckets and buckets uh whm underscore W says that's a lockdowns in vaccine mandates for uh uboso um Henrik kuto says I hope this money helps you recover from the pure brain worms you're getting from Sam Cedar and M for ten dollars Canadian uh no message 3x nilo two dollars again donating hardcore uh no message or message retracted Dirty South fgc ask if we had one day of zero crime does crime exist that's actually a trend I don't know if you know that a quick decline is is a new trend that's actually the new word for it if you guys are unfamiliar that is how that works Bob the hun are you going people are going to say sam won because he dominated the conversation Sean isn't getting to grill him on any stupid he said over the years meanwhile Sam is nitpicking him every second I think the nitpicking looked pretty bad uh and then he sent that again for ten dollars and then he sent it again for ten dollars so thank you for the thirty dollars in the same message uh usd2 chat is censored why so frighten a free feedback YouTube has its own filters and my mods uh get rid of certain nonsense I don't know what you're referring to Agora Dash Sarah says I like how his critique of Stitch and Adam was they pulled the clip of him and they had to explain the quote to him to continue the debate and now we're pivoting to on Connecticut yeah I watched that stream and um good on sitchin Adams for pulling up a quote and what was funny about that is Sam was like when did I say that it was like six days ago that did make me laugh so good on them for that one um for kalaharo 30 30 for five dollars what is happening now Sean is debating a team and still dominating while Sam desperately nitpicks irrelevant points to try to gotcha Sean that is true he did harp on a lot of things that were like you know very minimal but the problem is is that you can try to do that but I'm very into the like Niche numbers I did think it was funny when he was upset that I didn't have every statistic offhand and I'm like ah no I'll just look it up like you know you could get frazzled in that kind of section and be embarrassed but the idea that I would have everything offhand is ridiculous like I'm working on Cleveland stuff so I'm not thinking about the state of Connecticut um Gonzo the good crime is going down because it's being legalized Chewbacca's lover Sam knows he can't win on the facts he's trying to control the conversation and make Sean defend every Point while not having to defend his positions on crime and all the stuff uh all the stupid stuff he says not here for 69.69 thank you for that and that number Sam's Live Chat is so disappointingly moronic Sean's words are zooming over their heads they're jumping on clarification on simple facts as some sort of Victory what the hell is wrong with them uh by the way 69 in chat voice of the people says when Sam realized he was losing this went from a debate to an interview at slash learning session well done Sean uh whm underscore W says Sean um you need a chance to interrogate slash cross-examine Sam you're doing all the answering and just asking questions uh okay yeah that's fair I could have pressed more on that uh I did I did aggravate him with the wage theft thing which was uh which is funny uh because he didn't bring it up but I know people and his staff bring it up all the time when they talk about the topic this debate needed a moderator Sam was just steering the conversation wherever he wants to go and to talk about whatever he wants to talk about uh e Dash ER for ten dollars says the wage theft issue is a red herring we were talking about shoplifting I think I pointed that out pretty clearly that this is a common deflection slash denial technique I thought you were above Biden's stuttering compilation Sam did stutter a lot near the end I who tend to stutter and tend to speak poorly on live um ended up speaking quite clearly and coherently it was elegant if I do say so myself because none of you have said how elegant I was but um I did have an emergency person come in and grab me water because I was getting uh you know a little a little drying them out um for Thomas Paris uh here lies Sam Cedar giant among grifters master of pivots never has there been a more cunning wielder of a dishonest argument slew by Sean Warrior of actual Justice uh crime is about morality not poverty that comes from Gonzo the good uh Lord also men who I keep trying to say awesome but it says officer men opportunity drives crime that's true not here uh this is definitely Sean's most difficult debate I don't think he's ever debated such a huge r word uh before 420 in the chat ladies that's from not here uh Anonymous Sam is desperate to trap Sean in a gotcha question uh Julian for a hundred dollars Jesus Jesus I Gotta Give the big reaction to that I'll keep up the good work Sean 100 and he didn't even send me a long message very very thank you very much Slevin says you're you're doing uh ah you're doing good work is what I think he meant to say buddy hold your ground um Mike the dad Crosby I was on a sitcom once says the leftist with zero sense of humor must have been the straight man oh wait I can't say that for now right not oh LGBT listen Sam has a wife and a child so uh and that was repeated again I disavowed any poor references to the lgbtq double x iip Slevin for five US Dollars says comparing the police institution of the 90s to the police institution of the 2020-2030 by the way uh the 2020s is what he meant by that not here says Sam is a perform sonification of playing chess against a pigeon idiom his only move is crappy oh yeah crapping on the board when it's his move I think you might have meant Sean but okay uh or maybe yeah Sam is the Pigeon in this thing whatever Joe Sullivan said says am I the only one who hears the Star Spangled Banner playing in the background also I see the Eagles Taking Flight Rockets exploding and monster trucks uh Bob the Hun says Sam is is bent out of shape over how Tim treated Emma this Rich she went for personal below the belt uh pot shots first Sam did the same thing right there all right uh same did the same thing here yeah they did attack Tim but I didn't watch a lot of their coverage of that because I I don't care about their opinion on that conversation um but yeah I mean if he's if Tim which I I gave the stipulation that it's an if uh called her like a pedo then I don't agree with that but I don't know if that happened I think he said like tolerates grooming or whatever verbiage he used but if I'm wrong then whatever send me the clip it's fine um uh begin of the debate was basically an interview of your views and reading articles second half was the debate next time get a moderate W on your side uh yeah I couldn't be the moderator and the debater this time I was in majority reports chat simply agreed with ajw provided valid retorts to what they were saying has two account and had two accounts banned it's shameful and embarrassing on their part yet they called ajw fans Nazis yeah um I appreciate that I appreciate you coming over and I'm sorry you got banned from their chat twice for agreeing with me well done you didn't have ums or us you stated your you stated clearly your opinions and facts your voice didn't get louder and strained you should have been oh you should be proud of yourself that's from rkk and Casey Anderson is the person who got banned so let me refresh one more time and then I will uh I will wrap this stream but again thank you guys all for watching I saw over 5 thousand people tuning in live at one point I'll check if that's Peak later on but I really appreciate that you know it's a it's um it's it's nice it's nice that you guys care about what I did and obviously I'm not afraid of Sam Cedar especially on a topic that I clearly know more about than him voice of the people uh you did great I laughed when when it tuned into a when it turned into a learning session for him if you need help with stream Labs I'm willing to help you uh thank you um Jerry RN is that skeleton uh back behind you after you murdered him in the debate um Gerald Armstrong the teacher example Sam said was nonsense tell me a teacher who fights crime uh yeah so he was referring to like the pandemic causing resignations and teachers again it the ages of the people retiring early or leaving the profession are are higher and I think people were leaving the teaching profession earlier than the pandemic but I could be wrong about that you know of course of course you enjoyed the Dem of course you enjoyed that demolition of the wokis agenda Sam didn't even try to debate seemed like he was interviewing and trying to get some gotchas uh most of the time all he could all he could do was laugh uh Sean put repeat offenders in jail Sam uh Sam put more people in jail Sam is such a disingenuous right yeah I mean I I don't like that's like one of the key highlights from the other one where I was like yes we should put the same the people who were repeat offending in jail and he was like again it's like asking for specifics but specifics that didn't matter so he's like oh how many times should they reoffend before you put them in jail and I'm like he's like should it be three times I'm like five it doesn't matter like these people are offending six thousand times like that they're not going to jail we have that burglar story out in Los Angeles the guy's convicted of 77 felonies pled guilty to 54 burglaries and he gets time served so yeah we need something between infinite and one that's a number I want to go for okay uh Ryan Tate uh Sam's team versus Sean great bit on retail versus Sam by the way I could see I don't know if you guys could see I could see into their studio room so um I could see the reactions of their staff I even worked into all criminals or Aladdin thing which I thought was funny um you should have pushed back about Emma and Tim flip the script she accused him
