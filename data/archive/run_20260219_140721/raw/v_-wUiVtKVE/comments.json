The data he chooses to cherry pick, informs that position. It’s not exactly ignorance, but certainty that his position is based in reality.\n\nJust like many of you don’t actually arrive at your conclusions using data or facts. You just go with whatever fits to your political bias. A conservative holding the positions actual Justice warrior holds regarding crime is usually not reality based , just moral luck. \n\nSean is a definitely an exception, being that he has many positions which are contrary to your typical conservatives who doesn’t arrive at a conclusion using deduction/logic but ideological bias. \n\nI’m sure he has some area where he assumes a position is a true without evidence but Sam Seder and many progressives are extremely guilty of doing this. While morally grandstanding about their righteous beliefs.",

He wants to.blame the pandemic for the spike in crime rates, but what does that actually mean? I'm assuming he's referring to the lockdown policies. But what party pushed those policies the most? What party exaggerated how deadly the virus was? What party has not wanted to investigate the origin of that so called pandemic? What party is mostly responsible for destroying hundreds of thousands of small businesses? What party is responsible for pushing a deadly v🪓? But I digress. So we had the whole defund the police democrat movement, with crime spiking, & there's no direct correlation between the 2? Really? Progressives are slightly retarded in my opinion. I'm sorry AJW that I couldn't listen to the entire debate, but I can't stand those people.",

You do know debates are to change moderates mind and not to say your opponent is wrong to his face... Are you expecting the audience to already know what you're on about or to read your mind??? It's like you surrendered yourself to his flow and even he's surprised about how you're not pushing forward... At first, I thought he would just keep on talking but he started getting tired of talking because you weren't talking that much... You sound like a robot that won't give answers until they've been prompted to... I don't know when this started on the right... It's people badly aping Ben Shapiro... He actually doesn't act like a robot... There's a difference between you're not here to be friends and being a robot that won't talk except it's about stats, no hypotheticals, no clarification...\n\nSometimes you would say one of the reasons is this and he would say so you're saying that's the only reason and rather than reminding him that you said that's one of the reasons and then saying why that reason shouldn't be dismissed, you just say why that reason shouldn't be dismissed in small words only and just stop abruptly to the point that sam Seder started waiting for you expecting you to say more and you were just gawking at him until he prompted you like two more times before you finally reminded him that that wasn't the reason... WTF was your strategy here??? Interview with sam Seder???\n\nAnd here I was expecting a controlled debate where you dropped all the facts which you should already have down on has many browser windows as possible, you just turned into chat gpt and only started responding based on prompts from Seder... He was literally getting tired of talking and you just sitting down there saying small responses... I know you're trying to give him nothing to work with but that only works when you make yourself as clear as possible with no space for offhand nuances and no ambiguity to be misinterpreted rather than saying little words, that's even the opposite of not giving him something to work with... You're giving him short easy to remember complicated and unexplained points that he can expatiate in bad faith and purposefully misinterpreted it because you only gave the audience a freaking summary and started waiting for your debate opponent to tell you to explain your own points...\n\nWell the first 30 minutes wasn't great...

So in order to even have a footing in the conversation Sam has to supplement his own knowledge of the topic by doing ad hoc research. He says this at the beginning- Sean has a degree or 2 in criminal justice and runs a YouTube channel devoted entirely to criminal justice (or *Actual* justice- the idea of his expertise on matters of Criminal Justice is in his own chosen moniker). If you are saying Sean was outsmarted in his area of expertise by Sam because he had access to a researcher fact-checking his assertions and looking up specific data that Sam was aware of but had not committed to memory (because once again Crime isn't his area of concern or expertise) that sounds like a very poor \"expert\" who can't hold his own in that environment.\n\nCall a waaaaahmbulance because you just can't quit whining about it.",

        "text": "Well, the crime stats are off of reports, not cases prosecuted… but NOT prosecuting criminals encourages repeat offenders to commit more crimes, not the opposite. If a criminal knows they’ll get a slap on the wrist and be out of jail in a short period of time for Grand Theft Auto, they’re going to do it again because the consequences are worth the risk… That said, it’s not the lack of prosecution that effects the crime stats, it’s the lack of police on the ground to respond and take reports. I’d argue that more crime is still happening, but people aren’t even bothering to call the police or make reports, especially because of the anti-police sentiment, they are less likely to call the cops and make a report in the first place. Those who are calling the cops are normal people, not woke-skulled Liberals, moderates and Republicans and Liberal Democrats that don’t enjoy being victims of crime… So, it’s the lack of cops, cops not policing areas for fear of getting shot, police retiring at higher rates like Sean pointed out, and the fact that less crimes are reported overall… but it doesn’t mean the crimes aren’t happening, and that’s the most disingenuous argument by Sam Seder. He’s an absolute fool if he think under funded and reduced staff in police forces doesn’t directly correlate to their inability to respond to most crimes, and when police don’t respond to a call about a crime that isn’t as high on the priority hierarchy, then the people just give up and stop reporting in general. Do you know how many times I was a victim of a crime in my life and I didn’t report it? Many many times. Lots of people don’t want the hassle knowing the police most likely won’t investigate, and won’t solve it.",

You’d expect it from a child…or a young/immature teenager but for a 40-50 year old man to behave like this is just embarrassing. I literally feel the second hand embarrassment everytime he starts setting up what he thinks is a trap. It’s so irritating too because you can say there’s a bunch of reasons why this or that is happening….then they’ll harp on one single reason and if it’s not having a massive impact on the overall point(even if it does contribute but just a little) they’ll say “see! That can’t possibly be the explanation then!” And it’s like, bro, nobody ever said it was any ONE thing lol he was told that it was about morale, defunding, so many police retiring/leaving, less people signing up to be police, how the public views them in much more negative light now, etc….and what’s he do? He latches onto defunding, found a study that said there are cities that the budget is up by 2% and acted like the ENTIRE argument was completely null and void now😂😂which wasn’t even true since he got corrected w the whole—most of these cops having to do a lot more overtime thing….but even if it was true, it would just be ONE factor that contributes to the overall point. And when he said “they don’t PREVENT crime” about he investigator….like, you absolute tool! Do you think any crimes were prevented when the finally got Bundy?? OF COURSE LOL the way some of these people think just makes me wonder if their brains are just Swiss cheese…I refuse to believe anyone can lack such simple logical thinking. It’s literally a concept that a toddler could understand! If you put away the bad guys, you have now PREVENTED them from doing anymore bad things! Ig he wants police that can read minds and see into the future though?",

Crime doesn't go down and increase in a perfectly linear fashion, there are ups and downs or fluctuations, even when there's an overall upward trend. 3% is simply insignificant when crime had increased 30% since 2019\n\nHe kept strawmanning AJW's positions and misrepresenting then nonstop. AJW had factual arguments to support his claim, change in policy, defunding, retirements, overall police morale and sentiment etc... all of which play a factor.",

The next example that Sean conveniently decides not to talk about is the entire state of Texas, Houston specifically. Every single category of crime there is almost double (if not more) than NYC. He continues to make a claim that the “problem” is lack of police funding causing the lack of policing but Sam continues to remind him that VIRTUALLY nowhere have the police budgets actually been cut. Sean continues to overestimate (key work being estimate) the so-called problems of the nonexistent lack of police funding but makes giant leaps of faith to ASSUME what the problems and solutions to crime are. Sean is only good for memorizing crime statistics but when it comes to applying critical thinking to the statistics, or even providing a fair context to them, he falls flat on his face. Sean, much like many right wingers, sounds smart to your average buffoon but anyone with the bare minimum of critical thinking skills, or anyone who knows how to use Google, can easily see beyond his facade.",

He used the Kathy Newman interview style, only much more effective then she did.  As another commenter here said, he's your saviour, so I didn't expect you to change your mind on him, but he's an incredibly deceptive and decisive clone of David packman and Rachel Maddow.  They don't care what's true, only that you support democrat policies unquestioningly.",

However, his gotchas don't work when somebody has a deeper understanding of the subject at hand, as in the case here with Sean.  Sam still employs his smug asides and sneaky deflections to distract when he gets out argued but if you actually pay attention to what is being said, but Sean clearly knew what he was talking about here, much more than Sam.  \n\nWatch Sean's response to this debate, he puts the actual stats on the screen and links to his sources, unlike Sam who just pretends that he won.",

They tell the ones in their group that are working hard to get good grades, follow rules, etc that they're \"acting white\" and make fun of them. \nOne group has allowed the state to make them dependent upon them for all of the many benefits (in exchange for votes) while the other group is less likely to take that help and make it on their own so they can flourish.

Single. Detail.  Perhaps if he let AJW explain where the factors were to expedite retirement we wouldn’t have to deal with “but AJW wasn’t the one who brought it up!” nonsense.\n\nWhoever brings up a point opposing the other’s greater narrative _doesn’t invalidate the entire premise based solely on who brought it up in the first place_ *alone.*\n\nThat being said, AJW was referring more to the _morale drop_ experienced by police organizations across the states in general due to heightened hostilities and wariness expressed from the general consciousness.\n\nThat was the factor AJW was referring to.  And unlike in war, police officers are not bound by military contract to resign or quit or retire to greener pastures.  So those who disliked the increasing alienation also decided to leave, for better or for worse?\n\nDoes that follow?",

You said _certain areas saw crime spike _*_BEFORE_*_ the BLM civil unrest was happening,_ but I’m not quite sure what point you are referring to otherwise in the video.\n\nAJW said that the pandemic starting led to a decrease in certain crime, anyways, so I don’t see how that’s a causal link unless his data is unreliable or not nuanced enough or “big picture” enough as you seem to allege.\n\nMy issue was primarily how you seemed to dislike the fact that AJW didn’t bring up the pandemic first when the format of the debate didn’t allow for such courtesies to start out with.  It was unstructured, and Seder himself drove the conversation 90% of the time.\n\nI don’t get how that can reflect poorly on either person.",

Protest > police reform > crime spike, this was one of AJW argument\n\nI was referring to when AJW mention police reform that happened in 2017/2018, that mean it was before the GF protest. Using AJW's argument, it means we should see a crime spike in that city, but it never happened.

Go into debates to talk directly to their audiences and make sure you're clear... Judge how they think by how they respond to seder's previous videos in the comment section or likes, point out misleading information and debunk wrong information coming from the person they listen to to show them he doesn't know the fuck he's talking about and talk to them in the simplest of terms by expatiating your points and making it very clear what you're saying...

He allowed Seder to control the flow of the debate and actually behaved like everyone he's talking to knows as much as he does, that is to say, he forgot to take account of seder's audience, the main people he should be after not Seder otherwise what's the point of the debate... Just to shame each other and afterwards your supporters and have s supporters who dim the both of them winners with nothing gain...\n\nHe didn't even take advantage of all the gaps Seder was leaving to make sure he was clear and unambiguous, he just gave summaries and expected Seder to be good faith enough to ask him to expatiate or worse, he expected Seder to understand and feel beaten and then he goes hard when his morals are attacked instead of using that as a tactics...\n\nThis was caused because people misunderstood how Shapiro, the king of debates argue and they try to copy how he behaves during debates rather than how he formats his arguments (point, explanation, example... Sean just stopped at point and expected everyone to go watch his videos or something to get the rest)...\n\nI think people should actually not follow Shapiro but how crowder debates in change my mind,  Shapiro's techniques are too specific to him and you have to know how to talk fast and still be very legible and coordinated with making any error, yeah that's not easy to emulate... crowder knows how to handle bad faith arguments and sophistry, do not go along with them or follow it, don't even acknowledge it and definitely don't sound like you confirmed it otherwise they would use that confirmation to pivot back to that escape route, don't say okay okay okay, or mmmm mmm mmm, make sure to make it clear that what he's saying is pointless and he actually did it with well with vigeland when she was saying her rubbish and he just dismissed it after she pointlessly laid everything down, he just sealed with it by dismissively saying \"that's nice\" and immediately moved back to the original argument...",

I swear to God this Livestream era has made YouTubers very lazy and lax, they don't even edit their videos well anymore...\n\nI didn't expect Sean who hasn't fallen for the Livestream addiction would have more good sense than that especially against freaking Sam Seder, the bad faith ingenious sophist extraordinaire in chief, to go to the debate without his stats...

Sam is trying to use Covid to deflect from the fact that the left and Democrats were pushing defunding and demoralizing the police which contributed to more crime.  \n\nSo he thinks that mentioning  Covid is a good distraction that makes his side appear innocent.\n\nIt went right over his head that Democrats pushed Covid lockdowns to such an extreme that it raised the unemployment rate, and kept both kids and adults away from social interactions that we all need to various degrees. \n\nWhen people are isolated and more worried about finances, it can intensify symptoms of depression and anxiety. Some people can handle that better than others, but clearly, some people couldn't handle it  and took that out on others. Sometimes, even if it meant breaking the law.\n\nSo Sam is a typical left winger.  He recharacterizes what others say, constantly interrupts to push his agenda, and only looks at data that supports his narrative. This guy is wrong so often that this is the only way he can get through a debate and pat himself on the back as if he's not a pseudo intellectual.",

There aren't many hard ways to explain that. He wasn't being interrupted, that's just some excuse right wingers say when they lose debates. \"let him talk\". No. Don't let him talk because he clearly doesn't know what he's talking about. His whole argument was about BLM protest after George Floyd being the PRIMARY cause for more crime in this country. Sam said explain your point, he explained his theory, Sam disproved it by showing that crime is down nationwide. Debate over. If BLM protest and bad policies led to more crime, then why is it reversing itself. It would be the exact opposite, you would see year over year that crime is getting higher. You don't see that. You see it getting lower. Which means that the spike in crime has nothing to do with policies or protest, it had everything to do with COVID and inflation. Once we got past COVID, what's happening? A drop in crime. So the argument was already won within the first 5 min. Sam won. Sean for the next 1 hr was trying to explain \"stupid\". My teacher would always say, when ppl are wrong, they'll try to explain \"stupid\". He then starts focusing on new York and certain states that may have had higher crime because his point about the entire country being at a peak of crime was bullshit and brought on by racist or prejudice feelings he has towards black ppl. You have them too.",

Sam based his arguments on downwards trend on reported crime, and not BOJ victimization survey, which captures unreported crimes as well since not all crime is reported. The downwards trend was also really small and within margin of error. Sam never proved it could simply be down to covid.

Whenever you watch a debate with Seder, every now and then ask yourself \"Are they still on topic or has the argument been sidetracked?\" Then you will start to notice his tactics.\n\nHe also poison's the well a lot, but he does it in a clever way.

For example:  Sean brings up New Orleans as a specific example for exploration, and Seder says \"let's talk about national numbers,\" then Sean talks about the national numbers, and when that didn't work, Seder says \"let's talk about Chesa Boudin and San Francisco.\"  Sean talks about that, and Seder moves onto Connecticut.  He's also condescending as hell, expressing disdain for what Sean knows and doesn't know, and saying things like \"I imagine you'd hate rehabilitation programs.\"\n\n\r\nAlso, saying the rioters \"were overdoing it\" is extremely insulting when at least 19 people are dead because of their actions, and countless other lives have been ruined by the financial and social damage done to the neighborhoods that had to endure the riots.",

Starting out with \"You're the expert, I'm the layman ...\", repeatedly saying \"So what you're saying is ... \" then strawmanning Sean, and of course the constant interruptions. I popped over to Sam's posting of this same debate because I was curious to read the comments, and couldn't help but notice how in his version Sean's sound quality is awful and his volume level way lower than Sam. Perhaps Majority Report just happens to have a super crappy production team but I wouldn't be surprised if they do that on purpose, as I remember Tim Pool having a similar complaint.",

He embarrassed Ben Shapiro a few years ago by asking simple questions - *I doubt Ben will ever go back on his show.* The same thing happened to Tim Pool with Sam.  \n\nI'm looking at this objectively. If you go back to the early to mid 2010s, *a lot of left wingers were scared to do debates* besides the odd outlier like Cenk Uygur. The left wing was laughably weak during that period. A lot of right wingers were able to rise to prominence who can't debate to save their lives.",

Even if you want to argue that the vast majority were peaceful, the FACT is that some were not, and those some led to dozens of deaths and injuries and billions of dollars of damages.

It's funny that Sam Seder are laughing at Sean while Sean fans are desperately trying to discredit the debate. Sean blamed the rise in crime on BLM protest of June 2020. All Sam did the whole time was ask that Sean back up his claim. Sean started citing laws that were already in place before the riots. So it was obvious that Sean and another right wing nut jobs are targeting the BLM protest while ignoring COVID or inflation, while also not providing any reasonable evidence to his claim outside of \"old cops retired\"",

There are many examples of his dishonesty, but that one really crystalizes it for me. Also, Sean, you did a really nice job of consistently correcting Sam whenever he would try to ascribe a position/statement to you that you don't believe and/or never said. For example, you would say something like, \"A large portion of the increase in crime is attributable to the public's attitude toward policing following the George Floyd riots.\" Then, Sam would try to ascribe a false belief to you by saying something like, \"So you think the increase in crime is because of attitudes towards police rather than the massive worldwide pandemic?!?\" You would consistently correct him and explain the nuance of your statements/beliefs. Very well done. Sam took an L for sure. It'll be difficult for him to find a 15 second clip that makes you look bad by taking you out of context, but I'm sure he'll find a way.",

At any rate, I would argue that Ana Kasparian, David Packman and Destiny are all able to debate from the left in good faith. The same is true for larger left-leaning media personalities like Sam Harris who has done a wonderful job cutting through the bullsht. \n\nIt’s hard to take right wing debate serious when you have people like Ben Shapiro doing a 42 minute diatribe on the fcking Barbie movie. Matt Walsh,having his entire identity as an obsessed with trans people nutjob. This while having a closet full of his own skeletons so deep that it’s like an Indian burial ground in there.  Tim Pool, who suggested Trump would win potentially 49/50 states. GTFO. This is ultimate grifting. Tim who called Emma a PDF without cause which Sean rightly pushed back on. \n\nCandace Owens who sued her school district with the NAACP because white kids were picking on her because she’s black; now she’s adopted an entirely different character for the bag. Steven Crowder dresses and drag more than Caitlyn Jenner but is transphobic af. This on top of his own personal insecurities with his sexuality. Just read his workplace harassment.

That’s why Ron DeSantis isn’t getting any traction with his “woke” culture wars. Most people do not even know what he’s talking about is. They don’t know who Dylan Mullvaney is — just like I didn’t.

        "text": "I'm curious what you define \"bad faith\" means. Because what I consider bad faith is cherry picking a bunch of data and trying to wrap it around a narrative you are trying to construct that you know to be false. And then gishgalloping all around a subject just tossing those bits of data out there without any context; and when Sam brings up context it is just ignored and then hops to some other completely unrelated point and never answering straight-forward and direction questions. Questions that you know answering completely obliterates your argument.\n\nIf you want the best example of this: It's when Sam asks him, multiples times at different points, \"So you are saying that police officer recruitment and/or retiretimes and/or people quitting is due to the George Floyd Effect even though you see similiar recruitment and/or retirements and/or people quitting in all industries during Covid. Would you attribute those other industries to the George Floyd Effect?\"\n\nWell the clear answer to that is: No. He can't address all of the other industries have the exact same systemic effect applying to it because then there is no \"special\" dynamic within policing, and then there is no George Floyd Effect. Because that it the logical followthrough the second you provided that context. \n\nSo lets talk about \"bad faith\" again, shall we? Do you not consider it not just bad faith, but also just outright dishonesty, to deliberately leave out context that you, me, and everybody watching this video can immediately identify removes his point as soon as it is provided? If his goal is \"the truth\", right? Why would he not provide all of the details that develop that truth and choose to only hyper-focus that justify a world0view that he wants to have. And he wants you to have. And it just-so-happens that world-view just-so-happens to disproportionatelynegatively impact communities of color, communities of poverty, and communities that are economically disadvantaged.  For whatever reason aligns with the world-view that is shared to virulent racists.\n\nWhich, as you know, is coincidental. \n\nSo the elements of argumentation that don't disproportionately impact those communities? Those are never included or addressed for some reason. And even when Sam points out these things in this discussion and makes him aware of these things? For some reason he doesn't change his perspective or his content. The next day, and the day after, and the weeks, months, etc after will continue to provide content that ignores that context and he continues to provide A very deliberate narrative that doesn't address any of the issues that Sam brought up here.\n\nStill has not been addressed to this day.",

        "text": "@Eon-Blue I agree that you are correct. But that is the problem with content like this and Jordan Peterson and etc and why it is so insidious.\n\nI’ll give you a great example: 13/50\n\nBlack people are 13% of the population and represent 50% of the convicted violent crime in the US.\n\nNow that is factual information. \n\nBut you can’t just state that and just leave it hanging. When you begin to explain to people that crime heavily correlates with poverty (for obvious reasons that somebody with a good job, nice house, and good life is much less likely to just randomly go strong-arm a gas station than somebody that lives in a shit ghetto, has no opportunities for work, doesn’t know how they are going to keep the lights on). When you explain how generation wealth works; and how a historic lineage of 400 years of slavery, followed by 90 years of Jim Crow laws that prohibits black families from obtaining money or housing to pass down to their children and grandchildren. When you explain the housing acts, the redlining, the cycle of imprisonment, how schools are funded by property taxes so inner-city schools are underfunded unlike high property-value surrounded suburban schools, dozens more examples.\n\nThis context explains why 13/50 exists. And when the problem is understood; then you can begin to provide solutions that would actually address the underlying societal problems. You would solve 13/50.\n\nBut people like this don’t do that. \n\nThey just say 13/50 and that’s it. And then will give you an anecdote that a black guy once beat up a white guy or something. That \n\nLeft to their own devices? The viewer has to come to their own conclusions. Maybe black people are just inherently violent? Maybe they are inferior beasts? Who knows 🤷🏼‍♀️?\n\nAnd with that conclusion all the rest of these prescriptions make sense. You have to over police those violent blacks! You got to throw them in jail to stop them! \n\nWhoa whoa whoa! This guy never outright said that blacks are violent though. And that’s the dodge. He never outright said it. He is just “saying”, ya know?",

This is the third time now I've seen him debate someone from the political sphere of online discourse and he has been smoked in each and every one.  He first debated Destiny and he flopped, he then debated Adam and Sitch and got absolutely smoked, and then he debated AJW and got bodied.  \nHe can't keep to a single line of questioning, he tried to cut you off after he realizes you have an answer, and then he immediately tries to pivot the second you give him the luxury of taking his questions seriously.  \nI'm so glad that people from the online politics sphere decided to debate him and his crew because it has thus far demonstrated exactly why people discarded him as not being worthwhile that we have three direct examples not only of him being shown as incapable of stepping on to the the fighting floor, but also absolutely painful to even attempt talking to.   \n\nHere's a hint, Sam.  The thing about bad-faith tactics is that they can work ONLY if you deploy them as specific moments but if 90% of what you're doing is bad-faith tactics then it becomes undeniable and unavoidable that it's what you're doing, and we all noticed it, Sam.  This was round three, before round 1 nobody took you seriously and when you attempted to prove them wrong about you all you did was cement the fact that you aren't feared in the slightest, you're just a dumb dumb who you can barely communicate with because even you realize when you're getting bodied and will deploy bad-faith tactics (and still lose) every.  Single.  Time.  You're not feared, you're discarded, Sam.",

He kept acting like a ass saying,\"you should know this stuff or heard about this article\" like no one can possibly know every article. He also had a team giving him shit that they nor him didn't read fully. \n\nCops quitting wasn't due to COVID that's literally common sense. They was quitting due to the ACAB movement and BLM riots. You, me, and everyone have seen the riots and police officers being pressured along with being treated harshly. Before you say ,\"well it's there fault\" no it isn't the action of a few doesn't represent the whole organization or group.  Sam is an idiot and yes I'm resulting to name calling, because he said a few times before not in this video that white people are racist,(I'm black) that's what idiots say. Also Sean wasn't deleting comments on his video unlike Sam.  Sam couldn't even debate properly. Talking like he understand something, but never made any good points and just move the question when he knew he mess up. \n\nSeriously explain to me how Sam was correct in anyway and how are we in a bubble.",

Right up top Sean is asked about what his position is in opposition to Sam's and he says the following: \"\"We've had a giant increase in crime since the blm riots, you can actually trace it in a lot of places to the month of the riots, where we had certain criminal justice reforms implemented that I believe are really driving the uptick in crime.\" He follows that up with context about the increase in the national homicide rate from 2020 to 2022. So Sean, all by himself, has set his initial thesis as the nationwide uptick in crime, particularly violent crime from 2020 to 2022 was driven by certain police reforms in the wake of the BLM riots, the \"George Floyd effect\" as he later calls it. When asked for specifics like \"what reforms?\" he flounders. He's able to cite one offs here and there but he already defined the scope as a national increase in crime, something that reforms in one or two one cities can't account for. Reforms that he can't even name. Furthermore, when pressed on this he evades by saying \"well that's not the only factor\" as if that were at all relevant when the thesis he's defending is  \"\"We've had a giant increase in crime since the blm riots, you can actually trace it in a lot of places to the month of the riots, where we had certain criminal justice reforms implemented that I believe are really driving the uptick in crime.\" He doesn't get to deflect to \"other factors\" after he hung his fucking hat on \"it was the post Floyd Effect police reforms that are driving the increase in crime.\" I shouldn't have had to explain that to you.

        "text": "@h8uall66​​⁠  apparently I’m already doing better, because you missed all the nuance in the conversation, exactly because you’re used to people like Sam Seder dumbing everything down at what they think it’s the level of their audience (to whom they afford very little respect).\n\nSean explained how the “George Floyd effect” was one of the *primary factors* for the post-June 2020 increase in violent crime, of which he attributes about 50% to 60% of causality due to consequences like advocacy for specific laws that made policing harder, rising anti-police sentiment, with all the related aspects, that drove many seasoned police officers to relocate or retire (and it did do so, because there’s an avalanche of statements from Police unions and records that directly attribute retirements to this factor), and several other factors.\nThis is very different from the “ALL OF THE INCREASE in crime is because of the George Floyd riots” reasoning that Sam Seder tries to continuously pin on Sean even when Sean repeats to him that he never said those exact words…. and that logic that Sam Seder uses is the same one that you have adopted as well: dumbing down the conversation to single, generic points, ignoring very precise statements and cherry picking data while ignoring all correlations that don’t support your ideological view. Luckily you at least followed the video by yourself, without having an entire team goggling stuff for you and shouting it from the other side of the room.\nThen Sean explains how the trajectory of the reforms that caused the increase in crime in 2020 had been already partially traced even before the riots, he makes the example of “raise the age” that was passed in 2018, which he indicates as having made it harder to arrest youthful offenders. He makes several examples of the reforms that were motivated by the George Floyd riots, from the general defunding of law enforcement agencies around the nation after June 2020, to specific examples like the funding cuts to the LAPD, the Minneapolis PD, etc. or the disbandment of the Street Crime Unit in NYC (a very effective primarily plainclothes unit) which happened just a few weeks after Floyd’s death as an undeniable direct response to the anti-police sentiment.\nHe makes the example of New Orleans, and how it implemented the same fund-cutting, unit-dismantling reforms that were literally advocated by the George Floyd riots, which were enacted before the pandemic took place, yet lead to the same exact rises in crime that Sam Seder attributes uniquely to the pandemic.\n\nSean’s reasoning is extremely clear, but if you’re used to just slogans, don’t know the specific laws that were enacted and the data that took effect after them, and especially if you ask a question like “which reforms?”, after ignoring the examples that were just made, and follow that question up with a completely unrelated topic, someone with the memory of a goldfish might forget the points that were made and will think that the previous question “wasn’t answered”.\n\nThe main argument that Sean makes is that a number of significant, often politically motivated criminal justice reforms (like defunding law enforcement agencies), contributed to causing a rise in violent crime from the late 2010s onwards, and that the George Floyd riots acted as a catalyst for more of those reforms to come into place at the same time (to which again, he made examples), leading to a measurable spike in violent crime right from June 2020 (Floyd died on May 25) that progressed to the point that several of those measures had to be rolled back specifically to contrast the rise in crime that they incentivized.\n\nOnly by applying the worst degree of bad faith, selective listening, and lack of nuance would you be able to miss the amount of stuff that you (and Sam Seder) left out.",

The fact that he gave himself extra hiding room by invoking unspecified “other factors” should not be impressive to you. If you were smarter you’d realize that “other factors” is just a convenient place for Sean to retreat to when his central thesis is shown to be lacking. As such, “other factors” became the bulk of his explanation for the rise in crime. In other words, he showed that police reforms actually didn’t account for much at all in his explanatory model. Definitely not as much as ad hoc rationalizations conjured up as needed. You shouldn’t be impressed by a man boldly proclaiming that the root cause of anything is “nebulous and inscrutable instances of happenstance.” Yet here you are.",

The same logic could be applied to you. Unless you somehow believe you are above bias. \n\nThere are tons of Religion debates, or Abortion debates where people on one side argue the person representing them didn't do a good job. Most people don't go into debates to have their minds changed, they are looking to see in the person argues their position well. And a lot of people are willing to accept when someone didn't argue their position well. \n\nYou assume Sean doesn't know these debate tactics, but I'd argue that he's just one of those \"I'd rather have a discourse than a debate\" type of guys. I mean the man has been on countless debates, he just believes (naively I might add) that he shouldn't stoop to their level.\n\nI am a random person on the internet yet you believe to know enough about me to state that \"I live in an echo chamber.\" Crazy.\n\nSam was always going to \"control\" this debate as Sean was on HIS platform. He was asking the questions. He and his producers controlled the medium. It was Sean and his laptop vs Sam, his producers and their multiple laptops. This was not a moderated debate. This was more like an interview. \n\nAll that being said, Sean did address Sam's major points and refuted them. Compare how hesitant Sam became to argue his usual positions once he knew Sean was knowledgeable. The same man that constantly argued that poverty drives crime, like gospel, started adding caveats, and arguing for multiple causes.",

He allowed Sam to talk all over him and let him steer the conversation wherever he wanted it to go. Sam pretty much got to ask the questions the entire time and Sean rarely if ever pressed him on his stupid claims. Sean should have gone more on the offense. You can't let a glorified sophist like Sam talk too much because it'll give the illusion that he is making good points.

While Sam was reading that article FOREVER, I was googling the article (which you should have done, too) and then its sources and it turns out the reported data they were using was combined blocks of 8-12 year periods.... which absorbed the massive spike in crime during the BLM riots because it ALSO contained the subsequent decreases in crime that came after the furor died down... delivering the relatively humble +/-20% decrease over the decade long period. There is obviously something significant happening in CT, but that doesn't prove or disprove anything you guys were talking about. It might be fun to chase the CT rabbit hole and see where it goes one day (my guess is a large criminal gang composed of police was broken up in the 1990's just like in Los Angeles), but it's not representative of anything except that it DOES show that zooming in on the data supplied by Sam proves Sean's point, not Sam's.\n\nI figure you will know everything there is to know about CT within moments of exiting the stream and you might have already bemoaned this moment on your own without my help. You're welcome anyway, Sean.\n\nI applaud and thank you for going on that man's ridiculous show and shining a light on him even if you weren't as prepared as you could have been.",

The specific part of the video is 15 mins in, but because a miscommunication or misunderstanding occurs, Sam thinks Sean is talking about a delayed effect or a specific singular item, however Sean is talking about a compounding effect (the law X and law Y structure I created). This effect is measured by the increase in crime and the way criminals operate (which they don't get into, or if they do I didn't last that long).",
