what was you thinking when you did it some [ __ ] don't think Memphis Grizzly Star John Morant has been suspended for a second time after once again appearing to flash a gun on social media [Applause] [Music] [Applause] believe it or not I am not here to make jam Around The Conch Shell of the week flip a seat we hit my cerebellum today you get it cerebellum free it's a summer party in my mind I met thems the Vibes do they roll the tape skip I think a lot of people say I wanted me to come out here today and say I'm surprised I'm shocked I'm disappointed in jobs behavior and I'm not I said before the best apologies change behavior and when he was going through all this diatribe about what he learned about being away from the game Skip and how important it was to him I say I see better than I hear I heard everything y'all said now say now moving forward I'm going to see if the behavior meets what he said and clear right on and so at this point in time skip where I am I'm not even upset at y'all I'm not mad I'm not disappointed I'm not embarrassed I'm mad I'm upset I'm disappointed I'm disgusted by the people that defended him listen I know Shannon sharpen his fine ass is angry at everyone who defended John Moran and Shannon baby can I call you baby husband listen hear me out it's not that I want to defend jamaran per se I got my cape on but I don't got it all the way on drape to the side if you know what I mean it's that multiple things can be true multiple things can true and I just wonder whether we as a society have some responsibility in creating the jamarans that we're not acknowledging or exploring and in that same vein if we are in any way responsible do we owe them some Grace and a conversation about what we can and should be doing differently moreover I really want to impact why people are actually mad at John Morant and what exactly they're policing because I think we're gonna find a lot of anti-blackness respectability politics and the need to control the black man running wild beneath the surface for those who don't watch sports neither do Agile I'm in the NBA's business for a specific set of reasons today so I'm gonna give us just the basic information that's relevant for our purposes if you want a sports Deep dive take your ass on to ESPN now John Morant is a 23 year old NBA player for the Memphis Grizzlies he was the second NBA draft pick in 2019 the next year he was named NBA Rookie of the Year and in 2022 he was put in his first NBA All-Star game as a starter and at the end of that season the NBA award him as the most improved player I say all that for two reasons one being if you're gonna have someone's name in your mouth you could at least put some respect on it where it's due and two I want to emphasize for context what we're talking about a 23 year old boy who's been in the NBA for four years suddenly making millions and millions and millions of dollars just to be exact for my strategic sisters out there he reportedly has a five-year contract for 194 million three hundred thousand dollars baby he got money anyway child John around is in trouble for the second time this year and he's in so much trouble it's left the orbits of sports Twitter and made its way to my world that's not good because it means there's something a little nuanced if not downright political under the surface back in March Jamarion got suspended for eight games without pay because he brandished a gun on Instagram live while in a Colorado nightclub let me translate that it was a light light diet version of this [Music] and then he was chastised up and down by everybody and their mama he apologized he promised he wouldn't do it again and now mind you not me not me just not me spacing out of my own brain my fault it's worth mentioning that he wasn't criminally charged because no crime was actually committed Moran hasn't and isn't breaking the law he is violating an NBA policy but fast forward to May and jam around is in trouble again because he yet again flashed his gun on Instagram live while listening to some music in the car with his friends and let me be fair let me be fair let me be fair that is in fact pong shell behavior and for that the Memphis Grizzlies have suspended him indefinitely so let me just concede to some stuff so we can get it out the way one I am highly aware that this is not a second amendment rights thing in the sense that the NBA is a corporation with policies and the right to enforce them against their players and in this case John morantis violated the same rule twice within a short period of time so I'm not saying you have to feel sorry for him that's fine whatever but that doesn't mean we can't examine and critique the policy itself and a lot of how people are talking about and thinking about John Morant and I know a lot of people are the mindset that it's florals he knew the rules when he signed up a lot of rules and policies are unjust and someone has to challenge them if we take the attitude of the people agree to something then they have no room to complain push back or improve upon something then we'd all be [ __ ] who I am aware that black people are not on John Moran side either for the most part I think most people probably feel a lot like fine now shining sharp not so much because we're deeply judging the act of flashing a gun on IG live but because it happened to you do you need to dance with a gun do you jack did a gun be calling out to you [ __ ] I'm being problem for me is that while black people are mostly just mad at him because he's knowingly breaking a rule that just doesn't need to be broken and thus senselessly the bad not because we agree with the rule or innately share the biases that motivate the rule or the associated characterizations white people are making about jamarat but not enough people are pushing back on the obvious biases and perceptions of black men motivating what's going on here for me van Lathan actually made this point on Twitter and he was killing it so I'm tagging him in his co-counsel hair he said question seriously just curious let's say John had a YouTube page dedicated to him being a gun enthusiast pure shooter 12 or something he's shooting cleaning reviewing guns would you look at his displays different is the guns or The Manor in which he displays them the problem the replies themselves really Illustrated exactly what van was getting at one user replied LOL what the manner is him trying to act gangster stop it bro are you dumb are you dumb to which van followed up with trying to act gangster this is what I'm getting at is this image gangster to you it's certainly scary to me all these people look like they want to shoot someone are they gangster a friend of mine was firmly of the John Moran and his stupid ass Brigade said yummy yummy yummy yummy normally I'd be with you but it ain't like the NBA have a problem with guns people was posting pictures of Draymond Green smiling on the gun range and showing how he was fine with that they mad here because of how John Moran had the gun yes exactly that is precisely my problem that's an aggravating factor in my eyes not a mitigating one because what exactly is the problem here what is the NBA specifically policing an image a certain depiction of a black man with a gun look at it John Morant is not running around committing crime shooting up the plays gun button people pointing the gun at people or being accused of having an illegal gun no he has a legal gun and there's nothing criminal about his actions and the fact alone that in a country that glamorizes gun use is a goddamn American right to bear arms it's literally nothing short of racist and pardon the pun a Smoking Gun that there were people like Aiden Ross saying and I quote lock him up he's a thug lock him up put him in prison solitary confinement put him in there put him in jail the moment he saw John Morant with a gun as always inconceivable this black man from South Carolina who went to college in Kentucky and lives in Tennessee could have a legal gun and I appreciate that Draymond Green did acknowledge that fact I don't condone what John has done but what I will say is I saw a couple of people screaming like lock him up lock him up like it's actually not illegal to have a gun in a lot of places in America so to just start screaming lock him up you all actually don't know if he broke a law is Josh stupid no but if you're gonna call him stupid for something call him stupid because he's [ __ ] the bag twice in a two-month span not because you think black people have an obligation to tap dance around white people's stereotypes and negative perceptions of us and unfortunately the latter is what's motivating a lot of the harsh criticism jobs receiving one Twitter user actually admits much quote he said my issue with it is the fact that the NBA is already considered the thug League because black people have always held basketball in the Chokehold LOL van Lathan absolutely replied yeah but I don't care about making people who think the worst about me think the best about me and Bing because black people can't and shouldn't be expected to live our lives or order our steps based on the perceptions of people who view our mere presence as tantamount to the presence of thugs while actively profiting off of and seeking to control those bodies and while I'm at it also haven't appreciated people's attack on Jam around with the whole he's trying to be a gangster thing and the whole he comes from a good home so he has no excuse to do this or he's in the NBA blah blah blah blah blah what the [ __ ] that have to do with the price of tea and goddamn China something that frustrates me deeply about America is the way this country relentlessly shits on people for being the natural products of the world they're living in it's the same thing that pisses me off about expensive ass New York City constantly complaining about homeless people like the sky high rent prices aren't to blame like people are just choosing to live on the streets because they hurt us a good time in our book the will to change bell hook said where and how do boys learn what it means to be a man they seem to learn it all too often from the mass media and from the most visible males in their Community particularly their peers why would it surprise us ask yourself why would it surprise us or require all this moral condemnation that any 23 year old American man would think there's something manly or cool or fun about flashing a gun let alone one in the NBA with millions of dollars who spent his own entire life in gun Toten States and don't just try to put it under rappers or hip-hop music although sure of course yeah but rappers did not come up with popularize or even go the hardest for the idea that guns and showing off your guns is some manly [ __ ] to do be for real America is a country where white men in fact the whole damn Republican party makes it their business to show us their whole family blinking up on a regular basis tell me a lie tell me a lie have the damn right wing Talking Heads have visible guns in their backgrounds all the time people feel be for real no serious beef real and listen I get it it's extra nuts to everyone because he did it twice Ena you're behind all this yes and you'll never catch me but that's also a byproduct of patriarchy that doesn't surprise me either or make me take exceptional fault with him what do I mean by that in the will to change bell hooks talks about the way we teach boys not to express their feelings in words so they either act out or they implode they're taught that violence guns those kinds of things are the easiest pass to manliness so emotionally alienated boys boys and men who are going through things internally that they do not know how to address because they've been taught they're not allowed to act out that's about Hook's quote and that does not stop being the case because they're from affluent homes or are affluent themselves which is why as Bell hooks emphasize violence and acting out is just as common amongst emotionally alienated Boys in affluent homes as it is in their poor counterparts in other words patriarchy come for everybody so it doesn't matter to me that John Morant is an NBA player from a good home or whatever has led people to spare him no Grace because none of that renders it absolutely Bonkers that he would act out anyway ciao all in all if you are watching this John Marantz all I can do is pray for you matter of fact buy your head amen this is the best I could please please please [Music] my boy foreign man in a foreign line said something to me about pigs this week and that made me want to give you all a pig's fat and as a Bahamian I have to tell you about the Exuma pigs okay there is an island in the Bahamas named Exuma and then a beach called Pig Beach that's inhabited with about 20 to 25 amazing beautiful big ass pigs that we love and treasure the oldest one's name is Big Mama
