If memory serves, there was an altercation with one of the employees in the parking lot. \nAnother incident happened after an NBA game, when the opposing team was leaving on a bus and a laser scope was being pointed through the window from a car that belonged to Ja Morant, though it is very likely it was a member of his entourage.   \nThen he posted a video from the club flashing a gun right after reports of these incidents had come out that resulted in the first suspension, now this other gun flashing video and second suspension.

I believe that when discussing these topics the full situation needs to be looked at in the clips used of Sharpe there literally discussing the other accusations. When applying theory’s and frameworks context is needed and for this situation I think a key chunk in why there’s so much outrage was missed and while there’s racist clowns the majority was based on why he’s acting like a dumbass but the sections on patriarchy make perfect sense.",

My problem is that Jay is acting like a driller when he’s a ball player and I’m only talking about the message that he sending to the kids respectability politics be  damned. As a matter of fact, if Ja was talking, gun ownership, safety, etc. for black folks, then he should be applauded but that ain’t the case. I’m not mad about how white people look at us I’m mad that Ja knows what that imagery is and what it convey’s our young … I would argue that if we have the responsibility to give Ja some grace … and not go too harshly on what it looks like… then he should have some responsibility to the young people that watch him every day drill culture is crazy and it’s getting out of hand and all though guns in crime we’re here long before hip-hop music and will be here long after drill music that culture and that imagery is exacerbating a lot of the issues in the hood.  And I do understand that it is a byproduct of patriarchy and capitalism. There a group of boys around my way, and they are drillers IRL … beefing with some boys 20 blocks away… this gang warfare is not about money drug corners drug proceeds. Nothing like that it’s about rap and the Internet and bodies have dropped and talking to these boys about Africa with late stage capitalism or patriarchy. Don’t seem to be doing the job Ja is mimicking that kind of imagery.",

Flashing a gun carried not in a holster and loaded is a problem, but so are many shooting range videos. If you're concerned about him safety, you best react more violently to someone using a scope without intent to fire and equally violently to people not minding their barrel on a range as to people flashing improperly carried guns or goofing off this way.

    "text": "Loved the editing but really cannot see further than you on this argument. I don’t see how the policing of ja has anything to do with the racial profiling when it’s not anything legally unbinding that he’s doing and more breaking the civic rules of a multi billion dollar industry he’s apart of. They’re the only one policing the situation and i feel like defending his actions via patriarchy is what enables this behavior. The idea is to have preventive measures , especially when the same individual has multiple violations of civic unrest involving firearms. No it might not be illegal to have a firearm, but it’s extremely dangerous nonetheless to hold a fully loaded pistol by the fingertips smiling like it’s no big deal - and yes absolutely yes this is a huge difference than being at a gun range with safety measures and training in place. I don’t think anyone likes that photo of the white family with guns either, that shits cringe as hell and just as toxic imo",

    "text": "This is something that has always bugged me about \"American Gun Culture.\" There is a HUGE amount of \"ok for me, but not for thee!\" going on.  If you are even vaguely brownish, SOMEONE will be upset with you owning a gun. If you are a woman who isn't attracted to men and you own a gun, someone will get butthurt. If you are trans and own a gun, someone will get butthurt. Hell if you are white and NOT christian, someone will view you as a threat if you own a gun. If you are liberal/leftist/progressive and own a gun, you'll likely be attacked by both parties for owning a gun. Me, a firearms safety instructor, has been called a race traitor for teaching firearms safety to young black men. (I don't care what race/color/creed/religion someone is. I DO care that they're a responsible rational owner.)  Yeah, aside from white christianity, american gun culture is possibly the most hypocritical aspect of american culture.",

The majority of the backlash comes from people projecting stereotypes onto him and blowing this way out of proportion. But yeah you did a great job detailing the respectability politics side of this. Great vid as always!",
