we are seeing layoffs in the tech industry like we haven't seen in a very long time at notable companies like Amazon Microsoft and Google are laying off thousands to tens of thousands of staffers and because of this we're seeing videos and perspectives and people coming out and pointing out that these people had it too good in their opinion that these people had fantastic workplaces that these people are basically Perpetual children so what I want to do in today's video is actually discuss that sentiment give you my thoughts on the layoffs tell you how it's not all great just because you're seeing people that you may not like get laid off and talk about this overall attitude in this country and possibly the recession that's coming up but before we get into that I just want to say this video is not sponsored those of you who have been signing up over on my website actualjusticewarrior.com join thank you so much patreon subscribe star even the YouTube members this one is for you so like I said there are a bunch of layoffs in the tech sector in fact since the start of 2022 all the way through till now we've seen about 200 000 jobs just snapped out of existence gone done done for and all that and a lot of people do not feel too bad for the people that are losing their jobs we all know the trouble of Facebook after they converted into meta and all the layoffs that that happened however what people are tending to focus on right now are these Tick Tock videos of people showing their day-to-day lives at these jobs and that is causing a lot of people to not feel bad for anybody who recently got laid off because it seems like these people are just children that are at a playground and not actually doing a lot of work come to the Google NYC office with me the first thing we did was grab lunch there were so many options and we ate it on the rooftop Terrace with an insane view of New York City I started with a kale salad and had some veggies and the food was actually phenomenal so this is one of those videos that are going viral now it's the Google office out of New York City you guys know that I live in New York City so I have a bit of a perspective on New York City and one of the things that I've taken note of besides the food that I just showed you is the complete and utter amount of space that these people have at the workplace in New York City where everybody's stacked on top of each other one of if not the most densely populated cities in the United States of America Manhattan the most densely populated portion of New York City space is an absolute premium you guys have heard about studio apartments going for three thousand dollars a month yes that is in fact true so to see all this sprawling space that is featured in these Tick Tock videos a part of me the visceral part of me wants to get really angry wants to get mad at them and that's not even talking about the food although I will say New York City has a lot of great food and some of it's not that expensive that being said this food definitely is very expensive so these people come in they have a catered lunch that's the first thing that she does which means she's coming in around noon into Manhattan and then enjoying that launch on a rooftop with the beautiful view of New York City again just dollar after dollar being dropped on these employees just to enjoy a life of luxury we then took the scooters to the game room yes they have a game room how cool is that they have pong tables and a bouldering wall so then they go to a game room because there's a game room at this place yes these kids are that pampered and really children is the proper word for them because everything that's described sounds more like a high-end kindergarten rather than an actual workplace but there was work being done at Google's NYC office according to this Tick Tock video let me play you a clip of that work being done so you could see exactly how intense these high-end people actually get Google also has these micro kitchens which are stocked with unlimited snacks and drinks and here we're just making a note latte we worked for literally two minutes and then took a nap in these nap pods now you're really not winning anybody over when you talk about how you did that literally two minutes of work or should I say literally two minutes of work and then took a nap and a nap pod you sound like an over pampered child and this is one of the reasons why people are actually getting quite angry at the employees at Google and are kind of celebrating kind of enjoying the layoffs now that being said I actually don't begrudge anybody who has a good work situation I know we're gonna talk about some of the things that these people believe in some of the things that they do and how some of them are actually quite literally the author of their own Peril look at me using literally now after hearing that girl doing it once probably two minutes and then took a nap in these nap pots and that's another day at the office but I will say the reason why these offices have so many perks and look like campuses is because there's such competition for people skilled in mathematical Realms that essentially they're designed to lure people in who would otherwise go into finance and base basically be that East Coast Wall Street kind of thing where you end up working in cubicles so because the pay is often equivalent or similar enough what these tech companies ended up doing is making playgrounds as compared to the brutal cubicles that JP Morgan or Goldman Sachs in order to lure these people in so if not for these perks we would just have more people in the finance sector more people at Gold than sex more people at JP Morgan so overall I understand why this is the way it is Bill Gates had a very famous quote when they asked him what his greatest competition was he didn't name another tech company he said Goldman Sachs because they're competing for these mathematical skilled people because they're such a limited number of them and thus supply and demand ends up producing this kind of workplace and again don't begrudge you for having it that being said I could not help but notice based on the professions that are in these videos and the people being laid off that these don't appear to be the high-end mathematical technical skill kind of people these appear to be all those extra people that they hired over at Google in order to have an equity agenda in order to enforce censorship on people like you and these are the same exact people that ended up promoting the lockdowns which of course ended up leading to the recession in fact Google would censor news critical of the coveted lockdowns Google YouTube and all these big tech companies would go after people who pointed out that maybe these lockdowns aren't great ideas maybe they're going to have devastating economic ramifications so these very same people who aren't coders or anything like that that put the agenda forward the equity agenda forward over at Google appear to finally be feeling the brunt of what they advocated for while everyday Americans had been feeling it since the lockdown was initiated remember all these people were Pro lockdown because they were fully capable of working remote if you lost your restaurant or whatever ever they would say that's a consequence of you know the pandemic or whatever we all have to make sacrifices and it feels like they're getting that portion of the sacrifice and that's what people I think are really cheering on my life working from the Google LA office I always grab some candy from the reception before heading in this used to be an old aircraft Hangar so the decorations hanging from the ceiling kind of looks like an aircraft flying in before it was a Google office this aircraft Hangar belonged to Howard Hughes so there's tons of memorabilia so we're moving on to another video and this one actually has an update which is one of the reasons why I'm focusing on it and it probably went viral for a second time after this girl ended up posting the update but first we start out of course with her scanning into the Google LA office and immediately grabbing for some candy again we're talking about people being treated like their children so I understand that base jealousy or Envy or anger over this especially if you're working one of those hardcore with your hands kind of trade jobs but the thing is this is dude to the fact that there is competition with mathematical Talent however like I said it doesn't appear that these people or those high-end mathematical nerds like it doesn't appear like these people would be working in finance it appears like Google hired a bunch of these people in order to fill out a bunch of diversity quotas and they're just enjoying the high-end perks that being said it wouldn't be a Google video without the Absurd decorations and of course the food next I'm gonna pass by these art installations they're a really good photo op or you can sit in there and get some work done I'm gonna head to the coffee shop to grab some coffee and a fruit cup since I missed breakfast now this is the office in Los Angeles and despite the fact that La is one of our biggest cities in the United States of America is actually two in terms of population behind New York City space isn't at that much of a premium in comparison although it is a bit of a problem due to the fact that they have all these rules and regulations because of the fact that they have so much of La zone for single-family housing so it's not a situation where the average person in Los Angeles lives in a tiny apartment it's more of a situation of the average person in Los Angeles can't really live in Los Angeles so they have to commute hours and hours during their day in order to get to work so I understand again why the people who are looking at this who have to live at the Bottom Rung of society are getting quite bitter especially since LA and these kind of people over at Google were working remote they were like oh lockdown's no big deal we gotta do it for the virus while people who had to actually go out and work like physically at their location not saying Tech work isn't work we're losing their jobs due to those lockdowns and again Google and all these social media companies instituted policies that made it impossible to even criticize the lockdowns and talk about these negative effects so these layoffs are consequences of what a lot of these people advocated for I can't point to this person directly and say she was a chair leader of this but it is likely based on the fact that Google is overwhelmingly Democrat and again people who could work from home were overwhelmingly in support of the lockdowns now I work from home it's very nice I enjoy it but I don't pretend that like I'm the only person or my job is the only type of job out there that's why I understood everybody who was like Hey I could lose my job I have members of my family who ended up losing their job due to the pandemic and this is one of the reasons why I wanted people to be able to make their own choice about whether or not they would go out and work which is that bare minimum consideration that a lot of these people who are Ultra pampered in the office in the first place never gave their fellow countrymen and then I'm heading over to this butterfly themed room to take my first meeting and I'm gonna head over to the confetti room to take my next meeting it's so sparkly and beautiful in here I love that a lot of our rooms are themed I love that a lot of our rooms are themed again I'm not trying to hate on people who end up having this kind of luxury at the office I want people to be as comfortable as possible at work because the alternative is everybody having sucky work conditions and I don't want that for you guys so I think in part we can aspire to having a work situation like this and I know exactly why it's laid out like this however it is funny that these people in particular are the ones who look down on you and thumb their nose at you and again told you that you weren't even allowed to speak out against the lockdowns while they're enjoying such luxury and I'm gonna grab my two favorite drinks which is this green tea and coconut water next I'm gonna go upstairs and grab some lunch they always have pizza and a variety of different vegetables and meat the food is always really good and of course everything you see in the office is free the food is always really good and again everything is free now there is a strategy behind Google doing this they wanted to keep their hyperproductive mathematical people in the office as long as possible and going out to lunch and all that actually takes up valuable time so they in their calculations figured out that if they serve you catered food that's really good in the office that would allow you to stay in the office and get more work done but one of the things that you'll notice about this video is that no work is being done again we're talking about people that don't appear to be working in the high-end technical sector these are people who are enjoying the perks that is made due to the fact that mathematical skills are at a premium when they don't appear to have those mathematical skills these are more likely to be your people in content moderation these are more likely to be your people in HR these are more likely to be the people who hate you for who you are and want to harm you while pretending they're not the greatest elitists of our society on my way out of the cafe I ran into a doogler which is a dog googler and ran into some ghosts when they were renovating the office there were a lot of spooky stories from the crew so there's a whole area in the office where you can listen to them I know this isn't going to be popular because everybody likes dogs I like dogs I got nothing against dogs but this obsession with bringing your dog everywhere this obsession with your dog being a part of your family is also a sign of immaturity and again one point in the future we will do an entire video it will be my most disliked video of all time about how this over emphasis on loving animals is actually a substitute in a misplaced maternal love that we're seeing throughout our society I'm so tired of the term dog bomb and one day we're gonna tackle that issue but I have to be at about half a million subscribers because I know I'm gonna lose a hundred thousand when I drop my hottest of hot takes then I got more work done and headed over to the massage chairs to wrap up my day let me know what you want to see next now I do want to point out that both of these videos that took place at Google were being posted on Tick Tock and Google has YouTube shorts which is the competitor to tick tock so by its very nature I would fire these people immediately for posting these videos because again they're doing it on a competitor site on top of that Tick Tock steals a bunch of your data it is Chinese malware so these people are possibly turning over secrets of the Google company to the Chinese and you know the best way to do corporate Espionage is to get these overpampered children to install your corporate Espionage app on their device on their own and then have critical information be communicated to those devices now there's a Facebook video it's the exact same thing I'm not going to show it to you due to the fact that there's copyrighted music but more crucially we actually had a follow-up video from this very girl that I just showed you with the Google video that we absolutely have to get into because this is one of the reasons why this person in particular went viral life getting laid off at Google so I woke up to this really ominous text for my boss and I honestly had no idea what it was going to be about so I called her the minute I woke up and saw this and she told me to check the news and my email so I rushed downstairs to find out that I had lost access to basically everything I couldn't log into my email or even check my calendar so I just want to point out that this girl who makes tick tocks all day hangs out in a massage chair has breakfast unlimited snacks and lunch and by the way some places that I've been have actually had unlimited snacks if you don't know this over at the blaze Studios they actually have a little bit of a snack bar and a coffee bar there nothing this fantabulous or anything like that but again perks for your voice not against it you should treat your employees well but this girl has a giant place by La standards and I just needed to point out that she had to go downstairs to her computer when I'm shooting quite literally in my bedroom as a YouTuber with 200 plus thousand subscribers I called my boss back and we just sobbed over the phone because she was also finding out about my layoff for the first time today too I know it's very tempting to laugh at this girl for filming herself crying and talking about how she just cried and had a cry session over the phone with her boss but losing your job sucks did I ever tell you guys the story of when I first got fired well I was in college and as a part of my degree I actually had to take a physical education class touch football I ended up taking it with a friend since childhood we always had fun playing that as kids and guess what last day of the class I end up spraining my ankle it swells up massively but at the time my job was to sell remote control helicopters at the wall in the ghetto so I call my boss tell my mom crutches basically I won't be able to walk for a few weeks and then I'll be on crutches so I couldn't come into work the next day this is what I was telling him because I was going to the doctor the next day he fired me he said you're done you cut he thought I was lying maybe and he's like it's over for you if you don't come in tomorrow you're fired and that's how I got fired from my first job when I was in college and because of this I actually didn't have enough money to finish paying off my first degree I was short about 700 but you know I had to live I actually couldn't go to my first college graduation because of that because they wouldn't let me go until I closed out my books so think about that so it sucks I've been there I understand it however that's what happened to me after losing my job we gotta get into what happened to her after she lost her job I started getting calls from a bunch of my co-workers and started finding out who else was let go on my team and some neighboring teams as well but I think the worst part is that it seems like no one was consulted on this decision and everyone was just finding out about the layoffs at the same time it just felt like a really bad game of Russian Roulette and there was no consistency around who was let go it was also not Performance Based so it just felt really random I'm gonna say they let go of a lot of the excess staff a lot of the people who weren't programmers who weren't high-end mathematically skilled people the people who aren't in that much demand the ones who have the diversity quota fill out qualification and that's how they got the job but she does want to emphasize that it definitely was in Performance Based which I sincerely doubt because I've seen a day in a life from her at Google I opened up LinkedIn which honestly was not great for my mental health there were so many people who were in the same boat that were both equally as shocked and blindsided but it did help me feel a little less alone honestly I spent so much of the day crying that I just felt so tired from being sad and wanted to do something that would just make me feel better luckily I have an annual pass so I headed over to Disneyland because I wanted to go eat my feelings so I started off with a cinnamon Galaxy churro she went to Disneyland that's what she did after she got laid off she went to Disneyland now here's the thing this is actually a big debate point for me because in a way it's kind of badass after something bad happens to you that you're like you know what I'm going to Disneyland I mean Michael Jordan after he won a championship said he was going to Disney World this has become a thing a meme and all that but as somebody smart pointed out in the replies when I asked about this on Twitter she has an annual pass as an adult to Disneyland luckily I have an annual pass so I headed over to Disneyland because I wanted to go eat my feelings and when you think back to our workplace and you think back to the themes one of the things that you realize is that these people are Perpetual children these people don't grow up they don't seem to have any of the impacts of the real world and again I think following the lockdowns that were supported so heavily by big Tech by big Tech employees to the point where they were censoring people who ended up disagreeing with them a lot of people feel like hey you know what you did things that drove us into a recession or you cheered things on that drove us into a recession enjoy the consequences of that recession so after shooting the remainder of this video my conclusion my outro and all that I ended up noticing that a black conservative perspective who's a good guy by the way he actually said some very nice things about me recently actually did a video on this topic and his video opened up with some other videos that I had not found that really emphasized my point so I just want to show you some of these clips and and talk about and have you guys think about whether or not my theory of the diversity hires being out first is actually supported by the facts update I got laid off yesterday seriousness yes I did get laid off unfortunately 12 000 people got laid off at Google yesterday so if you didn't know that I worked at Google I might have been there for almost four years I'm a technical recruiter or I guess I should say I was a technical recruiter I don't know what a technical recruiter is but it sounds like it's not an actual high-end Tech thing it sounds like she's somebody who recruits people in order to get hired at Google like she goes out and solicits people to work there which makes a lot of sense not saying anything not trying to get in any trouble but she is a nice looking person and she looks quite personable so I would probably send her out to be a recruiter especially if I was trying to fill out my staff with more females because of all the criticisms that these tech companies are all about the Bros and the dudes and all that not saying anything just saying not not making any commentary but you guys heard my commentary I was part of the Google layoff on Friday I was working there for over nine years I'm also six months pregnant this is decaf this is not how I thought my career at Google would come to an end now again I wanted to leave this one in here in particular because this is somebody who spent nearly a decade over at Google six months pregnant just got laid off and even though these are people who largely supported the lockdowns by the statistics we don't know about the individuals and even though they have very nice workplaces I don't begrudge them for that on its own and it's still a human thing to lose your job six months pregnant with no job absolutely disastrous we understand it's disasters so we can still sympathize for people that in other circumstances we might vehemently disagree with however the next one is definitely one that may fit my theory you know what let me tell you something I was just laid off today um by the Big Daddy G that engineering software tool that everybody uses with two zeros in the middle of those G's l e you know I don't want to make any snap judgments I don't want to make any assumptions because we all know the worst thing you can do in our society is Judge anything or have any kind of preconceived notions or anything like that but I would guess if I had to put my own money on the line that this guy is probably not a high-end computer programmer this guy probably worked some superficial position at what he calls the Big Daddy G I was just laid off today um by the Big Daddy G look I don't know maybe look there's computer programmers that totally Dash a brand expectations and all that but the ones that I've met and some of them are actually in my audience uh not not that particularly like the this guy there's there's a few things mannerisms and and all that that would lead me to indicate that maybe he was hired for a less high-end technical role I'm not saying anything I'm just saying well we can make jokes while we could have fun while we could mock the children that are being laid off that are finally facing some real world consequences I think it's important to note that this is not a good sign overall for this country and I probably could have seen this coming just based on my own experience posting videos on YouTube which by the way is a subsidiary of alphabet which is also Google so one of the things that I've noticed over the past couple of months is that ad rates are significantly down I got the same exact amount of views more or less in December of 2022 that I did in December of 2021 and guess what my income from ad Revenue was cut in half probably slightly more than half and since Google despite all this playground despite all their hobbies and all that is fundamentally an advertising company so I knew there was a lot of trouble at the company when advertising rates dropped this significantly at the end of the year which is typically the peak advertising season and one of the reasons why this is happening is because a lot of advertising is fueled by cheap money with lower interest rates and interest rates have been going up so even though we're seeing layoffs at Google and all these companies you need to understand that's a consequence of a lack of advertising which is a consequence of a lack of sales which is a consequence of a sluggish economy and a recession that's going to hurt a lot more people than those we consider to be spoiled brats over at Big Tech having their latte machines and their catered meals and their rooftop dining so while you may want to celebrate mock or whatever these people and the position that they find themselves in understand that a lot of good people that aren't in the tech sector that aren't overly paying tempered that shouldn't have worked at a place that paid them enough to build up enough of an emergency fund to weather a storm are also getting laid off they're also facing these consequences and you might face these consequences I know I'm dealing with losing almost half of my income the thing is I'm incredibly lucky because I have you guys out there that actually support me I can produce more content in the hopes that you guys will enjoy that and thus that can make up some of the Gap although I am producing nearly twice as much content for half as much income something that also troubles me a little bit but a lot of people aren't like that a lot of people when they get fired from their job they don't have another source of income they can't just do something like this twice as much and hope for better results so honestly while it is fun to make fun of these videos and all that some dark times are coming the Biden administration's economic policies not a great plan and we're dealing with the consequences of lockdowns still at this point in time and inflation and all these other issues so it's kind of hard for me to hate on people who have better working conditions than I do when I think we should aspire to have good working conditions when they get laid off because I know for a fact that a lot of good people who aren't jerks like a lot of these people over at Google are going to be struggling soon or already struggling now but hey those are just my thoughts let me know your thoughts down in the comments below if you like this video you can
