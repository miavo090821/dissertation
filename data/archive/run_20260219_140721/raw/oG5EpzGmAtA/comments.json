        "text": "For me it has been *much* more disheartening to realize that I am the minority, I'm not \"pretending\" or \"disavowing\" things that don't reflect kindness/decency or what have you, it's that I *GENUINELY* get a little sick watching things that are bigoted, rapey, or whatever. I have loved certain songs my ENTIRE life, and now, hearing Diddy's voice on them makes me feel literally ill. \n\nAnd when I speak up about that, people have insinuated that I am \"moralizing\" and that \"you know you still like it, you just feel like you shouldn't\" - and while I'd never say DELETE those songs completely, or other media bc of the reasons stated in the video....\n\nI genuinely, *TRULY* had no idea how people are still deriving genuine enjoyment from those types of things while believing they \"care\" about rape, or dv victims. Just like they thought I was lying about secretly still being into media that depicts certain things and people as desirable, I, on the other hand, thought *those people* were lying about saying they think rape and coercion is wrong, and abhorrent, but still getting their chuckles easily while watching How I Met Your Mother, for example. I literally *can't overlook it, because I CANNOT find raping and coercing women funny*, bc that's not funny to me. Clearly it is to other people. I cannot bop my head to songs where there are lines clearly about underage kids and violence towards women, because I genuinely cannot find them fun. Bc that's not *fun* to me. One thing cancels out the other.\n\nAnd yes, I have a spectrum- so I'm able to suspend disbelief with Powerpuff Girls and other things, sometimes, but I still can only get but so far into Sex and the City- EVEN THO I enjoyed it originally as a lil kid, *because* I don't find their casual racism, bigotry and nonsense fun. It takes me out of the \"fun\", even though, clearly it doesn't for plenty of other people. Some shows and things are fun enough for me to ignore the fly in the ointment, but I never am able to pretend the fly isn't there, or not be disgusted there's a fly in the first place.\n\nAnd I wish there was a phrase for people like me, who aren't \"practicing virtue mirroring\" or purposefully trying to browbeat others. I was and continue to be *GENUINELY* shocked and bummed that I am apparently the weird one.",

Zero critical thinking or analyzing what they're told, just 100% believing anything and everything their chosen media source says is gospel from God Himself, not being able to grasp the concept of nuance if their life depended on it, and not caring about things unless it personally affected _them_ because of their complete inability to place themselves in someone else's shoes or have basic empathy. \n\nI'm so exhausted of how fucking stupid our society has intellectually become.",

This is a similar argument to people racistly raving about 'black spiderman' despite the simple fact that anyone can be spiderman because that's how Stan Lee made the character. It's why 'Into the Spiderverse' is a silly and enjoyable movie, despite what the big-iq critics try to say about Miles Morales (who has spider powers and wears the spider-man suit or a variation of it) is, somehow, 'not spiderman'. \n \n\nPeople who make shitty articles then blame the consumer are like parents feeding their kids junk food and then claiming they are incapable, as full-fledged adults, to tell a child to eat vegetables; \"when all children want is candy, I can't lead them to make good decisions\" is a major cop-out,  because children are not \"too stupid\" to ever understand patience or self-control. The parents who raise children without proper self control, are the types of folks that enable bad behavior and gratification over boundaries; this creates people who are selfish.",

I also don’t like how more viewers only watch movies and shows from a surface level. \n\nPeople look at me like I am insane when I overanalyze why I love or hate a show. It is hard finding people in the real world who want to overanalyze media like I do. That is how we engage with it. That is how we relate to characters.  \n\nThe more I think about it, overanalyzing is not that. It is basic media literacy. Also, saying it is not that deep or that we shouldn’t over analyze everything disrespects the time and effort everyone put into the project. \n\nFor example, XO Kitty is seen as bad by viewers who only see it from a surface level, but on rewatches and talking about it with XO Kitty fans and analyzers, so much time, thought, effort, symbolism, foreshadowing, etc. is put into it. People just need to care enough to see that. \n\nI am always amazed at how much styling and costuming can tell a story, even contemporary clothing. But stuff like this gets missed when we only watch something at a surface level. \n\nAlso, analyzing and deconstructing is what we learned in school, especially in English classes. \n\nAlso, I feel seeing movies at a surface level is how we fall into bad propaganda. Sometimes, it is that deep.  \n\nIt’s not that deep shouldn’t be the answer to everything.",

The original movie was a dark COMEDY released in 1942, BEFORE WW2 ended, depicting \"a troupe of actors in Nazi-occupied Warsaw who use their abilities at disguise and acting to fool the occupying troops.\" (wiki). I mean - can you imagine?  Sort of insane to make fun of nazis *in that moment* especially?  But also just a GREAT movie.  (aside, I think Tarantino's nazi movie is a bit of a rip off of this without acknowledging the source material so I did not love that one so much).",

Only 1/5 of violent encounters on girls (almost always secual in nature,) ever get reported.  1% of SAs on girls will ever have a conviction of their assailants. Most victims of SA try to file a report but are literally laughed out of the police station or told that unless they have a text or emai of their assailant directly admitting it AND a video of the assault already in your possession or they wont even let you file a report of your assault. And even then they rarely do anything. I have spoken to women that have had gotten rape kits in 80s and 90s and their kits are \"still being processed.\" It is 2025. So yes. Most victims dont even get believed. Males are more likely to be SA'd (most likely violently by another man,) than he is to ever be falsely accused as such. There are so many jokes of people and children where the entire punchline is \"haha they were violently SA'd and sexually tortured.\" Especially for women. Its very much been normalized. Thats rape culture.\n\nI understand youre trying to be very disingenuous and playing stupid as well as intentionally misrepresenting everything thats been said, but im explaining it for everyone else.",

        "text": "@CalvaryProductions1 I am a real life victim and I don't find the term or concept of rape culture to be insulting. I think it's a hard hitting term that describes something that I've experienced directly, and I think having a term for it helps me feel less alone in the experience and helps me discuss it with others. \nWho says it's okay? In the US, there have been senators who have directly said rape should be legal, the president is a rapist and people still voted for him, he was in the Epstein files for goodness sake. And other English speaking countries are not really any better off. Pretending that our society is as anti-rape as society likes to pretend is just false. If our society was anti-rape, the sex crimes wouldn't have the lowest rates of conviction, at less than 4% depending on jurisdiction, and that's not including all the ones that never get reported.\nAlso the term rape culture doesn't just mean thinking rape is okay, it refers to all the cultural norms that lead to rape. Ex: getting someone drunk in an effort to \"change their mind\" after they said no while sober. Did you not watch the video? Literally everything Barney did, and the support he received for it from his friends and the audience, is a part of rape culture.",

Also, kids’ shows are an important part of practicing social skills like patience, teamwork, and how to deal with conflict. \n\nWorking as a summer teacher for young children, we would often pick their favorite show and say “Well what did Owlette say to Gecko when he was having a hard time?” Or “how did Bluey handle that?” Often, these are what children pull from and mimic for better or worse. While I think Powerpuff girls is aimed AFTER that important age group, my point is that even children’s media IS that deep and should be the LAST thing we disregard.",

        "text": "@gothgammy666 I don't think it should be controversial to say something has to be a conspiracy or propaganda to have influence on people, especially impressionable children. How I Met Your Mother isn't a conspiracy or propaganda, either - it just normalized and perpetuated toxic views on women that were socially acceptable at the time (and unfortunately still are). I don't think the argument being made here is that PPG is deliberate, conspiratorial propaganda meant to indoctrinate children into believing cops are good and people committing crimes are evil, but instead that regardless of intent, it does have the effect of teaching children that law enforcement is always in the right and should be able to achieve their goals by any means necessary. The assumption that this is true makes it easy to write a good vs evil narrative easily understood by children, and I can see the appeal of being able to rely on that on the part of the showrunners, but it does have the side effect of teaching children that cops are always good and those who have committed crimes are always deserving of violence.\n\n\"Copaganda\" in general does tend to mean media that goes out of its way to glorify and exonerate cops on purpose, but media that rides the coattails of deliberate propaganda by relying on the same worldview has a similar effect, so they are often grouped together; I think the most important thing is interrogating the assumption that the police are always justified and always have good intentions, and I think PPG was a perfectly valid example of that. This also definitely isn't the first time I've heard someone point to PPG as easily-missed copaganda - it portrays extrajudicial violence on the behalf of the government as brave, honorable, and heroic. Yes, it is *usually* (but notably, not always) after we've seen the villain doing something blatantly harmful and evil because they are a literal cartoon villain, but the protagonists don't just drive the villain off to protect the civilians they're hurting - they throw the villain in jail, explicitly on the mayor's behalf, and that imagery and framing sends a message about law enforcement that isn't necessary to the premise of 3 kindergarteners with superpowers born in a lab saving the day.",

Also we watch movies for fun. It's not the end of the world but i just chose to monitor what she sees and don't see the need to show her some of the more adult pg and pg13 movies from the past. Compared to stuff from today where its way easier to gauge what to expect from the rating. Comparing that to famous art is different. That's culture and cool af. That's why in school they show you art with nudity but that doesn't mean the teacher is going to put on showgirls for the students to watch lol. Now if the family was stuck in a cabin with one movie to watch and it was 16 candles. Then id put it on. It's not this do or die thing but it's pretty easy to show her one of the million other movies that are more suited for a child. Am i making any sense?",

He said \"The superhero dream Is essentially fascism\", which has little to do with the subject matter, but everything to do with the audience that consumes the media. So it is not the superheroes themselves that are fascist, but rather that having a large audience/fan base of adults attracted to superhero stories puts a society at risk of fascism - due to the parallels between that desire and wish for some singular being or entity that is better/stronger/smarter/wiser/etc that regular humanity would come along and solve all our problems for us while we stand by passively in the background waiting to be saved being fundamentally the same instinct that leads populations to end up supporting authoritarian fascist regimes, as the underlying premise of fascism and the way it sells itself to its society also relies on that exact sell. Superheroes themselves are Deus ex machina, anthropomorphic narrative devices. They are the modern era equivalent of the supernatural Gods of Mythology and folk entities, whose stories now reflect their existence as what we now consider vigilantes beyond the order of supposedly Enlightened egalitarian, a social innovation that didn't exist back in the era of Mythology. Neither vigilantes, like the Gods, Titans and spirits of yore are as a rule fascists.",

When she’s abducted and being forced to marry another mob boss, despite the bad shit he does, she sees who he could have been if he’d made other choices.

He's not happy because he loathes himself for not being rich and perfect and he can't emotionally connect to anyone because his pathological lying, originally developed to appease his abusive father, has put up walls between him and everyone else.

Apparently they never thought to ask how he got this way or why the author made him like this. (Hint: it's because you're not supposed to root for his classist ambitions and ideology IT IS RUINING HIS LIFE.) The book is used in courses on classism and people don't get it, not because it's hard, but because they get as far as him lying to escape his abusive dad and go \"wow he lied he's so unlikeable\".",

        "text": "@athousandandonenights11 I think that’s fair, but there’s also true merit to being more direct about how you’re supposed to interpret morally reprehensible characters in an age with poor media literacy (that has also just come off a different age of the super common trope of Morally Reprehensible Guy Saves Day, Is Awesome, Therefore Is Redeemed). \n\nThe major driver of them making it clearer was when Harvey Weinstein said he liked Bojack and that Bojack felt relatable. Already there were many that, like with Rick Sanchez, felt vindicated in seeing someone who struggled in a dark but genuine way, but ultimately caused serious harm to everyone that surrounded them with that same darkness. \n\nThey were already underlining that Bojack was a bad guy from the get go and in the finale of S3, Todd serves as a mouthpiece for a more direct version of the messaging by stating that the problem IS Bojack and that Bojack can’t keep doing bad things then feeling bad about them as if that makes it better. He has to BE better. It’s really easy to miss that messaging when it’s done in a more subtle way through the narrative, especially when Bojack is genuinely a very witty, funny, relatable character and has some of the best lines in the show. Similar to the earlier portrayal of Rick Sanchez in Rick and Morty, where he’s shown to be an objectively bad guy but is still Very Awesome and Cool. It blurs the line in the overall narrative of this shitty character that you’re presenting as a bad person, but making story choices where the bad things the character does ends up working out for the better or worse, somehow saving the day even though they’ve caused so much damage in other ways. \n\nIt’s a really fine narrative line to toe between that often tips into glorifying/romanticizing and even when the writers of BH got very blatant, they still were able to drive home that people live in shades of gray that often aren’t totally morally good or bad, but just… are. And that even if you’re the worst person in the world, it does not mean you cannot make meaningful changes for yourself, take responsibility, and heal— even if that means your life and relationships can never be what they were before. And that your actions have lasting consequences and you will have to face those consequences every day to work toward a better you.",

I felt like in the later seasons, they made him into too much of a monster when he started violently attacking women \n\nI guess it’s like, at the start it felt like it was saying “if you relate to this, that’s bad and you should improve or get help”. And in S5 it was saying “you shouldn’t relate to him. He’s a monster”. And I guess I’d have preferred it if his downfall in the final season was just over the stuff we saw him do and didn’t think critically about, as opposed to this huge hidden detail in the Sarah Lynn story that made her death directly his fault ontop of everything else\n\nI totally get them feeling responsible for shitty men using him to justify themselves ofc. But I don’t think media is fully responsible for people misinterpreting it",

Recently I've liked The Rookie but it does a good job of having relevant themes but not feeling too forced, and they at least try to be honest and current with their representation of GOOD cops.  But it's less making cops look good and more showing what a good cop SHOULD be like and they've had a lot of subplots with police brutality, profiling, corruption, etc.  I'm not sure how it would stand up to a proper analysis but it definitely tries to be more human and nuanced.  Plus it's just got a likeable cast and the scripts weave in a lot of humour.\n\nBut yeah a lot of cop shows have been and still are just very sanitised and Hollywood cliche feeling.

Some people might have missed it, but it's not unrealistic to say most got the point. It's more a testimate to the writers and actors that the audience stayed on board with it. I'm not saying there isn't a lot of \"it was a different time\" moments out there, but it is also possible to write a lovable heel.

And the mentality of giving everyone in the time period a pass because it was the culture (though it doesn't sound like you are) ignores that fact that not everyone agreed with it. Again making it seem like the oppressors opinions were more important than the ones being oppressed. \n\nWhile I can understand how children can be brainwashed into some terrible ideology that doesn't take away any violence or behavior they later force on others just because they didn't get raised in a less bigoted home either.

For example, in the 70's, shows like All in the Family, The Jeffersons, Sanford & Son, Good Times and many others all joked about race in ways that you could never get away with now. But these shows were important for opening the door to a dialogue that before then we'd never been permitted to have on TV. The fact that black characters could also be bigoted and racist (ala' George Jefferson and Fred Sanford) was, I think, an important milestone for entertainment at the time. They allowed us as an audience a way to step back and look at ourselves, and of course, much of the humor was reactionary (payback for all the years that blacks had been the butt of racist jokes and the humor), The way these shows handled themes of bigotry and racism was a necessary if somewhat bumpy bridge from the era where these things couldn't even be acknowledged at all to a time when we were obviously comfortable enough about race to joke about it. So while it's easy to cringe at the jokes now, the context of time and place is definitely important.",

Every word was selected and possibly agonized over, reviewed by a committee of other writers, signed off on by a show runner and a tv/movie studio. Camera positions, angles, filters  and lenses were selected to help to create mood and emphasize themes. Lighting was selected and adjusted. Actors were cast to be the correct delivery method of the message. Actors are trained to move with purpose- the blocking of the performance is decided in advance to coordinate all of these elements together. Did you notice that actor deliver their line and then check their nails? Did the camera linger? Is there a close up? These things are all choices and they’re somewhere in print because many people made choices. It’s 100% that deep, it is DEEPER. There are shoes selected to complete that outfit that got cropped out of the final. That makeup job was done a bit lighter today to make that character seem more soft. That camera angle was selected to make the perspective from below so that we the audience feel that person is powerful. Film and television and theater all have a language that they’re communicating in and YES we love it when the audience is engaged and picking up all of these nuances. \n\nTLDR it’s not a documentary!

No one plans an event for a day they know won't have amenable weather for said event if they can help it...\n\nSpeaking of \"other things\", the intentionality is also found in the choices we make about the the things we CAN control. We put colorful decorations in our personal and public spaces that are often themed in some way to our liking. We play music in our cars, our buildings, at different events or even just in our yards (something others hear as well). It may not be in our brains, for better and for worse, but video broadcasts are much closer to POV footage of an event than it isn't. And that's before we even get to more direct forms of communication like conversation.\n\nMuch like creatives make creative decisions about the sensory simulations we collectively call art, we all are making creative decisions about the world around us - the results of those decisions just happen to be more diegetic than the ones the artists are making....",

        "text": "@dolphinswilltakeover No, I think I understand and agree with their point. I think you're dismissing their point with a long-winded \"it's not that deep\" expression about real life. There absolutely are conscious decisions being made in real life about things that might signal something or other about the environment or society, that you can observe and notice.\n\nHave you ever asked yourself why we put certain decorations during certain events, but not others? For a very simple, clear cut example, why do we put primarily western/christian based imagery out and about during Christmas, but we tend to not have eastern style decorations? That signals something about our society - it's not inherently good or bad, but it's something that can be observed and analyzed. Why is a pedestrian crossing on the road at a particular position, and not another position? Even individuals, the way they dress, or walk, or talk, they also signal things about themselves. There is a certain level of intentionality in their \"unintentionality\", so to speak. One obviously can't use this to stereotype and pigeonhole whole groups of people into behaviours or societal roles, but it can still be observed, and this can lead to better understanding of each other if used correctly.\n\nNow obviously people in all times have tended to seek to subvert any such observations, so the value of commentary based on observations can be fleeting. But that's getting into deeper weeds than I've already gotten into to explain my own understanding.",

        "text": "@YouAreStillNotablaze yeah absolutely, that’s the point i was agreeing with, which is Olayemi’s argument in the video. Barney was portrayed as a charming funny guy. his constant predatory behavior was not actually criticized within the show. or much outside of the show, at that time. that’s why we look back and cringe. it was way more common at the time, both in media and in real life, to normalize and glorify predatory behavior. but looking back we can and should criticize it. you can also still like his character or the show without that reflecting directly on your own values.\n\nthat’s the whole point of the term Olayemi has coined here “virtue mirorring.” generally we shouldn’t look to shows and movies to portray back to us our exact values and how we want the world to work, those things have their value and place (like with abolition and imagining a better world, that’s super important). but like we gotta operate on multiple levels and engage in media analysis. under current power structures, a lot of media is still gonna be bad and try to normalize bad things, like the pervasive copaganda landscape we have now (and have had for a while). you can enjoy law and order svu while also recognizing it for what it is, copaganda and straight up lies. it doesn’t make us bad for liking shows that uncritically portray bad norms, it’s when we agree with and just absorb those things and make excuses for them, without taking a step back and thinking about what’s happening and how we have agency, that’s when it’s a big issue. sorry i’m a rambler, so this is probably incoherent but i hope my reply helped a bit.",

If people are getting some enjoyment from otherwise irredeemably evil characters, that's fine. This video tries to say more than that though. At some points she compartmentalizes the desire to enjoy bad things by saying \"it's good actually because it can teach us something about ourselves and about how we interact with society.\" Okay, then what (aside from just generally liking it) does it teach you about yourself that you like hot guys covered in blood? What does excusing a rapist because he's charming mean about someone's psyche?\n\nThat's the full context of my question. \"What is the genuine benefit of liking characters like this (outside of just  vaguely enjoying it)?\" What is the deeper psychology there?

In growing and reading other series, I just found myself with less of an interest in it and the way it actually engages with its world and world building. It ultimately became clear to me that I like the universe *around* HP (fandom/fanfiction/analysis videos/A very Potter Musical) more than I cared for the original books.\nThe response to the series You stressed me the math out.

Media had to adhere to all the same strict rules we did, and we were expected to turn it off and in some cases, destroy our \"immoral\" CDs and DVDs for things as minor as swearing (I shit you not; I heard so many stories of teenagers being held up as \"truly changed by the Atonement\" when they would take baseball bats to their rap albums 🙄 no racial implications there either 😑). So it's bothered me for quite some time how people are engaging with media out here in the secular world in the same regressive ways I was taught to in the high-demand religion I left. I didn't know how to articulate it for so long, so thank you for how you've done it!",

I get enough nihilism in reality; I want there to be some element of causality and follow-through in my fiction",

It was the proliferation of cable TV, and now with streaming sites where you can curate your own TV channel... When you only had less than 10 channels on TV, a half dozen radio stations to choose from, etc. you dont have the agency available today. A bit like how airlines used to put a movie on a projector for everyone to watch... And now we get to judge the people around you on their choice of TV show on their personal entertainment screen. \n\nI truly enjoyed every second of the video. Thsnk you so much for the work and perspective you put into this. A lot of these ideas have been bouncing around my head for a LONG time. Like when the sunburned, goatee, wrap around sunglasses internet got real unglued about their sports being invaded by discussions or statements they didnt like (about paw patrol). \n\nAnd regarding JK Growling, the funny circle harry potter fanfic has gone through is hilarious. Its absolutely breaking copywrite law, or does when its monetized. Idk, not a lawyer. But either way, the best way to continue enjoying old media from trash people... Go find (or write) the most disrespectful, biting, blatantly extra fanfic, and go support that writer instead. Sometimes we gotta engage with stuff that makes us sad... So when youre on the nerflix or youtube homepage... intentionally, and knowingly queue up stuff that makes you feel good, or hopeful idk.",

I feel like far too many people don't do enough to actually find and support good media and just complain about the mainstream media ('hiphop is dead', or 'AAA games suck' or 'TV is trash' etc) putting forth no effort to find all the amazing indie artists doing amazing stuff.",

The hosts spent the episode talking about how much of a problematic creep Rick Springfield must be to write this song. The ideas that song lyrics might not be autobiographical or that an artist might write something unflattering not as a boast but as an honest portrayal of human failings that the writer dislikes seemed to be beyond these people.",

        "text": "just wait till they stumble into Stephen Colbert back in the day. \"characters\" and my generations inability to parse them is crazy. Cause my generation had people like Roy Purdy. but at the same time, we had supreme patti, boonk gang. These guys were hard to tell as characters, cuase they really did that too their eyes. It wasn't jack ass, they didn't have friction layers. Thats what broke my generation. I think my generation has a hard time parsing lyrical perspective because a lot of artists due write from themselves now, but a lot of media we consume cut out bureaucracy. Like In hiphop its lame to be lil tecca in some circles. rap was wack if you werent doing what you said you were to a degree.\n\n I think my generation is this weird bell curve of authenticity core. where even in the era of AI NOW. I am an 02 baby. I think my generations main pull to youtube content was that was like Amateur ornp compared to big budget ornp.  Its like people who protest and scream that the local manure indie band at that one coffee shop is just better than mac demarco.\n\n\nTo the point where a lot of us would be the modern version of getting scared at the train in the cinema. they really thought that train was coming at them. Even though it was in black and white. \n\nI think theres also a lot of people in my generation that say chill way to much. Lots of women in my industry of fitness are \"negative energy deniers\" who constantly scream about Push away the negative energies, and as a reddit atheist i have to bit my tongue.  They use words like kharma but dont realize that incapsulates negative energies. Were supposed to have bad and good, and achieve a neutral balance. LILbignanc is someone who is really annoying \"positive energy this, negative energy yuck, gratitude! you never should have a bad day cause you have clean water why would you be mad at the guy who rear ended you\" I think that applies to media. Getting immersed, crying to characters and story, \"CARING IS CRINGE\" is truly a part of my generation. I think that I have that. thers a fine line between caring to much and aura farming that is the goldilocks zone. \n\n\"The generation of Lofi hiphop can't engage with  media. Shocking. \"\n\nA lot of emotional baby proofing as an unintended side of effect of mental health awareness. \n\nLike if you go look at lilbignac videos. Youll get what i mean. She is the exact opposite of that depressed emo kid during lil peep era. I was always so fuc king sad, i wanted to die, smoked cigarettes at 15 cause it was the coolest form of self harm. And depresso Warped tour emo kids like myself were just constantly spamming the sad button. But because sad bad, happy good, no one calls out LILbignanc and her insane overdose on positivity.\n\nYou cant analyze media without negativity, and negative \"Ernergies\". A lot of people think sex scenes are redundant. We're oversexualized. We're to violent gory. At some point when you do all of these things we become gray sirloins, too literal, unemotional,  and pragmatic. theres this perverse nature to the way lilbignanc and all these energy mommies as ill coin them act. They pretend to have this immoveable shield or they actually do maybe. But i just know. She isn't really like that. Its copium, its no different than the alpha male shit. its just marketed with a pink veneer. I genuinely think, that has a link to why we put media in a weird place. Its why we cant parse characters. Cause think of alpha male bros, that girly pop energy based version teaches them they same level of distrusting the masses. Alpha male bros cant engage with whiplash the same way a sane person does, I doubt lilbignanc and crystal energy mommies could sit through the whole movie. They only read SELF HELP Books. They dont read horror, they don't read thrillers, they dont read anything that puts them in a bad state of mind. On purpose. Self help books are fine i guess. But they dont teach you media. They teach you how to be annoying. \n\nAnd it suprising. Cause frank ocean is gay as hell man. And he uses female pronouns a lot in his songs. I dont want to believe theres that  many Trents, Chads, Thads, or, Bethanies, Hollys, and Charlies, that just dont fucking get hes not straight. They probably don't. that sucks to realize.",

Music itself is typically written in a first person or to represent the ideas of the writer..\n\nSo in my head, I’m not gonna listen to Chris Brown Trey Songz, R. Kelly, Marilyn Manson , Kid Rock, B blood on the dance floor… none of those because I don’t want their creep energy in my soul lol but also I don’t really find that “separation of art from artist” concept being anything but away for us to ingratiate those idea ideas in a society because as it was put in the video people don’t critically analyze anything they just consume and absorb.",

Curtis Mayfield had a huge hit \"Gypsy Woman\" about falling in love with a Romani woman that he wrote when he was twelve years old after watching a movie with such a woman in it.

I can absolutely see a Joe Jackson keeping his son to live in Gary Indiana in the 70s and 80s away from that culture or having people who live on the other side of the tracks” giving Michael Jackson this exact speech and then him using his musical to create a piece that resonates with cultures and generations in the future. And the Curtis mayfield point kinda proves what *I’m* saying more than it does for you… he saw a beautiful Romani woman in a film and then wrote a song about falling in love with her at 12… kinda checks out. \n\n.\n\nBut even if we apply that “songs aren’t autobiographical” you have an R. Kelly writing a song saying “seems like you’re ready”  and “age aint nothing but a number” knowing that while I, as an adult, can put it in an adult context the man who wrote it absolutely was not speaking to adult when he wrote that song as well as music like that putting money into the pockets of the person to fund/condone further acts.",

It's being aware that media impacts the world around us and therefore knowing how to engage with it and when to know whether it's impacting or whether you're taking it personally in a way that specific to you that may not actually affect other people. \nPart of not falling into what did she call it moral mirroring is being able to accept and understand that these characters are fictional and that it is okay to like them even if there are bad messages with them and part of that also includes not being overly attached to them as taking it personally whenever anything bad is said about them or acting like they are real or specific reflections of you",

There were so many fellow nerds insisting that I should hate that show because it made fun of nerd culture and because the nerd boys were just as misogynistic as any other guys while being depicted as \"nice.\" But I felt like that was part of what the audience was being asked to recognize about them. And they did have Penny regularly calling them out on their misogyny and their intellectual elitism. Plus, we can discuss for days how poorly the writers treated the loan character of color.",

    "text": "Someone linked to this on Bluesky and I just want to give this video, and particularly this distinction of virtue mirroring from ethical consumption, etc., an utterly unironic chef's kiss. You put into words something that has been driving me crazy as I've been forced into making policy decisions for a staff of like 35 people around what kind of stuff not to cover on my music review 'blog,' and why there's a distinction between electing not to give something publicity and liking it, for example. This is also the root of guilty pleasures discourse. \"Like, I know this makes me bad for liking it, but...\" Saying that is virtue signaling, but the fact that it's even occurring to a person is already suggesting that a lot of work has been going on internally to reconcile that this stupid reality TV show or liking the NFL despite concussions or loving reggaeton despite bad gender politics is \"problematic\" and therefore needs to be explained away in order to match someone's sense of self. Analysis kind of requires us to set that aside and to differentiate between these different ways that we relate to media.\n\nI want to go back and read some sociology of identity to see how and if they're dealing with this. But  I literally just had to stop in and comment, because what a really useful and meaningful distinction. Thanks!",

        "text": "@sabrinabrainiacbri Having read plenty of video game analysis in academics, there's a problem with students trying to employ one frame and then just reach for the depths. It's a faulty way to go about it. Elden Ring is the same. It doesn't work employing a single frame. You'd need one for the world, one for the character and one for the player who plays the character. All frames develop throughout the game, but not in unison. I recommend listening to what Noah Caldwell-Gervais has to say on the topic, he tends to give an impressionistic take on any game he plays, I don't recall what he said about Elden Ring but his output is consistently valuable. Be aware that academic analysis has historically had a problem assuming full immersion, which isn't a valid assumption.",
