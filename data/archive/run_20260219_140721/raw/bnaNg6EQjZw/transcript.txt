okay so the first question that I have to ask you is what's it feel like to be an [Music] icon oh my God am my icon you know people listen here's the thing Olay the people try to really really do everything their power to Discount my presence like you know and I think that people think that to be an icon or to be something that's uh a role model or somebody that you look up they you have to be cookie cutter girl ain't [ __ ] cookie cutter about me I'm a Libra of course my scales is tipped over to the side you may get the dark side of me I'm a Libra of course I'm going to be loud LV and color and fabulous while I'm doing it I am a labra of course [ __ ] I'm going to act like girl that I love you cuz I do and when you cross me I'm going to run you over with a Mac Truck and so I think that people get the this this thing and be like well why would somebody say that she's an icon you and then when you really look around and you look at things that you've accomplished or not just accomplished or or the contributions or how your voice moves the needle in certain things you be like yeah I might be that but I'm but I'm never conceited with it yes and and here's how I don't show excuse me here's how I show that I'm not conceited I get in the comments I'm gonna be in the comment section oh I get the what you said [ __ ] and I need listen well today please lean into all the Cockiness cuz I want to give you your flowers that is what I have you here today I want you to have all your flowers I want to learn about your journey because honestly I I have to call you an icon because you wear too many hats you wear way too many hats for me to call you any one thing so I guess what I really want to hear from you is how do you define yourself in all that you do uh Entertainer I'm an Entertainer because listen here's the thing you put a microphone in my hand that's like it's like you know how Miss Pacman or Mr Pac-Man eats a eat a power pellet that's like a power pellet to me you know you put a microphone in my hand and just throw me out to a crowd it's over I don't give a damn who I'm in the room I could I feel like and maybe this is a reach it could be a reach but I've got my arms up I feel like that I am a Patty Lael of our community you know how Patty Lael you give Patty Lael a mic everybody who's singing is it that's it it it doesn't matter who's singing Patty gets that mic is I want you to show me she go over everybody and and she doesn't mean to do it she doesn't mean to do it this just her raw ability to be you know who she is and I think that me being an Entertainer it doesn't put me in one space like I'm not just an actress I'm not just a comedian I'm not just a talk show host I'm not just an an activist I'm not just a producer or content creator I'm an Entertainer cuz I can I can slide anyone I need to do what I do what I can slide in any of those areas and I'm because my energy is built for that and so it's crazy because someone asked me the other day um like I've been hosting Fox soul for the past a week or or last month or two weeks whatever and they asked me m would you take the fox Soul job and I said um I don't know I I cuz that means I have to sit down and do one thing yeah yeah and you do so many things I don't want to do one thing ol I don't want to do that that's actually the thing that I love two different things I love that you jumped you came in you jumped right into it all these questions that I have for you I have numbered we can get into them right now because a thing I've heard you say before I've heard you talk a lot about the importance of building your own brand and what and you talking about the fact that you wear so many hats and you are this Patty Lael in the community I think that's what makes you jump out to me is not only are you like one of the most visible black Trans women period of but not it's beyond that you are like a pop icon we know you in the black community we know you in the LGBT community trans Community everybody and I'm like and you've managed to do that without in any way conforming like I what I never get from you is any respectability politics I always see every time I watch an interview with you tent toes down on everything who I am this and I'm like everyone who even groups you would expect to usually uh push back and have a have embraced you how do how do you think you got that out what do you think has made people connect to you so much um well I think what makes people connect to me is that I don't think that I'm too good and here's the thing you know how we expect Our Stars our celebrities we expect our people to be unreachable un un Untouchable unattainable we expect these like oh oh oh they're too busy they're too booked and busy to say something they too they're too booked and busy to be involved they're too yeah I'm booked and busy but I can get down here in this in this with y'all yes I can make time for this you feel me you know I I want to use an example but I want to say this but I'm not this person like okay cuz we G to end up I know somewhere in the conversation we gonna end up talking about her but Beyonce like yes right now Beyonce outside she is not have you not been looking oh no I'm looking I'm I'm I'm Hive she's outside Beyonce outside side she's at the events she's showing up honey she's taking selfies show is she outside you feel me and so I think that she works hard and she gives to to to her fans and she gives to her people but I think that she's heard people say we lost connection to You Beyonce because there were times that you used to be you used to do the interviews you used to do this you do this and we we like we lost connection to you and I think that she's listening like okay I don't I done got all my Plex all my this this it I'm let me get in here with my people yeah with me I'm not on the beon state level I'm outside but I'm also outside you know and still not as tangible but I'm still outside you know I may pop up to the [ __ ] spot over there where they got the the where they selling gizzards and everybody else outside of the gizard yeah I a pull in a black truck and get out with my security and get me some gizzards and be like hey y'all let me take pictures or whatever and get in my truck and hit it you you know what I'm saying but I'm I'm not going to be like well go in there let me Keith Le y'all and let me sit my family in there and come out with a plate no I'm going inside too you know so I just think that that's what makes people feel connected to me it's like [ __ ] when I get famous or popular or whatever and you know I want to be in a space where I don't lose the the connection or or lose touch with with people that that love me and and and and and help me get there I usually cuz somebody said the other oh I'm just rambling girl girl girl you get this this is this is your interview you talk we want to hear you um usually people give well you know I I I'm not going to do that or I can't do that's not me and I don't even like to even deal with people like that like like like I was just at the emys right so I went to the EMS got there t-shir Campbell to rajie P Hing like taji saw me she scream she's oh my God oh God oh my God gtia c t ass you know it's like that like they feel connected to me because I speak to to everybody I speak to women I speak to men [ __ ] I speak to straight men I speak to you know gay men I speak to women because it's just like I don't feel like that I'm one thing I don't feel I don't feel that that I'm a woman I don't feel like that I'm a man I don't feel like that I'm like one thing I feel like that I'm connected to to all all aspects of living and I think that that's what keeps people that that make people love me I could pull up on a gang on a gang of [ __ ] and get out on the what a we that n what a we you know and nobody's over there concerned about me trying to make a move on them or try to try to question of sexuality or try because that's not what I'm there for I'm there for the weed what we there you know what I'm saying so you have to you have to remain you can't get so big as a star that you too good to have a conversation Valentine's Day I don't I didn't have a Valentine's so I went live and I opened the floor up on my live on my YouTube channel on all my platforms and I send a link out and I let all my people that love me come on it was like it was a it was a few 25 30 people that was able to come on we were just talking like I just spent I spent majority of my Valentine's night giving love to my people they was giving love to me we was talking about stuff we just just having just engaging with who's who's loved me from the beginning not these new found people that found me because of because of Beyonce Co not people who found me because they love me from RuPaul Drag Race or not people who found me because you know I don't been on this show or that show or I but people who the core audience of girl I've been rocking with you since new weave 22 inches yes that's important to stay solid like that Olay yeah H is there a tradeoff because I know I think what happens sometimes is people is people are connected to Their audience especially as they're getting bigger and bigger and bigger but what often happens is I think on the internet there's so much hate you get so much hate when the the more accessible try to be how how do you think uh what's the back end of that how do you deal with that well the back end of that is you know people are really and I'm learning this the more and more I go people are internally struggling with your presence they're internally struggling with your presence it don't really have anything to do with you but it's your presence it's it's it's you remaining in the trenches and still being a star cuz it's just like well I'm doing the same [ __ ] thing why why this ain't happening for me and it's not happening for you or or it's because your intentions are not pure I have pure intentions when I jump out in the street my intentions are pure I want the coin and if I'm not doing it for the coin I'm doing it for the Cs you you understand what I'm saying some of those people just want to be I want to be a star I am a star I don't want to be [ __ ] I am that yeah I am a star and not only that I'm one of the people so I could be a star and one of the people at the same [ __ ] time so the hate that usually builds up on me it does come from a place of like H how are you doing it or why is it happening for you and not me right and if somebody watches this that's a hater of mine [ __ ] that's the problem with you it's it's it's it's why is it happening for her or him or whatever however they want to misgender me whatever it is I don't care how is it happening for this person and I feel like that I'm more talented than this person I'm more funnier than this person I'm more engaging with this person sweetheart my thing to you is it takes time this didn't just happen to me overnight there are people that are just catching up to me [ __ ] I've been a star there are people that are just now coming in and like oh okay with and then do your research I was here way before a whole bunch of stuff like I had followers and stuff girl um social media's done shut down YouTube's done been lost deleted accounts like girl this you ain't new to this you to this this ain't new to this girl yeah I ain't new to this how long have you been doing this I that's what I want to hear at the beginning because I know I listen again you wear so many hats every time people interview they can only tackle one angle of your ride so I want to hear the beginning you know sister I've been in this for a very long time I remember I got started as as you know I'm transparent I got started in the adult entertainment industry and so people don't really realize that men straight men straight identified men were already on to me before anybody look at that straight ien let's let's be clear here right transp porn gets about a billion Impressions or a billion views or something like that somewhere in that number I don't want to be misquote I know somewhere in the a billion yeah no it does it actually and it's incredibly popular it's like most popular in the red states too so I've always been some sort of a star so I've been under I've been on DVDs I've been on magazines I've been on on on I've been on the interweb the dark web and I was on the dark web and I didn't I wasn't just on there as a blurb I commanded it so I've been in households for a very long time very long and the gag for all of the people was that I crossed over yeah and now you you you lived a lot of your life seeing me naked now [ __ ] you see me clothed and you don't get you don't understand and you hear you and more importantly they got you got to hear you you got to listen to you it's that everybody is listening to you're a voice that people respond to yeah and so I think when people try to use my past and say oh well you were just a porn star no I was a sex educator honey I taught a lot of you [ __ ] [ __ ] how to suck dick and eat coochie I taught a lot ofing I taught a lot of y'all how to please a man in the bedroom I talk a lot listen a lot of y'all men was coming to me for therapy and a lot of y'all had to and that goes for the trans girls too like when the when the girls I heard a [ __ ] earlier today say it's you old [ __ ] that get on my nerve and I'm like [ __ ] you better get old you better hope a old [ __ ] talking in your ear you young stupid at you young dumb full of C broad you better hope a old [ __ ] is somewhere teaching you A Life Lesson cuz you running through this [ __ ] blind you better let a old [ __ ] teach you something and so you know I embrace everything I embrace The Good the Bad and the Ugly and there are times o that I get exhausted with um the narratives that I spent about me and and I'm really coming to a a a point I'm not there yet I am not there yet but I am really arriving to a point where I'm like man [ __ ] y'all [ __ ] [ __ ] I I'm I'm really almost there I'm not all the way there because there's there are times that I get in and I want to check a [ __ ] for saying some [ __ ] like I want to check you for you know especially like spinning a narrative like that I know that that is untrue and a lie and false narrative travels faster than the truth cuz people want it there's people could hear the truth in the said ah it's not spicy enough I'm I'm G stick with the I'm G stick with the tea and I think it's a lot because people are content now I realize people see real people as storyline they don't see they see it as content over everything rather than they are creating real story lines about real people um you know what's interesting to me about what you just said um when I asked you about the theing this hate and negativity what I loved is you to the people outside of community immediately people who are who are jealous or or have a problem with just who you are what they see you as Xyz the immediate dismissal of that's their internal struggle and what I saw you spend more time on was it was negativity you feel is coming from from your own Community a community where you don't you don't expect that and I think I think that was um really interesting because it really L me know how much space shouldn't even be given to that kind of negativity is going to come and go with it and if there's anything to even wrestle with internally is what you hear from your own peers or or people who look like you and you don't expect that from is that that's what makes that more difficult imagining it does it makes you and it makes you angry because it's just like [ __ ] with with you with with all your chisling away at me sweetheart you really want to be something like me maybe not ex you may not want to look like me or be shaped like me whatever but you do want to be something like me and and what's going on with me now it it this is the building block to what what makes this what's going to happen to you because you're going to you if you moved me out of the seat and occupied my space there's somebody next to me I mean there's somebody out there that's going to do to you what you were doing to me absolutely they're going to try to pick apart everything that you find out everything because the struggle is your position it's your position and them wanting it right and and you know what you know what I think even worse than that people have this tendency to think they think that they can push you out the space right like they think they contend with a world where okay there'll be other people trying to push me out but I think the even scarier reality is they can't push you out the space like people can commiserate hate around you but they never realize that never turns into fandom for them it don't give them de seat even if they could knock you off the seat it it doesn't give it to them sister one of my good friends talked to me today and my good friend said let me tell you something he said Madison [ __ ] engage just a little bit and then leave he said because they'll never they'll never remember that person after they shook the they'll remember what's going on in that moment but you'll be the unforgettable thing like you arguing with them back and forward or this and the other read a ho and go about your business because they will never remember let me give you an example somebody trying to expose you or expose me they'll be there for the tea yes and they will absorb that tea but that person that poured it it'll be they'll either they'll be forgotten for one or they'll only be known as that yes that's it they'll only be known as girl that's that girl that P such and such tea we going never know what type of job they got we don't know what type of star they are we don't know it's just that girl they pull the tea girl and then there there are people who are private people that just like I don't [ __ ] with people like that bang that very that I don't listen and you got to watch people that do that from the from your circle too like was they could do that and you can feel HT cuz in the moment it don't feel good it don't cuz it's happened to me a few times so in in the moment it does not feel good but then you start looking around like well where they at like even you start thinking like damn they were so loud last year or two years ago or what what they I don't even see them thriving right but I know they see me I know every time they turn around they see me so listen you just got to hush I mean you give your little bit and then you go on because they eventually will phase out yeah that's something I've realized that often it took me a long time on the internet now to realize it like deep deep a long time I feel like it took me 100,000 followers before I finally started figuring out that often times the people saying the most negativity about me or whatever when I respond to it I give it more eyes than it ever was going to have like I give it way more life than it ever it ever had if I didn't even acknowledge it right because they're using you they're hoping what I realized is when people are like commod azing hate on you they're hoping they need your engagement they need your reaction they need you to be upset to really be able to try to do anything with it at all and and people will monetize your name they will monetize off your outrage or um girl just like what's going on right now girl girl just like what's going on right now oay I'm looking in the you know because uh one of my uh videographers made a post about uh and they asked what was one of your contributions to black history and he said I'm the creator of the sequence that they use on Beyonce's uh um uh Renaissance for Cole's life okay and then they were all people were all in the comment section like what are you receiving cuz everybody knows I'm receiving royalties everybody knows that I'm credited as a writer like so they're asking him and it's just like okay here we go like here we go because now it's like yeah and I love him I didn't I just I didn't like the responses that he was giving in the thing like oh if I would handle my business better no it it doesn't have anything to do with you handling your business better sweetheart because you were paid for the service that you provided and you in the way that you made that statement people people were taking that you wrote what I said right you didn't you see see see see you have to be clear in what you say because people who feel some type of way about me are trying to find ways to be like want to run with it they want to run with it especially with my name being attached to Beyonce so it's just like now it's just like oh well she really didn't say that somebody wrote that for her no ain't nobody wrote [ __ ] that came off my Dome ain't nobody wrote a [ __ ] thing for T right okay and if you say you did you are a [ __ ] lie cuz you didn't and you did edit the video yes we did do it you edited a hourong video we did and you condensed it down to 24 minutes and Beyonce watched that video and picked out pieces that she wanted for the song Coy but I said it and I hired you to do a job you did a job you were paid and you're loved but not and I don't want you to have these people in their brain cuz this is what they ready to do like you didn't pay me to discredit you hype to discredit you and try to find where you want to especially let something be on Twitter it don't take a a second before the thesis is being written on how you actually unethical you don't stand for what you stand for yada yada y I didn't really do it you like no you need to clear this up if you ain't clearing it up I'm offici to clear this up right yes let's be clear about what we did yes you did film the video in my home in my studio with my equipment and my lights and my camera yes you did put the footage on your computer and you did edit it but you did not say it I could have picked up my phone blindfolded and told a [ __ ] ho [ __ ] I'm black like that [ __ ] I'm darkg Brown [ __ ] dog skin light skin B [ __ ] I'm black I like potato chips [ __ ] Brown [ __ ] I like [ __ ] hot dogs when they burnt on the side [ __ ] that came from the TX can't nobody write that that was all raw TS and so right that's why it spoke to be us cuz it wasn't scripted it was me off of my off of my Dome yes you cut out yes he cut out all the rest of the stuff that we film yes it in it started on the green screen yes he put a background in the back yeah but Beyonce didn't use the video she used the vocals from the video which were mine that were said by me that were thought from me so we not discrediting the place that you did when you C to edited that video and she found it she saw it and she used me from the video what what it sound like to the people is you made that right I I think you're teaching me something really valuable here because I've been trying to figure out myself like there are going to be people people you work with especially on on your creative projects on the content that you create and you respect them and you appreciate them and you love them and but and you but it's also this is what you do this is what you create this is a business and there is there has to be you protect what is yours and you know set these boundaries in your names and it can be very hard trying to navigate how do do you make sure you are you know uh protecting what yours speaking up for you making sure people don't play on your name and also making sure that these people still feel appreciated and not put down and not create a um an issue so I think that was really really nice that you just demonstrated but but I'm explaining like and I'm I'm not leaving him out of the equation of what he did I'm just be we're we're being clear about because we didn't that video wasn't shot and edited specific spefically for Beyonce that video was shot and edited and done because I was angry about what was going on in the world when George Floyd was murder that video was shot and edited because I was angry what was going on in the world when Ayana Dior was in the bathroom being oh excuse me in that gas station being beat up by all of those black people in the gas station that's where that came from nobody that didn't come from somebody writing it out and telling me and directing me to say this that came from raw iner me being angry and what we're not going to do is leave the public or or we're not going to you you know cuz people try to take fragments and pieces of something to make something out of nothing and right yes he was basking in his moment cuz he should feel good that he edited that video and that he you know that he he shot and edit that video and Beyonce use that use my voice from the video that he shot and edited but we got to be clear in what is delivered to the people because then you start thinking like people people were thinking like well she did she pay you for that like why you not getting royalties for for it and she is why you don't have a Grammy for the things and she does why are you n I clear it up right let's let's clear it up speaking of um now that now that we on it because I think that is also you have a Grammy right like back to the you wear so many hat come on let's be let's be let be clear I still haven't got my paper yet because we just are finishing up with the paperwork for it like it like when the album dropped and so while they over here fussing about who don't get rights and who don't get royalty who don't get this and the other we're just now that was a project that Beyonce was working on for a while that in private in secrecy I didn't nobody knew this no one knew this and once the thing Dro we all were like oh oh [ __ ] and then our lawyers were communicating with you know like okay well there's a project coming I didn't know it was be I tell the story all the time I didn't know it was Parkwood I didn't know and so once I found out this is when you get your lawyers involved at the ninth hour yeah so we got we had to go back do our paperwork right whatever our paperwork is right now our stuff is fixed we're good now and so this is why I'm eligible to receive my grammy because the album won a Grammy and I am an accredited writer on cozy hey which is my favorite track on the album I love it I love it too but I I'm not gonna I love cozy on that but I love America has a problem valid valid a banger certified Banger there really no skips on Renaissance I Renaissance is truly my favorite Beyonce project and that's really hard that's really hard to do cuz Lord knows I love the others but Renaissance I love hold up you don't love me like I slow down I love I love all of the projects that that BC has worked on but it's just something feels so different about Renaissance even the country act and even act two that's coming with the country is just there's something different about it and I think what what you and I oay both are feeling the difference is she's reclaiming all things black yeah that was created by black that's why I feel so good that my voice is there I'm black like that because that means so much significance in that in that whole Renaissance thing because it's just like house music is black It Started Black queer is house and disco and dance that's black queer inspired and created country is black created black folks is the first cowboys hey hey tell them people know country music is it's black so I think what she's doing and if we get if we go through this project and we get to act three and it's rock and roll I just know it is oh I just know it's rock and roll I already have it in my I am convinced Color Me convinced that it's rock I'm waiting for her hair to go black I just know that it's coming that just shows that her connection to her blackness in totality like I'm I'm black that's why cozy means so much to me I'm black like that like all that all that that's black I'm black like that and I'm not going to let nobody come through and take my moment for standing on my blackness in a time I was angry about black I'm not going to let nobody come through and be like Oh somebody wrote that for you n we we we clearing this up now that came from here in my heart that came from my heart we we listen I think that's important it really it really reminds me of and it's not an understated part of the work that you do but the work that you do as an activist but not just as an activist just as being as visible and taking up as much space as you do as a black Trans woman because there's just so much eraser and there's so much people are always talking about the trans community and the LGBT community is divorced from the black community which is ridiculous in so many respects it's historically inaccurate it's life inaccurate it just is unreal and so I think that is what I so appre appreciate so much about not even just your activism but it's how much space you take up like you take up so much space and you're so Unapologetic and I love feeling like when I watch you on interviews like you burst through the doors like when I see you on Breakfast Club I see you in these places and you look and you see what is normally audiences that are just so hateful or so um unwilling you know unwilling to even listen to what's being presented you know be forced to really have to contend with you and I think that's amazing so how' you get to that to be able to to be that kind of voice and activist in order for you to try to convin not convince but in order for you to convey something to someone you also have to listen to what people are saying you have to listen so that you can hear what what people are thinking makes them different you have to be able to listen like well this doesn't affect me because I'm Black and I'm straight this doesn't affect me because I'm Black and I'm a woman this doesn't affect me because I'm Black and I'm a man and then I come through and be like all right well let me give you examples of how all of it affects me and I'm black and trans and I have had a black man experience I have had a black woman experience I have had a black straight experience so let's talk about it let's talk about the experiences that then once we lay all of our experiences down youve really realized how we are we are Six Degrees of Separation each other girl yeah yeah we are Arms Reach from each other so we're not experiencing something at different times we're experiencing Blackness all at the same time girl yeah and that's the thing right I feel um I want I I always imagine I have a lot of black Trans friends and I've also spoken to a lot of um black Trans highly visible people and they're always doing a lot of listening and they always have that understanding and there's so much grace that I feel like the community offers to everybody else because there is this recognition they understand trans people understand better than everybody like you said they have so many experiences they understand where people is coming from I think the issue is do you have do you feel listened to do you feel like the black Trans Community is listened to I feel like they listen to me yeah because I don't use a lot of Academia when I'm talking about it cuz I'm talking to people that's that don't hold a lot of acad you understand what I'm saying so I mean I I feel like they listen to me or they or they get or they get an opportunity to open their minds up to thinking like you know what [ __ ] M you make a valid point and then people when I'm on my platform oay and I'm talking and I'm talking about something and this lets me know what how closed-minded some people are I could be talking about something that's happening in the world and what I'll do is is I'll go back with what's going on in the world and I'll bring it back to what has happened to me MH because if I can give you an an example of this happening to me or telling you how I experienced this then you can think of it from a place of damn that person went through that or if I can let give you an example and then open up the dialogue and say well tell me your experience you know for ex example you are a biological woman am I correct yes I don't want to use the term CIS because I know that it upsets a lot of people I know a lot of people get so I I I stick to the regular school I know there might be some trans people that that may be like you know but it's okay trans people we all right so biological woman I'm a trans woman right you and I will never have the same lived experiences because I don't have a vagina and I don't have a uterus so your lived experience and my lived experiences will be different especially when it comes down to the natural state of being a female we will never have that lived experience you and I may have some shared experiences especially with dealing with men yeah dating men dating you know what I'm saying dating your dating a race of men dating black men whatever you and I will have a shared those are shared experiences because we can girl did he tell you girl yes or girl you know now when you start saying but girl my period was on that night I'm like hey I got to check out of that because I don't know that's not my that's not my lived experience but my shared experience is girl that niggaer ain't [ __ ] yeah girl you know why he ain't [ __ ] girl he was that was a good man he did yeah girl let me tell you what you know these are these are shared women's experiences and I think that when I break stuff down to to women on a on a spectrum like that they they start to understand like oh [ __ ] or like oh let me really think about that like like I'm sitting down talking to my home girl about man problems that she got even though she wasn't born female we haven't I'm talking to her it's like girl y'all go through that too like girl yes that's called shared experience it's called shared experience now when we start talking about how it is to carry a child or how it is to to ministrate I got to cut the line right there and said listen I only seen that from my mama my mama is the only woman that I knew that uh that I've known that has I've seen her go through cramps and cuz you know that's she that's the woman that's in close proximity to me so you know yeah that's her lived experience that you and her have together y'all can talk about that that's that's when I leave the conversation but when you lay this stuff on the line to people and say and and and and make them see it in an area that's outside of black and white that's in all colors it makes them say okay I understand yeah do you do you think we're doing a disservice in our advocacy or just in the way that we communicate um and getting through the People by using like academic language or being so specific or nitpicky about that cuz it makes me think of recently when um Mo'Nique gave you your flowers on Shannon sharp show which I loved to see that happen and I know there were some trans people who uh maybe this Monique sentiment went by because they were hurt by the language the terminology a transgender um and you and you rebut that how do how do you feel about that do you think we are being too sensitive or overly nitpicky or academic about our language I do at times I'm not going to tell you a lie I do because there are some people who have who we we're we're we're in a world where people are still learning even the people in our own Community are still learning and you can't kick out the people that are in your community you can't kick out the older trans or the older lesbians or the older gay men you can't kick you can't kick those people out like what is the reason you're trying to kick kick us out like we're all a part of the community you have to give people time you have to give people time enough to learn and absorb when I'm not talking about to the ones that you constantly beating over there some of those just they just don't want to learn they just don't so you just leave them [ __ ] hoes alone but in that situation when Mo'Nique had that conversation she was not disrespecting me yeah had she had she said it took a transgender and then continued to say he him and misgender me then she was that then we could have had side ey on her like girl what's the te you know right right we could have side eyed her then but that's not what she did she's always she's always she affirmed me in that but what she affirmed was which people were overlooking that my own people didn't hold me down yeah my own people were scared of losing something my own people was afraid of being ostracized and excommunicated from from from everything it took a transgender what I heard in that line it took a person who y'all found detestable it took a person who didn't give a damn about losing anything and was Fearless it took a person that has titties at the top and Dick at the bottom to understand how how I was outcasted and that could have that I felt connected enough to to know how it feels to be this way to hear me to see me and to tell the world [ __ ] I stand with you because I understand and I ain't scared and for the girls to miss that speaks to what they really want which is nitpicking negativity you know focusing on the wrong thing yeah yes yeah why would you try to nail her to the Cross we just that was the biggest Act of unity that I have seen in a while and to follow up and say she her and Miss Madison and that's my and said that's my sister the rest of those girls could miss me with that [ __ ] they can miss me like girl you just wanted you just angry like now now I got to police her and be like cuz she doesn't call me a transgender she calls me sister [ __ ] she calls me sister and not only does she call me S well in that context of what she was saying that she was throwing that [ __ ] back into the faces of the people like and I eat that I think I I think that's really important because I'll see some people say and I understand where they're coming from I've seen sometimes people have um feel about it like like they always have to accept breadcrumbs or the community is so far behind in in in catching up and being inclusive and that they feel like they have to um accept so little but from what I hear when I hear you and I listen to you and I really think about it what you're really saying is no it's not little it's a big act for someone to show you how much they are including me that they care about me that they see me that they appreciate me and that they see my experience and it's not it's not breadcrumb it's not a little thing I didn't get a bone you're focusing on the little thing and it's really this bigger thing that you're missing yes cuz you're so wrapped up in Academia she's not she's still she's learning too [ __ ] and and and and allow her to learn but allow her to also learn and to teach because she could have easily said a transgender you know he pretty or he look like a woman but he's not a woman you know what I'm saying she didn't do any of that she affirmed me in that whole conversation sitting across from a heterosexual man that has me blocked I love that hey I love that look at that hey look at God you block me [ __ ] you couldn't block me you platform you couldn't block me I still I'm still here and you don't know yeah and I'm G get my flowers on your platform for your platform and while I'm blocked but this is the thing to Olay I appreciated her for that I and I and I and and I didn't turn a a blind eye or a deaf ear to what my sisters and were saying like they were saying whatever but I had to inform my sisters like sisters no it wasn't that like you got to you got to look past the surface cuz that's surface level [ __ ] you looking at you got to look past the surface and and and here's why I say it's very important for for there to be many of us cuz there are girls that going to speak to the Academia there's going to be lne Cox there's going to be Angelica Ross there's going to be Dominique Morgan there's going to be hope Jazelle they're going to speak these ways they're going to speak with with great academ I'm going to come in that [ __ ] and take everything that they said and and and you okay you said what you said this what you say you said this all right let me translate this for y'all all of us are saying get right [ __ ] and I love it hey and I and I love that and I think that's really important and you know funny enough i' I've interviewed L and I've interviewed um Angelica and I've also had Hope on my show too um and I think that's the thing I love about y'all is also one why I've invited you for iconic is I really want you to get your flowers is the individual that you are like so often you know you just get lumped into the group and I that was something I saw you you really point out like Mo'Nique is talking about me as a person I am a person this is not about everybody else right now everybody not your moment yeah this is not your moment right now this not your moment to take this and what she's saying and take this into a moment for this is not of her a dig at the trans Community this is not your moment to do that and don't [ __ ] up mine don't do that this is a moment of unity this is a moment of standing in solidarity this is a moment of that that we both stood in solidarity with each other she stood in solidarity with me in this in the face of that man because from then on out Shannon was saying she and her yeah yeah yeah look at that look at that because he knew how to act he knew what kind of environment it was already was that that wouldn't be accepted and that's how it starts we have to all like make that make that active concerted effort like hey we don't not around here nah we don't do that get right [ __ ] get right you know what I love that you always doing your interviews which is uh the the opposite of how people are wrongly taking cat and Monique's interview because what they're doing is not messy people keep trying to portray it that way it's necessary they need to be able to call out the mistreatment they've experienced as professionals and in the industry they're in and in their Community nothing about it is messy but what I always love that you do on your interviews is I always hear you end up speaking about somebody that's been good to you like I always hear you express so much appreciation like I watched a bunch of your interviews you did that and your Jason interview you talked about your appreciation for Beyonce your appreciation for Nikki your appreciation for Pete and what you always say is no matter what controversy they're going through I always appreciate how you say they have been very good to me that person has been good to me they have treated did me right like that who do you who do you find in the in the community and in your experience in all your different H hats Hollywood doesn't feel suffice to say it do you feel like has been good and has been a friend and an ally and people we should we should embrace or look to in in in our community yeah because I could speak about outside our community who's been good to me you can do both your interview in our community I have to say that Dominique Morgan has been good to me and has listened to me and has has wanted Community for me and wanted to bring me back into community and I want to tell you this Olay I I talk heavy for my community I do a lot of behind the scenes stuff for my community that people that I don't even talk about but I stay I keep a distance in my community because they are the first ones clawing at me that's a hurtful thing for me that they're the first ones clawing at me or look or wanting me to plummet and crash and they're the first ones that are making that are spinning narratives and and and keeping things going they're the first ones and it's just like and so Dominique is really teaching me how to or really bringing me back into how to not love my community from a distance but but be able to wrap my arms around in my community because she get she buys me gifts we talk on the phone we we're doing programs together cuz I'm getting ready to do something make I I I I wanted I I can't tell you yet because it's still in the works get ready to do something major for my for the girls um like she's she's right there in the front helping me do this stuff but I'm really what I can tell you is I'm really standoffish because I've been burned so much by people close to me and these people are close to me in my community in my community I've gotten massive amounts of love from outside of my community so it it it can sting a bit yeah I've been I've been thinking about that recently cuz I think obviously in a in a different space but that's something I feel I was talking to my friends last night I was like you know anytime I see somebody hating on me online very often it is somebody similarly situated to me and somebody like I'm like are we not of similar descent or something and that and that and that really blows you because you feel like you but what I what I what I when I try to take a step back and I try to um I try to make it systemic and so I so I don't feel it so personally maybe that's what I'm doing by trying to intellectualize it but I'm like sometimes I think what it is is marginalized people are always made to feel like it could only be one you know what I mean like it could only be it can only be one and so and what and what that that brings out is this desire to rather than truly see Community or Embrace community and embrace many of of us or who's doing well people just can't help but feel like that one seat occupied was supposed to be for them or because that seat is occupied they can't have it and it brings out unfortunately we see the worse and that hate from the people that we should be in community with and that that [ __ ] hurts it does and I'm a strong [ __ ] and it does it does feel away it feels away like really [ __ ] really you well I want you to know regardless of how that feel like how that feels experien and how much I must suck I want you to know the impact is felt like the impact is felt and you are loved and embraced and felt by like so many people and not just the people who think that they see themselves in you but everybody like so many people I was listening to your interviews and one of your interviews just this morning my boyfriend was like run that back run that back what she say that was oo spitting like you really you really make people feel seeing and make people feel strong enough to really be themselves cuz I consider myself a pretty this is me and when I hear you I'm like okay all right I got the gas I got the battery in my back to really lean into who I'm going to be and what I need to be dayto day and speak up and take up all the space that I need so I wanted to make sure you really feel that uh appreciation and I'm so grateful that you are somebody who tries to be in community and to be tangible and be accessible and agreed to come do this interview because because I am honored I just wanted you to know thank you for having me thank you for hold on I'm telling these people I'll be done shortly thank you so much for having me sister thank you for having me for for bringing me on here to just talk to me like sometimes I just be want to talk like you know and I like I I like the uh I like the questions that you asked me and then you just let me free ball freeballing [Laughter] girl oh I needed that thank you so much you are thank thank you for doing it so many people were messaging me they was like girl you I seen on Twitter I said oh yeah I got to do this interview baby I gotta do this listen I when you said yes I was like oh also I just want you to know um this is going to be the beginning of you getting hit up for the black intellectual space of the YouTube I'm telling you I know it because if you don't know uh FD signifier huge Channel FD had wanted to interview you from ages ago but none of us had the plug okay and pl them in plug them in plug them abely will because you're right you know you do something that as we can't all of us can't do something very very necessary and you can reach people that sometimes we do not use the language or not the mode to be able to and I'm more interested in reaching people that's it you know CA listen when I watch let me tell you some real [ __ ] I watch lne speak and I'm I'm in awe at her her wisdom like honestly I sit and watch her speaking and there have been times that I've said to myself damn I wish I I could have articulated my point that way yeah and then when she and I talk she says [ __ ] you have a way of delivering something that I wish I could do I say this is why we're important to be in in in a system together because we're both needed for you see I see in you what you see in me yeah we need that that is beautiful that's why when I have the opportunity to say like like I I'm always in awe of the way that she I watch her I watch I watch all of her interviews I watch when she when she occupies spaces and I and I watch the way that she she stands T toes down for black women black Trans women black you know I I love the way she stands in it and the way she articulated I understand what she's saying but then sometimes I'm like them [ __ ] ain't going to understand that so let me take what hey and that's what we need we need Angelica actually just spoke about that she was like the importance of us all being in community with each other because she she's like you know sometimes I'll see you and a m you talk about something and Amanda seals talk about something so I say okay I know we got to jump on that and get that to my audience and translate that in a way so it's so beautiful for us to all know each other hair each other and help each other spread a message and reach to different audiences that we all can't access and listen that's why I love Amanda me and Amanda could sit down and have let me tell you something o that's my [ __ ] dog yeah that's my dog yes I that's my dog I love she could call me at any time I make time for my sister you to n you to n any time she call me she she called me she like I got a new podcast I got a new thing I want you to come I want you be my girl I said okay what day let's make some time anytime she come I could be a la you know I if I got a book in that that we can both get booked at and whatever she can get booked I'm going that's my girl and it's my girl because one she meets me where I am I like people that meet me where I am and she's and she she don't try to change me like you ain't trying to change me you say anything you want to say on your sister you can say it and she she likes to talk and she gets it she under she understands this stuff like she you know like a I love her oh and that's look we love all the same people Amanda's been on my show too the best that's my [ __ ] right there Hey listen I and those are the best people because when you see people truly be visible and they like they gonna tell you regardless what anybody else says you know that what they're saying is what they truly believe and they it's principle behind that it makes you just like okay that's what we supposed to be doing that's I'm supposed to be here so that's why I think y'all are all amazing women that I've wanted to highlight and make sure you get to say whatever and just know that you can always say whatever you want here and you and listen when you slide over there where I'm at you can say whatever the hell you want to say when you get ready thank you so much for being [Music] here he
