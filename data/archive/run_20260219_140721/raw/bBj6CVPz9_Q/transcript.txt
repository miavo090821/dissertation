hello comrades welcome to midwestern marks i'm carlos garrido today i'm going to be talking to you about marx's materialism um and how it stands different from from other forms of materialism in the history of philosophy it's this guy's 200 anniversary since his birthday november 28th uh 1920 wow 18 20. so uh yes i i don't plan on going way too deep in i'm just going to touch the surface and give you the main ideas but what i will do um is give you all of the texts texts all of the textures i'll give you all of the text in which you can find information concerning uh marxism and and specifically materialism in the body of work of of marks and angles um so yeah let's get started so materialism philosophically is is at the heart of philosophy philosophy starts or at least we're told philosophy starts with uh thales in malaysia malaysia is this region by modern-day turkey and that epoch of the pre-socratics that starts with thales they are materialists they um they are trying to answer questions about the cosmos and what they were what their their methods of answering those questions are um well their methods are idealists because they're they're thinking but they're looking around the world to explain the questions of reality the central questions they're asking yourself is they're asking themselves this what is the er stuff of reality what is that which everything else is made from what is the one which composes the many what is the one that transforms and changes and um so thales says water from the ephesian school heraclitus has fire we have the atomist the democritus and then lucretius we have a bunch of different pre-socratics and and they all have an appeal to matter to the elements uh except for some you know uh we have permanently she talks about the one and and some other figures we talk about non-elemental sort of approaches but we have a generally materialist line of of philosophy in the pre-socratics right and that's that's approximately 400 years from from 8 bc to 4 bc where we have plato with plato we have an idealist approach uh but it is an idealist approach that is not like um the idealism of the metaphysics that comes later on it is an idealism that is dynamic that takes within it also a dialectical approach um so in an important thing to note is that in the marxist tradition as opposed to other philosophical traditions where metaphysics uh comes to me in the theory of all being and being is interpreted as being as the thing in itself right as outside of the experience of the subject that is experiencing um the world right um so we have that most famously in kant um in in his critiques and in his prologue of first prolagomen on the future of any metaphysics um we have this distinction between the world of phenomena right the world that i experience and the world of the thing in itself the ding on siege and this is not the way marx and angles are interpreting metaphysics because the reality is that in this way aristotle and plato and and and these guys would be considered metaphysicians the way that i learned in undergrad i went to a catholic university and we we did a lot of aristotle a lot of thomas aquinas and we were taught that that was metaphysics but when you read the text of angles and when you read marks you realize that they're not treating that as metaphysics why because they're interpreting metaphysics from the framework of fixation they're interpreting metaphysics as that which gets things and holds them as if they are unchanging that which defines beings as unchanging so if you're going to talk about a human being it's the unchanging ultimate uh human being the universal human being that is just this way and that's it right the the um the greeks whether the pre-socratics or plato um aristotle and and um the ones from from the period after the sophists and and uh the stoics they all have a few points a few philosophical perspectives that you see present in in marxism for example with the stoics you have the notion of the logos that the world is structured rationally that we can come to see it rationally well with angles we have a we have a similar quote from um i believe it's either dialectics of nature or anti-during where he says nature is the test of the dialectics and he talks about the two different forms of understanding dialectics that there's objective dialectics the way it works in the world that the word is dynamic and that it has these principles all right so right here in the dialectics of nature he has the three principles of dialectics the law of transformation of quantity to quality i'll explain that in a bit the law of the inner penetration of opposites and then the law of the negation of the negation so we have the structure of the early greek philosophers that to some they're seen as metaphysicians to the marxist and then they're seen as as having a dialectical framework right um in mao and in lenin we we see that for the marxist tradition history is essentially divided between idealism and materialism uh between a metaphysical approach and a dialectical approach at understanding reality right and the thing is that the way these concepts are defined is in a different way in which they are defined generally in philosophy because in any philosophy course you get taught aristotle's metaphysics and then marx and engels are not referring to him as a metaphysician so okay vibrate um so what we have is in the early greeks and the pre-socratics materialist approach and in plato and in aristotle we have plato we have an idealist approach in aristotle we have a more materialist approach but we have a a a dialectical approach overall right um and metaphysical when i or idealist in in in the sense of plato is working with what's real is the realm of the forms the realm of the ideals right the world here is really just an abstraction of a shallow reflection of the world of ideals right um aristotle's not necessarily saying that the way he uses forms is a lot different it's it's done in a more materialist manner but what what they represent in the marxist tradition is a dialectical approach so we have it in fedo uh one of plato's famous texts he has this one nice section where he's uh attempting to do a proof of um the immortality of the soul and he goes into an argument which i believe is called the argument from reincarnation and which he's talking about everything comes from his opposite so if you're lifting and you're getting stronger why are you stronger well because you were weak and then there's this interpenetration of opposites and that's what allows change to happen every state of being is a state that is always in relation to its previous opposite that's a dialectical approach as as we saw one of the main one of the three main points that angles lays out that's the dialectical approach the second one the law of the interpenetration of opposites we already see that in plato's fatal right in aristotle we have aristotle's notion of change as as as dual notions of change we have accidental change and we have substantial change accidental change is a change of if i take off my jacket right now or if i shave my beard i have changed an accidental state of being in myself but i have not changed myself substantially i'm still carlos now if i die i have gone through a substantial change this is something that is it holds the seeds in a way towards uh it holds the seeds for the qualities that hegel expresses in the science of logic and which is kind of expressed also but more so implied in the phenomenology of spirit and these qualities are quantity and and qual or these categories are quantity and quality right and how does this work well what we have here is a cup of water what happens if we drop the temperature of the water to a point where it freezes well what happens is that each degree we go down right and if we can break up the degrees you could if you could break up the degrees you can interpret it as each milligram or whatever each degree we go down we have a quantitative change in the state of the water but something happens at one point when the water goes from being in a state as a liquid to a state of a solid as ice something happens that's a quantitative that's a qualitative excuse me that's a qualitative shift it's a qualitative leap a qualitative change right if you want to think about it in the aristotelian tradition that is a substantial change and it only happens because of a quantitative accumulation right because we accumulated a subtraction of certain degrees or if you want to talk about it in the other way and how water becomes a gas and how the um the temperature has to elevate and so for the atoms to sort of uh separate right because that's what that's how it works with with cast the molecular formation i'm not a scientist but it's more separate as opposed to a solid where the atoms are are together there's a moment in which one thing goes from liquid to gas or liquid to solid that's one of the fundamental uh rules of the dialectic and that is the rule of the of the transformation of quantity into quality is always a quantitative accumulation of something that leads to that leap of a qualitative leap so we see this in figures as aristotle we see this in figures as plato angles even says that we see it in figures in the east like buddha there's dialectical approaches in eastern philosophy even in the conceptual framework and in the linguistic framework the concepts in the west are generally more a tied more tied to things the concepts in the east are generally closer to function so already in the concepts you already have a sort of process way of thinking about the world as opposed to the west it usually tries to to reify uh things and it does that with the epistemic structure and with the language it uses to interpret the world so we have already in the ancient greeks a dialectical perspective we have in the pre-socratic materialist perspective so is is marxism just a synthesis of the dialectic of aristotle and plato and the pre-socratics no um we have after them we have a long period of idealism of metaphysics middle ages and then we have the renaissance and we have a period from the renaissance all the way to um to hego in which there's this constant back and forth of idealist and materialist tendencies and what we find in the materialist tendencies is that they drag the sort of metaphysical in the sense of how marx and angles use the word as static right they drag this metaphysical approach so we have a scientific revolution going on in that epoch but the scientific revolution is one that is interpreting things in a way in which they are taken to be fixated and not dynamic things are not interpreted in a dialectical sense and then we have other figures that are taking an idealist approach but that are thinking about um that are in their idealist approach taking a dialectical uh point of view most clearly here we have we have hegel whose dialectic serves as a pretty big inspiration for marx mark says in the in the preface to the second german edition of capital that uh he owes a lot to hegel which is capital volume one is here right here here we go so see if i find it real quick second german edition there we go dialectical method is not only different from the hegelian but it's its direct opposite to hegel the life processes of the human brain the process of thinking which under the name the idea he even transforms into an independent subject is the demiurge demiurges is god um of the real world and the real world is the only the external phenomenon of the idea with me on the contrary the idea is nothing else in the material world reflected by the human mind and translated into the forms of thought so here we have um what's what's usually popular popularized view of thinking of marx's dialectical method as an inversion of the hegelian one um whereas hegel sees the idea as as the the real in a sense and then the material world is really a reflection and abstraction of the idea marx sees it the other way around it is from the material conditions that we that ideas arise right you first need to satisfy your hunger this is something we see as early as as 46 47 in the german ideology right here in which he says and responding to the the young hegelians of the time he is saying hey these people start from heaven they try to know man by starting from heaven and then going to earth and trying to understand man all right we're not going to go from what men think about themselves we're going to go from what meant do right we're going to go from the material conditions of of of man and then interpret the thoughts right and then think about man right so what what this is essentially is an inversion you're not going from idea to material but you're realizing that before you can think you have to satisfy material needs you have to satisfy hunger and this is something that can even be seen before the german ideology in the manuscripts of 44. in that last section where he's dealing with hegel marx goes into why we are natural beings and the example which is a very semite example right remember marx comes from a family of of i think four generations of rabbis his father wasn't a rabbi he was a lawyer but his uncle was a rabbi and and marx here is using the metaphor of the stomach of hunger as that which pushes um that which establishes the relationship between me and nature and we're natural beings because we have a necessity outside of ourselves in nature all right i don't want to get too carried away it's very easy to do so but he ends up saying the mystifying side of hakuni of hegelian dialectic i criticized nearly 30 years ago so this is uh the second edition so he's criticizing this in in the mid 40s 44 40 even 43 in the articles on uh on his uh critique of hagel's philosophy of right um he's doing it there too um the mystifying side of the hegelian dialectic i criticized nearly 30 years ago at a time when it was still the fashion but just as i was working at the volume of da's capital it was the good pleasure of the peevish arrogant mediocre that's a greek word um i don't read greek who now talk large cultured large and cultured germany to treat hegel in the same way as the brave moses mendel mendelssohn in lessing's time treated spinoza as a dead dog i therefore openly avow myself the pupil of that mighty thinker and even here and there in the chapter on the theory of value cocketed with the methods of expression peculiar to him the mystification which dialectic suffers in hegel's hands by no means prevents him from being the first to present its general form of working in a cons comprehensive and conscious manner with him it is standing on its head it must be turned upside right right side up if you would discover the rational kernel within the mystical shell right so we have with hegel is possibly the best formulation of the dialectic at the time he was not really using the terms dialectic um but it's essentially what what it is right um so i i do the first book i want to recommend is the science of logic right um which is really sort of laying out the method of the phenomenology of spirit hegel is very important uh to read and this is not just me saying it as a as a philosophy student grad student whatever um but this is said by by lenin uh lennon's as it in materialism empirical and empirical criticism that we must we must read hegel that hegel uh is is a necessary read in order to really understand marx although we can you know understand hegel pretty nicely with with uh through through marx and english's works all right we're getting to like 20 minutes i had to speed it up um so so how does marx's materialism mar when i mean marks mars and angles is materialism how does it differ from the ones before that well the ones before that took a static view um a static view of things and even though their methods were materialists they were repeating to material they took a static view others um not only took a static view but took what he calls um ah there we go an anti-human in corporal materialism right and here's he's referring to specifically this is in the the holy family this is the first text angles and marks right together in 1845 is referring to bacon and and hobbes that their materialism has nothing to do with with human people it has nothing to do with with life um and and and and the relationships that humanity um establishes within itself and different sort of social formations um so what's what's the kernel of the materialism that is present in marks and angles that sets it apart from any other materialism first is that it takes an approach that centers in the human being it centers in the material relations of human beings not just material material but in the material relations of a human being so it is a humanist uh materialism and this is a concept that is sort of controversial in the marxist tradition because a lot of people had have tried to appeal to the early marks as the humanist marks to sort of contradict some other things but we shouldn't be scared it is a humanist materialism it is a materialism that starts with the human being humanism doesn't have to be the bourgeois humanism right just like democracy doesn't have to be bourgeois democracy we we can get these terms and use them in our way and i think our way of using them is perhaps more fair to the concept um so it's a humanist materialism it starts with the human being and the human being is material it's a corporal being it but it's a being that is necessarily social right it exists in community humans cannot exist outside of community it's necessarily laborious and from being laborious it becomes rational and if you want an interesting read read um dialectics of nature a chapter called uh which was an essay that he published separately the part played by labor in transition from ape to man where engels argues that the role of the hand and labor that's what ends up developing the mind and further anthropologists from this century stephen j gold they they confirmed that thesis which is brilliant that's one of the things that anthropology has done anthropology has confirmed a lot if not most um of the thesis is that marx and engels were not speculating on but they were writing on and in a time where they couldn't really prove it with the same certainty as as the anthropological thesis so another good text that does this is ancient societies by henry h morgan um who was an american and then he talks about the state and his his discoveries it's like if he's pulling it out of the german ideology um and he's not it's right and we're back i'm sorry my laptop died but so i was mentioning that um at the text the transit the part the uh the hand the part labor plate and the transition from eighth to man um is is is a very essential text you guys have to read it's one that's later confirmed by anthropologist stephen stephen j gold um and yeah and anthropology has generally been without a any sort of marxist background it has been confirming a lot of the thesis that marxism was was uh uh bringing up as early as the mid 40s 1840s so we said that marx's materialism is a humanist materialism right this is something that he says himself um it's a humanist and a militant materialism says it in manuscripts of 44. um what else is it it's a dialectical materialism right so the term itself dialectical materialism i believe is introduced um by plekanov uh the russian marxist right but it's it is it's a dialectical materialism um so it's what does that mean well that it sees things not as fixated not as either or but it sees things as it sees things as in a relationship with its opposite right things are composed of polar opposites and those polar opposites are in a constant relationship with each other interpenetrating each other and in that constant struggle new things come about and that's the the kernel for the for the scientific approach to socialism right before marxist socialism marx did not invent communism he did not invent socialism what he did was discover through scientific investigation that the appeal for socialism doesn't just have to be normative that we don't have to cook up an ideal society from our brain that the relationships that exist in the existing form of society are relationships that have not existed forever that capitalism comes about in a very specific uh context um and that it develops specific forms of relationship between classes that are essential to it and that in those relationships there are contradictions in which one can see that the system itself is not going to last and the prediction is that out of those contradictions the element that is going to be victorious the pole that is going to be victorious is the proletariat the working class and that's how we get to socialism it's a scientific approach of socialism not an etobic one so what do we have a dialectical approach right with the dialectical approach uh with the dialectical materialist approach which uh it's later called diamant diamond we also have a historical approach so material is not just treated as changing now but it's treated in how it has come to be this way it is treated in its historical context so those are the three main things to understand the philosophical concept of materialism in marx it starts with a human being it doesn't start with just matter it starts with the human being which is a material a natural laborious creative uh rational being right social being um it starts with a human being it acknowledges change it acknowledges that change has a structure that depends on contradictions that things that the way that the world was being analyzed through previous forms of aristotelian logic where a is a um a cannot be both a and not a that those sorts of fixations just weren't real that in the world we have the dynamic of opposites and things are constituted by that dynamic of opposite states so that's the dialectical approach and we have a historical um a historical approach in marxist materialism which doesn't just look at how things are but it looks at the historical reasons for why they are that way so three things starts with the human right as a material being starts it it looks at things in a dialectical manner things change and this is how they change right and it looks at things from a historical lens as well right so it doesn't try to separate oh this is how it is now that's it let's analyze it you know it's not trying to do it as as you do things in a lab right even though lab studies of certain things do confirm dialectical approaches right um the marxist lens thinks of things in its historical context so how does this help today is this a bunch of philosophical gibberish right um is this just philosophical jargon and is it is it good for nothing um to some extent marx and engels were the first ones to say that philosophical jargon is is in a sense worthless and as as we see from lenin and of course has its origins and marks and angles all philosophy is class philosophy right philosophers act like we're talking in this universal realm and reality is that we're talking from a class perspective and that our interests are usually aligned to the status quo to the interest of the ruling class at the time so in feudal society these scholastic academics hold up the interests of the aristocracy original society the bourgeois academics um liberal academics were conservative they held up the interest of of capital that's just the way things work people who are in academia who are um against the structure of how things are are the exceptions they're not the rule right um so what is what what does this mean well that on one end they're saying philosophy is kind of worthless and again here we have to interpret the dialectic approach they're not just saying don't read philosophy they're saying or or don't um yeah they're not saying don't read philosophy like engle says you know you have to um you have to read philosophy um it's what's left of philosophy is just logic and the dialectic but it's good to know how we got here right um and we see this with a with a lenin two in his speech to the communist youth leagues in in nineteen twenty he says we need to study everything that the bourgeois society has created so that we can um not everything but what's what's what actually what actually contributes to something we don't have to be just memorizing and memorizing memorizing how academia kind of works now but we have to take what's useful and expand it socialism doesn't try to destroy the past it tries to destroy the contradictions that existed in the past that made certain things that are irrational possible like the fact that there's an abundance of food there's food being thrown away everywhere and yet there's people going hungry even in the metropole right so it is important to know that the materialist approach starts from the human is a dialectical approach and it is a historical approach so what is this service now just the right neat little philosophy books that are not really good for much um no we we can use it in our practical everyday examination of of of our world um eddie uh liger smith the other editor in this project our comrade he has a research focus in venezuela but how does he analyze venezuela does he analyze venezuela how it is now and that's it no does he analyze venezuela how it's changing now and that's it no he analyzes venezuela from a historical context of how it was being a colony for a long time without was being uh a colony that that was made dependent on oil for a long time he analyzes it in a manner in which it interprets well how the travis come in the failed coupe the um the successful election the the blockade the economic sanctions right he analyzes it in its historical context right we have stupid conservatives that talk about facts don't care about your feelings right it's not that we ignore facts it's that the facts are not just facts facts are not just there they're not just they don't just happen to be there they're there for a reason and you don't understand what's there unless you understand the reason why it's there so you need that historical approach right in order to understand things you also need a dialectical approach to understand that there's certain contradictions in every society to not just uh uncritically accept maduro just because you're a socialist to be able to critically engage with what are some of the flaws what's going on here right um that dialectical approach that accepts that there's contradictions in things and that that those contradictions are at the basis of of all change of all progress that's needed as well and also a humanist approach which starts from the real people of venezuela not the white venezuelans in miami right not the bourgeois venezuelans behind guado but the real working-class venezuelans right this is the marxist framework if you apply this framework anywhere in any of the social estates um or anywhere in the world this this is what the marxist framework consists of you start from the human being you interpret things dialectically and you interpret things in its historical context and this is the reason why we have to study uh these texts all right so i wanted to conclude by giving you where you should go to read on on on materialism first i'm gonna do it chronologically the first book you which you must check out is the holy family this is written in 1845 by marx and engels the contacts page tells you which one who writes each chapter um specifically there's some good comments on the dialectic i believe in chapter four yep and yeah in chapter four there's good comments on the dialectic and in chapter six we have a development of the the um the philosophical history of materialism right that's important you also should read okay i said i was going to go chronologically the german ideology um that is where marx first really systematizes the the approach of historical materialism right of looking at history as the history of class struggles right and seeing the motor of history being the dynamic of of classes and how the subsistence of the society overall is produced right and there's also a sort of ontological um an ontological basis in that text which says that well the first act um is an act of of subsistence act of maintaining your own life which is the one of eating and drinking and that act requires production so the first uh the motor of history its genesis is in a productive act the first act is a productive act and act to meet the needs of humanity once you meet needs once you have production then you can start to think um or or think abstractly in philosophical stuff partake in rationality so the german ideology um then you should you should read angles engels is specifically the one who develops this probably the most um check out the dialectic of nature it's a book in which in his studies and scientific studies he spends like eight years studying just science and and writing articles on science and and seeing how it is that science works and what what he ends up confirming is that science works uh that nature works in a way which confirms the dialectic so he says nature is the test of the dialectics right and he says that there's the dialectics is interpreted in two ways in objective dialectics which is how it exists in the world and subjective which is when we're conscious of the dialect of the world so yeah read dialectics and dialectics of the dialectics of nature um i recommend you get a newer copy with a good introduction because usually in the introduction they'll catch you up to date on some of the topics and some of the scientific discoveries that just keep on confirming that things work in a dialectical manner i recommend you read anti-during which is a book in which angles is responding to our doing and are doing trash you don't have to read him um you don't even have to read the passages that angles holds from her doing they're essentially trash but just read the comments the positive side of the book which is the comments where angles expands not just uh critiques during reading critiques for pretty funny but yeah read that and then read uh this is a rare text uh ludwig fourbach and the end of classical german philosophy it's it's very it's it's perhaps it's i think it's like 50 pages 60 pages you know 61 pages it's very short but it's very very good it goes from hegel four year bach right we didn't talk to you about four year bach but yeah if you if you want to learn about materialism right before marx the essence of christianity from foreign um and of course uh [Music] socialism utopian and scientific that again sort of mirrors some of the topics and in the outcome of german philosophy so i hope this video was helpful um i recognized i probably rambled quite a bit too much it's really hard not to um and i hope that you uh that you reach out and [Music] i hope that you read these texts that are recommended because they will give you a phenomenal insight in what marx and angles mean by materialism and that you use this lens to interpret reality how how how it exists it is in essence a a a critical lens of interpreting reality um so yeah thank you for for watching the video if you want to support us um consider a becoming a patreon if you don't have that money to help that's fine you can help us by sharing our content either our articles our youtube videos um or anything else as far as anti-during right now we're doing a series um that's why i'm rereading it now we're doing a series by dr thomas riggins he's been a mar he's been a marxist academic for a very long time and we have the pleasure to be publishing his series of 22 parts going through anti-during so um if if you're too lazy to to read the text just uh hop on every sunday on the website and you'll see his his article for for the week it's 22 of them so that should help tremendously in helping you understand what marx's materialist approach is is all about so um yeah happy birthday angles uh by the time this video is published it will be his birthday november 28th yeah november 28th 1820 and uh thanks for watching see ya
