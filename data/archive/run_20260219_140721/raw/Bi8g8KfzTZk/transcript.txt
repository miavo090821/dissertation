racist zionists love to say the Palestinians have never produced anything what have they ever created when the zionists have been systematically murdering all of the great minds and thinkers out of Palestine for the last 70 years I just finished a book from the legendary Palestinian author and journalist gasan kanafani and I have another one on its way in the mail okay this man was a genius he was a beautiful fiction writer and a brilliant academic and Israel killed him along with his niece in a car bomb because he didn't support Israel because Israel expelled him from his home when he was just a child just like they expelled 75% of the Palestinian population at the time and if you think that they've stopped doing stuff like this you would be wrong in fact earlier this year an Israeli missile targeted and killed the Palestinian poet rfat Aller and you see Israel loves killing the Palestinian artists the Palestinian intelligencia cuz these people are able to mobilize resistance with their art and they give the Palestinians a shared sense of culture and that's what the Israelis want to destroy because this is truly a project of ethnic cleansing they don't want the Palestinians to produce art and culture so they systematically take out the Palestinian artists it's one of the sickest things imaginable they're just trying to destroy an entire culture of people so they can take their land it's sick
