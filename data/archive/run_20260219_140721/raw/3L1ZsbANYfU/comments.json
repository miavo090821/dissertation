Being diametrically opposed to anything implies powerful forces are repeling each other - if this is the case as you suggest, what then is the cause, the driving force behind this? If we have a feeling, there will be a reason behind that feeling and a cause for it. I didn't wake up one day and think - I really dislike this - it was weathered upon on over an extended period of time until I changed my mind from my overly liberal upbringing into a more realistic world viewpoint borne of experience though the analytical mind.

        "text": "​@ddoherty5956 Racest,racism are easy and lazy epithets to fire off at people without giving thought to what these attitudes and behaviors really mean. Racist becomes an insult rather than an observation or a statement of fact. I've viewed Television panel discussions where one panelist accuses one of Anglo-Celtic heritage to be historically racist just from being born.  That's not true.  Although what is true, becomes revealed when understanding of how a country's wealth was obtained. There will be at someplace along the time line appear a time when there was slavery.  The American South is where Slavery is most widely remembered by the outside world. Yet less well known are tha examples of slavery that exist even to this day in the home country of WIlliam Wilberforce whose work lead to.the aboloshig of Slavery in Britian in1833. But didn't include the Empire at large. Supported by British mill owners, slavery continued to exist in the American South where cotton was king, until after the Civi War.   Slavery today comes in a different variety in the United Kingdom. Mostly organized by Eastern European immigrants.  A profitable enterprise for these despicable modern day slave traders is to ecourage women from Eastern Europe to work in Britain with the promise of good paying jobs as, waitresses,  nannies, factory assembly line workers and shop assistant's and forced into supervised prostitution,  Instead, these hapless woman and girls were imprisoned in low dive boarding houses, their wages paid to their keepers, representing themselves as employment agents, the workers wages paid directly to them.  Law enforcement had little interest in their plight until one was found beaten to death in sex for sale establishment and a police investigation organized after a social worker had at last been believed.",

Wilson and heath were like children and there are millions like them today .starmer is probably the least intelligent man we have seen this century, he borders on a form of insanity .in my 70 years of adult life i can honestly say this man is an ogre of mental incapacity . You see”education has nothing to do with intelligence. We take in information and then we conlude and arrive at a reality some where along this process ,starmer  is lost . His capacity to store information is what made him a barrister of sorts , but his ability to reach conclusion and a point of reality is none existent.  In simple terms he’s a lost soal. Even his sexuality is confused . The dummies within our society placed him where he is and now we suffer .  Untill this man is gone .the world Enock Powell wanted for us all will remaine a dream. May god grace his memory . A candidate  for the most intelligent man to ever become a politicion. It’s no good trying to deny these realities . Reality just is”Shakespeare country uK",

When this happened he returned to England & found the Civil Servants could not cope with the conscription process. However a loophole existed for men from The Colonies who jumped the queue. Powell was categorised as Australian & joined The Royal Warwickshire Regiment (his County of birth).

To clarify top army ranking historically the correct title was Sergeant Major General hence it is below a Lieutenant General.\nAlso in WW2 Michael Calvert (Mad Mike) reached the rank of Brigadier at 29. Jack Profumo MP was similar although he blotted his copy book & was ridiculed as only going to bed for the exercise!\nHowever pride of place must be with Roland Boys Bradford from Witton Park, Co. Durham who attained the rank of Brigadier at the unbelievable age of only 25.",

Powell knew how the world worked, he should have done, seeing as it was him and generations of empire-builders like him that caused the problem in the first place using good old fashioned British plunder, slavery, war-profiteering and corporate manipulation. \n\nAs for the so-called Rivers Of Blood speech, Powell wrote it because he craved power and needed working class votes, and so he sought political allies in deprived areas and scapegoated immigrants from our own colonies, people who had a right to be here, using lies and fake stories about excrement being posted through letterboxes, directly equating blacks with human waste. He knew he was lying but he carried on regardless. The speech in question quite rightly got him disowned by his long-term political allies and friends who saw right through his cheap distortion of the complex reality on the ground in quest of a cheap populist power-grab.",

He was good in respect of getting rid of the aristocracy/royalists , but didn’t finish them off by a long way.  If he'd handed power and sold their land , back to the people instead of letting charlie 2 back in to take power back . England would have turned out very differently and most likely for the better. The royals and aristocracy have vast wealth , in the trillions , amassed over centuries. When the bbc , spout Elon as the richest man , know there's quite a few many many times richer .

But after 1965, he went hard for immigration. It was not out of nowhere, it was not pandering, hell, his speech from Waalham couple weeks earlier was even more inflamatory than this and nobody noticed. That is why he did this stunt.",

What i can tell you on YT is very limited, but the invasion of Poland had very little to do with ideology, same with the Soviet one. Roughly 50-60 thousand ethnic Germans were killed in western Poland in the months leading up to September 1939. Austrian Painter had tried to get a peaceful resolution for years. The only lands Austrian Painter was interested in from Poland was the Free City of Danzig and the Polish corridor. He tried to acquire these through peaceful means several times, and the atrocities in western Poland de facto forced him to take military action.",

        "text": "The total population in England and Wales as at midnight on Sunday, 8th April, 1951, according to preliminary summaries furnished by local Census Officers was 43,744,924 persons, 21,024,187 being males and 22,720,737 females.  It should have stayed the same after that until now, or even gone down a bit if everyone was to have a slightly better standard of living.  There was a native Baby Boom after the War - but not for long.  The huge increase in population since then has been almost entirely due to immigration and births to immigrants, initially from our former Empire (now called the \"Commonwealth\") but after than from anywhere.  There was a native post-War \"Baby Boom\".  A total of 46,071,604 persons were enumerated in England and Wales as at midnight on Sunday, 23rd April, 1961.  Were all of the extra 2.25 million babies white British or white Irish? - obviously not.  \nOfficial Census results are not published until 100 years after the event, since they were made an Official Secret in 1920.  But you can get unofficial sets of figures, though the Preliminary Summaries are only available for 1951 and 1961.  By 1981 the population of England and Wales seems to have risen to 48.5 million, and it is not known how much of this extra 4.5 million since 1951 was due to a native Baby Boom and how much to Immigration and births to Immigrants.  But if we say half was native Births over Deaths, that is a mere 2.25 million - who have not then gone on to have large families themselves, for the most part.  The rise after 1981 was steady, and I would argue not attributable to anything but Immigration and births to Immigrants, since the native Baby Boom ended in 1964.  There was a 4% rise between 1991 and 2001, an 8% rise between 2001 and 2011, and a 6% rise between 2011 and 2021.  [Not counting several million illegals over that period.]  \nThe rises are cumulative - i.e. each rise is on top of an already enlarged figure for the previous Census.  Perhaps you can see why I am a bit gloomy - and another reason I am gloomy is just how difficult it was to find these unofficial figures.  Why was the Census an Official Secret from 1920 onwards?  All Censuses taken between 1931 and 2021 will be published 100 years later (except 1931 which would have been published in 2031 but sadly was destroyed in a fire in 1942).",

They were both generals but at least Mitchel had a medium bomber and an airport named after him (B25 and the Milwaukee Airport) when the US Navy finally had the truth forced down their throats by the Japanese in 7/Dec. Mitchel was correct right down to the day and time of the attack.  Powell got nothing but grief. It is a long held British tradition to punish all those who gave the country their best service , while they reward the idiots. If you ever wondered why your country is in the dumpster, you do not need to look any further. I was in southern England as a teenage student when Powell gave the famous River of Blood speech. I must say today, the situation is not just worse than Powell imagined, but worse than he can imagine. Powell did have genius level IQ.",
