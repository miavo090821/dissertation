laughed I knew who shared it immediately I believe I commented I know for a fact that Carlos posted this um this was shocking because you know anybody who at least anybody who's been to college or anybody who's enjoyed uh a night on the town knows that in America in except for in uh places like New Orleans uh it's very rare that you're allowed to walk out with OP or walk around with open containers um the cops if they see you with one they'll come up and and make you dump it out or even arrest you um but in China I guess it's not a thing you're allowed to walk around with open containers they probably have less drunk idiots than we do here in the United cops it's pretty amazing living in China he shows you the contrast between American trains and Chinese trains American Apartments Chinese Apartments oh he's like a vlogger I'll have to check that out by the way shout out to Red saffron revolutionary who's given $2,000 to Hurricane Helen relief so oh my God freaking hero right here thank you thank you so much just wanted to throw that out there say thanks I've not even had a sip of it that is a crime it's if this was America what I've just done now is a crime can you believe it if you open an alcoholic beverage just open I've not even had a sip of it that is a crime it's against the law the police would probably come over shoot me tackle me arrest me just for opening it not even having a sip but in China know look there's police behind me here no problem don't even worry about it but it would be a completely different story if this was America I decided to get an American Beer you know just because it's even more ironic you know they call themselves The Land of the Free how can they be the land of the free if their citizens cannot even just come and sit down in a public place like this and have a local beer how are you the land of the free if you cannot even do that you know China is the true Land of the Free so here's to China cheers there's nothing like the noise of a Budweiser being cracked open I swear to God that and hitting a home run with a wood bat are the two best noises all of humanity has ever been able to produce but I mean I I just did recently uh an that's the American dream right there guys I don't know if you know this but you show midwesterners that you can drink Budweisers out in the open in China I mean they'll be Communists in a week um I just recently did an article that I published in the China Academy which I don't know if I mentioned this to you Eddie but their newsletter has 150 million [ __ ] people in it so it's it's insane the amount of people that that got to see that article but you know I I deal with the the concept of Freedom throughout history I compare Hegel and I develop a unique one but what I should have said was that the real measure of Freedom throughout history is how public you can drink your your bruskies and then China there stands as the ultimate culmination point the end of History the end of history that is that that's the real political Spectrum right there I like it I someone asked someone asked earlier if we're still planning on going to China definitely at some point um that we will make that happen and we will film lots of videos when we're out there um I'm kind of surprised it hasn't happened yet but Czech Budweiser still state owned when socialism fell they couldn't let go of their beer that's awesome I did not know that that's cool nationalize Budweiser now baby absolutely that's that's yeah that's what heo mat um yeah the China trip is happening there's already moves uh going on be sooner rather than uh
