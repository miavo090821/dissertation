a Phantom Ghost by Phantom Ghost I actually win at saying this and she well it's going to be one of those things the greatest trick colonization ever played was like teaching us to hate ourselves and each other so that colonization and white supremacy can function whether they're there or not Dr Umar you ain't never ever really intellectually spar with somebody that can call you out on your bullsh anybody watching this some Dr umar's team I just happen to be a debator I guarantee you I will intellectually whoop Dr umar's it's not in our nature as black people know but black communities are also indoctrinated with patriarchy en abolism and all the things that are also causing this harm there is so much information out there on all of this the fact that you even open your mouth without even going g o o g l e it's literally right there they want to keep us divided so the more that they can say that person doesn't speak English so they're taking the black jobs right the migrants are taking the black jobs when you hurt a white person's feeling and that hurt feeling doesn't equate to like political or structur over her right but when white lady hurts my feelings that feeling Aces to me behind a cell he dead me a [Music] [Applause] [Music] j I'm going to tell you why I conv you here today but first I have to say happy Independence Day to my beautiful Bahama land and I have extra beham here this time normally it's just me and forign but I brought Ash yes Lord Miss and Ash told me please let's not talk about nothing serious on theeman Independence Day and I said I Christina have us talk about our Kelly what happened Kelly I thought was dying in jail dying what do you hear happen to that bro there's no there's no way that you do what you do and not anyway let me not because there are definitely pockets of Blackness yeah okay let's let's talk about it R Kelly most goated R&B singer of all time we all know this at the same time he could also be literally the scum underneath my skin so I mean we all know how we going to do inside jail like his his record going to be awful in jail like I mean let's be real my boy ain't got the protection that a fell like Weinstein things yeah I don't know it might not even be like that cuz like you ever heard the story about that um life jenin told about uh D he became a star yeah he was he was singing for uh for Jeffrey D he wanted him to sing pretty brown whole Sunday you joking you are definitely joking he told the story J like must be nice has mad people that follow him around and he like convenes a whole masses and he sings to them he's a whole thing in there oh he got a talent show in there then he Tak this we have a specific so I'm like Christina Christina have been tweeting about something interesting around our Kelly's wife actually because yall know our Kelly's wife Kelly yeah yeah Andre Kelly you know there's always like a viral video that's going around with her like her her little Beyonce tip but she but you know Christina ever the one to point out you know sensible Nuance in funny discourse Christina was making some valuable points and so I'm G let her have it well it wasn't oh I can't believe you threw me the lob oh my goodness oh I got trapped oh my goodness so basically I mean it it started off as like people keik keing about her dancing right um oh my God and being an aunt as far as I see it she's just like an Auntie who to be dancing kind of you know and way but then I saw the discourse go from like oh there goes J again dancing to like she's a weirdo um I have get weird energy from her because only a weirdo would marry R Kelly and she gives weirdo Vibes just like her ex-husband and probably because she's a creep and a pedophile just like him and then I just tweeted like oh I did we know that like Drea was a victim of R Kelly also like she wasn't an accomplice to what he was doing um and there was a lot of people that didn't know her story that like she was also beat um she would be locked away she um yeah locked in rooms and stuff and and sent down to Florida went right before he got arrested the first time with nobody telling her anything isolated from family she had one friend with her um went into labor the night that he got arrested because of all the stress so I was just I was just throwing in a little bit like of like I don't think we we are like understanding that she also a victim of arelly and I guess the conversation kind of grew to like well partners of like abusers or like wives of abusers and like people were upset that she still was keeping her name Kelly that's what it turned into like well if she was a victim why does she still have the last name Kelly and I was just like she is three I don't know I mean maybe that's the that's what's up for discourse but I'm like she has three kids by the man Tina Turner kept her last name um saying that you know she worked hard for that last name it's kind of the show business name now I never knew her to be and her being AR Kelly's ex-wife I'm not sure if it's ex-wife at this point but I never known her to be we only know her by that last name so that's kind of her identity I guess especially in the space as her being a dancer like she's well known for chore choreographing lots of different artists and dancing behind lots of different artists so she has her own you know reputation with that name so and she has also his children with that last name so maybe it's more of that type of thing for her but there are other artists who still go Nicole Murphy she's no longer married to Eddie Murphy and she still goes by the last name Murphy so it's kind of like for them uhuh I done birth these kids I don't work hard this is who people know me as this part of my reputation this part of my brand it should be optional for me if I want to drop this name and move on from it uh I don't know if Tor Hart has dropped her last name but even for her um in that to situation um she kept her last name but I say to say it ain't even about the last name if she was a victim but for people to do that associate her with his crimes or what he's done um and say that that she's exactly that as well that is crazy business that's crazy business and it was all in the documentary NS what I was it was all in the documentary first of all Twitter is just an association of people just trying to get the next thing going they're not even trying to make of it the minute you make some sense they go but well this but well that and it's just like yo talk about it there is so much information out there on all of this the fact that you even open your mouth without even going g o o GLE E I hope I spelled that right but it's like right there it's literally right Google actually she answered she answered the question of why she kept her name and that recently since she got viral again that got brought up I forgot where but in the last couple years and she brought up exactly what you were um saying that it's because she worked hard for this name and no one would really be paying attention to her if she didn't have this last name people wouldn't be asking for a story and if she can use this name to talk about domestic violence and and other important more important things then that's what she's going to do and people were judging her for that my opinion was I was like is she wrong because we're talking about her because she has the last name I feel like people who make that argument are just people who don't care about what it is that she experienced in general and they just need a way to like move the goal post and diminish it because what the does it have to do with the price of te in China like at the end of the day right if you believe abuse is wrong like if you believe that men should not be abusing women abusing their partners and you know for a fact that she was abused by this man what else is there for you to discuss to somehow diminish her for whatever like there isn't a reason to be a value ating anything on her part in and of itself you know what I mean but it's this means of how people it's what they always do like every time there's never there's never a perfect victim enough for them right like anytime they talk about any R Kelly's victims they find a way to do that right it was like you saw with like azreel like her social media how she act on social media got assessed like that they do it to Dria they have all these arguments it'll be even when like it's a little kid like a young girl they don't know anything about what do they say okay then the parents like they always find a way to move it from what it is what they actually issue is it's just goal po shifting I think like one of the things we see quite a bit is that if you are in proximity of a man as a f presenting woman or anybody then you are very archaically property of that man and whatever your property is embolic or symbolic of like you end up running the same thing I actually winse at saying this and Jes we it's going to be one of those things but I say the thing the same thing with Nicki Minaj to extent hear me out because like we understand that the man that she has chosen to be with and apologize for is indeed one of the most heinous people inside the Limelight as Association by partnership whatsoever but a lot of the things that we see Nicki Minaj sometimes getting attacked for is the fact that like she has proximity to this man yet the fact that he could be heinous we could address him being heinous Nicki Minaj has done heinous things outside of the man so why are we getting on her for her proximity to this man and weaponizing against her in that regard like anytime like when you have the sins of the father it not only goes to the son but it also spills on the mother and like it's always like this thing of culpability being transferred to the woman in proximity to them just in general IE I think you're right I think you're right I think you're right generally but I think I I have like nuanced re like different reasons for why I feel differently about the niiki Manaj situation like ca okay like first of all Nikki has been under Fire for her proximity to lots of different abusers right some of whom are by choice and some of whom she doesn't have choice right like her her brother or something like that's that's that's your brother right um and so I think that that plays into it for me especially as someone who's a defense attorney and all these different things like I don't have the issue that I have with Nicki Minaj even like her people talk about her paying for representation for her brother right like I don't actually think that's like that she did anything wrong there anything thing to be criticized for right regardless of whether or not the brother has is a convict I think the brother is convicted pedophile right like I still don't think there is anything wrong with his sister deciding to pay for him to get the representation that people are entitled to right like um I don't even necessarily have the problem with her marrying the man that she has right like I think it's a dangerous game to play if you live in America where the average black man is criminalized right if we take a position that any black man that has found themselves in the criminal system or that has been convicted of anything especially they alleged that they believe that they're innocent or whatever story you know um Nicki them have for for for old boy like if we take the general position that women are to be shamed for being with any man that's been convicted of a crime or whatever that is that's a dangerous game to play and it's one that I I think is bad for a significant number of reasons the issue I I have with Nikki is like if Nikki were like he did so like he was convicted of a crime or whatever then this was a long time ago whatever have you today he shouldn't be judged for that this is present day y that'd be different instead what we've heard from the the the victim his his victim right because he was he's he's been convicted of rape and he's been convicted of murder his victim his victim of rape has said that Nicki Minaj has specifically intimidated her and used her money and threaten them and harass them like she has said that right so that's the thing that makes it different and when you see Nikki like there are all kind of videos and lives and Nikki crashing out talking about how man is a real ganga he'll come kill this he'll come do this he'll threatening academics all this she uses him like he's an attack dog like a pit bu like she takes pride in the criminality of him like her she's the one like celebrating him like that so I think that's what makes um the Nicki Minaj situation A a little different but you're right though that there is a general like when women when when when a man is when a man is this women are shamed for it right you're shamed in proximity this but I also think there's some level of like agency and like I guess the man you pick right like into it's like a fine line because it's like it's a fine line between like oh well you know she's probably a victim of him too versus like H she might just be a bird and I struggle with that line I'll be honest laugh at that I'll be struggling I'll be like okay hold on like what do we what do we it's kind of similar to like Megan good and Jonathan Majors you know she just she just came out of came out with an interview where she was like yeah everyone told me not to be PR today at 1 right like so I it's day D about that bro we weren't already scheduled I'd have been like oh let's watch that first and then and and then talk but that's a that's a learn a pop we could do another another episode no no no I would not have that kind of episode I even know with a nice audience who likes me to laugh and enjoy myself yeah we can go over there and talk about like inside out but you're right though because like I was thinking when you said that it was a really good point Christian because like the way that victims behave when enduring abuse from their abusers there's a way that like we police it and as y were saying and alluding to like this idea of a perfect victim and how that looks and how that performs and what it looks like and we often see especially that black women in particular they are so far away from the like the Avatar of what Womanhood and white tears and all them other things that are conflated with that they so far from that that it's very difficult for them to even be a semblance maybe even a caricature of a perfect victim but like when you're dealing with domestic abuse and like giving space to like all of the women and F in particular that has undergo domestic abuse that we have present that we have watching like let me know if I'm wrong but the way that that colors a situation especially if you're cohabitate in the same space with your abuser you often wonder how that plays out right like the way that the pressure mounts upon someone to protect their abuser some Stockholm syndrome type of way I really give a lot of space and Nicki Minaj got all kind of things you ain't see me holding no water from Nicki Minaj let me tell you a lot before youall hop on me in the comments but I I'm more so speaking about what Nicki Minaj represents because she's extremely talented um rapper that also as you say like plays into those stereotypes and tropes of black masculinity and also gangster rap masculinity and just the aggression that comes with that all of that I think is part and parcel of her trying to fit into a role that not only Society wants her to be but maybe even like the man that she's with and her Associated association with it that she has to be because outside of that it makes it very difficult this every time I bring for on something we always just end up having a whole different topic and not it's about said it was be be getting killed in the comments for being an anti Barb they're coming you mention them they're going to come but you they're on their way right now right now they from out of nowhere thing about ni Nikki is right like and I listen I appreciate you being willing like wanting to hold you know space for understand this whatever like but Nikki is a very powerful woman in fact I think we I think we need to acknowledge too Nikki's man is her lap dog like that's what he Nicki's man is on the payroll like all like what what name that J um before that let's let's let's be cognizant of what the structures is around Nikki and how Nikki [ __ ] operates like and how Nicki need Nikki is not somebody being like toiled by no man or what's happening and and know I could let me tell you I actually if I was a g who like to be in Conflict on the internet I would i' have been do yall at Eric Adams level expose on a Nicki but and he don't know that you know much I could do you a whole compilation on women that have come through the industry in the last 15 years that n been a terrorist too like n is not a think the reason why Nikki gets the analysis that she does is Nikki is a woman who shows repeatedly that she don't look she she is nobody's girls girl Nikki is not a girl's girl Nikki is not a girl's girl at all like Nikki is a woman who actively and I'm not even like mad at her for it I understand like a lot of women it's the same way like so many black people think there can only be one instead of wanting to help other black people come into the room because they've train and been in a world to think that can only be one of us and so you comeing for my spot Nikki has come up in a world that made her feel like there could only be one that was the time she was in or whatever right so instead of seeing these women like she don't see the industry away like like for what for whatever criticisms people have a of a CI CTI coming into the game made space for all kind of women like a whole bad [ __ ] rap became like all kind of GS that is that open up a whole door for like that and CTI collaborates with and has relationships with with women with women artists in a way that Nikki doesn't Nikki will be cool with an artist for about two seconds if they dick ride her enough in the minute they they achieve any success is beef and the list goes on and on and on and on and on so when you look at like the men she's chosen to be with she's chosen men that have been like significantly um underneath her like man like a safari that she could keep under who who on the payroll and he worked for her he' be the first one to tell you and you see the one that she got now you know what I mean and if you hear any of the stories about people who worked with her throughout the years women that have interacted with as a reason why she get the [ __ ] that she gets you know what I mean Nikki is the type of gy like it's not just that it's not not just that you choose to work with a with a 69ine with a the game with a with a um um this last one that you married to the that you married to it's not that you only that you help your brother it's not that you're surrounded by abusers in that sense but it's what what you have to say about women is you mock mag the stallion about being abused you find that that's big joke yeah talking about the morality mean I never seen nothing all these women so these women like Nicki Minaj and Drea Kelly and um whoever Rebecca bringing it back Rebecca such a journalist we have a point here so um these women who are attached to these men who are either abusers I don't necessarily like the point that you made Olay is that she has a character outside of that that isn't the best Nicki Minaj um daa Kelly people don't know enough about her to dig up her true whatevers it could be they're just going to associate her with um uh R Kelly um and I don't like that talking point where they say because she was with him she has to be like him she isn't in jail she definitely has been raising his kids all those kind of things and has been and has been open and honest with conversations surrounding her ex-husband I'm I'm not sure if they're exes yet I'm I'm just but her ex relationship and so she's been open and honest and she even said for the things that he's done she hopes that he goes down for whatever Nicki Minaj's case she's standing T toes down for him I'm not saying that men can't be rehabilitated if that's what's your choice is that's your choice you know if you want to go with a man that his past includes whatever his future includes whatever his present includes whatever and you're choosing that that's your choice um but her history and what she did to that young lady even the young woman was in interviews talked about um how he um how he and Nicki Minaj threatened her uh offered her money all kinds of these things so she told her story and immediately the barbs came and discredited her because of her Fame and a lot of people like to do that with our Kelly too um they like to discredit the claims the allegations the truth the proof because of his Artistry his Artistry is amazing he's to me a definitely a goat when it comes to music but outside of that what he's done we can call a thing a thing now we can't we can't necessarily attach that to his exwife that's a mess now I don't know if y'all saw it but the um the interview with uh Dr Umar on today and on The Breakfast Club he discussed they brought up um Diddy right they brought up they brought up a whole bunch of stuff they brought up Diddy they brought up OJ Simpson you know he says snow bunnies ain't you know don't go for the snow bunnies or whatever his whole thing with that but but the the whole conversation was about his history and why be he uh he charlem man asked Dr Umar about Diddy and he also asked him you know with bet a lot of people were upset one being Stephen A Smith uh being upset that bet chose to honor um OJ Simpson and he's like because OJ Simpson you know has a history of possibly being a murderer um abuser all those things and bet decided to honor him Dr Umar said now white folks is are always doing you know bet did that because that's a brother okay and he was last time I heard he was acquitted and um you know and that makes it right he said he was acquitted that's the last I heard right that's a black brother the you know Char a gonna point out but he's a snow bunny or whatever my point is he was making excuses for OJ but he was saying you know to remove that and we should be able to honor our brothers because white folks do it all the time as well they will honor these type of people who have terrible history this and that mentioning Diddy he said what Diddy did was in indefensible but he brought it to this place and see here we go I don't like when these conversations are had because if you're saying it's indefensible and I understand he's he was saying saying like black women though if if Cassie were another type of person I don't know why he mentioned if she were lizo a full figure black woman I don't know why he that he said that if it was lizo it wouldn't have been and Char man was like no if it was lizo then it would have been because she's a celebrity so it would have been he's like well you know what I mean but if it was a dark skew like he made it about that but but what does that got to do with the like that's he made it he he he he he almost said you know women don't he so he made it so that oh we have to say that if it were a dark woman women are hypocritical because every day you know they have family he started going real away but those what was his point his point was basically that his point was that black women are 40% um when he say black he don't consider Cassie black so he said black women are considered you know um 40% more abused than others because she's fair skinn so he does they find all these ways to like just move and like like I say just move the gold actually don't care about the issue like I like and I'm getting ready I'm in the middle of writing a script for a video I want to put out next week about this like how we have to talk at fundamentally what we have to understand as a society um and this is something I I want to talk about in relation to abolition that I think it gets left out of the conversation a lot right it's like even if we we gave all the money unless that guy really could take all the money out of police and impr prisons and give it to us for all of like the resources that we need if we still teach people to believe in patriarchy to believe in these systems and all these different things it is still going to breed violence because fundamentally if you teach men if you teach people that women or women or are are unequal you know what I mean like or are to be controlled are to be acquired fundamentally that lends to to a a a sympathy or an understanding for this for the means by which you must control them like if you believe that ultimately a woman is to be controlled the woman is act like this like even if you say they shouldn't do that you're like okay well they need to what what needs to happen or whatever and that's what like this ultimately is about like he's going to keep moving the goal post because fundamentally it's like funny enough whatever but funny enough in that same interview he talked about holding men accountable but when it got so my point was when it gets to conversation about these men who are in higher power who are abusers right we shouldn't be honoring them and that was my point but you're right about him moving the goal PO for his people he started the conversation off with it's indefensible um he also stated you know that I think his point it just got lost but it started getting crazy he said that um the you know it should be centered around just darkskinned women I understand and by dark skinn women he considers that to be black right um so he's like black women themselves it should be focused on that that's not true because didd he has a history of abusing Kim Porter and dark black he don't give a discriminate so so you don't you have chosen to to to Champion that's what they it's the same way like whenever people talk about the LGBT community they make them white black people like to make it white so then it seems like oh it's a distraction like by talking about this we're not talking about our real issues it's like oh let's it's because it's Cassie let's fixate on Cassie's race or the fact that like Cassie's getting more attention or any first and foremost like yes it's always true we live in a world of colorism and racism and all these different things and how those things function so yes it's always going to be true that someone like Cassie is going to get more uh sympathy or more understanding or more attention than than Aliza with alisma yes that's true how fat phobia colorism all these different things function none the less she is still a woman still a victim of abuse still receiving on the receiving on of all kind of misogyny and misog or and none of that has to do with you like her being right punishing if you want to make a critique or to critique about oh did he did he get they're only focusing on this because of oh because of who the victim is so so like it's the conversation still need to be had has a male AB abuser in this like first he started off with you know it's a he started off the conversation before they talked about before they said Diddy or before they said you know OJ sson he started off literally saying that women need to be protected and you know our black women this and that it was the conversation was all right so you know my ears was listening and then when it got to that he studied just on the so like he started off it's indefensible but then went in but hypocritical women are hypocritical because this and this and this and when it's you know if it's a dark skinned woman though this is what my problem is they wouldn't they rallied so much around Cassie but if it it wasn't a darkskinned woman at this time it was Cassie at this time and we don't have to talk about the what about isms and if you want to talk about dark skin you can go back to the other woman that he uh abused literally and that's what you can kind like why are we sitting here in but you know like I we stop engaging like so like this outright misog War because like that's what if a man we talking about a man abusing women like abusing women and somehow the conversation he managed to do enough Nimble gymnastics to make women the bad guys is that what's being said women who are the color women are colorist it's black women who didn't want to advocate for other black women being that we didn't hear this interview right as I'm listening to this it sounds like he's trying to say more needs to be focused on into what happens with darker skinned women who are not highlighted when this happens to them this is only being highlighted because it's a fairer skinned women when there are black women darker skinned women that go through this every single day even in the industry and nobody says anything that's not true first of all that's not true I like I I really hate like Dr Omar and lots of people are good at this they are good at throwing out straw man you know what I mean and like arguments that sound like they have a little bit of sense to it FD has a cont have you call it pseudo intellectual negro nonsense you know what I mean like trying to trick you there's a little bit of Truth in something yes color they're trying to like he's trying to play on your emotion like it's literally they teach it to you in school like as an attorney like you get if if and you as a black woman is going to be quick to perk up your ears is something that sounds like a defense of you it sounds like a recognition of like your experience or that you're not but it's not that's not what's happening here and it's also not true it has nothing to do Cassie I mean first of all cashy was [ __ ] on by everybody let's talk about the black community and Men across the board but namely black men were [ __ ] on Cassie and finding every reason to doubt it why she wait this long blah blah blah somehow that's not a part of the discussion nothing what actually happened was Cassie had her [ __ ] she went to the law her [ __ ] was settled immediately and somehow that still became the narrative against her oh if she really wanted she be looking for justice why is she getting money blah blah blah blah blah that's what they saying they did not it wasn't until a video came out a video came out and you still had people like camera on up there acting a goddamn fool on the like so like let's not act like oh this is because we're paying attention to it now because she's this no that is a straw man that he is bringing up because he know black people he know we will get we will grab onto that and move on from it that is not what's happening there is no what happened was Cassie did something that had not been done before we've always had rumors that Kim Porter and those were abused and all that but they never came out and told us that they never had lawsuit where they alleged where they had pages and pages of of of detailed accusations and stuff so like he needs to stop the B [ __ ] before what we've had were rumors we had rumors that this man was an abuser and it was unsubstantiated as far as we know then when Cassie happened it was substantiated and they still didn't want to hear [ __ ] until the video came out so what what drar is saying respectfully is some Bullit and I'm laughing because I'm playing back I didn't I I was almost I can't believe I watched it but I was almost down with it and I'm playing it back cuz there were a lot of points that he made I'm like okay that black people need to hear that I don't care for Dr Umar crack up at his memes I use his GFS all the time in text messages you know holdery and so with but with the the conversation that he was trying to have for people to listen to it okay fine in the beginning when they got to this person did he the way that he just just wanted to start off and say okay it's indefensible but she was light-skinned let's let's focus on the fact that she was light-skinned and she's ambiguous and she's not black now Tahoe the point that he would try to make to surround okay black women you know they don't get heard much we need to start looking into that okay fine so he talks about that he goes into detail about that as well and he says he drops numbers 40% I believe um of black women but then he goes and starts talking about black women and how we are insecure right I don't know how he went all the way into this he did not focus on Diddy being an abuser or anything anything like that he went into how black women are insecure and that um we go out and we are afraid to and this may be true um we are afraid to you know tell the police that our our partner is an abuser or whatever we're afraid to have them put in jail especially as a father of our children but then he said when black women don't even want to they have they don't have Community with their friends she can't go to her friend this was the weirdest turn for the conversation must she can't go to her friend and go to her friend and say oh you know Olay let me in because my man is abusing me because my friend is too insecure to let me in because she got her man there and she don't want her man to have wandering eyes so now she getting beat up in the street so she just made something up he just made something I'm fast forward interview did now we gonna watch this he said this I swear it's like the whole point of this conversation I can Circle it back to what we were saying he attached to what did Diddy did to her nothing about he made sure that he made her criminal he made her the issue she didn't actually to be born light skin she like does that require like because she's that ambiguous and and and does that say that it's okay for her I I hate how much like I hate how much like I love hate Omar like intellectually I know all that's [ __ ] about Omar but also give me laugh because I'm I haven't muted just what I'm reading the captions to try to get to the part that I need to see to show I'm telling y might he funny even in reading the captain like it's on mutant he's funny he said he I read the cap he talking about how you know they be talking [ __ ] on his foundation I school a't never got built and they've been donating money for that he said he he said you will see these brothers he said making their videos to sland them he's a walking character sland of my name and my Foundation to get 100 views brother you did that for 100 views you thirsty Str he's a character I'm about to say thirsty struggle stream forever I'm so I can't even be mad at Umar long my favorite thing that he does is when he repeats the same thing said like 10 times now it's gonna be a coin phrase but my thing is so he he speaks of Cassie being his lightskinn devil to to Champion black dark black women but immediately which would be a good argument but immediately starts talking [ __ ] about black women that he was just trying to Champion how are he get there he made up a story in his head like walk hat fantasy he went there I'm okay I see what you're trying to say about black women that's that's your emo that's that's Dr umar's conversation points and it may be something to be had that's how he talks but when he started to go in deeper cuz even before that conversation started see this is where we go back to the beginning of this whole conversation because he doesn't like who Cassie is this is what I'm gonna assume right because she and because she's lightskinned right he promotes dark skinned black he don't like no snow bunnies he don't like no in between no no it's not she like give Omar a little bit of defense like it's cuz she's not black like Omar told but he attaches but he attached her immediately to the abuser as the the one that like okay we're gonna dismiss the fact that Diddy did this for sure um and then he was saying like we're hypocritical he's like what she did what he did was indefensible but we're hypocritical right because we don't call out those type of people in our families is it he just went y'all gota see it it got crazy but he had now we're dismissing Cassie we're dismissing Drea we're dismissing all of these people in their experiences about to pull it up you said we gonna see it we're about to pull it up Aon pull it up I went and go and found the time stamp 27:42 let's run it that's actually admirable that you were able to with us horrific yes what are your thoughts on everything that's happening with Diddy that's all you say if Cathy was dokin it wouldn't wouldn't even I believe that absolutely horrific indefensible but the response from the black community Envy in Charlemagne I believe is somewhat hypocritical and the reason I say that is uh 40% of domestic abuse victims are black women black women are being beat on by on a regular basis oh pause hold on hold on he said black women 40% of the victims are are black women black women are being beat on by he didn't want to say black man you saw the stumble like he didn't be black but he didn't want to say by black men you saw that though you saw that but bounce it back run it back watch what happened there because you got to adjust for the argument for who what audience you trying to watch watch was dog skinn it wouldn't wouldn't even I believe that absolutely horrific indefensible but the response from the black community Envy in Charlamagne I believe is somewhat hypocritical and the reason I say that is uh 40% of domestic abuse victims are black women black women are being beat on by on a regular basis ghost ghost we don't know doing don't know hypocritical it's hypocritical for we ain't calling it out black women or 40% of the victims but you can't call it out [ __ ] look at you somebody somebody do we don't know who we don't know who but they getting beat more than white this is a good picture listen look at that about he afraid to talk about though we could talk about what he afraid to talk about said black women are being beat on by some I a never I never seen that man stutter a day in my life swear to God hey he literally went black being beat on somebody out there is maybe somebody doing it who's doing it to be like black people are H hypocritical because black women are getting beat on by We call we know I'm calling it out and I get I'm like I don't even know if I got a ha or rest of this but I want to yes oh damn rebea no ouro it at at the risk of upsetting a great deal of of the black folks inside your audience in particular lii because you know if we leave it on that Cliffhanger we we could be in the arms of of many many hard wigs many hard wig girls no for real we didn't we done talk about about we can talk about it we didn't talk about our Kelly Nikki and um this episode I could get cursed right that's what I'm saying so I'm trying to help you right now I'm just say if we could talk about the fact that if if we could talk about black femicide or or just like black domestic abuse especially at the hand of black men we should talk about that thoroughly because if we leave it on the on the cliff anger that likeone talk about that we will very well play into the hands of particular people that will very much like us the BL into that hand cuz like we need to acknowledge the fact that yes we like we do see a substantial amount of black men in relationships with black women and it's often times black men filiz and black women and abuse by psychological abuse all of that but we need to also look at the different circumstances that lead to these situations as far as just like a systemic reason as to why because there's a agenda one would say to make it seem as though black men are these puent violent vitriolic um men that are animals and you need to and you need to go and basically surrender black women in totality uh to the white man in order to make sure Happ exactly that point what's so that's why I'm just laughing I don't know why went there because he I just don't want to to it and leave it there and now here's my thing I'm never the one I'm I'm not saying that like the thing is it's these n arguments they make these bad fa arguments you know what I mean that are like half and we have to fix it yeah like but I'm like I am not making that argument I've always been like and I and I think we talked about this I I hate that like when people you know they watch something they watch one thing and they'll come in but they don't see all the rest of the other content and all the time they discuss this and flush yourself because we just had this conversation in the everything episode where I explained like we are in community with ourselves you know what I mean we are in Black in the black community so you're going to see the re the results of what is what I spoke about earlier in this video like what is patri R Archy and misogyny and patriarchal violence or whatever that breeds violence and you see that from Men in society in general we are in the black community or we are in community and in proximity with other black people so we are experiencing that but that doesn't make black men the the the picture of abusers or the most abusive or the problem being black men the problem is I mean a series of different things like a a myriad of of different things that happen but it's just stupid that Umar and them bring up these arguments like and they bring it up without the new of like yeah why like all the different things that is it true that our community our communities protect abusers or people that are abusive toward yeah yes not just the black community our communities like the society protects abusers for the reasons that we protect like we protect our hierarchy we protect our systems our our preservation of what whatever have you we often T in a patriarchal society you view men as the head of the household you view men is necessary you are inclined to have more sympathy to the plight of men than than um women and all of this but and I think there's a a larger I think this conversation in of itself is really large because I don't think it's okay to talk about like I think we're going to talk about abuse and violence and how it's bred like how people become that we have to talk about it not just in like intimate partner relationships in terms of like like H uh men beating on their their Partners but talk about children children being abused and like also a lot of abuse that happens in the black community happens at the hands of women abusing children like you know what I mean abusing women and women then in also abusing their children in the normalization of that kind of violence and how all of that feeds into it so it's a really really nuanced thing my thing is I I want to be very clear because I watched the interview most of it so let me be very clear so my point of this whole conversation is because he brought up all those points that you said the same one that you said forign he went in depth about that one um saying that it's something that we got to talk about because it's systemic he even go went into why the um black children or children or what ever how these kids are you know it comes from us and and he went into the whole conversation right but then U and he even said that men need to hold themselves accountable but when it got to this conversation about Cassie he almost cited with um went like he almost just threw away Cassie and you know went into this whole other conversation and called women hypocritical or our communities hypocritical and all that that was my problem because it's connection with Diddy and the ction with um same thing with ar Kelly and D like it's that they will say that the person did wrong but there's more like we need to have conversations about why the woman was wrong or what what was wrong with the woman instead of focusing so much so on better that's literally just a rhetorical device like that's what that is is a rhetorical device I got to teach you an argument like yes you were going to concede like oh yes that's indefensible while I proceed to find ways to defend it you know what I mean to move to move the goal both to shift a conversation to something else and how you do that how it seems real is when you give people where their things where there's a little bit of truth to it you know what I mean and you deflect them with things that are serious and other things and now you're having a bunch of other conversations that are separate and apart from what the you actually you know what I mean supposed to be discussing what is actually the issue crazy but let's play Umar let's hear it so that you know no one could accuse us of not listening to this brother out rate for black women is going through the roof a black woman is three times as likely as any other woman to be murdered by her lover black or white y'all saw what happened with the sister uh in Milwaukee 19-year-old black sister what about a month or two ago went on a date with a 33y old Caucasian man he killed her dismembered her spread her body all over the this is recent you see what I'm saying yeah he won't bring up black man he's going out of his way black man like he won't say black man in this right like oh it's supposed be calling out and O us to love her but you know statistically most black women are with black men black men when women and white men are the least common statistically interracial pairing there is but you bring up what is an outlier of violence of this 19-year-old on a date with this white man that murdered her but you don't want to bring up the actual common who of the 40% of black women that are experiencing domestic violence in the black community who are they experiencing it with are those scenarios where white men are taking them out and murdering us on dates or what is more likely happening that we are being abused and our households but you see what I'm saying yeah see that's fair that's fair and then you had a little a 17-year-old sister down in K caral Florida she walking back from the movies with her two friends and a white boy just pull over gets out the car he know is he know he know who he talking to day with a brother killed his children killed the woman killed himself those are not typically black crimes we don't nor me do that kind of stuff we don't crash out like that but we are now because the spiritual Foundation of African people and the emotional one black man said that's not true that's so not true that's what gets me and that's what gets me is that they oh he's he's so it's almost Insidious how clever he is using his words because there is truth like these aren't black crimes they're not but if you looked at in proximity like o you said proximity who were black women Mo mostly around number one and number two there's also the aspect of like who has been told who Society told is easier to victimize black women so anyone who's in closer to proximity to black women they're going to if they're we're just easier to victimize and then you include a whole bunch of different you know intersections like okay fat phobia colorism um ableism it just makes it even more easier but we don't do that it's not in our nature as black people know but black communities are also indoctrinated with patriarchy and abolism and all the things that are also causing this harm that's happened in colorism that's happening to black women he's he's Insidious that was crazy we don't do that like it's these ways that we lie you know what's funny we do this in a lot of ways as black people it's the way like black people talk about drugs that aren't weed and be like Oh them white people drugs and it's like we have we had a crack epidemic before we had the crack epidemic a little lesser known fact y'all should read this book that's called um it's by James Foreman about like crime and punishment in Black America but he talks about like how heroin was a big was a big big issue before that and that yeah heroin the heroin problem in the black community is actually what made the black church and so many like black leaders refus to like get on board with the decriminalization of marijuana because they were so convinced that if anything could cause the like this they were in convinced that marijuana is a gateway drug and that you're gonna end up with people back in this like heroin crisis right so but we will say things like these things ahistorical [ __ ] like like we know black people who do drugs we know black people all these different like that's not a black problem that's not a this like what do you mean black people don't do that black people don't don't crash out and kill their whole family or anything like like or black people don't commit suicide or black people don't do that or black people yes yes we do yes we do we have we are we are literally human beings like everybody else in the same Society falling victim to all kinds of different things being being taught to believe in what do you mean but it's this way you see what he did though like he called out the black community for being hypocritical for saying that we're not calling out like to protect our black sisters talked about the statistics of violence that black women experience statistically at the hands of black men refuse to at any point talk about black men brain brought up scenarios by the way that are not a part of that statistic by the way like if we're talking about the domestic violence of intimate intimate partner violence you bring it up miscellaneous white men these outlier scenarios literally are not even a part of that statistic and then the only time you bring up a like a a brother a black man in the scenario is to say that don't happen though do that sh mind you back back in may he said I believe somewhere he done said back in May that his predictions because I don't know if he's a prophet but he done said that um Diddy would purchase a church uh and become like you know and make more money than he's ever had um it's somewhere it was a claim uh something like that um that he made and uh now I didn't watch the interview or I didn't watch it there's no I didn't watch what he said before that I didn't watch what he said after that that was just something that I read right that he stated back in May and I'm like so he got help for Diddy or is he saying Diddy gonna go for a money grab in the church I'm not sure but the way that he dismissed you see how from when they said they asked him about Diddy and Cassie and how he felt right they gave that they gave that verbage back to him it's how he put it out there that man literally ain't saying nothing sense and started going in about the the crimes this and thatal like what nothing is help political can I ask a question intellectual negro nonsense really I have a question I don't I don't want to redirect away from this if y'all not finish but y'all said something earlier that kind of um caught interest in my head right when you let when you drew a line from abuse in men back to children now obviously I'm not trying to to talk about moms and [ __ ] like that I love my mother I love my children's mothers um but do y'all think that there's really a real connection between what happens with kids at their home or growing up being beaten and then creating abusers later on in life yes 100% I think I think I think it's I think it's all connected and I think it's all connected I even think like I think it's in the same way you know when people that talk about um Bill Burr made a joke like he has a joke in in either F is for family or in one of his stand-ups but he talks about like um the like a he doesn't sort of in How I Met Your Mother but I guess like the cycle of screaming right the cycle of violence right like men men spending every day like out in in life upset or whatever by how they're treated in these systems and they come home and they take it out on their good is about yeah family the dad is just up the whole exactly and so he takes that on his wife and the wife take it out on the kids and that's very real when you think about the connection of these things right and to me it's what it's what reinforces violence because the reason why people talk about it all the time a man will a man won't buck up with a man but he'll buck up like that with a woman right like a man will not come home they're not going to fight the men in their life that are doing this or the systems they feel this way but the woman who is smaller than them in the same respect that's why women will beat on beat on the children like you even I know lots of women in my like life growing up who who talk about oh once their son got too big they couldn't beat him you know what I mean they couldn't fight you know what I mean like the children get older the children get bigger so there's a recognition what you are teaching implicitly that if somebody is smaller than you if you're able to you can exercise for like physical domination over them and control them that's what it's being taught so that lesson doesn't just like go away because like you suddenly get into these gender Dynamics are out in life we are in fact that's what I'm saying it's like we are breeding violence like we as a society are breeding violence like hey conscious we're reacting to Umar wow you know the hey conscious you know he said um in there and you know Tahoe the he talked about that like a lot of these points like I said he that's why I say he knows better but the way he can throw his his opinion he can say all of these things the same thing you said Olay um the same thing you're asking Tahoe the same thing all of us have mentioned here he will say it go in and it's the truth he knows the facts of the situation he knows where it's how it's systemic then he gonna Veer right up in right up somewhere in there sprinkle some of his little razzled Dazzle on it his opinions but still make under the guise of it still being factual right all the stuff that he's yelling to and he likes he likes to call them by name while he's saying these things which our opinion um mixed with facts He he'll say you know Charlamagne Envy you know get my attent get like listen here listen listen at me okay because this is focus focus because what I'm telling you is Bible my brother no snow bunny right soad are we really having a are we taking Dr Umar seriously like is that what we're doing are we really we really spent minutes speaking about somebody this is political this is this is what he does like literally you ask him one question and it goes off into some anging about all this other [ __ ] like we it's problematic because people on The Breakfast Club right the dumb Dums like the shade room I'm not saying that everybody dumb in the room comment section but I'm saying like this is what these are people if we're trying to fix the system if we're trying to fix it because we're saying there's a problem here like you just mentioned where it's like where it stems from how it's systemic if Dr Umar already knows that but yet he's putting out this other rhetoric right behind it he has followers like Donald Trump too like those kind of people that be after him and will follow every word he says to the te how can we ever fix a system that he's talking about that's broken that we need to fix by putting the blame on like this party only but then just before that saying what the issue is and how it's a bigger scope of things but see and people are going to focus on that part which they do all the time on these huge platforms on that part that sounds good for them like that part that said tells us that Cassie basically almost deserved it like but we need to focus on the dark- skinned girls we can't really like we and that's problematic we don't we need to focus on the fact that Diddy beat that girl's behind made her suffer so much mental abuse physical abuse all the things embarrassment shame right this is what happens to women especially when they're dating these type of men in power that should have been the conversation I be I'm like Umar saying so much [ __ ] and we barely have even touched the nose in it and like and I'm looking at the title of this episode and that's two seconds of this I'm looking at the fact that I see the migrant right the fact that I see the migrant crisis you know it's about to be a bunch of anti-black nonsense that's wrapped up in all this total intellectual I'm telling you and like it's just yeah oh we Never Gonna Be Free We Never Gonna Be Free like you mentioned the migrant crisis free again um I was looking I was at there's a bunch of migrants on my route in the street where I work at they're all basically Nigerian I thought Nigeria was like a really affluent country how did Nigerians the Nigerians are able to to immigrate to the states normally can have means to do it um but I mean that still wouldn't save them from being Peril to the same systems of the immigration system I mean a l go off Nigeria is a is a huge country I don't think [ __ ] realize how big Nigeria is like like they sure are there people doing there are always going to be people doing well there are people who are well to do everywhere but n there are I think the best way to put it too my I asked my daddy and my uncle Bala we were watching a a Nigerian movie on Christmas and they was laughing about something but Nigerian women so I asked them like oh like their thoughts or or something about Nigerian women and my uncle pulla was like he was like yummy there uh Millions I can't remember how many millions and millions of Nigerians he was like there's no generalization I could give you for Nigerian women or Nigerians like there are way way way too many so it's like it's not like think about it America is America not a world superpowered that's a affluent country are there not tons of Americans living in poverty like so it's like that oh wow hell yeah what the hell I ran into drar Johnson about two weeks ago in New Orleans when I was uh uh going yeah listen listen now cap No Cap No Cap I'm in I'm in the I'm in the New Orleans um airport uh me and the wife getting ready to celebrate the 19th anniversary I run the Dr Umar ass I decided that I was gonna say [ __ ] soon because we know he mentioned the running in New Orleans with a mixed couple get the hell out of here I definitely ran into keep going you feel me I definitely ran into him swear to God I ran into him and and and and and what I and what I realized though know I'm saying talking talking to him and seeing him you feel me because we both like like we looked at each other but we Ain say nothing in my mind [ __ ] you don't know who I am I ain't going to cause no scene up in this airport you feel me but my mind it's like you King African pan africanism and you do a lot of copy and paste the vice supremist ideology when it comes to migrants and immigrants and [ __ ] like that but you supposed to be panafrican so for me it's like where where is Right line of Distinction for your domestic identity and you being King Kong King King Kong Consciousness you feel me and like like like like what's the bright line you feel me and to me too I'm saying when it comes to him talking about snow bunnies and all this [ __ ] here to me it's like hey do you think it's transactional wherever I put my dick at this is how I sh up care for my people so if I'm with a Mexican woman you feel me or or Filipino woman you think that because I'm putting dick in the Filipino woman or the other woman I should not care about the black community no more I think that is indicative of your bad politics and how you think that wherever you put your penis at it's always got to be illustrating how you he was talking about you baby he brought running into a mix that's so silly mixed couple he said in the airport he saw a mixed couple look at him and he's like they be looking at me I just I'm not trying to start no trouble I love when I see black on black but I'm not trying to start he was he was doing all that but he said when he was in the airport in New Orleans he was talking about that but I like how you said all of that because you're right he tries to spew out this if you're really about the people's work and you're caring about people and we can't it's a whole bunch of people in this world but he's he see what he tries to do he phrased it as I love people they are still human beings they are still human beings and I'm like okay he's like so we can but we have to preserve the Blackness and all that you know whatever the case may be and then Rebecca next week he'll be talking who claim his cousin he claims his cousin Douglas right FR Douglas me it's like so me it's like okay let's look at this model if you believe that Frederick duckus is sneaking with a snow bunny what does this mean for his effcacy and for his for his work does this sto all out cam James has a great video black ey on YouTube that he just put out six days ago on Umar and he talks about that exposed like debunk all of umar's many lies it's 30 minutes is fire I figured that's who the shade was he call him thirsty struggle Steamers he got Umar together six days ago probably then it was him see he started calling out people cuz he he tries to act like he's unbothered but there he's very much bothered he he um went and said he's a therapist how he still works with children who are white who are black who are whatever um but then he even called out because now I'm gonna take it over here because he talked about a lot of things um he talked about Kendrick Lamar right he said Kendrick Lamar I love him I love him I love what he did for the people you know how he talks uh Charlamagne Envy I love what he did for the people and so but he's a brother from now we have to start focusing on gentrification bring seeing that the the the elite is that what he called the elite Mexican Rebecca I hate to cut you off I to cut you off but I just want you to know that if nothing else work out for you life just this this right here is such an extra stre I would buy out concert Halls justan well thank you beloved I got to give it to you how I how I heard it because people say I'm lying and if you see it they gonna say I'm lying so this he's literally putting out this rhetoric and thank you so much but he's literally putting out this rhetoric and I want y'all to know this is not something that I just I'm making up he said this and this is why I say it's super problematic because he's a Kevin Samuel's ass that's gonna be out here and people will take it as Bible and they're going to think that he is act this is what he is saying is actually him promoting love him promoting Unity him promoting but it's not it's division what was he saying about the elite Mexicans he said that the elite Mexicans sorry he said the elite Mexicans and he was saying that Kendrick needs to focus on thank you for bringing the music together thank you for bringing he said thank you for bringing um you know the The Gangs together but you need to start focusing on the how the elite Mexicans basically white Mexicans um and the white people Caucasians are gentrifying the area start focusing on that building back I said but that's the problem see now you're you're you're you're othering and you're you're doing all of this and you're you're going to fearmonger you're you're going to tell these people who are listening they're not going to listen to White Mexicans they're going to say Mexicans people who are listening the dummies they're going to listen they're not going to do research they're going to say Dr Umar mentioned Mexicans in the area people are just Prejudice and they want excuses and they and they want and they will do Nimble gymnastics to like justify and they like when that I like I I really think fdfd at with his pseudo intellectual legal nonsense the other day because they love when someone can give them a bunch of stuff that are like wrapped up it's so tangled you know what I mean that people don't they feel like ah there so much more Nuance to it like oh it's complicated there's a bunch to hair out but you pass past all of these like straw man arguments and these things that are just meant to distract you and it's nothing more but just good old fashion stupidness and bigotry all of these things are just bad faith Arguments for what when you pass through it all it is is just good old fashion misogyny I don't want to see like that's all it is like that's all the is like some cute ass Pro Blackness with his white supremacist ideas of like for everybody you know what I'm saying to me it's just like hey man we in the middle of an election year and you're repeating rhetoric that could be volatile in helping conservatives and you know what I'm saying Republicans get in office now I know you King C Consciousness you Mr independent and this that and the other but goddamn my you care about the black experience right so you don't care about how you gonna encourage other black people to get to a pole to down the pole and thinking about who the superintendent is thinking about who the I'm saying da is thinking about who the sheriff is like bro I think you full of [ __ ] and too if anybody watching this from Dr umar's team I just happen to be a debater he can pick when I speak he can pick whether the speech is six minutes or nine minutes I guarantee you I will intellectually whoop Dr Omar's ass and he listen you can scream as loud as you want to you feel me you screaming it don't make you right I just happen to be a debat and I think Dr Umar you ain't never ever really intellectually sparred with somebody that can call you out on your [ __ ] constantly just happen to be that guy we can talk about wives and biracial [ __ ] all you feel me but I guarantee you I'mma burn your ass like some good barbecue like they do in the Ws it's gonna go crazy they're gonna they're gonna send but but he also talked you see here I go talk about a lot of things that we're talking about it is politically problematic because he then sat there over there at The Breakfast Club and that girl wasn't there but just charlot made an Envy so he he he literally was having this conversation going in deep and he said you know know we have of course he talked about the age he talked about he but he he admitted and said you know Donald Trump is bad he's bad for black people he has never done anything for black people his um uh he had people executed who five of them were black U made sure that went through while the transition of of power went to to Joe Biden but he still said that he's not voting for anyone now you know all the little Umar dick riters are like I ain't voting either I ain't voting either but if you're So Pro black you would understand how you're ancestors right as African people he calls them African people has African people you know your ancestors have fought got beaten died all kinds of things for your right to just vote and now you're just going to sit here and as a pro black person the most you know hotep is like they you leveled up black right that's what you think elite Black right and you're gonna sit here and tell people not to vote because it's the people that we're voting for aren't black man tired they all the stuff they be saying just be so baked in so much foolishness they be on this like hotp stuff pan you you'll say you Pan African and in the same breath that you like become like an American exceptionalist be against migrants and immigrants you know what I mean like you want to like like like Oh I'm a I'm a I'm a I'm a descendant of slave while the while literally denigrating where the slaves come from like y'all want to know like attachment to that Africans I really don't understand it people I'm like I understand it actually I understand it it's all a bunch of white Supremacy wrapped up in nonsense and it's what it all has been and I've been tired of hear it for like a year now the same people who want to like Champion the one drop rule they'll be fighting for you to say like logic and them of black will be the same ones telling you like black people from across everywhere else in the globe aren't black well it's just nonsense if you point out they start with this anti-immigrant rhetoric meanwhile if you point out that immigration is a black issue that the majority of immigrants who are finding themselves in ice for the longest or deal are black immigrants y y y they don't want it no no no they're a tether they're a tether they didn't think they were black when they were in their country they got the whole do stay with that talking point but I didn't hear his I didn't hear his um uh conversation surrounding that I know that he likes to talk about Haitians and how Haiti is you know was once a great country that white people came and had the you know he has those talking points right but then he'll go and his people his following you know the [ __ ] I don't know but the all those people which are fine love y'all mean it because y be in the comment sections mad y all came here by your own valtion I did not take y all here cuz y all come and say that oh foreign on the yeah forign doing the dasp I ain't going to lie I'm glad it wasn't you I'm glad it was honestly if we if if I came here again and you did it we would have had to like talk something we would had to fight in the conversation Tariq was like I can put hands on feed him for if he do this again Hey listen man I'm born and raised in Brian Texas you feel me I'm born and raised in same city that my people was slaves in same people that they call me tether they try to call me a tether and Sh so to me it's just like y'all make a lot of just accusations and you throw [ __ ] at the wall hope for something to S you know what I'm saying that's I'm saying they literally just lie on your name I concern call Marill Jamaican they be calling Mark Lon Hill Jamaican like they they come up with all kind of [ __ ] like I really watch lie on my name for extended periods of time like I show it when I tell you showing I was like was lying on my name for 19 minutes straight it's crazy like just lying they saw a picture of me with my black boyfriend and said that's a white man they don't there's nothing that's common sense to them they don't care they just is lied they just is they just is lie like let's talk about policy real fast too cuz think about it man you can't talk all this [ __ ] about not voting and doing all this here and then you making analysis that emphasize the significance of Haiti as if Haiti isn't caught up in the abyss international relations that for America politicians to set ups that allows American corporations to go set up and steal resources but you said you're not going to do X Y andz how can you be a pan-african that cares about the global experience of black people politically socially economically while you foreclose and literally concede the power to a right-wing fill in because B name black or because the person you full of [ __ ] because they don't care about the black experience because they don't care about the black experience internationally like let's let's let's just you no but the no because the undercurrent for all of this the undercurrent for a lot of this is American we don't like so if we could just let's just let's just be like real clear right now I sitting there behing y listen y'all talk and get get I let you know right now all of this is American exception first so when you make the AR so when you make the argument of oh how you could say x y and z you talking about you talking about Black Americans who don't have the same power as white Americans and would like to wield that white American power and so they find the closest thing to wield that power too and that is black foreign people who have been who literally come in try to try to fit in where they can fit in try to fit in where they can fit in but these people don't but who you are speaking about the people who have the the loudest mic the biggest platforms the the the the most stringent arguments the the wildest arguments they don't care about the black International experience and I can tell you that because I can I can watch any any bamian right I can't speak for other Caribbean people because I don't live in any in any Caribbean in any other Caribbean country but any bamian that works in tourism right now can tell you how they are treated and how it hurts when they get treated by yeah hell yeah right because you don't get to because there is a power that you have with the American dollar that does not equate in your specific too so we so there has to be a very open and honest conversation about how American exceptional how American exceptionalism how do we how do Americans uh change that narrative what what should Americans be focused on doing to help change that this whole diaspora thing that's happening because I I I don't really know what to do I try to be I don't think it's a merit I no Ash talk no I'm going to say this so there has to be a very there has to be a a a a very um concered effort to look at oneself right so I can sit in a conversation and we can let's just let's just put it this way we can sit in a room of of people who have been abused right because no one was abused in the very specific way that I was abused that no one else is hurt no one else is hurt it points to my hurt and so I don't want to look at the hurt of someone to the right or someone to the left and so there is this willingness to completely ignore the experience of the black diaspora there's this argument that a lot of people make that there's a lot there's this argument that is made that because you come from a black a majority black nation that you don't suffer the effects of that you the effects you don't but you suffer the effects of you know how Wild it is as a black behan to walk into a into a black bamian restaurant and still not be served the same way a white person would or have areas of the or the island you can go blocked off that's where the white de live are there are beaches nasau is now the this this the capital the capital of the Bahamas right now nasau you cannot there are certain beaches that you just cannot access you cannot access alra ancestral land has now turned into just a an American playground right we there needs to be this and and and It's upsetting and it's very upsetting because you know what I can do as a black baman I can sit down and I can talk about at the very least a surface level I can have a surface level conversation about slavery in America the Recon the Reconstruction period Jim Crow I can then go and proceeded to talk about the Civil Rights era and now modern and now the modern era of of the way black people in America are being treated and I can also talk about the way Caribbean people have contributed to that struggle but you know what take and I wasn't talk to me in schools I was talk to me in schools that's something that you you talk about here because you know as a black behan you go into America they say oh let me see a passport let me make sure let me let me make sure use a Black y' from from the Caribbean I treat no no I ring up I get ring up and string up the way anybody else getting ring right so you learn about where you going into and what American exceptionalism does well what the what what just what the power of the West has done in general we don't even want to just put this down to just American exceptionalism but what the power of the West has done has allowed you to be the center of the experience so when I go to a place I don't need to learn about that place when I meet someone from a different place I don't need to don't even need to know know when you think about it the fact that the Bahamas is like one of the top tourist destinations in the world everybody's heard of the Bahamas but they can't even get our country name right like everywhere like you see they can't like capitalize the te when you tell them there's this disrespect this there's this when you when when I even when I correct people like no I'm not we're not Jamaican no we're not this like people act like Americans have an attitude that they offended that you even like asserting where it is you from or that you should get the country name right but you know but you know y it's even in the way it's even in the way that that you introduce yourself right hi my name is Ash hi my name is Ashen from the Bahamas and I can tell you there have been countless occasions I'll introduce myself to an American hi my name is Ashen from the Bahamas where you from I'm from Georgia yeah I'm from hi I'm XYZ I'm from Georgia don't we own com anytime I talk about my immigration situation don't we own y'all don't we don't you so now there's not even a because you view your St you view your States as different so you view your States is different countries right so obviously I need to know my favorite thing right now is pretending like I don't know what oh where's that right oh I know you pissing folks off Ash I know you is pissing people know it's real like someone like I think that all the time like people send me something like they they they'll send me something they'll be like I saw something someone sent me something they wanted me to boost something and they were like oh it happened in Bahamas and I'm like where the the Bahamas like in my mind I'm like the Bahamas is a collection of 700 Islands in Keys you talking about nasau are you talking about this that is a different place like yes 700 Islands in keys so it's be so crazy to see people like know that when that when that um that when that when that b girl the other day who was on that one show that one show that that bringing the black when she was to say which one Caribbean no she was no she was running on not's Caribbean but she was SM she's like my friend went to the Bahamas she went to no not the and she was like oh and she lost her leg but now the whole are thinking that we got just a bunch of shitty bacteria and you don't think tourism is our literal number one product so now n buying tickets so let me so not only that but like the Min the minister of health and them had to literally put out a statement do you realize how like the the dynamic that's involved where you believe that you are entitled to say something disparaging about a whole country and then elicit a response from a minister official and have to and and it's because we're raised and like what people don't realize like the the effects of and and and this goes I'm I'm getting ready to write a thing for a show and I'm getting ready to Launch um but like talking about like uh colonization and how colonialism and all these different things function to like affect all us in this in this way because we're raised in the bomas tourism is our number one industry and they teach us in school how to serve foreigners like how to serve tourists you know what I mean like you the Bohemian is put underneath the tourist right which which leads to a lot of xenophobia that the Bahamas has and like you tie up that and then tie up being taught like anti-blackness and colonization and z and then you'll see like like people weaponized at xenophobia but against like foreign black foreigners like Haitians and people who are not even the ones experienced who are not the ones like creating this subserving subserving class between usism exactly right but they teach you that in school like Ashley we was just talking about this the other day like you wouldn't believe this but if a Bohemian could sing or could dance they will send your ass to the airport to Shook and JY for tourists I swear to God I tell him and you no no no you you you laughing but I want you no my fat black ass was out at the the aort or the har singing singing folk song Sing Song SK oh God literally literally puppy no they literally s me at the airport watermelon is spoiling watermelon is spoiling that's what the hell right it sounds like a song I have but you know what's so funny about that song that song is recorded in the Smithsonian right they sent two white they spent they sent two white Americans to Cat Island to record a behav right on his banjo singing that song the two white names and I meant not memorizing them the two white names are recorded you know what they got the banjo slinging man the banjo sling man golly damn that's SP song though be like like the thing that I find frustrating into what Ashley was saying and I honestly Ashley you put that Soo much better than how I ever felt it's like your Force especially like as an immigrant you have to know everything but a i like I know I am a literal expert in American political this American history like degrees all this you know all of this and then people who don't know they don't even know your country's name they don't know [ __ ] have the nerve to think that they could speak to the black experience or the lack thereof tell you that you don't know colonization that you don't know racism that you don't know this that this isn't your experience that is infuriating and like they don't see it like I'm like you are from a world superpower you're from a world superpower with all with with with the citizenship and privileges that come with that assuming that you would like the whole world has been colonized like black countries black countries are either like even if you think you don't see white people in the same way because I've seen this people be like they think because we live like in a black community that like racism or colonization or systemic racism don't function and it's crazy to me because a lot of black people even within America live in their own black communities and so I don't know why and you know how systemically and all these things are functioning I don't know how you could think we live in Nations that are like out hear people a lot from Black Americans they'll talk about how Young America actually is with they experience I'm like the Bahamas this our independent state how old the country is foreign 51 51 the country our parents like our Independents you know what I mean no the country in it structure is is 51 but then you dealing with you're dealing with guyss like me who come from families who have set the foundation for this country that has been in that has been colon for over 200 or so and also you have like basically a structure of petite bisi that is still very much in Power white bahamians and whatnot and bahamians revel I don't talk about this too much especially given the circumstances but bahamians Revel black bahamians especially Revel in a in a brand of anti-intellectualism and antihistorical value of our own history and and value and revel in in the idea that oh yeah this a bamian he can say he can say even though he white he can say he KY Joe that's fine why you all we Ain like the Americans why are we getting all this whole race thing that's that's the whole lips you literally have bahamians that will get on we have white supremacist bahamians that will get online that we follow that we know of I know L me them know because we already had to cut up with them already and we regurgitate okay boom all right so KY Alex we got I go to scho watching you need to stop your [ __ ] before I go on boycott even hard I did before and put you back inside toilet when I was bullying you back in school because I mean the whole fact of the man was you still got white bamans that live in a particular um crust above black Bohemians no matter whatever parity of riches that we do have and you will have black Bohemians that are darker and tire itself that will still if they have a little bit of proximity to the same petite bushwasi sell whatever dark skin blame is say oh no we good how bad colorism is in the Bahamas like between colorism xenophobia like I mean Advanced colorism is one of the earliest colorism and xenophobia are some of the first things I ever knew in the Bahamas because like my daddy is is Nigerian and my family like Ashley is a real all the way back bamian family my mommy side we are real all the way back bamian families and my mommy is red and are called bamian like that but I am Doc and my daddy have an African name as far as they concerned my Daddy's African so I was always like some of the first things I saw of post was the way colonization and the way anti-blackness like taught bamian to weaponize to worship like to feel like they have to serve white tourists while while actively being against the black immigrants you know what I mean like and there's a difference you learn that because you you learn that in the books right so we have a social studies book that you learn in that you have in primary schools it's literally called social studies and TM Ed I forget about that tourism education and so you open up the B right I will never forget it because I went to government primary school before we TR before I transitioned to private private school and so I can't speak to whether or not the private primary schools learned from this book but I do know tourism education so you open up the book and all the all the pictures of tourist you see so I personally I was maybe 14 when I learned that a tourist could be black yeah okay so you open up the book and you see white tourist and then your teacher saying you got to be you got to be nice to the tourist because the tourist don't because if you a nice to them the tourist come back and I could be your fault when the country can go so now you now you are ask or little child smiling at every white person you see because it can be your fault if the T don't come by that's what you were taught Bahamas in making Bahamas they haven't written our books in making it a Bahamas to teach us that that the that beham this is in the book I remember like this in the history class like this is the answer to the test on the quiz that beh were lazy that we were lazy and we were given our independence because we had nothing value when we were lazy and that slavery was not so bad in the Bahamas and that I I mean I want you to understand how deep I actually just the other day bought a bunch of different new Bahamian history books because I was like you know I getting sick of these Americans saying [ __ ] to me getting ready to have to make a video essay about like bean stuff and I was still and I found all the old white history books they have with the quiz is telling you writing in there you could see him in Amazon discussions the white people coming in oh I'm so happy to find out slavery wasn't so bad in the Bahamas in in the Amazon comment section yo Amazon when listen when I hear all of this right and I see on the internet I see all of the back and forth between people of different countries and black Americans for one I take it as for just plain ignorance me personally right like I'm I have West Indian parents I identify as black American I I none of my West Indian W Indian grandpar Indian Grand I feel like grandparents so but where they from Aruba and Grenada we got some did that whole run through the Panama Canal back then um but I I wasn't taught none of that so I grew up in Mar projects that's what I know that being said I do love West Indian culture even from the East Coast I love the West the West Coast like I I take in love for other people that look like me that I feel have similar experiences but I do believe that there's a level of distrust that happens between black Americans and people from other countries the reason I can say that right even even in the last two days on my timeline while I was talking I went and found them because I follow these two people two people that I've been around I've been to beach parties with they've been at my crier been in my house when they had an issue between their country or and a black America or whatever one of them says when people realize black Americans are idiots you will learn to ignore them I'm not listening to nobody whose descendants outnumbered white people in America by far and yet remained enslaves for 400 years what that's what this is the person I've had in my house the next person the next person since you black Americans sending everyone back to the countries make sure y'all cut them dreads out y'all here too go back to Jerry Cur you pork dreads anyway no Devotion to spirituality or or nature and the thing is you my comments right now you know what you know what so and you know what you know what I'm not gonna do I'm not going to invalidate I'm not going to invalidate how those comments could hurt by telling you by by telling you that that's like that they're not that they're right on it because they're not right but what I will tell you is that there's a power dynamic between black Americans and black Americans there is a and and and and you know what I'm there's a com there's a there's a because I want to be very I want to be very careful right because the the whole concept of diaspora Wars anti the concept like just the whole concept of diaspora was is just like dumb to me right but I think would be need to what we need to maybe this is about to be a clunky analogy right but it's when it's about to be a clunky analogy but it's almost like when um when you heard a white person's feeling when you heard person's feelings and it doesn't and that hurt feeling doesn't equate to to like political or structural or or structural hurt right like it doesn't like so me as a black me as a black person I H this white girl I heard this white girl feelings and yeah she can cry for a second but when but when when white lady hurts my feelings that feeling equates to me behind a cell me dead me losing a job me losing like me my reputation down the line and I'm not saying I'm not I'm not saying it's right I'm not saying that it's right to say any of those things but I think it needs to be acknowledged at some point that before the before the the the the Genesis of social media um before the Genesis of social media um um discourse and before the the engaging of these pockets of communities that we can get together and concentrated and concentrated corners of the internet before all of that you had black immigrants facing facing discrimination from all pockets of American society and until that until until that is genuinely acknowledged there's always going to be like this this this um this biting back the hurt the hurtful I don't understand what the the power Dynamic you and I literally am ignorant to it I will say that I do understand that we looked at West Indians or Africans in a certain way you go back to the African booty scratcher or or go you know you you coconut you coconut or or or you know those type of things I understand how those type of I will tell you the yeah like let me tell you let me tell you what the power Dynamic is every other white immigrants like the reason why European immigrants attack Ians polish all these different people have been recognized as white is because white the white America recognized that it was to their better their betterment and their power to like cre legislative get rights for them and pass for them the reason why black immigrants our countries can't get anything like you can't get you can't you can't get a work visa we can't get here we don't have no special car outs it's the reason why Haitian immigrants make up the spend the longest time in ice we the most mistreated we the most criminalized is because not only do you have white America against you but and it's not the fault I always say this it's not the fault of black Americans they're being fed white supremacy and xenophobia and all these things just the same way the rest of the black Globe is as a result of colonization but how that functions in application is why like me don't have a green card don't have citizenship don't have status why you can't earn money why you can't do anything it's the reason why uh all the most of the behemon that I know or foreigners that I know like myself who tried to come over to school are back where they are or end up and'll find themselves in those in those positions there's there's a difference like and don't get me wrong don't get me wrong somebody who has lived like I said I've lived in I've now lived in America since I was 14 I understand what is the unique experience of of black Americans and what they up against in their country and all of those structural impediments and all and everything that's happening there so I will never paint it as though it's like black Americans fault or even that it doesn't exist you don't see these same kinds of xenophobia and anti-blackness weaponized even within like I said it happens in the Bahamas you have it there it functions differently but there's a big difference like whenever people do this thing to what Ashley was saying like about the hurt feelings for every Tahoe for every you saw two comments I can show you hundreds of comments every single day from Black Americans every single day for can tell you when we come offline you see my social medias are deactivated every day on the most disgusting of levels it's like it's not only it's it's all anti-blackness it goes on both levels you I know it's it's ignorance and antiblackness both ways I know I know I'm never going to say pretend as though there aren't Africans or Caribbean black people or black people elsewhere who who speak on or diminish and dismiss the Black American experience that they don't understand because they're being fed they're watching their American propaganda and all these different things on TV and and it happens those ways but to be in this country how xenophobia functions to be black in America so you are black in America and experience all of racism and everything that comes with it but not to just not be a second class citizen to not be a citizen at all to have no rights or protections afforded to that to not be able to earn your money to not be able to work to be scared and stressed I like what happens in the election like what happens when when when when Trump gets uh elected is very different than what happens to you versus what happens to me I'm a Visa deny I didn't have to get out of a country I've been in longer than I was ever in my own country because it those thing happen that's the difference between hurt feelings and actual power you know what I mean so when people when they decide to to to embrace xenophobia and this idea that like black black uh foreigners or black people are not American are not black and thus should not be protected not thus should not be cons considered that that effects that has real real meaningful effects that not only hurt black immigrants but ultimately will hurt black people overall in if I could just say this for for one um o i see the words that are spoken to you on the internet and I want to apologize for all of that [ __ ] because I believe in you I believe in in your mission for me and and my people our people I I know you don't deserve that [ __ ] you know what I'm saying so I just want to let you know that I I apologize a th% for all of that that's directed to you again I will say this that that's just ignorance I've been saying this since the beginning of this episode A lot of them people on the internet are people you and I would never ever speak to like I would never find myself in the same room with you yet I'm subject to hearing your thoughts and it's insane that we're flocked to these pages every day right we go right to the shave room comments and we see even the people that would go there and comment we know we would not talk to that's one thing but I will say this as far as my experience as a black American and what I've heard this is not how I feel what I've heard and conscious I can't wait till you speak I I know I jumped in front of you but I feel as if a lot of black Americans feel that other black uh people um look down on them like y'all think that we're lazy like that we feel like y'all have y'all y'all get all of the hospital jobs or or y'all have y'all these communities where y'all get the houses and like that and we up in the projects I know that this I listen I'm trying to speak for what I've heard not for how I feel but it's like we're we're competing because that's what white supremacy that's what White America that's what they they give you they want you to believe that they want you to believe that so that you instead of hating our oppressors you atte each other the thing that's frustrating as an immigrant is I understand that they think that I understand exactly what they think and what they feel and I and I even understand why they think that and no why that's not their fault the frustrating part is is it's not true it is so much harder imagine going to a place like you get this what it is to be a foreigner somewhere to be visiting somewhere and you're not from here imagine living in a place like we can't take your job we're literally not allowed to have it like you know what I mean we can't do it we cannot do it we literally for me to like let me let me give you an understanding what you have to do it for me to even get into a law school they only let in seven to n International students into a class at a law school think about that like that is the carve out you are competing in an entirely different pool that is less for you because they know you can't get a work visa they know you can't get a job in order for me to get in law school I had to be the one of the best you could Google it accept it everywhere five C at every honest Society working like a mother dog you know for me to get a job like coming out of law school nobody would sponsor me like you can't even get it like I couldn't like it is so it's just not me you talked about this though me and you have talked about the opportunities that you're not afforded because you have this immigrate immigrant status that literally forecloses you from getting access to certain opportunities to certain jobs to certain houses and I think that what we describing right now is a masterful analysis of American exceptionalism and I think that I'm saying with what Tahoe was talking about is showing how though actuallyy is right there is a power Dynamic that always already exists and something about being an American citizen having an American accent having access to American passports that gives you a different type of power you know what I'm saying when we start talking about how they be anti-black to us and we be antiblack to them I do think that though it does uh bir directional I think that there are times that black Americans we try to cover and Center our American identity at the expense of other black people I also think there are other times that black immigrants try to uh uh make themselves into the American exception at the expense of black Americans I still think what actually saying is true you know I'm saying like I think that the power that ield as a black American a it ain't comparable to what o do you know I'm saying O hurt my feelings and C me ugly or something but I could say some things the O that could make it where now legislation you call ICE you could call Ice on themas and [ __ ] threaten you like that they really do like that's real life like I think to people I be like you don't know what like it is to not be able to quit a job because you like they can make you they know you're an immigrant treat you like they treat you like sh but they know to quit or to be fired is to lose your life to leave the country like that is not an option I have had the situation where Court officers go to physically attack me where [ __ ] like the the level of like xenophobia and bigotry and stuff that I've had to endure and this and you cannot go or they know where they pay you lastly you know you can't even get a promotion as an am on a student visa you know when you when I asked you about doing content creating and I said so you going you going to do this and you looked at me and said conscious I can't I can't I can't do that if I if I take some extra money they will send my black ass back to the Bahamas because I am not allowed to make money outside of what they thought got a Visa for I'm like wait what so you can't Hustle No if I know every instance black people get treated worse if we talking about immigrants you damn right black immigrants get treated worse than the other immigrants so now we put that in just position to Black Americans is like fam we it ain't competing there but going back to AR Johnson I think that because we're able to acknowledge like for instance I got a master's degree in education I know that on most higher education most of the tier ones here in America when they start talking about the black population majority of the black population is not gonna be from America they gonna be from Nigeria from the Caribbean from over there right I think that when Dr Umar starts to make these different claims and [ __ ] like that he does it in a way where he's not giv his dupe diligence on the entire context of we talking about and he's making a snapshot you feel me like well because in this one instance I believe that black Americans are overrepresented by black people International this must means that black immigrants can do x y andz and it's like n Christina you was trying to say something I know you've been trying to get it Christina back yeah see I can hear her I can't hear you can see and he here oh my God Christina I didn't know you were here damn was gone she been trying to get in for a second oh my God I could onlya let me say [ __ ] damn damn and that look like a like like like we like we impressing my good s I'm like Christina oh Christina you have to refresh or something I don't know I don't see her hear you anywhere oh my god there you are you were not here I know you thought we just were I just thought you you was for like an hour y said I was no I was listening the entire time that's torture that's tort was for a second but she came back and then y'all was just talking she was trying to get in she was trying to get in I'm like Dam my she in here talking been talking like oh my God Al me this is some americ they they talking about me as the American black American right I'm I was listening American women you know how we got to do black American a I got to hand you sis you you going to give a get your monologue you you the the monolog I let y'all be free people sis you gotta oh my God no I was listening I was really listening all time and I was like learning a lot of interesting stuff and I was trying to to address what Tahoe was saying about the right before Ashley and you were speaking about like the com the um Power Dynamic yeah I think one I think it's difficult for a lot of Americans to understand the power of our passport until they leave America yeah and i' I've lived abroad I lived in France three times I've visited sagol I've been to the Bahamas but I was like 12 when I went to the Bahamas um so it's been it's like been a minute since I've been actually Caribbean but it's you don't really there's two things you don't conceptualize the power of your American passport until you are you see it in these other places where there are other black people and you see by just holding this passport the type of power youing because we're in America you all you experience is there is like the oppression that's happening within America and you're not going to fully see it until you you leave and most don't sorry yeah most and most of them don't leave and most of the most of us there's a a financial um social and economic privilege to being able to leave unless you're like like I was able to do it through scholarships and through working um so there was even that aspect like I wasn't like a rich expat but the mere fact that yeah I'm able to be out there with an American passport it meant something and I was noticing that and the second thing is I think a lot of black Americans conflate the hurt feelings that come that are attached with feeling like we don't have an attachment to roots and an ethnicity does that make sense that gets conflated with the power Dynamic that comes from American exceptional ISM and having an American passport and not having immigrant status here we often feel like we have to and I've also felt that and I felt it while traveling abroad when people would be like okay like well where are you from I'm like black American they go yeah we know you're black but like what do you what what is that and then I would have to oh you know I'm like what do you me my family has reached from Louisiana and South Carolina you know what I'm saying so you you you realize oh other okay other black people they whether or not they can right but they they have like this Pride this Pride there's a pride that I at least I've experienced in like speaking to the black people acoss sasp a pride we don't there's not like a pride to being American that we have even though being American as power so I think that conflation of like we feel like we don't have pride in our Blackness and so in in our ethnicity of being black American they some black Americans don't even realize that's an ethnicity half the times in these talking about this person's not black you're trying to say that they're maybe not like black americ but but our ethnicities including the white people like white white American they see white black but like that's just the ethnicity when it's like race and it's been it's become somewhat an ethnicity specifically over here so I think that gets conflated to where it's like yes it can hurt or you you you feel like a type of Disconnect to Blackness because to be a proud black American you have to be we don't have we don't have that and I think that it it's it's it's it's definitely it's definitely I think misconstrued that we with with there's a black American Pride that's attached to America yes we're attached to what we've overcome but for me it isn't something that is higher than what West Indians um that the pride that they have for where they're from like when y'all say I'm Jamaican or bamian or beian like there's something that you're attached to that's positive most times when us the pride that we have for being a black American is is mostly attached to struggle and like but you notice you said us Caribbean Nations and not and not and not the African one because like not for nothing people I like I am denigrated a lot for being Nigerian mind you I'm I'm being born and raised I've never been in Nigeria I've said this a million times but I Nigerian but the way that people use me being they like they they choose to ignore me being Caribbean because there a way that people will exoticize and they think Caribbean is cooler than they think African is but they [ __ ] on me for being Niger like the way people I'm telling you if I showed you the comments I get from black people about calling me because I'm a Nigerian isy I got a theory on that o I got I did I did my I did my little my little DNA found out I got a little SI little Nigerian and yeah but I'm I'm a little embarrassed to say it you feel me but I could be real and say that I had to really take a step back and really process my own feelings and emotions when I found out I was a bit Nigerian because in my experience of being a black American the that's been the nastiest to me has been other Nigerians so for me when I learned that I was Nigerian it me up because I was like damn like know what I'm saying like being real I was like I hope I ain't Nigerian they be bad they mean to me you know what I'm saying and this is when I was like I'm 33 this Happ I did this I did this when I was like 24 you know what I'm saying 23 24 so it's almost 10 years ago but I think that it's something about the white Gaye that we all talking about that we not really kind of acknowledging with specificity we're acknowledging that white Americans will I mean black Americans will literally put the European Gaze on black black immigrants and Lally try to Center ourselves as being American we T I agree there are times that I can acknowledge hey man to be black American is not being a part of being the pride of America but like O A may say goddamn if I need to be over somebody I I I remind her ass American I own your country I'll kick your ass out so that right there showing you that American herim that that that white Gaye or the flip side when we thinking about how our feelings is being heard or how we being told we we monkeys or a catha or we ain't got no region or we ain't got no land we seeing it as being like the white gays and what HT our feelings is we recognizing the same tactic the white folks use on us you're using it the same way I think that black immigrants be like damn the same way white folks treat me treat me which brings me to something when I when I've gone abroad as a black American that that I feel like I got hit in the mouth and humble is realizing I got that American passport and being like [ __ ] I'm American and then being at like a Resort in Jamaica and then [ __ ] Jamaicans should treat that white person with their white American passport then they treat me with my American passport and that's why I think that white gays fit into it and why we start thinking about desirability as you [ __ ] me up with social studies and tourism education I'mma think about for the rest of the day yes oh I can show you the books we can show you the books like they still using them I don't know how we got I don't know how we got here it wasn't even you it was not you for it was me it was me but um and I let y'all just you know fly with it but my thing is we learned a lot I think the conversation and I as much as we want to run from it it's always going to come back to it because we get to be real about our experiences I cannot say I can't invalidate taho's experience I can't validate especially because I can understand a lot of olay's experience because my parents literally have to go through that till this day right now can't do a thing can't do nothing can't say nothing can't they have to function in the same manner that Olay has to function in and so imagine how hard they had to work for me um who was born here but still treated as other black here told that my parents ain't no good all that we get to have this conversation but understand that it is systemic they want us to look at each other like this they want us to no matter no matter how our experiences are or what's real and what's true they want to keep us divided so the more that they can say that person doesn't speak English so they're taking the the black jobs right the migrants are taking the black jobs that rhetoric is very problematic so when people like and again I did not hear what Dr Umar said as it relates to migrants I know that he said something educating about the Haitians on there but um that still those people who are in the hotep space um they will push that that same rhetoric that Donald Trump said it's the black it's the black immigrants the black migrants that are the problem here and in fact that's not the issue it's it's systemic and why we ain't got jobs is because they want to make sure black folks ain't got jobs and it's not like we have to start looking at it from outside of the uh what they want us to be with each other because if they keep us fighting against each other especially in the online spaces they keep us fighting against each other they can start doing all this other stuff behind the scenes against they the government your leadership can start doing stuff behind the scenes against migrants against black Americans and then we can go back and say it was we blame each other for it what I that's what I'm gonna say I think and this is what I'm getting ready to say in in the script I'm writing right now but I think the greatest thing the greatest trick colonization ever played was like teaching us to hate ourselves and each other so that colonization and white supremacy can function whether they're there or not like oh God white people don't need to be nowhere near the building for us to like for us to like implement it right and I think so I think like the greatest thing I think I want to dispel um as my cloes out for like mistu air a lot is people have this idea and I see it because they tell me every day is that we are not black in our countries that we are only black when you get to America like a lot of them a lot of black uh Americans who say this not of in general the majority because I don't think the majority of black Americans have this like xenophobic thing I that's not been my life experience I've been in America 16 years and I really think [ __ ] is only amped up the way it has in the last three four years like I really wasn't experiencing that from Black Americans on this kind of level but I think there's this idea that we only see ourselves as black once we get here this understanding or being treated or perceived as black is unique to hear and I'm like no it's not piss me off o that [ __ ] that [ __ ] make my ass it and I hear that listen in the in the Bahamas I'm wearing the bamian flag right now the yellow is for the Sun the aquamarine is for the water and the black is for the people like like that's what it you said boy look you saw me die right not her saying I am the most bamian bamian ever you walked into [Music] that because I went and asked them to bring their on here for Independence brought it up I asked could not find your behavior I had my behav banana I didn't have a shirt in the color and for wearing colors Navy BL shirt every my whole room is Bahamian I am in the Bahamas we ain't you ain't going to win this one you married Aman have an American you better end the episode quick before you lose hey you ain't even bam me you literally one br me one in my B passport this one who would be traveling as what that one americ passport to travel in I had a choice came [Music] home yo if I could if I could say the whole story about loing about them treating him stink with his bement passport and him quickly getting his American passport for them fight back fight back I it ain't no fight I I right there I right there the rooman i s i sitting in the B I sit in the B say that in the states right now wasn't and I come back home I come back youting big movie in the city you a win this one if really reality that's that's an ex that's an excellent that's excellent promo that's an excellent promo Independence Day though yes that is a promo for forign reality show the getaway that is on a real friend excellent excellent represent only yes yes hey a dumb question who who did who did Bahamas who did the Bahamas win their independence from the British British I thought that was aor everybody can I ask something real quick how much when y'all are getting taught in your schools abroad do they speak about the Black American Experience here in the more than I on more than we know about say something real quick before you go Ash very please take it from me after this right you know we don't they don't teach us much about about y'all experience so so so y so when y' say this right when you say we act like you only been black a week or a month or for the time that you've been here that we're talking about being looked at the way white people here look at us because we don't know what your experience is over there because notated about that but that's the ego but but hold on in every other context when white people when why how come we understand in every other context like arrogance and ignorance except it's like shut up like on other people's experience that you don't know about like I believe that and I think it goes both ways I be the first one to tell my mommy and them y'all are experiencing your thought process and policing y'all are watching American propaganda and y'all are not hearing from the black americ and y'all are assuming all these different things you don't get it you even lived in this country you don't get it like my daddy will say things I've heard these people I've heard it goes both ways like I'm saying it's ignorance on the parts of everyone that is how colonization functions is to not teach us our own histories and to not teach us the history of each other but to feed us propaganda that makes us anti and against each other I completely agree black Americans are not being in t stuff just like black Caribbean listen bamans are our national average is a d bamans don't know Beman history let alone anybody else on but we have more pop culture and more access American Media is what's like fed and given to the rest of the world so you by virtue you learn things about American culture more than you would other places including your own I I know more about American history reason why [ __ ] bad too I think I think that a lot of us black Americans don't recognize how hegemonic black culture is to the rest of the diaspora and literally how most people throughout the world get force-fed black American culture from different media so when they get here you feel me a lot of times the only idea they have is what they've been taught but also a lot of us black Americans in interal Li centering ourselves and being Anthropologist is able to dictate the way the world is identified and the way the world functions I can't tell you how many down south I didn't have to argue with hey this my home girl she from the Bahamas like Jamaica no the Bahamas like this like same thing they out there it's like you sound and the fact that that's not seen is offensive like I as a person like I believe I believe and I think it's offensive both ways I believe like it's important for me to respect like the difference like cultures within black American culture Regional differences where you from all these different things but it's the fact that no one like so off so in often do people feel the need to afford the same respect to us like it'll be people my people will send me super chats watch my own watch the show comment on this in your audience and insist on calling telling every other Island they're calling us we from there we from there we from wherever and when I'm like that is not where we're from likee don't matter whatever difference same difference Barbados but to but to taho's point though um when he referen you referen the fact that you know you're not taught that in schools right so I think what I need to say in reference to American American history needs to be a little bit contextual bahamians don't specifically learn about black history right we don't we don't specifically learn about black history but we learn about our contribution to American history right so there's an entire Community there's an entire community in Florida cocon that built by Beeman right call it Little Bahamas right that's it's l was literally built up by bahamians so uh South Carolina you can't tell the difference between the gichi people because you share the same accet right um Bim you can stand on the beaches of Bim bimy and see the lights of Miami right there's an interconnected there's an interconnected history there Dr Martin Luther King wrote most of his a lot of his speeches um in the mind Groves of bimy that's where he bent for peace right um but you don't it's not like you just specifically learn black history in in the Bahamas like I said you going into the States you got to get in where you fit in so what you do you learn about how are black people treated there because ain't nobody can see me as a beian first they see me as a black woman first and then they proceed anywhere after that and um and so when you say that you're not taught that in schools I think that's it's that's two sided possibly multiple sided right so on one hand you don't know because again it goes back to American exceptionalism you don't have to know yeah you just don't have to there are things that have to know because outside of because outside of your own reality let's be real I don't care what going on in my neighbor house what Miss if Miss roer don't have rice and don't ask me for no rice why I got Miss rice I don't need to go and and you know I don't need to not you do Miss I know I go over to miss Roa house for some dinner miss you got some rice let me go to the store and get some r now I gotta learn what kind of right Miss like that's excent that's an excellent beh anology Caribbean rice and we can acknowledge that they are black experiences around the world outside of our own it starts with conversation let me also please don't give behemon too much credit on her history knowledge by listening to Ashley Ashley is an advanced level education created called the behan citizens Tas already said that she learn [ __ ] was the first thing I okay before I let you before I let you go just so y'all understand Ashley created a thing called the behemon citizenship test where it's the only test that behem have ever voluntarily taken like online where ash ask us questions we all anwers like very communal no one gets them right only her and bamans who are at least 65 know the things that ashle know none of the rest of us know ashle has Advance if I need to know something bamian I call the for as because I don't know and a lot of bamian history is not like readily like available like you could just Google you need to know old Beman or be home where they could point you to some artifact you need to know old Beman or Ashley so please give us too much credit the national grade average is a d me and forign know no all them things Ashley talking about okay I want to talk to Ashley right now like so so so so so then there's a history then that of enslaved Africans from the Americas maybe going to the Bahamas to escape or no multiple multiple ways I think right both literally boths literally both ways so there was um there's a a village in nasau called gamb Village it was literally founded by fre the Africans man many of them would have been on their way to the Americas right so there's a there's there's um there is a deep history an interconnected history of of freed slaves going to the to the Americas and from and from and from the Americans into the Bahamas right so it's it's so much to learn there's so much to there's so many stories that can be told like black go like I I will always stand on this hill on this hill black American history is also behan history beian history black American history and and to and to not know one is to also not know the other you do yourself a disservice by not by not learning about Caribbean history and it's connectedness to Black American history because the same front lines a lot of y'all was on our grandparents our great grandparents standing right on we probably share ancestors that's what a lot of people way that and that's why so that's why it's so frustrating specifically the diaspora war between like black cbans and then like black Americans stupid man talking about a both size it's it it it's like hello same bus different stop and then when I when I had learned I don't I don't know very specific information like you do like where exactly but when I learned that hey New Orleans was a hub for a whole bunch of black free or slaves going toan that's what I learned the north isan you know what I'm saying yeah yeah my family is right I'm know not entirely sure if they're all gichi but right there so it's like every since moving out to like New York um I think a lot of it to what to was saying is like proximity black Americans just got to be open to like learning and realizing that we are ignorant like I'm group in California I did not come across a lot of black cariban people at all up until really up until I moved to New York and I moved to New York two years ago and now we're everywhere no the it's mostly in New York someone black people are usually of Caribbean AF yeah so when I'm I'm popping up and people are you know they're oh you're obviously TR you're triny you're obviously guy I'm like I don't you you would give you definitely would you do give guy right but I I yeah but right but at home that's not even in the like I you literally do not know the only people you're probably encountering I'm encountering like Ethiopian people and encountering some people that have like a parent or grandparent from the Caribbean but it's just not in in my close proximity so it's like a time to learn I was just a New Orleans you know what I'm saying people are like oh you're obviously your granddaddy was from out here I can see that so it but I I also got used to that traveling abroad and like being able to see and and experience oh there's so much diversity in the black experience and I think that is what gets lost we we're so like we no well we black marage we have culture we have culture you can simply just remind somebody that we do it doesn't have to be a war it doesn't have to be me that's perfect that's a perfect that's the perfect point because like I said I come from my parents were the first generation Americans so we grew up here but we grew up Haitian because we grew up in South Florida so everything you have everybody speaking creol there's going to be an area for people that everything is still Haitian you got Little Haiti you got different areas where Haitian gathered together so my first experience of Blackness outside of Haitian being Haitian because my church spoke cre all my friends in school spoke cre I was an interpreter we talked about this on previous episodes ATO so you know and people come up see it gets crazy because y'all they saying is y'all Jamaican Haitians have a different accent than the people in the Caribbean we got just different accent okay so they'll they'll be like okay so you speak French no no our colonizer SP French our language cre right like yeah that's I said they got French in it it's not French I don't speak French and I love my language and it's beautiful but I say all that to say my first experience with actual Blackness was when I went to Florida A&M University the number one HBCU in the nation but when I went to that school okay that University taught me so much about my blackness as a Haan um and me being in America like and I saw black people from all over the world World from the UK from Africa um from the west side I didn't know that there were like black girls from California like because my little Hub was just a little Haitian Hub my household we grew up Haitian so I when I saw that and then they taught me about what America taught me which they really didn't um about being Haitian or or Haitian history my dad gave me that history and it was also in the books that they taught me at FAMU where they made us unlearn what we learned in high school about the little things about um Caribbeans and stuff like that so I learned a lot about Black Americans that I loved and we got together and black people from the UK just all around the world and they're on the highest of Seven Hills in Tallahasse Florida um there we were able to really love on each other grow with each other it ain't no diaspora Wars at an HBCU but when you go out into the real world you start to go back into that and I'm so glad that I was able now I can acknowledge some of the things like I said all of our experiences I can say that the worst experience that I got bullied by a lot of people when I was younger having to fight all my life when I was younger um because I was Haitian and but I don't when I went to Fam I'm meeting a lot of people and we're just like dang you this this like how what was it like there like when you talk about South Carolina never would I have known they had an area there where they speak another language or or or still instill those those the history of where they came from there I would think it was just another southern little area but no so it was a lot of you know I I don't know the the internet does allow a lot of this struggle but I love to find out and educate myself on people Olay even Olay being from the Bahamas my experience with Bahamian people was not great growing up right um but meeting her understanding her struggle knowing that it's not different from a lot of my family struggle or whatever the case may be like it's just educating ourselves and choosing to educate ourselves and not keep not keep spreading the the division talking points right Haans decided in Mass to be anti- Bohemian they would be well within their rights like if they decided just based on on no no beans are it's factual it's not it's the whole Caribbean like I said that's what colonization does they want you they teach you to look down on Haitians and to hate Haitians because they want you they don't want you to look at the people who for their freedom yeah they don't want you to look at those in an inspirational way they don't want you to see yourself you know what I mean they want you to look down on those people and so Beman are Beeman Street hatian hati thought about this way it's treated as a slur like I always said people people I was bullied and mistreated my entire childhood because my daddy was African but they never call us African they were calling us Asians as like yeah damn Dam I think that this conversation made me realize that the power that white people have internationally is to will European kinship in a way that they're always able to protect them themselves hoard resources fight Wars it's like the United Nations in a lot of World War I World War II is fought out of a European kingship and them clicking up with different Europeans and being like hey we all agree we ain't Russians everybody in favor say ah okay Russians so so in my mind when we start talking about diaspora Wars It's really fighting at the way that we can uh uh structure African kinship throughout the globe and make it where instead of us thinking about and talking about K now we talking about uh [ __ ] I got a Texas flag you got a Bohemian flag ah you you ain't got no culture and for me it's really recognizing that the diaspora Wars and divide and conquer is really a white supremist invention or I'm really thinking about how like when I watch the remake of roots you feel me and you got k k over there you got a person that just got you know I'm saying captured and he like man it's something different about these Plantation born Africans basically it's like they're in a lost tribe you feel me when I was in high school I was in high school in in college I used to represent like lost tribe I was to get I'm lot that the other my point is though I think that there is a a intelligent design that make it where we don't get to talk about pan-africanism African kinship the solidarity you know I'm saying internationally because now we got to start talking about Bohemians vers Haitians vers UK versus black Americans versus all this and it make it where hey instead of us talking about how can we get to the cono how can we get to the sedan how can we get to over there and make you Hey listen man if they got all the Cobalt all the Cobalt and lithium over there and these corporations from America France and Israel is over there taking their [ __ ] we should be able to do something well we know us as black Americans we got that damn black passport they gonna do things that discourage us from literally using our kinship our resources our accessibility to helping people over there and I think that this conversation is is is is is is really a part of unpackaging how can we think globally and act locally like H P Newton said in a way that allows for us to really work for the political social economic liberation of all and not just thinking about the match signifi in America you just up a word a word real rap bars that's the final word [Music]
