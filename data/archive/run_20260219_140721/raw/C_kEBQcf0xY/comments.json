They began to talk about look about how they've worked in a bunch of different countries and how India has been foraging a path for technology right now. The guy turns to me and he's like \"you know the Indians they aren't the nicest people to work with\" and I was like ok fair enough, he continues \"they were occupied by Britain the same way The Bahamas was\" and in my mind I'm like occupied is a weird way of saying colonized and enslaved but I guess that's how we're wording it. And then this man dead ass looks me in the eye and is like \"they didn't exactly learn the same lessons that The Bahamians did\"(We are known for being very hospitable)\n🤨\nWhen I say I was flabbergasted, taken aback, bewildered. I didn't know how to respond. What does that even mean???? Like what????\n\n And the way I just had to smile and nod with that interaction because that's how we've been taught to do that in The Bahamas is wilddd!",

I think another perspective to consider, following Tahoe’s point, is that when speaking on negative/anti-black experiences with Black Immigrants in America, we are looking at a percentage of a percentage. Only a small percentage of the diaspora will make it to the USA, and even a smaller percentage will actually get visas and possibly citizenship. So when Black Americans see those who immigrated and gained wealth, power, etc and may also be attached to Anti-Blackness, we must recognize that it’s only a minuscule percentage of all Black Immigrants (who are also fed propaganda about Americans) and America is also always attempting to only allow in those they feel will comply to the elite interests.",

    "text": "I love your videos, you give me opportunities to reflect on generation trauma that has been prevalent in my family. Because when @msolurin said \"ppl who made that argument don't care. Because they're looking to move the goal post in order to diminish her.\" Because that's exactly what was my family's attitude was with my other family members for experiencing domestic abuse & sexual trauma. There's no such thing as a perfect victim. If ppl not going to attack the survivor of DV & ST for staying, then they'll attack them for not fighting back, for not going to get help etc. Forgetting that victims or survivors don't be believed for most of the time. \n\nSame was said to my family members. Who probably felt like they needed to stay because their abuser destroyed their confidence, their self-worth, they want to stay for their kids or that they lack support, etc. My family, most of the time, lacked that support for my other family members. They sat back & believed \"it's her or their fault.\" \"They must've wanted to stay.\" Yet they never tried to be the actual family they thought they was. Also making excuses for men who do abuse & then making others within the family think that what they do is okay. It's not okay to make excuses for men who hurt others but that's what we've been conditioned to do. Because it's either that or loneliness. That kind of fear doesn't translate well to women in comparison to men. Because men, historical, has always demanded for women's emotional, physical & sexual labor for the loosely threaded promise of safety. That was never going to be fulfilled in a grand scale. No one in my family was for each other. That became a fertile space for more abuse because no one would step in, even if you're a child. I think I said similarly in another comment under your video. I'm not sure. But because of this generational trauma, it denies the humanity & empathy needed for a family to be healthy & loving.",

    "text": "As a Haitian, I had so many emotions throughout this whole episode lmao but that last speech from Lee hit the nail on the head! End of the day, that’s what we need to do! A single black political party that is focused on just protecting all black wealth, culture, and heritage. Promoting all black businesses, positivity, and education. And projecting all black power, dollar, and consciousness to form our African Kinship. Take that and we can have our own system that literally intervenes on all levels for black communities and countries worldwide. \n\nNow this is assuming at least 85% of black america, citizen and immigrant, put their all into this party and an armed self defense force. Not only will we only vote for our own and elect only our own within our spaces so that we maintain control and the narrative regardless of what white America does nationally, but we will also have a security force that will defend our communities and be capable of deploying to wherever they are needed worldwide to physically protect black people. Heck, I’m a combat Marine Corps veteran. Put me on the team that takes it to the enemy to strike before they can even mobilize. \n\nAnyways, great episode. Looking forward to your other videos.

    "text": "I used to be an Umar fan back in college, I stopped messing with him when he went on that rant to Seti. I further stopped checking for him and started exposing how pseudo-intellectual he was and how much of a fraud he is when I found out he was scamming money from the community for a school that still hasn't been built and he started going off on people who really grill him about it i.e. Lord Jamar. You also can't find any credentials proving that he is a PhD. psychologist, but he calls himself Doctor. He likes to talk about the Black family and what caused the destruction of it and what it needs to fix it, yet he has 2-3 children by 2-3 different women. The problem with Umar is that he is such a hypocrite, and even after all his lies and scamming, there are still Black people that fall for the rhetoric. But I'm not shocked as long as it sounds good, Black people love believing anything someone has to say, whether it's in good or bad faith. This is why Umar likes the Breakfast Club because he can spew his BS without being challenged.",

But I am sitting with all that’s been said and learning and reflecting along the way. I pray that we both (black Americans and others throughout the diaspora) are able to decolonize internally and externally so that we can be in real deep community with one another 🙏🏽\nOnce again thank you all for this convo 🙏🏽♥️",

    "text": "Ask, how often is colorism used to minimize lighter skinned peoples relatable struggles and NEVER become more attention to darker skinned people's. It then turns into making them the mutual target to hate on for false ideas they have it SO much better.\n\nWhite people do not treat them white, and black people dont treat them as kin half the time (no pun). They do not get the same level of abuse on race, but they also dont get the same community to get through what they do face.\n\nAnd 100% its a scapegoat, stawman, and scarier still, that its like a pre-approved victim. Light enough for attention, but dark enough to not be vindicated and only used to perpetuate turmoil within a racial group so we dont focus on the harm, but instead how (usually black people) approach the issue of said harm (SA, DV, general violence, systematic discrimation, etc).",
