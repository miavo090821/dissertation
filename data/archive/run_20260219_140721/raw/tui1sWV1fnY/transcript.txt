it was devilish but it wasn't genius what they did they didn't create a new movement they took over the Republican Party he truly looked shocked at the words coming out of his M like he's like we may be in the gym doing the wrong workout like we're putting effort but it's the effort going toward the result of what we actually need to me the state the oligarchy the US is fascist it is a lot easier in this moment to look at Trump and Joe Biden and say wow these two are a little bit more similar than I thought people that's trying to figure thems out they don't they're not seeing what's going on around them cuz they're trying to figure their s out so you guys's voices definitely should be a lot [Applause] louder hello beautiful black people hello hey how you do let me tell you I've convened you here today I want to discuss the [ __ ] show of a presidential debate that we witnessed either in whole or in part the other night and I'll start by giving my quick little thoughts because I don't have too too much to say before I turn it over to the room I was not going to watch because I don't like to stress myself out for no reason and then I clicked on my I clicked on Twitter and the entire timeline was in shambles like I like shambles of just people like oh my God Biden's like he's running circles around Biden Biden looks dead I was like no man let me turn this on and I was like oh my God like listen yes was Trump lying pathologically lying being a crazy nut jaw white supremacist and you should still have every reason in the world not to want that to be president yes why yes but was Joe Biden doing an excellent job of appearing to be a living human being and orking any of those things I don't think so um and I know and I know everybody's really really mad at the moderator and yeah sure I think moderator should be factchecking and pushing back some more but I do think people a lot of people and I I get it I understand it it is really stressful to look at that scenario because that looks like Panic like the like I think what New York Magazine made their cover like Panic with Joe Biden I think if you're really stressed out or really scared of a potential Trump presidency watching Joe Biden like short circuit in real time make you panic and I feel like there were so many people wanting to beat up the moderator because they wanted to M like they wanted to like to me redirect their ey and like so many people were like oh he needs to pick up the spack slack for Biden he's not doing it for B I was like that's not what a moderator does one like that would be a person who's participating in the debate second I think we're forgetting what a debate is if you were adequately if you were performing at your best in a debate your answers like would serve as you being able to like sell yourself while debunking what the your opponent saying like Biden has like it's a people like so I'mma put it to the room from there y'all take it I I just want to jump starting and saying like as someone that identifies as an anarchist like I don't mess with a lot of mainstream politics I hate it I think it's disingenuine I think it's a pendulum swinging back and forth but I watch the debates because I like to know how things are being framed the discourse and one I think the biggest thing I mentioned this before the biggest thing that that's confusing to me is why was this debate the one that broke the camels back for like the Democratic party Democratic National Convention like why was this a signifier that Joe Biden isn't the right kind of candidate and then the other thing I'll jump in with the part of the debate that I had to rewatch like seven times was When Donald Trump called Joe Biden a weak Palestinian for not going more toe-to-toe against Israel I I don't know I I didn't even I didn't even see that that's crazy I I don't even want to pretend like I knew that cuz if I knew that that's nut I did not know that I mean there was so much though there was so much that just I mean you got to understand Donald Trump basically said that Vladimir Putin confessed the whole War to him the war in Ukraine nobody caught it nobody said a word I actually think Donald Trump was a little bit on his best behavior only because I think he was shocked at this Weekend at Bernie's show okay when Joe Biden was with the mouth open not able to finish a thought at that Remember When Donald Trump said I don't understand what he just said and I don't think he does either yeah that was the only true statement that he said in the entire debate no one what are you talking about it was absolutely crazy I um I differ a little bit when it comes to the m look Joe Biden there's no excuse for this you have to at least appear to be alive if the the bar is so low at this point you have to appear to be alive I understand people aren't happy with either choice but now it's a choice between living and you know medicated or something but I think why do we bother to have this mainstream organization with no color represented in asking the questions or deciding what the man tried to overthrow I have to put democracy and quotes because we know do we really have democracy anyway but he tried he's a treason treasonist and yet that was asked like two-thirds of the way in it was absolutely crazy but I don't know why you would give a debate was insane to a major news organization if all you're going to do is be zombies and I do think it's difficult if you asked us a question about this suppose I just started talking about Michael Jackson is that easy for you to keep steering the it was crazy it was crazy it was it was actually insane and that's the only credit I will give to Joe Biden seeming alive was he truly looked stocked at the words coming out of his like he like he literally was like I can't believe this [ __ ] the part where Joe Biden really looked Blown Away was when they asked about January 6 like something like you know what do you have to say to the people in the country you feel like you incited at and you incited like an interaction he was like he was like January 6 was very great the people the country was looked at really great he like he was like but now we're looked at like clowns like now because of him and Joe Biden was like yeah and I think he was just like incredulous like he just looked like he was being punked the whole time like he looked like he was being punked and then when he would talk Trump looked like oh [ __ ] this really is old as for real yeah that was the only time to me that it felt like Joe Biden was alive like the rest of the time I was like is anybody home um because it seems like nobody is up there but that part that answer even he didn't even really have a reaction when Trump called him a weak Palestinian he literally just looked it didn't move him but also like anti-muslim like racism is not that's not going to affect Joe Biden like that's a part of his like career as a politician yeah that's not gonna move him um it's not gonna it's not gonna shake shake him at all but what I've really been thinking about is how you know folks are really nervous about a trump presidency and I get that I I do but I also think that it's interesting how the left really concedes everything when there's a Democratic president looking at like the the last couple of years under a Biden presidency if if Donald Trump was in office right now in funding this war um in Palestine people would be I mean I don't I don't think we would ever be able to drive a car because highways would be blocked all the time but because it's Joe Biden there's a little bit of hesitancy to go hard it's a scarcity mindset around what we could and and can have it's nuts so I'm not saying that I hope Donald Trump wins but I am saying that there's pros and and cons to to each candidate um and we should be mindful of it yeah I think that's a really great point and yeah it just makes me think about like what people fear out of a trump presidency and how to me is like I've heard a lot of leftists say like oh if Trump wins it'll be easier to organize against him and I think that kind of is maybe just some of your point about like the visible xenophobia and aggression and militarism versus Joe Biden who's more of a career politician right and kind of like spin it to you perform it to you so I think that's a great point I actually think that's what would make it not advantageous right because like especially on the issue of Palestine in my entire life up October 7th and now the time we are in is the only time in my life that people You' have been able to see people support palestin Palestine in Mass like say it loud like that has not been like not even just not a popular position an unallowed like a dis banned position like you don't hear it you don't see it right and now you see like this this uh this rising of the opposite and I think because we have a Biden and you're able to see that still now it at least what it it will be it's sustained in terms of a real moral position like if Trump were president people would even if everybody was just as outraged and doing all the things that they're doing to oppose Palestine what would happen is when they got Trump out of office or whenever what's currently happening now they would pretend as though it was just a part of people opposing Trump and they would downplay like the ra like what it actually means right like the radical shift in people being pro Palestine and like speaking out against like s settler colonialism and all these different things so I think it actually the fact that this rises even now with a democrat in office even if it's still like the Liberals and the neoliberals and whatever still don't want to hear that [ __ ] the fact that you still see this la like this large of the laugh to is still the people who would be voting who are typically voting and on this side or whatever and voting uh Democrat and all that I think that will make it like I think that legitimizes it in terms of what the movement ra is rather than just getting because that's what they've done right when like 20 everything with like black lives matter everything with policing everything that happened during the Trump now they pretend as though that was just a moment and people didn't really whatever get it and they use like what they're doing legislatively to pretend as though that it the people you know change and the people don't support it anymore whatever and that was just cuz in the moment to like support to oppose Trump so that's that's my take on that I think we have to remember too that it's not just you know APAC um the pro-israel pack who is going after candidates like Jamal Bowman defeating that Progressive Cory Bush will be next um but the Democratic party is trying to suppress this speech when we look at what happened on the college campuses who do you think shut down that speech and and then told us and lied to us that there was this Mass ATT given to and what he Wasing with the college protesters Eric Adams and Democrats were doing the same thing you yeah they had a ladder going into a window and moving I mean what are you doing this is a bunch of college kids who I thought that's what college was about him not advocating for violence or people who are you know Fringe but what they told us was going on was not going on and members and a wing of the democratic party does want these Progressive to shut up about Gaza and shut up about Palestinians because it's not making it easy for us to get elected you know if not now when yeah you you know you're absolutely right and that's what I thought when the college protests were happening I'm like I know I associate college with protesting you know what I mean like like that's what I associate it with like when I think of college Prince but Prince and I went to college together and Prince was the main ones doing all the protesting I was at not at none of them I was an international student immigrant I'm like Prince D my immigration Prince that about the the US encampment protests and to your point L about uh like uh 2023 in October being like a major flasho like when we were in college 2014 to 15 was my senior year and I remember I was in student government and my friend who was student Senate President dumped a bucket of fake blood on herself bring that up and responded to the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge from our University president and advocated for Palestinians and advocated for boycott divest and sanction and she received hundreds of thousands of death threats had the FBI come to her she was advised to go basically into hiding got thrown under the bus by the university got accused of being anti-semitic and so to your point it's interesting for me like that 10 years ago was my flash point where I was learning like okay there's this uh conflict like people are talking about it but I don't think people really understand and so one I will say from then to now to your point the mass understanding of like colon aary and then it's interesting to look at's happing now I think one of the reasons I can theorize why Biden isn't really reaching people is in some ways I think Biden is the backlash to a trump presidency and what people are expecting is for Biden to stand up for humanism to be uh a clear opponent to Trump to be that enemy that the American public can invest in and what we've received is a crumbling economy numerous genocides uh an old man that isn't able to really speak to what needs to happen which is a ceasefire which is like more legislation which is actual humanitarian Aid not a shitty Port that is built and can only deliver five boats a day of eight and so I do think in terms of like the timeline of how things have gone we're seeing a failure of this attempt by the left by the Democratic party to to to sell a healing to us and I think that is like what was kind of exposed I I mean I think it kind of goes to uh to point that was mentioned earlier about um about how the left concedes so much I think when Trump won like even for me I wanted student loans being taken away and if it would have happened I would have been in that ballot for Biden and so I I think it's also about our personal investment and what our personal issues are and then what is our Collective strategy because if our government isn't going to demand a ceasefire how do people other than college students and Palestinians demand to cease fire and so I think it's also like the question of like if the party can't for healing how do we demand it on a mass Collective level I'm not going to act like I'm the extreme politics guy because I'm not that I thought he was going to Old subject but I feel like my biggest thing when it comes to like like Biden I feel like his constant state is like he's buffering like I always feel like he's in a buffering State it's like he's on a 5sec delay and we're already on live TV yeah and like and it's tough and it's like Trump is like the guy that like you don't like him but you respect his gangster and it's like yo like I don't like you but you know what I want and you keep on leveraging what I want but I don't like you and I wish like B be somebody could give me what I want and the tough part about it is like I'm Jamaican Jamaican culture like sometimes I just rap the gangster this like I be like yo like I feel like Trump be want to say blood clout all the time he just don't like you know what I'm saying like to me like that's how it come off like like he just moved that way and we just as as much as we look at like image wise America we've always seen us to be an image a certain way and the way that he like Guan make us feel like like I just wish like you had the blue tie on but you was moving like that like and I think that's how I see it I think where I'm kind of at with um I guess what I expect from governments or or politicians especially like the federal government especially at this time with what especially with what Biden is actively doing or funding with Israel but for me sometimes less is more like I don't expect to me politicians are not who create change right it's not like even on the ground right it's organizers and local people and they and they create organizations and movements and they do all the work around it and they eventually get some Congressman to like sign off and right but all the heavy lifted and actual work is done by organizers and people right so like politicians too much really right so how I see it is when people see like you know oh I rather like Trump is alive and Joe Biden is dead and I think that's fair I think those are fair characterizations Trump is alive wanting to do extreme [ __ ] you know what I mean like Joe Biden is dead and mostly disappointed me not accomplishing the things that you want and doing a lesser scale of the extreme [ __ ] that uh uh Trump is doing so I guess like from I to I guess to bring it all back around to Prince's original point was why is this the moment that for for people like why is this presidential debate making them go oh we should have somebody else when you know the left and the people were saying that from longer like give them somebody else but Biden because not for nothing to what Cheeto said Biden's been buffering this whole term like Biden is looking dead the whole time I I think I think Trump represents an existential threat to both the US and the Democratic party which is why they're trying to go so hard but that to me is confusing because I'm like I don't know I just think the fact that Trump is even running again I'm like why would the fact that it's possible for him to even run again when he has dozens of felonies against him and and and I'm supposed to like believe what the Democratic party might want to present as another option I feel like that's also the thing where I'm like it doesn't make sense yeah yeah I mean I think one I think I don't think Donald Trump should be president but I do think somebody with a felony could baby be president in the future and it'd be fine considering like systemic [ __ ] we all know that happens that's kind very American to be honest yeah what I think is what I think I've been playing around with with like different organizers and folks is the messaging about the threat under liberalism and then the threat under fascism and one of them feels a lot better one of them feels like a lot a safer a less painful death and I think what's happening is there's a there's a fear around the painful death death under fascism the college students at Colombia just would have been shot down right they just would have been shot and it would have been done under liberalism they go through these institutions that are up to to somehow like kill them whether it be socially whether it be their academic careers but these are all institutions that people feel comfortable with they feel comfortable seeing the police attack a bunch of students because historically that's what happens under liberalism they feel comfortable like seeing folks be threatened with a uh a Rico in Atlanta um through stop cop City because they feel comfortable with the legal system so there's this like thing around legality um and what feels good to people what they've always seen in a quicker immediate death and I think the left has to get much more clear about this threat under liberalism the threat of Joe Biden it is different than the threat of trump but it still is a threat it still is a way that we die and it sounds scary but it's the truth people want to feel good when they're on their way to death they don't want to be scared they want to smile yeah but the question also becomes now is like so do we want to just like slowly die in our consumerism while we feel like life is just fine or when we see Trump doing it like now we're more attentive towards it I'm more from the belief of like I kind of want to know what I have to deal with and know like this death is in front of me instead of just like like prime example like we're still eating the bad food at our aun funeral after she passed away from eating bad food like do we constantly stay in that same space of knowing it's killing us little by little and so that's the part I guess the fear is we're going to die anyway so I guess the question is how are we going to die and for some people they don't really care for me it's like America has its date and we know it's getting closer and closer the world that we know and we grew up on doesn't exist anymore like the internet we even get to like us making like if caveman made fire the internet get to oven yet like we still kind of in the cave when it comes to so when the internet gets to that space the world economy everything I think it's not just us it's how we're seeing toward the world because eventually the world's going to sit at the table with us and then that's get scary I think yeah I I if I can jump in I I think like this question about like the slow death or the more immediate death also makes me think about the dichotomy between um uh reform and Liberation uh assimilation and Liberation and I think to your point about like the slow death or the more immediate death I think if we're more invested in liberalism or a certain kind of survival under capitalism um we're going to want to be comfortable in the meantime before things change few Generations like Hue Newton or revolutionary suicide or immediate which like our goal is Liberation and if it's Liberation we have to be clear about what politicians are complicit in genocide what it means to hoard wealth what it means to have um a political system sold to you that is built on overp policing or genocide and when you're more invested in Liberation you're willing to like give up a lot more Comfort or privilege or whatever it is like your placement in the system and I think this is what's interesting that like for black people that are looking at the debate like there was a moment in there where Trump was basically trying to sell to black people like these Hispanics are coming in and stealing our jobs and so to to the point of like the slow or the fast death we're being propagandized to and and I'm even thinking of a specific Moment Like a few years ago I did this artist residency and I was talking to my black friend who grew up in Cleveland with me black woman and she was like I like when Trump was President because black people got a break and so I think there's this conversation that we need to have with each other about to to the point about like the gangster or what looks cool and like but at what what is our point of intervention I think is like another way of looking at it what do you know like can you li wish she buy a break or I don't me she said she said Trump was worried about the people at the border worri about criminals and like I got my check our people got our checks and I was like girl the what about all these police murders that happened what about the [ __ ] hole country so I think she was much more ined like they convinc the oppressed to hate the oppressed right like they convince you it's the same way you see it doing and like you like like what Eric Adams does in New York City right Eric Adams has made Eric Adams has cut the budget seven times since that he's been in office is he's done it repeatedly he's cut all social services but he's raised nypd's budget he's found money to make Rec by what he's called like what never before seing uh deals for the NYPD and XYZ but he's telling people now suddenly you see in the last year suddenly there's a migrant crisis and it's the migrant's fault that he's cutting all these different things for us right and so what people is they come to hate each other instead of of of the actual system and I guess like this is something I think about a lot right because like I'm an I'm an abolitionist right I'm somebody who like wants to close Rikers right but I still believe in the movement to decarcerate Rikers to get there right and like I've had conversations with people like I remember when I first started advocating for Riker's receivership right for them to uh turn it over so we could slow down to death or whatever and would naturally revert now this is still on the plan to close Rikers and I remember there were people who support that Advocates on the ground and organizers who didn't want to vocally support it because they thought that it would be interpreted to people as meaning you don't want to close Rikers like if I support any of the efforts to decarcerate it like that someh implicitly buys into wanting it open or something and the thing that I I always have to remember and I guess for me is sure I could I could be like I just the only thing there's nothing to talk about the only thing you could do is close Rikers I'm not going to advocate for nothing else I'm not going to try to figure out anything else to do because I want to take the I don't I don't want to risk anybody think I'm not on the side of of absolute like Revolution Liberation close this whole whole thing and then people die record deaths or whatever at at Rikers right like something I guess when I was a a public defender what I would made me see it a little differently than I would see it and because I would see it differently if I hadn't been a PD like when you see numbers if you see like okay if I saw numbers but I would haven't ever worked with people and I saw like okay 16 people died or whatever or 30 people died or three people died or how many people died in in the course of me only insisting on this thing and not trying to do anything else it's like okay by the grand virt of the numbers but when I was an attorney I would look at it like if I had a client in Rikers like let's say I had seven clients in Rikers and I got six out that one last person there I was a person who was calling me who I know is a real person like I am stressed you know what I mean about that and I have to get that that last person out so I don't feel don't personally feel comfortable with taking the position of I can't talk about any any re any reform things or things that are you know in the middle uh in order because I don't want that to be the antithesis of abolition but I will say this what I think is the difference is are you in are you are you uh advocating for something that divests or or or reinforces right so like to me that's the standard it's like all right I want to eliminate cash bill I want to this I'm not going to be someone that's like Les get more training for police or whatever or whatever expans so that's the that's the standard that I have in like removing the power of the state reducing the state's capacity to intervene on our lives and exactly and the way that kind of like functions for me in terms of the elections is I always see is how much work the people on the ground have to do like how much work it becomes like when narratives take form when narratives take hold and what y'all were saying earlier about how liberalism can make people become their comfortable with the violence of the police with the protesters especially now like you see in 2020 this to you know what I mean videos videos like you could if you the longer you see something horrific the longer you see extreme things the the less it becomes that and so then the people on the ground are always always like pushing this Boulder of trying to like minimize trying to move us further to the left to left to Liberation to progression right and every time that we become we move right to a more extreme world like a Trump World in 2016 created so much more work to move us back to decency and so when people start feeling like they they think a Biden is a is a left you know what I mean or whatever have you or they see these uh uh so my my fear sometimes with when when we keep letting the rights get more and more power we see more and more extreme uh right like it's harder to me it's more it becomes more work for you trying to move it there and you don't even realize that you're still sitting still you know what I mean like I feel like it's easier for me to keep trying to like discourse and move us to worldway if you see Biden as a villain if if I can show you that uh this live with the problem is with neoliberalism I could show you why the Democrats aren't this I could show you that I'm moving you so much further left but to move to to tell you why a trump is bad or whatever like it does it's not as hard to convince you it's not as hard to convince you but I'm actually not moving you as further as I would like you're moving you're just kind of staying in the center of like that's why still that's why so many people so many of the like liberals and neoliberals were so happy to get a Biden you know what I mean because they were like oh same let's get let's I love the status quo you know what I mean they like when you hear them you don't hear them say oh I wish we lived in a more Progressive America we lived in a different America they go oh I wish it was how it was I I hate I hate like how much has changed I wish I like I I missed the days of yester years where poit politics was normal and by prodution and blah blah blah that's what they say so I I just think Trump the more further we let these crazy nut ass right-wing characters be around and normal the more the nation gets desensitized and it's you know but that's to y'all it's a distraction too you know what I mean like the more like you said a few minutes ago about teaching us to you know hate each other at this level so we're not paying attention to everything that's going on over there and so I think that you know we I think we too have to remember to with these crazy rightwing and Maga and this and that it it was devilish but it wasn't genius what they did they didn't create a new movement they took over the Republican party which already had the infrastructure in place to do whatever they wanted to do and I just think we talk a lot about how desperate we are in this circumstance but I just think there's a lesson for us there take over structure that's in place and impose your will you know and easier said than done but we outnumber and I think we outthink them and if we could ever wrap our heads around look what the Tea Party did they it's the same Playbook it's just over and over over again and I wish that we could figure out a way to avoid the divide and conquer and say okay we got the numbers let's take over a structure that's already there and and do what we have to do well I think people try like we've got the aoc's we've got the jamals we have Jamal and then and then we have APAC and then we have like other forces we've got more moneyed people and this isn't about a lack of organization and a lack of strength and trying this is actually to me about the Democratic party and the Republican Party being aligned in their missions so I don't know if there's a if there's a takeover of the democratic party I'm unsure that that's a viable strategy I actually think that having like a a I think the bipartisan system is something that doesn't work and I think the only viable strategy is a third party option and a complete abolishment of the of of a bipartisan system it just literally doesn't work and I think like and to your point about organizers working hard you know I I've been organizing since I was young like super young in high school I was telling somebody today I'm at the southern Summit in Durham um that I feel old as hell all the time even though I'm 26 um and I've been organizing for a while but I think that for me and talking to people and organizing people that are maybe apolitical or just like you know they pop up when they hear something funny about the debate it is a lot easier in this moment to look at Trump and Joe Biden and say wow these two are a little bit more similar than I thought they are so similar on the genocide they are really similar in their anti-immigration policies and their rhetoric like these two people are very similar so I think we are pulling people further to the left um but in my personal experience I think it's a bit easier to pull people to the left in a in a when there's a person in president and when there's a person in the presidency who is a little bit more explicit um and direct with their like racism and xenophobia and all of those things because we can name it and we can see it now the effects of those things like it's hard and it's tough and it's hard work but but when I think about a cultural shift and a social shift and people feeling more empowered to take a stance and do something and in my experience the the common person that's not super politically engaged feels more empowered and ready to take action because they can see their enemy people don't look at Joe Biden and see an enemy they don't so when we try to have a conversation about Joe Biden and what he is and what he's done they don't want to hear that [ __ ] at all they don't want to hear it and that's from older black folks that's from people that are you know moderates that are right in the middle that's from even people on the left it's been heartbreaking the way people have been silent over the last couple of years and we can we can use this moment as an example Joe Biden has been the president for these years and like the the left has been trying but it's hard to drag people when they happy with what they got and they feel a little bit safe I think it's like a chicken or egg sort of thing like it's it's tough It's like the devil you know it's like goes back to like that whole like would you rather the devil that you know and I think a lot of times that's the issue is like people are want to get back to the devil that we know and so many times like once again I'm not the biggest political person but I constantly feel like we constantly confuse like movement with progress like just because things are moving doesn't necessarily mean that it's actual progress and I think what happens is we get caught up in how it how it feels emotionally vers than actually like what it actually is and when I travel to Country and I do different shows it's like I see a different America every state line I cross like when I'm in New York I'll be like oh now we good then I start getting in the middle of America I'm like whoa ho ho ho and I get to Cali I'm like okay they're not like us but it it creates and then I realize we all have a different perspective based on what we're actually seeing too many times we live on the internet and we constantly forget that everybody has their own Wi-Fi in their house and when they step outside that house they live a different reality and that's where that vote is being casted from it's from the reality they get when they step out their house not the reality they constantly see on that screen and I think that's where the traditional part goes back to people wanting the devil that they know because progression sometimes is only on the internet some people don't have that progression outside their house yeah yeah and and I um oh phone I wait not the house phone that's a house phone over that's buzz into my building my apologies no but what you to what you were saying and I guess building off um of what Delaney was saying I guess the reason why yeah I think sure it's easier to get PE I think it's easier to get people to appear to be on the left with me like it's easier to get people to attend the protest with you when they see George Floyd and they will say the things with you they will hold the sign that says they understand it's about the system and systemic this and y y but what they're really protesting is like like like what they're seeing the absurdity of like like the the more extreme event right like that they're seeing this video they're not protesting the over policing that leads to George Floyd's deatha they're not truly protesting the system and so what I think is like they're protesting a shift in their status quo yeah I think like yeah sure it's easier to like point it's always easier to sell people on The Smoking Gun that's why you want the Smoking Gun right or C catch people right red-handed like uh a Donald Trump but the thing is if people never if all they see is the examples of these things that they buy into is the extreme version they love to buy into the idea that's this extreme version and Donald Trump so that they can dismiss the rest of it right and like it like we're required to truly do the work of like pointing out what's covert like I always like I lived in when I moved to America I lived in Florida then West Virginia then Ohio then New York right and West Virginia and Ohio who is trying to come to my house hold on one second y'all who's just one second I'm so I never been to West but I heard they got some good don't go to West Virginia just okay well is is the South classified as the Dirty South I just had to I no South Carolina is South Carolina the Dirty South no the Dirty South is like Mississippi like down down I'm in the like North Carolina is the South South Carolina's the South okay Georgia Mississippi Louisiana okay no it was a group chat debate and I was just wondering I was just kind of like group chat debate listen I'm in New York so to me I'm like once I hear pety Pablo I think that's the South but that's just my opin that's crazy pety Pablo is from North Carolina and also you know pety poo everybody's cousin in North Carolina too he my cousin I need you to know I I know 10 people right now I can call all of them would be like that's their cousin and in North Carolina I don't know why I don't know why but he said he everybody cousin his family's in yeah okay cousin pety listen I ain't Cousin P I'm a city boy so I just I listen I don't I where do you live in New York I live in the Bronx oh okay I live down the street from o for like a year and a half two years in New York who's worried about youen use her s attacking Raheem she's I need her out my house anyway you can't get I'm following the storyline I'm sorry I'm like people that keep telling you that you're an animal abuser if you get rid of making she's ruining like like significantly Bringing Down the quality of my life like I need you to understand that well you need to sacrifice it that's what them white people told you so she's so bad like her prison is getting here tomorrow up l p and she's going in it I'm sick of her ass wow she's so wow so bad so what I was going to say is I lived in Florida West Virginia Ohio and then New York and while the racism was like overt like more overt like easier for me to tell you the stories or whatever in West Virginia or Ohio to convince you but the racism the covert racism like going to New York like when I went to my Queen St John's Long Island I've never experienced to me more harmful more psychologically harmful real gatekeeping barriers just like real up situations than being in New York and it's harder to say and and the reason why it's able to function and the reason why it's able to be so harmful is because it can hide you know what I mean because you're forced to be in a position of trying to convince people that it's happening and explaining it to to people and I feel like when people keep seeing they they have no problem with making the clansmen the racist you know what I mean okay the the burning cross is this this that but when you try to tell them about the racism you experience in your day-to-day life what's happening in schools yeah they don't want to hear that [ __ ] they don't believe it they don't want to hear no microaggression and your you're constantly in that position and I think it becomes it becomes more and more difficult right like I think yeah it's a lot more work it feels easier it feels easier but I don't think the progress is as real you know when you're convincing them based on the like the video the extreme C like okay someone died here somebody is somebody said here somebody did this somebody did that but meanwhile all this other thing so um but to Delany to to delany's point what she was saying um I guess to Delany and Sharon's point about because I think Jamal Bowman is a perfect example of what yall talking about because we do have like the Working Families party and people trying party did on the left and I think doing it really really successfully in a place like New York like we have a lot of different Progressive politicians that you know I like or do good things but then to what Delaney is saying is like a we got a Jamal Bowman but and and to what everybody's saying I guess about the establishment and what the problem is with the Democratic party what the DNC does is the redistricting you know the redistrict they they and it's an understated part of the discussion Jamal lost for two reasons two primary reasons uh the redistricting and a pack dollars so they drew his district to pretty much take out the Bronx so think about it Jamal Bowman virtually won almost all of the Bronx in 2020 and still almost all of what was left of the Bronx in his district in uh 20124 now think about this in 2020 he won like that was like 20,000 something votes getting the Bronx this year he still won the majority of Bronx and it was like 6,000 votes that's how much they took out of his district so so it's not that he lost his voters so like his voters changed on him like they're trying to create it's APAC sinking in a then APAC comes in and spent more money APAC is a is a Israel pro-israel Lobby that uh function is to ensure that the US continues giving Aid to Israel forever more they uh they sunk in more money than they have ever put into any Congressional race in their history more than $17 million they put in to to sync Jamal Bowman so that they could create the messaging that this happened because of his anti-israel position meanwhile it's like that's not what happened they drew all his voters out of the district and then they flooded New York in anti him ads and so that I guess like that that's where I fall in the middle of exactly what y'all are saying right Sharon and Del is like yeah I agree like they should we should do this like try to take it over this infrastructure and you see the people like the Working Families do it and do it really well but then what do you do when ultimately you have your Democrats the DNC as a machine to what D is saying APAC and all this working against them because APAC is not even though yes this is farri money or a right-wing Lobby in some to some degree they fund candidates on Democrats and Republicans all throughout Congress right like this this it was Democrats like Hillary Clinton and all these different um Dems coming out to do not support Jamal Bowman the incumbent like they would usually pretend like oh they have to do they're not supporting the incumbent but they're supporting George ladimer because that's who apack is behind so I don't know I say all that just to give the information I don't know what that means about what I feel about any of can you go you go just like being in the like I can honestly tell you like he was everywhere like every corner like I mean like his poster was next when I was getting my big NE cheese in the morning like it was as advertised as it is like I mean it but I think it's difficult because like I didn't I wouldn't know that like I this conversation make me realize I to be more present on this end in my community and understanding like what's taking place from political standpoint because I see these things and I see it taking place but I don't understand the ramifications of them and like knowing that and knowing I have a voice in my community is like that's something that I should show up for you know what I'm saying that's something that we should have a conversation about amongst our people because we are in a more unified front it's just that sometimes we don't know like we may be in the gym doing the wrong workout like we're putting effort but it's the effort going towards the result of what we actually need and I think some people don't show up to the gym but some people are there but now we have to be on the same Accord to understand what are we trying to actually get done and I think um yeah I'll take that on the chin like it's something that really really needs to be better like as as a Bronx the gy that was that was a bar that was really good the gym yall are figuring it out naturally Cheeto is a poet like is a regular thing that's why I just wanted to say one thing just about like cultural shifts I think I'm struggling right like in this conversation I'm I'm struggling with you know what happens under uh more overt like fascist re regime and like what happens under a liberal one but I think that defund the police and that slogan was a huge cultural shift yeah it was nuts I think like right now if you're friends with a cop people are like Boo like don't come around me there was I don't know if y'all watch those um those little balloon YouTube videos where they popped the came up the guy was like hey what's up y'all and the lady's like what do you do and he's like I'm I'm I work for the Sheriff's Office pop pop pop what I'm saying is that before 2020 I think you know black people had a 12 sort of energy but I I don't think that it was it was like cool to be like you know cops I think right now it's like no never like I would never I would never date a cop I would never have a cop as a friend and that came out of 2020 and this like incredible cultural shift and from my point of view I think that a cultural shift is what makes space for organizers to do the work of building organizations getting Buy in and then moving towards policy changes and getting politicians to buy in but we have to have these cultural trigger moments for people to believe in something and that and so we need these extreme moments in my opinion these trigger moments to just just have like a shift in the cultural dialogue and I'm not seeing that happening except for around Palestine right now with Biden it it rarely happens it's it's very hard to get to have a trigger moment when people are so happy with the crumbs that they're receiving under liberal like presidencies and it's tough and I I wanted to add in um to to to a lot of what we've been saying about like going into the system and establishing a place in it or how do we deal with a more Progressive or liberal Administration versus one that's more fascistic I I'll say this like um as an anarchist and like someone who's done like a lot of Blacklock work a lot of anti-fascist work for me in my lifetime that came up around 2016 with Trump and kind of the more overt understanding that this is a fascistic candidate he's racist he's xenophobic XYZ and I feel like what a lot of that work taught me is that this to me the state the oligarchy the US is fascist no matter if it's the Democratic party Republican party something in between because it operates to give us a representation of democracy not a direct democracy and then that representation operates to lie to us to subjugate us and to sell us some version of a future and so doing that anti-fascist work what I always kind of return to is that for me anti fascism requires that we know the point of intervention and from my standpoint no matter what who is in office the state is fascistic so that is a point of intervention and I'm thinking of like going to Tulsa Oklahoma visiting where the race riots were and maybe this isn't fully connected but there is a preacher there that said for the enslaved African the ultimate emancipation was death and I'm not advocating that we all jump towards revolutionary suicide but it is the question of like if we're resisting the state like if Trump wins that just means we're going to have to be much more ready for very overt o o repression and authoritarianism which is going to require more subversive organizing if Biden wins we also need to be just as hard against the state because we have to bring what's visible to the point of contradiction we like and I think that's kind of one way I look at like what a cultural shift is it's when people make a visible like contradiction I think that's what 20120 was it's a covid-19 panic we're stuck at home and still black people are getting killed and you have to in your house and watch it yeah that's a that's a when you brought that up it made me think about Black Panther and it always sticks in my mind I'm like kill M just sitting there like yo I'd rather be in the ocean with my ancestors and it it all it makes like doesn't always have to be to that extreme um even during like the black lives mattera movement I had like a very very interesting space because like my family has rental property so I'm in there like painting and trying to get ready for a new tenant but then my people are outside and they're protesting I'm having my moments and I'm like am being revolutionary by like trying to generate generational wealth by keeping this the house where it needs to be instead of being outside and sometimes like the right move isn't as sexy it isn't as like I think so many times America follows the blood so much it's like it's an action movie we always want the dopamine hit we always want the thing that looks good or that's shocking when sometimes like like I was writing this poem and I say more people would be free if they didn't need their slave master to see them run away like so people to SED like we want to run people like like a lot of us can walk away from this but walking away doesn't feel as exciting it doesn't and that means just a tactical stepbystep movement to what it looks like because it has been done speaking are you kind of speaking to like how people do organizing and Grassroots work outside of the movement moments the spectacles yes to yes to a certain extent yes that's tough I just want to say that's tough I think there yeah I think I think I I feel like I get what you're saying and I also think we should have another conversation about generational wealth and what that actually means and that and if that's like if that's a liberatory tool I think that's something that we could talk about not now but I think it's something worth worth talking about I I guess you know I guess when I think I guess it depends on what head I'm thinking of right like if I'm thinking of my as a media commentator if I'm thinking as an organizer or if I am thinking as a lawyer or what have you right because I guess like my mind changes like I think there is a lot like from a media perspective I find that first of all I think is a media in general like if I take out having any concern about advocacy or black people or revolution or anything I think for a lot of media in general a trump presidency is good because drama you know what I mean it is drama people are outrage people this because what Delan is saying right it is get it is easier to get people mobilized about around what they see as a Clare white supremacist threat or whatever have you right um so there is that and I and I and I think there's some of that but I guess in terms of like organizing work or advocacy work in in that sense I find sometimes that attention is the worst thing that that that can happen to to organizers on the ground I find that the most of the change that happens like all the good things that I really think like that get done right like there are a bunch of different uh uh organizations now uh Nationwide doing things to get like um people's like phone calls me to make phone calls free right like where I'm thinking like work Rises and different organizations or unlock the Box in California trying to do things around solitary and whatever have you and some or even like the drug policy Alliance and then sometimes what happens is they get to they're quietly able to do so much good work like they go do the work in the community they quietly get so much [ __ ] done and what'll happen is some too much attention will get on it one day on some negative and they don't have the ability to like fight that and drown with how that affects what they were doing on the ground right so so to me I think about it like I've been on the I've been on the on phone calls with lots of different politicians who have talked to me about different different things I've either been against publicly or some law or some policy or to help support a a policy or something that uh that an organizers on the ground were doing and I'm able like and these are the most frustrating phone calls in the of on earth right you feel like you're trying to tell people Jesus Christ like all the reasons why this is wrong whatever ask 100 things and you could get a little something but what I've never been is on the phone what a republican you know what I mean trying because they don't give a [ __ ] about right what I'm like what we're saying what we want they can't be shamed they're impenetrable I think a lot of uh Democrats or people on our side don't do no necessarily do things because they're good or anything like that or whatever but they can be shank and shame them more effectively I at least speak to a lot of what Their audience is right like I think of like a DC crime when the crime Bill happen like I immediately ended up on the phone with some of the people who were who were legislating that and explaining to them why this this this is and the next thing why this is the worst version of this why this could happen why this and you at least get a little bit somewhere versus Republicans when Republicans see I think like I'm in Ronda santis I was in one of Ronda Sis's campaign videos when he was still running uh explaining why he's the devil right and he heard that and he thought that was good you know what I mean like that's what they they see think about what the right is they see us hating them us fearing them as owning us you know they love it like they're literal supremacists they're bigots whatever and so it's like I feel like we can't get anywhere with them so when I think of like I guess I think about it for the or the organizers that in my mind nobody knows that don't have the platform they do so much [ __ ] they're so they're so influential in their Community they're the ones like creating the things that like I might talk about or give some attention some positive attention whatever but they're the ones doing it they never have the ability they don't they don't have the like V the vocal ability to like fight these things when it gets too much attention and so that's why I don't like like a a trump Administration or the right-wing or when they get a hold of things because it to me it becomes like impossible for them to move on the ground it's easier for me to move as a media Advocate as a media Advocate I'd be rolling like Trump's admin like oh like in terms of why this is wrong out there but in terms of what they be trying to do I'd be like damn you between a may be so I guess I don't know you know what I mean I hear what everybody I I hear what everybody's saying that's the thing is like I think every body is right like I think you're I think you're right like I think you're right Del lady I think you're right Shar I think you're right I I I think everybody's right I just I don't be knowing what it means that we do you're right about the attention I mean damn yeah yeah I mean I guess I take that intentional kill [ __ ] like the drug policy Alliance like when they were doing they were they had a big role ination yeah yeah Prince yeah uh I guess to bring that up again I think about it in terms of uh are we doing organizing or or Grassroots work that is adjacent to the state aligned with the state's like intentions or functions or are we doing work that goes against that and I feel like one way I look at that is like legibility and and for me at least if I'm opposing fascism I'm not going to try and like I'm GNA maybe like try and pass a bill or like have an above ground strategy where people fight it and go to city council and XYZ but you're going to need people in your neighborhood that know about the next uh uh KKK rally that's happening or the next protest against a drag queen who's reading in a library who's going to show up who's going to do security who's going to make sure that people in the neighborhood are safe when these fascists or whoever come in and so I guess I think about it in terms of legibility and what our goal is and for me since I guess I'm speaking of words like screw this system like my my work I think ideally will always be tied to the more subversive underground stuff because that's what's going to help us survive whatever kind of administration we have just like with like reproductive health or carer it or XYZ it's like we always need that underground structure that's going to help us survive Beyond this system yeah I okay my bad yeah no I was just gonna I agree I think like you know everybody has their work everybody has their work I don't think that like for example I have no interest in talking to cismen about misogyny I don't want to do it that's not my work I'm not I'm just not going to do that not going to put myself in that situation in that position I I just I think it's nuts um I think we I think everybody has their work and it's all important I don't think that we can concede power on any level at all ever um but I think what we're raising is when we're talking about at least a presidential election we're talking about Federal politics did my thing freeze it's been doing that over and over again it it's fine it does but it is recording locally okay yeah no I was going to say um when we're talking about Federal politics there's like a when we're talking about power that's actually what that's I think that's actually what what we're talking about like this like tension is about power and if we're saying that Trump and Biden are are similar and are aligned in more ways because of what Prince said that they're all oligarchs and this is all one big thing with two different faces then are we it feels like we could be wasting our time talking about their differen in when it's like the same power source yeah and we actually should be having a conversation about how to raise and build a different power source rather than like pretending like these two people are being sustained by a different group and a different source of power if I if that makes sense yeah you make you make complete sense it's like I remember when I was younger like and I want to play the game so much my brother would just give me a controller but I plug it in so it made me feel like I'm playing the game but I'm really not so at times you have to wonder like how many times are we getting the controller and we not actually playing the game but and it's the illusion of power like doesn't feel like you have power because anytime it works in a dynamic like you know there are people that think the boss and then there's the actual boss yeah and I think there's two things I been read a lot of Marcus Garvey and like the concept of like going like yeah that's the that's the OG OG but the concept of just like can we ever ever really like change a system that's designed like this way and the foundation's imprint is so much on just the oppression of of the weaker people like is what like what that like it's like that's a tall task no matter how you want to look at it and I don't say that to be naive I don't say that or to like to make anybody not want to continue with this fight this fight has to continue but nonetheless it's like trying to break a system while still benefiting from the system like even though it's crumbs like my crumbs feels like a cake compared to like my cousins in Jamaica Audrey Audrey will the Master's tools dismantle the Master's house and I think about like if we look at every segment of black life under americanism like us politics whatever when we enslaved what did Liberation look like literally running into the marshes and being like I need to grab me some hush puppies to shut these dogs up segregation you had to get the [ __ ] beating out beaten out of you and you had to have someone like present a nonviolent strategy and so our subjugation was how white people achieved their Consciousness and even if we look at now it's like I I think this is why electoral politics always frustrates me because I'm like I feel like every four years identity and Global issues are always weaponized and we end up in the same place and I'm like am I going to be 80 arguing about the president of my math is horrible what how where wherever that will be whoever the president and I guess I'm like I guess I come back to the question like what is our point of intervention because if our point is intervention always trying to get the Lesser evil in office or to find the devil we know like when do we begin to assert what the narrative is moving forward I think we have to see it like we are the same way we do a million other things right like we're multi-dimensional people like these political discussions and we talk about a million other things we do million other things and like we see that's how we have to see it cuz for me I guess like when you're talking about El electoral politics by by the act of talking about it or seeming like you're expending energy on it it creates the impression that you believe in it or that you think that this is worthwhile you have a lot of energy in it or you feel saliently about it right and like I don't like I care about local politics right like because I like I directly can see and know what the you're doing and blah blah blah specifically my Lane right like criminal stuff but when it comes to the law I am not I do not believe that you were going to back beat it from the inside or any of that like that's the exact opposite of how I feel right like I became like I don't feel that way like when people I do not see lawyers is like when like oh I'm gonna be a lawyer to go change that I think you do something valuable like I think the system exists so like when I was a public defender I used to tell him I see myself as a harm reduction is at best like my clients is stuck between a rock and a hard place and I'm doing my best to try to like do do something within that but we're between a rock and a hard place to me the only way I was going to make life better or the circumstances better for my clients was if I could get out into the world and change the minds of of people because ultimately what happens and what we always have to remember is a lot of PE people the society the world we live in has been indoctrinated to believe in the systems to believe in that so even if like you the the the public will break your heart and disappoint you the way they can be tricked you know what I mean unwittingly into supporting their own their own oppression right and so I've never seen being a lawyer or the a politics is the way that's why when people like oh people are tell me every day I have hundreds of messages people like go into politics go into politics go into politics even the politicians are like going to politics going into politics and I'm like everything you like about what I do is because I'm not in politics you know what I mean like like it wouldn't happen right like it wouldn't happen like to me who's really powerful the politicians who's powerful as Angela Davis like who's powerful to these people and I'll tell you that because I was radicalized by I remember the moment they gave me our prisons obsolete I didn't become an abolitionist on the spot but it happened at some point you know and I always think about myself like I'm a very stubborn dogmatic my daddy is Nigerian I am raised for being like I am for all my intensity and as hard as I go for the laugh I think about how ignorant I would have been without my college education without having been educated the way I was and mentored and I would be I would I would be a force of evil I'd be such a just a a source of Terror believe like just die hard believe in stupid stupid [ __ ] like harmful [ __ ] and so to me the real way that we we change is not is like it's like cool when we talk about electoral politics this is something that's happened and I think it's like okay all right within that system if that's what we're talking about we contend with what it is right but I don't think that's where we rest our hat I think if you're resting your hat there or you're looking there for change you're gonna be heartbroken to me it's in educating each other it's in changing minds and it's not just like on the level of like you don't have to be a content creator with a bunch of followers or anything like that Angela DAV didn't win me over on YouTube you know what I mean I read a book and it was cuz my professor handed that to me cuz she read it and she told me about it and she told another person like I always I always try to like explore what is really to me a shifting I always my main mission is to shift social Consciousness I think that's what that's how we create change that's my real Mission and I think that happens over time like I have never I have family member none of my family and generally like my friends I grew up with not my like friends that are my besties now but my friends I grew up with are not people who believe the [ __ ] that I believe or anything like that in fact the opposite but they follow they talk to you enough they follow you long enough they see enough things they don't even know when they start thinking something they I don't have a friend who doesn't support eliminating cash bail and if five years ago that was not the case like you know what I mean but my friends don't even know where my mommy doesn't even know when she became a g cash bail she don't even know when you know so I think that's how we really do it and if you think about it like that we have so much power like so so much power all the when you really think about it everything that's oppressing us is built on an idea an idea that people are fundamentally they believe in in some way that's what it is like everything that you're fighting the misogyny you're fighting this idea what they believe the patriarchy the sexism the homophobia the capitalism the the the xenophobia it's all a idea and if you could change people's minds if you could introduce them to what's flawed and those systems I think that's how we really do it so so do you feel like emancipation starts in the mind before it starts in the body yeah yeah and and I'll put it this way uh I help with this podcast called in the belly and they do just like advocacy H basically it's interviews with people that are locked up on the inside and people that are locked up on the outside and so it's like an abolitionist project and recently we did an episode about Martin SRE he was a jail house lawyer he fought for um incarcerated people's rights for them to have religious freedoms while incarcerated and he talked about prefigurative politics which to him is exhibit the political processes and actions now that we're going to need through a revolutionary process and in a better world so I think to your question about like does emancipation start in the mind and then the body I think like he talks about it in this way prefigurative politics there's the individual prefigurative politics so how do you study how do you change yourself how do you change your thought processes how do you get rid of internalized homophobia sexism misogyny abolism and then there's the more Collective level so how do you exhibit these modes of change with your friend friends with your family at your job in the places and institutions that you are in and then the bigger one is like more structural how do we build towards organizations systems uh different kinds of Paces that get us towards this better place and and I think this is kind of in line with a question that I had since we're talking about the election like I wonder how y'all engage in conversations with people that like maybe more invested in the political system or the two- party system or like how do you navigate that in your life because I think that's one area of what I'm interested in in like this conversation because I feel like I'm always like don't vote no no no no and then I'm like okay I have to slow down and figure out how to talk to people about it so I guess I wonder how y'all approach that that's so tough oh my God it's so hard um yeah it's just hard I think sometimes I get it right and sometimes I get it really wrong I think sometimes I just want to offer I like to give people space to be more imaginative about the world that we could be in and I think these days I'm starting with like an I don't really have an answer um but here's what's possible here's what I think is possible I usually tell people at least like in North Carolina I'm like damn we've got Mark Robinson um who's a really scary black Mago Republican running for governor and we've got Josh Dy who's running for governor and I think Josh Stein is like all right um I think he's like if I was gonna rate him out of 10 I'd put him at probably like a 5.3 but I also know that Mark Robinson sucks and he's scary and um it it it it would just be bad news if he won so when I I I feel like I talk to people on a like a hyper local level these days because that's where I feel like I can be I have a I have a good assessment and something that I feel more confident on I'm still wrestling with the what's happening with the presidential election but I think um right now I feel less curious about how I'm talking about two genocidal Freaks and more curious about how we message the dangers under liberalism and how we message the dangers under fascism so that regardless of who wins we still have some sort of narrative pathway um for folks so we don't lose ground if Biden wins again or if another Democrat wins or if a republican wins like I just think that we can't yeah I just don't want to lose ground on a narrative and cultural front because that's where I feel like that's where I like to play um and and how I engage in in organizing yeah I think that's that's That's Heavy with the losing ground aspect like um I guess I kind of plead the fifth because I guess I am people like I'm the one where it's like to that point where if it starts in the mind I just felt free enough to like deal with my own stuff and not allow the politics and the world and the traumas affect me and I'm just starting to like I'm getting my mind and my soul and my spirit back that at times like it can be like it drowns it out like I feel like when I start to tap into that and I don't know myself enough I'm still figuring it out I get lost in it and as much as there's a fight I felt like I got lost in the black man's fight instead of this black man's fight and I had to come back to like me first and I'm still trying to figure that part out and I'm trying to find a space where me and the world have enough for both I just don't have that enough right now and I'm trying not to be guilty for it at times I feel guilty for it but yeah it's just days when I'm just like I'm really just trying to figure it out with me and like my family what's going on I'm just trying to make sure that's good and then I'll have enough to make sure everything else is good if that makes sense that makes a lot of sense that makes a lot ofense oh it's such a beautiful conversation I think we've got a show Nigel talk just so the people hear your voice I do want to say you know what's crazy I do want to say like um I'm not the biggest like politics person I'm like I'm a music industry guy personally I'm a music guy I'm not the biggest politics person but just talking about like a earlier conversation you guys were having um I think is it Cheeto it's Cheeto righto sitoo I'm I'm apologize I think it's a conversation you and Alami was having um you guys are extremely impactful against people I'm somebody that wasn't even into politics per se until like my friend ultimately got with Al L man um he he talks to me every day about like different stuff he learns and I in turn learn it and I'm just hearing you guys talk I learned from you guys and um uh I think you was saying something about people doing stuff more underground and stuff like that I I personally feel like e like people like you are necessary to push culture forward to like you guys should have a louder voice because it impacts even like me on the smaller level it impacts me people who are ignorant to what's going on in this world who only like you said you like you trying to figure yourself out people that trying to figure thems out they don't they're not seeing what's going on around him CU they're trying to figure their self out so you guys' voices definitely should be a lot louder so they can see what's going on around them and get out of their own way when it comes to these type of politics oh thank you friends y'all see I love Nigel like Nigel's my I I just been learning so like y' y'all talking I just been like I just been like suing the information NE bro trust me like when when the subject changed I went on my phone I start looking up stuff like hold on like what happened I I was not what she told me I was even going to pretend I'm like yo like I'm just
