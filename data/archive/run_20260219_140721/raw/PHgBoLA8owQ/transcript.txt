ah [Music] filling in what's up everyone i kind of look like i'm in the dark right now i'm like half light half dark like uh anakin when he's fighting vader which side will i go to will i go to the dark side will communism fail because human nature oh thank you for the sticker oh could everyone go follow my friend um hellusa.nation uh is that her username here she makes fantastic videos we met when i made a video about michael brooks uh talking about how michael brooks was like a huge inspiration to me and everything i do and she actually had met michael brooks um before so she reached out um play other side by the chili peppers oh i used to be able to play that she reached out to tell me that she had been friends with michael brooks and yeah we're friends ever since thank you so much no thank you you are a truly wonderful person and i appreciate your support do you love me yes i love you all how do you play other side [Music] i can't do it oh well i'll figure that out for next time i promise it takes one to know what you look just like thomas from project x which one's that is that the is that the jerk or the one the guy who like throws the party or the guy who has the party thrown in his house are you pro dprk see what people need to understand and this is what i tried to explain i keep trying to explain this concept and i've explained it in my video response to vosh on youtube midwestern marks and i've explained it on tick tock but the video is probably like the least viewed video i've made in like the past two years uh because anytime you try and actually explain something in depth or or talk about something that you might think is interesting um everyone else seems to find it boring right people just want me to yell but uh this vid um this uh concept i keep trying to explain is from a hegelian and marxist um intellectual name domenicolo cerdo i'm not sure where he's from uh not the u.s though and which is great you should try and read as many people who aren't from the us as you can especially when it comes to marxism um but he uses the example of a tree so he says the roots of the tree in the neoliberal tradition so in the u.s and capitalist type you know countries um based on liberal values the roots of the tree are private property rights so the number one thing that society upholds are private property rights in the hegelian and marxist tradition which is what hopefully we all are here the roots are sovereignty uh and anti-colonialism and anti-imperialism so the people of a nation first and foremost have a right to govern themselves then out of the roots goes the trunk of the tree which is economic well-being saying that um in a marxist or hegelian country people have you know we we look to um create economic well-being for our citizens um and that comes second to sovereignty and the roots of the um the liberal tree are like i don't know it's like identity politics or growth or something or the trunk of the liberal tree um identity politics are the leaves i'm not sure what the trunk is actually like civil and political rights maybe but then the leaves of the marxist and hegelian tree are like civil political rights things like uh social issues so that's where you can criticize the dprk right that's where you can say oh they they do these uh human rights abuses that i'm against um you know and it's with the amount of propaganda that's pumped out there by the us and by south korea everyone please go watch loyal citizens of pyongyang if you haven't yet incredible movie that will probably change the way that you see the dprk um if you haven't studied anything about them before but um you know there certainly are human rights abuses committed by their government right it's not 100 propaganda it's not that this is a flawless country who's never done anything wrong um but you can criticize the civil and political liberties you know the leaves of the tree without saying that um these people don't have a right to sovereignty right and without ignoring that the fact the fact that the u.s has tried to take away their sovereignty for the last 70 years same thing with the trunk of the tree being economic well-being you could you can critique the civil and political rights within the dprk while still saying the us should not put them under sanctions and economic embargo that keep their people trapped in poverty their people have a right to their own economic well-being as a marxist i think that's the position any any really well-read marxist or hegelian philosopher thinker intellectual or whatever should take on the dprk um at least living within the united states right obviously if i lived in the dprk or even you know closer i would probably have more critiques of them um so thank you all for the stickers very very kind like i'm trying to think of an example like if i was in china i might critique the dprk right because my country's not trying to overthrow the dprk and hopefully i can know that most the information i'm getting about them is not as propagandized and nonsense as the information we get in u.s corporate media um oh thank you for the sticker and i guess like something similar would be like i would well it's different because i'm a marxist and canada is not a marxist country but it i don't know it's almost like me critiquing canada being like canada does imperialism and they have capitalism and too much inequality but i like that they have universal health care but they helped out with the iraq war i don't know i don't know my point in saying that and drawing the comparison to canada thank you for the sticker is that uh me living in a country having a platform um in a country where people listen to what i have to say living in a country that's been trying to destroy countries like the dprk for 70 years i'm not gonna use my platform to spread um [Music] negative propaganda or just negative feelings towards the dprk because there's already enough of that i'll tell the truth about them right i'm not gonna lie i'm not gonna lie to cover up human rights abuses and stuff i'll talk about what they're doing you know but i'm not gonna be like oh today i'm gonna make a video about labor camps in the dprks it's like well 24 of the world's prison population is right here in the u.s and in the main problem that the dprk has is there's tons of u.s troops around their border and they're not allowed to trade anything because the u.s is holding them under embargo so me as someone in the u.s why don't i focus on fixing my own country before i start you know lecturing other countries on what they need to do um yeah not that i you know like and if there if there was a a critique of the government in the state coming from the the proletariat of the dprk and it seemed like they wanted americans to talk about it right like americans go ahead and criticize our country here um because we ourselves have this critique i would do it right like i stand in solidarity with their working class with their proletariat not with their government right um so yeah there's my long rant about that i'll answer some questions now sorry i haven't been looking at the chat wish everyone could see your videos thank you me too i guess thoughts on the workers unions in germany so i'm pretty sure com the communist party is like outlawed in germany but they're fighting for things like a 25 hour work week increased wage they were able to nationalize their wages during kovid so if you got laid off of work or you couldn't go into work you still got paid your full wage which is hilarious compared to the stimulus in the u.s and i even got i got one of the three stimuluses stimuli in the u.s and i was pumped um just to get one of the three when i got that stimulus but uh uh so yeah germans got this ig metal union that's like um this giant union uh in most their major industries that's like 2.5 million members or 2.2 million members and that's why they're able to fight for these things right do they have economic organization they have class struggle right it doesn't necessarily matter if the ideology of marxism and communism is outlawed if their working class is organized and engaging in class struggle they can fight for things for themselves which is exactly what marx said which is marxism just in praxis rather than in theory but marx obviously said the working class would eventually seize power over the the ruling class dang eddie why you so cute i don't know thank my mom what radicalized you um there i have a video about it on my youtube channel midwestern marks it's like my path to the radical laugh how i became a socialist it's actually one of the most popular videos but uh yeah the the teacher strikes were going on in wisconsin where my dad was a teacher um scott walker the governor cut the teacher's wages said it was to fix the debt um the current debt in wisconsin is 21 billion dollars or something so he didn't fix the debt not that that even really matters um and he also gave a 4.4 billion or trillion dollar subsidy to foxconn as a foreign company based in china that was supposed to bring hundreds of thousands of jobs it didn't it turned out it was just a scam right it was just scott walker lying and cutting my dad's salary to serve his donors so i was like this is messed up and at the same time as that was going on bernie was running um and i was just scared of the word socialism right i didn't even look at him because i'm like nope socialist that you know bad evil bad no um and then my friend uh who happened to be a very very attractive girl um who i was hitting on started telling me how much she liked bernie sanders and then i started looking into bernie sanders then i started really liking politics then i studied politics in college and now i'm a marxist man that you see in front of you [Music] he's taken though i'm not anymore actually i'm sorry i've been kind of hiding that from tick tock i haven't been telling everyone um but i am on my own now single single main yo eddie i'm here from france impressed by your commitment thank you solidarity my friend how badly do you think the red scare propaganda has affected the u.s very bad uh very bad to the point where even socialists within the us don't yet a lot of young socialists don't yet understand how propagandized this country actually is and how some of these ideas that we have about u.s state enemies that are implanted into our brain since birth are just fabricated by the us what do you think about every man's right slash right to rome i don't really know anything about that shout out to women for radicalizing eddie yes shout out to my friend from high school oh mate you okay though yeah i'm fine i hope single life's going well everything's going well it is what it is you know i'm 24 it's not my first breakup how you doing my friend i'm good how are you you gonna debate bosh probably not iran's election what about it i love that little peep video eddie oh you did thank you i don't know if i was even playing that right sorry that's a question i want to answer thoughts on any thoughts on pan-africanism yes i love pan-africanism and pan-africanism is like the best i found i i would do this when i would uh just start a tik-tok i would listen to pan-africanist talk and pan-africanism is basically like socialism or marxism right that's a component of it this is specific to africa and they basically explain marxism and socialism in a way that's not marxism you don't have to call it marxism you can say it's pan-africanism and it makes perfect sense so here's what i mean part of pan-africanism part of the idea besides moving africa to a socialist mode of production is uh uniting africa into one country and having a strong central state apparatus to protect from the imperialism of the west and from europe and from the united states mostly in australia so when you look at their history in the history of every african country you see that that state apparatus for protection is necessary if they're going to transition to socialism they're going to need to be protected from these these western countries who have long exploited africa's resources exploited their labor and destroyed them with cia coup invasion and whatever else and that's marxism right seize state power and use the state to transition to a socialist mode of production but you can just explain it as pan-africanism and given the history of africa it makes perfect sense it's like wouldn't you want a strong military to protect yourself from the us you know and from the european powers if your entire continent's history um has has been based on intervention and exploitation by these countries it's like oh yeah that makes sense it's like well now you're a marxist leninist i just called it pan-africanism so yeah i love pan-africanism i love there's so many good pan-african teachers on youtube that you can i'll listen to them for hours i love them yeah hi eddie hope you're having a good day i'm having a pretty good day i'm i'm done with work so that's nice favorite animal i like bats um i don't know i probably gotta go simple like with a dog um but like that's just because you know humans have dogs if i had to just pick my favorite animal to watch and observe probably an otter otters are awesome any truth on reports of chinese state-backed money and resources for mexican cartels i don't know i do not know i'm sure that situation's super complex like if you look at bolivia you know the us is constantly accusing bolivia and the dea is super involved in bolivia the u.s is constantly accusing them of international drug trafficking because bolivia grows the coca leaf which has turned into cocaine but there's not a drug problem in bolivia they just grow this leaf and then they sell it and actually i believe it's in japan where a lot of the coca gets refined into cocaine and then you know americans and europeans snort millions of dollars worth of cocaine per year so the u.s says oh we need to kill the problem at the root we need to send the dea and the cia into bolivia and do all these things so we have coca that stops coming out of there and bolivia is like yo we don't have a drug problem you're the ones with a drug problem this is just our a part of our economy we just grow this plant and then we sell it you're the ones who are turning it into drugs and snorting it so why would you send the dea to bolivia how is that going to help anything but of course we know the dea and the other apparat the cia the other apparatuses of the u.s state department are in bolivia um to to make sure they don't do too much socialism which is why in 2019 we saw a uscia-backed coup in bolivia what are your thoughts on che guevara i have a che guevara clock in my room um he's like one of my personal heroes i know that's stereotypical um but i've read his 700 and some page autobiography plus a lot of his just like personal writings which i recommend everyone check out the stuff that che guevara wrote it's um it's good from like a theoretical standpoint he was a brilliant human being but it's mo like he's super inspirational as a human being which is something we have none of on the left right we we talk about how hustle culture and working hard is bad because we're exploited under capitalism right and you know it's nonsense being like hustle if you just work hard enough at walmart you'll eventually be rich and it's like no you're trapped in poverty but you know it's not bad to put hard work dedication um and all these things into socialism it's basically che guevara's argument you have to throw everything you know into socialism and he said i'm asking people you know to potentially die in a revolution so i need to be willing to die myself for for my values and my ideals what i believe in and it's just a really inspirational sentiment and i think the the left could use some inspiration you know and some motivation and some uh um some of that hard-working protestant ethic minus the capitalist exploitation eddie wait did you say you're going through a breakup if you are i'm so sorry brother thank you all but i promise i'm gonna be all right no need to worry about me thoughts on syndicalism is dope best leftist literature ever of all time capital i think capital is probably the best work of leftist literature of all time as far as like how thorough the analysis of capitalist of the capitalist mode of production is in capital also imperialism by lenin is probably my personal favorite because it allowed me to understand why the things that i hate that happen in the world like war happen much love from australia much love the imperial triad australia europe and the u.s why did you mischaracterize spacex in your last video starlink will allow for cheap internet access yeah there aren't good it's not like my point wasn't that good things don't come out of capitalist production right it's like i'm not saying that spacex has never made anything that's worth a crap or you know the engineers at spacex are just doing nonsense all day i'm saying spacex produces things like uh you know they spent millions and millions of hours of labor and of resources and money on space tourism for the rich right because their whole goal is to make a profit that doesn't mean in their pursuit of profit they never accidentally make something that helps the whole of society of course they do this is not as much as if it was were organized to benefit society rather than organized to make elon musk as much money as possible um and yeah you see the same thing with like medicine right you have like uh all this money and research and development and the labor time of scientists goes into medicine for regrowing your hair right which is good but it's like all those resources could be diverted to curing cancer whatever else it's this irrational production we have where production is carried out for individuals for the enrichment of individuals and it doesn't mean you don't have things that are that come out of it that are good for society of course you do but um there's still that contradiction there of production carried out by the masses um for the benefit of a handful of you know capitalist minority um whereas we could carry out production by the masses for the masses and it would make much more sense um and we would have a much cleaner and more equitable world while also um striving you know for things like exploration uh increasing our knowledge as a species all that good stuff you know innovation i suppose do you have a i have a podcast i actually have a couple on our on our youtube but like me and my buddy carlos who is my co-editor who i want to do the podcast with it seems like every time we meet it's just like a two or three hour meeting about the website and about you know organizing stuff talking about details and that combined with he's in grad school right now and i'm working two three jobs plus wrestling plus trying to make videos and write and it uh it's a lot it doesn't leave us a lot of time for podcasting but please follow my youtube midwestern marks i like youtube more than tick tock um it's a lot easier to use uh yeah eddie i love communism i have adhd so buying things makes my brain go better oh yes that's the one that is the most insane thing i've noticed about 80d especially since taking my medication now is i don't make impulse buys anymore i swear i would stop at the gas station every single time i was going to or from work i just had to buy something or like um especially with books i was really bad like i finished books before i read them or before you know i move on to another one i'm not someone who just reads half a book and then moves on but like at a point i had like 20 books stacked up that i still had to read and i was like wanting to buy more i'm like alright you gotta buckle down and read these but since getting my medication i don't do that anymore i don't make impulse buys if i'm gonna go buy some food from the gas station i'll think in my head i'll be no don't buy that food it's going to be cheaper and more healthy if you wait to go to the grocery store and then i can actually do it before when i had adhd i was just like candy i guess i still have adhd but when i was untreated i swear i couldn't help myself i guess i could have but um oh simon got to him before me have you seen that pedro castillo is leading by like 30 points is he that's fascinating did you see my video about that simon um one of our our writers um on the website with us is uh in a polemic right now with this super high profile peruvian academic and they're arguing whether they should vote for pedro castillo or not and sebastian the guy on our website is arguing that you should and this academic is saying no because of castillo's socially conservative views um so interesting so interesting it'd be scary to see if there was like a socially conservative marxist candidate in the u.s he might be able to win he might be able to just be like anti-immigrant but then also be a marxist and and people in the u.s would be like oh sure which is sad was confused for a second because my name is also simon sorry simon is radio free america and he's a writer on my website or our website um and he makes great tick tock content hey hey i love you i love you too what do you have to say about marx's anti-semitism i'm not trying to start anything just curious um i'm assuming you're referring to uh on the jewish question by marx which is read that book um he'll explain what he means like obviously that's like a you wouldn't ever publish a book in the modern world called on the jewish question that would be considered racist but he wasn't making a racist argument in that book i mean a bigoted argument i guess um and he was also jewish so bro you guys he has like six videos on his thoughts on elon musk lord yeah i should do more elon musk videos though every video i do on elon musk blows up i'm like why are people so obsessed with this guy it's i mean part of it is people like hearing elon musk get slandered but then like his supporters every time are so angry but their their comments that they feel the need to go post boost all my elon videos so they all get huge like thank you but they get so mad they're like how could you say this about elon you are just so bad that he is rich and you are not rich okay yes i'm more just mad that he's a capitalist who exploits the labor of his workers and lobbies the government to do coups in bolivia but uh maybe i have some subconscious jealousy towards him because he's rich actually i do you know i wish i was rich he is real life iron man he is ben shapiro looks like zemo i don't know who that is but i think ben shapiro looks like a linus from sharkboy and lava girl you know that is he's they look and sound the same where are you on the political map i'm it tells me i'm like you know libertarian left or whatever but that compass is garbage because like people call me a tanki all the time like i would definitely be what's considered like authoritarian left like a 100 percent support seizing state power and using the state to transition to socialism which is the difference between you know libertarian leftists want decentralized revolution without seizing state power because they say it puts too much hands in the power of the government but if i if i took that test it would tell me i'm libertarian left the test uses such weird thing that tesla will ask like to determine whether you're authoritarian or not which this kind of shows how ridiculous even the word and the concept of authoritarian even is um when it's used in modern political discourse um but the question is like do you support spanking your kids and it's like if you say yes it'll put you up on like authoritarian like what does that have to do with politics like i'm okay with people spanking their kids i don't want the government to take their kids out of their homes and spank them i guess does that mean i'm not authoritarian does that make me a libertarian like what are these questions it's so weird the the real political compass test that you should take is the german ideology where marx runs through all the ideologies and philosophies of the past that he used to make up his concept of dialectical materialism and then that should be all you need then you're just a marxist and you believe in dialectical materialism and you can punt the political compass out the window sock says hi hello sock who on here is from sock that's right the town i grew up in we all know you make stalin look like an anarchist eddie true critical support for paul pot just kidding no one clipped that out of context should i go to myanmar with my bros and fight if you feel called if you feel so compelled i think the test considers libertarian authoritarianism is a social like scale maybe i don't know i'm just going to stick with uh read the german ideology and then read state and revolution and then read origins of private property family in the state thoughts on juche it's just uh socialism with korean characteristics basically korean nationalism and it's good for them there are people though who like live in the united states and they say like they're advocates of juche and i'm like the ideology thought up by kim il-sung um specific to the conditions of korea like how do you support juche in the us what does that even mean i'm assuming they just mean they like the writing but this is what bugs me about all the ideology shopping that people do right and i've noticed there are like a list of ideologies that wikipedia gives when you search marxism it's like tito ism juche blah blah blah it has like five ideologies and one you know people ask all the time what do you think of this ideology what i what specific ideology are you and i think a lot of people are literally getting it from wikipedia um i just but like uh like like i said read marks and and read everything you can and then form your ideology you know you don't have to say anything outside of i'm a socialist or you can even use the word leftist if you want you know your ideology doesn't matter that much and i feel like people are just hyper obsessed with these ideologies because on the internet where politics is really popular and trendy and even marxism and communism is becoming popular and trendy you know you can form little groups on this ideology on that super ultra specific ideology it's like okay the us is currently in what like seven wars we have a thousand military bases over the sea overseas we have more empty houses than we have homeless people and you know meanwhile we're arguing about the differences between like i'm in anarcho syndicalist trotskyist eco-socialist i'm like oh i'm an anarcho-syndicalist trotskyist uh um and i hate the environment and it's like okay let's just fight about this forever that was a bad example but you know people go and there are major differences in ideologies like the main one anarchist and marxist are have different views on the state and it's okay to discuss those and have those conversations but like there's like 200 different popular ideologies in the us usually based off people like you know i love maoists but mao was writing for china right he was writing specifically for china mao wasn't thinking that people in the u.s were going to take his writings and apply every single thing he wrote to the united states because we have our own unique conditions and we're going to have our own unique struggle for socialism in our own unique theories um yeah i basically feel that way outside of like marxism saying you're a marxist and then like marxism leninism is um i see why people call themselves marxist leninist maoist but i don't know at that point i feel like it's getting out of control like how many people's last names are you gonna add to your ideology would you ever vote for a celebrity as a political figure heck yeah i would vote for russell brand russell brand is a communist for those who don't know also people pretending the difference between anarchists and communists the same as left and right definitely that's why maoism is an incoherent ideology mao zedong thought is miles actual ideas yes thank you for explaining that simon i had that in my head russell brand is a communist yeah he's got this interview with who is it it's this really popular british interviewer um but they get like a fight almost because the guy's like oh you say you're on the left but um you call women birds or whatever and russell brands like yeah because i'm from the working class and like that's how people i grew up around talk i'm still a communist they just like wrecks the guy um and and uh if you read mark fisher's escaping the vampire castle uh it uses that interview to argue that online politics are extremely negative and we just tear each other apart and it's echo chambers of negativity which is one of my favorite articles of all time since becoming involved in online politics i just feel like it's so true but he talked about russell brand and communism in there what about muhammad ali was he a communist i don't know i know he was anti-war he refused to do the draft eddie do you agree with anarchism or socialism by stalin i've never read that actually the only thing i've read of stalin was uh dialectical and historical materialism and then the national question tupac was communist yeah have you read quotations of chairman mao yup i have it in my room [Music] war pretty cringe not gonna lie couldn't agree more totally cringe also frida kahlo was a communist yeah i thought everyone knew that the other um some of my friends got a cat and they named the cat carlo after frida kahlo and they didn't even know frida was a communist i was like telling them like that's awesome like that's so cool they're like oh yeah you like her art i'm like heck yeah you know she's like one of the best communist artists ever and like she was a communist i'm like yeah you just you have a communist cat now congratulations [Music] love from ireland thank you [Music] burger team burger king would be top tier if they toasted their buns [Music] maybe all right i'm gonna answer five more questions here let's let's get some good ones before i head out what good questions do we have oh eddie you've got to read economic problems of socialism in the ussr it's so good but who is that uh the one by che i have i have read che's book about um economic calculation problems in the ussr you got the same hat very cool explain the ecp i did that on the last live sorry not not two in a row i'm not doing it that's giving the libertarians too much credit okay what are your views on veganism that's question number one um if you know obviously we know that corporations are destroying the planet right there's very little that we can do even reducing our own carbon footprint to actually save the planet we need to move to socialism but if you do want to make changes in your personal life that help preserve the environment the number one thing you can do is stop eating meat it takes something like it you would have to take like 50 showers to use as much water as it takes to make like an ounce of meat because obviously you have to feed the animal and we eat it so yeah if you want to feel good about yourself be vegan which is maybe why vegans are always telling people how they're vegan and bragging about it because it's the best thing you can do for the environment it takes a lot of mental toughness and discipline um okay question number two thoughts on the un the united nations is you know supposed to be this international body who governs in using international law and stops bad things from happening but they are a tool of western capital um you know not entirely there are branches of the un who do good work and there are unbiased reports or good reports and good information that comes out of the u.n and there are people who work for the un who will come out as whistleblowers and be like hey they're lying about this like recently what happened in douma syria um but uh for the most part they do whatever the us and europe and australia want them to do um in the western imperialist powers and you know most of the people who run the un have ties to western finance capital so big banks or industrial capital all right finding another one is bugs life based yes i recently rewatched bugs life um and it's basically just socialism all the ants develop class consciousness and they're like oh they can't stop us all why are we living within this irrational system where we're all slaves let's change it and then they do all right that's three questions what do we got next [Music] um the eu i don't know enough about the eu to talk about it in depth you all don't want to hear me talk about the eu there's much better people um what is my favorite book okay my favorite book i was saying this earlier is probably imperialism by lenin because i was studying uh politics and global politics in college and i was like holy cow like there's this huge divide between the rich and the poor all these countries are being held in poverty purposefully by our governments so i just thought you know the u.s government was bad and i was a social democrat and then i read imperialism and lenin in 1917 said once capitalists monopolize and they control all the markets at home they're going to go abroad and try and overthrow other countries and in order to see their economic interests carried out overseas and they're going to use the state to do that the military to do that because the capitalists are the ones who truly control the government i was like ah it all makes sense now and the only way to stop imperialism is with socialism so yeah that book just gives you a really good lens of analysis when you're looking at geopolitics all right oh yes this is a great last question have you read ishmael by daniel quinn yes i have uh so i had a professor who very intelligently taught a um a a class about ecology political ecology and the environment um so obviously the basically the whole class was us talking about what can be done about climate change but the first book he had us read is ishmael by daniel quinn and the book ishmael is a guy communicating telepathically with the gorilla and the gorilla is basically telling him like humans are not living naturally right humans are completely above the ecosystem and they're destroying the planet humans think we're progressing forward and everything's getting better and as we get these increases in technology and knowledge but in reality we're on a plane that's on fire crashing into the ground and eventually you know we're just going to destroy the whole planet we're on while we tell ourselves that we're doing everything right and the gorilla says you need to instead live like what he calls levers he says current human society is taker society um meaning they take from the earth i believe this is how the takers and levers things work things worked in the book i'm a little bit it's been a while since i've read it but you need to live like more ancient human societies who just took what they needed from the earth and respected the earth rather than destroying it to produce as much as possible so after our professor had us read that he had us read facing the anthropocene by ian angus which talks about how uh the metabolic rift between human production and the earth so basically how we produce too much stuff for the earth to do its natural recycling processes like uh global warming is an example of that like the earth cannot no longer recycle the amount of carbon it has because we're pumping too much into the air so that's what's called metabolic rift and if you were to plan production to move to socialism you could create a mode of production that brings humans out of poverty while also um while also being sustainable with the environment and fixing uh these metabolic risks that have been created by capitalist production um so i like that book better but ishmael was a great book to read first to make you think like are humans just on a plane that's on fire crashing into the ground like are we all gonna die if we don't do something about climate change so yeah yeah love ishmael by daniel quinn all right well that's all for me folks i'm going to upload this live to youtube if tiktok lets me download it because this was a fun live so thank you for hanging out
