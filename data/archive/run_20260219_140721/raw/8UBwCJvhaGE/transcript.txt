yes uh Marx was writing capital in his later works at the peak of the Victorian period the peak of British imperialism he moved to London to study it properly and write his works yeah uh he has a very famous quote from the preface to the first volume of capital where he says that Britain shows for other countries the trajectory that they will have precisely because Britain was the most advanced Capital the most advanced capitalist country in the world that quote was wrong or partially wrong uh because the the way that capitals expansion the form that it's taken uh has not been one where the same way that Capital developed in Europe it develops the same way in the global South no um what has happened and this is where we need that Marxism leninism you know this is where we need Lenin's analysis as an extension uh of Marxism via uh keeping the method and extending the conclusions to a new concrete reality um when when when capitalism goes abroad in the form of of imperialism the dominance of Finance Capital the the export not of Commodities but of capital um it makes other countries poor it keeps other countries poor it doesn't create the conditions that Marx thought where it was just you know it's just going to replicate what happened in Britain and you know in India or something it it keeps them poor and underdeveloped and in a condition where it's just imperialism is just extracting resources producing things very cheaply and accumulating Capital uh like they unable to do in the metropo in the heart of of the Empire so that's an analysis that lenon develops marks towards the end of his life developed something akin to that um especially in the contact that he enters with various ethnographers various anthropologists um but he doesn't publish anything on it I've been able to read the manuscripts and secondary literature on the manuscripts uh but um he never in his time publishes on it so I think it's fair to say that it's it's Lenin the first person that draws those uh conclusions out um but there's a you know there's a rational side to that there's a part of it which which is true um in the form of a statement from Nikolai sheski the Russian leftwing populace uh who wrote a book what is to be done that's where lennin takes the the title from but who marks loved you know markx was even considering translating sherki um in order to to spread his Works Marx loved sherki and shvi had a phrase which is that history gives uh H history gives to its its Sons the the bone and to its grandchildren the marrow something along those lines it's a beautiful quote and the essence of it is that the best part of history is given to um you know the civilizations which uh while history is entering a new era developed last those are the ones that develop the quickest because they don't need to say develop the steam engine on their own once it's been developed in Europe you can just say oh cool that's uh that's it you know now now we uh now we have it so certain forms of development happen quicker and easier once development has already occurred in one place and there's some uh truth to that you know of course we have intellectual property laws and and the enforcement via imperialism and Ne colonialism of a condition of dependency on the global South where all they're allowed to be is low techn techology producers but you have situations like China where it's because it's led by a Communist party and because it was able to ride the tiger out um the famous Chinese expression goes it uh made a conscious effort of the four modernizations first enumerated by xia and Li uh you know development of Sciences Technologies Securities Agriculture and production so it was able to conscious um produce this uh eating of Tamaro as sherki would say
