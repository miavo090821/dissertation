Literally one of the few ppl with actual radical politic in the entire freakin genre….which is wild. \n\nIt was nice to hear Ebro talk tho, I am not familiar with his thoughts around politics and capitalism. I think there was a lot of capitalism apologism in his assessment of Bey, Jay and 50 (and Tyler Perry *shudders*) but that’s not surprising. However this convo did add some dimensionality to him that I did appreciate! Thank you Olay.",

That's a big deal, those programs are an expense for the company that doesn't always pay dividends and is usually pushed off on people to go get that education on their own dime and then come work for their company.  It's a great alternative to college that still offers a lucrative 'college level' salary.  More companies need to do this.  Great show, thank you!",
