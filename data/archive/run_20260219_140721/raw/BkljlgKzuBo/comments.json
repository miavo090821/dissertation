People who say otherwise had no idea what they were getting into when they started doing porn. Funny how you don’t mention people who don’t regret doing porn. This is no different than saying that having sexual urges is “abusive to women” it’s not. Saying “do better” like a ridiculous sjw only makes you look more ridiculous. There is nothing wrong with what I am doing, it is helping me quite a bit. Sexual gratification “not being everything” is a complete non sequitur to use against porn, since that’s no reason to get rid of it, and you even admit it’s a part of a human relationship.",

There are plenty of places where bashing the opposite gender happens, and it's unproductive. Of course if you are a straight man or straight woman you're going to see the other gender as the problem. It's elementary thinking that's not based in any solution and it is a time waster. People who are still bashing are not ready to do any healing, and will ultimately sabotage any healing that people are trying to attempt. So there would be moderators and people ready to block out anybody male or female who starts with the crap. I'm still trying to work out the kinks and I'm also looking for a man who wants to cooperate and help me with this. It's unbalanced if it's just me overlooking everything. What do you think?",

Sure the top percentage of guys you can blame for allowing this self destructive behavior to continue but the majority of men don't partake in promiscuous behavior. Women need to take and own the responsibility for making sex easy to get and for giving it to the select group of men who will use them sex only. The women who don't partake in this behavior need to belittle and shame the ones that do because those women who partake in the hookup culture only listen to other women and what masses of women say.

That is not how this works. All I can do is educate young women about the realities of promiscuous sex, and the consequences that go down. If men stop rewarding women for being lude, crude, lascivious, promiscuous, and start rewarding women who take care of themselves, are healthy, intelligent, have God in their lives, with strong character? What do you think would happen? The reasons why women are out of control, is because for years men uplifted and rewarded the most lascivious women (Talk to your Boomer parents about what they did, and how they ruined everything). I don't know how old you are, but you have to look at the past at least a little bit to solve what's happening now. Both sides at this point are fully accountable for their behaviors, but all women can do is try to educate. Start ignoring women with hoodrat tendencies and watch what would happen. Do you know what an actual good woman is? Would you know how to identify her? How much do looks matter to you? Again I will never suggest that you be with someone that is not physically appealing to you but are you attracted to what you have seen in porn, or are you willing to deal with a more natural looking attractive woman who has a good character? Would you believe that there are hot women with good character roaming the world? How are you feeding into this as a man? Because I guarantee the reason why women are falling for this crap and doing it is because they get what they want with this bad behavior. Stop giving it to these women. Stop giving the money, stop sleeping with them, stop giving them attention, stop going on and on and on about how insanely hot they are. Stop giving in to them when they try to seduce you. I am working things on my end but I can't do it alone. Men need to work with me.",

Doesn’t make me stupid , while using complex speech in case when you think someone’s foreign not making you look like the smartest one honestly .Why I know ? Because I know that people actually making efforts in working this profession ( constantly researching, studying and observing) don’t support “everyone have to be in monogamous relationships”. Life can serve you well if you analyze and observe people but don’t take  believes  as facts. Also we’re not talking about personal life characteristics, we’re talking about professional understanding of subjects . Let’s say if you’re cardiologist you’ll understand faster if in front of you fake or uneducated cardiologist . I didn’t do broad generalizations by saying that monogamy doesn’t work for many people( historically proven) to force it on every single person lol. Are you drunk (counterquestion)? I’m good at the topic that’s why have no problems to shut your no sense up not even  being skillful with the language:3 To understand why embracing sexuality went the wrong way you need to be somewhat sociologist. Can it be harmful for some people? Yes. But we talking about forcing a thought of normality in this areas. When it’s supposed to be different approach if you really want people to be healthier with their sexual and interpersonal relationships. But historically people seems to go from black to white when they need find gray. No it’s not coz left took something people went this way it’s much more complex reason. Thing not just happens coz people just go crazy. Nothing in this world just happens if you didn’t find the complex reason lead to it doesn’t mean anything but you didn’t find it due to some reasons .",

They'll either decline to a point where they lose their market dominance, or they'll be bought out by another company that won't understand the I.P. and will irreversibly change the product for profit and alienate their target consumers (I'm looking at you Disney+).\nAnyway, this is all speculation from a long-time wargamer lamenting the days when his hobby didn't equate to a second mortgage. 😆",

I do understand that there are some things that a man can't understand about the life of a woman (like all that is entailed in the reproductive capacity of a normal woman), but I don't see that as a collective identity.

Most people are the first two and this is why society is; to help the young traverse the world without having to worry, or be confused, and to help them when they fall. It seems like too many people are being spiteful and are relishing in a bunch of people who made the wrong choice and are now trying to help others stop from also making that choice.",

To some people who very easily get into addictive patterns of behaviour maybe, but not to more stable individuals.\n\nOf course the sexual gratification gained by masturbation can lead to a hormonal high that is extremely gratifying. And without access to a real life sexual partner pornography becomes a substitute gateway to achieving that. \nWhich is why I think pornography has in fact a positive side.

        "text": "@habibishapur I’d say addictive personality disorders are nothing new for those who do struggle with it. Also the internet in general has exposed all sorts of skeletons that were otherwise hiding in people’s closets. As far as adults and adult lifestyles full of sexual proclivities, that’s always been the case throughout recorded history. The real concern ought to be how children are often targeted for grooming. That’s a serious issue. But adults will be adults, because they always have been and will be. I don’t agree with the stance that erotica is something relatively new and invasive to other parts of culture, when it isn’t. It’s not new and rather than being invasive it’s at times a crutch that’s leaned on.\n\nSomething can still be said when an entire population and culture is leaning on the prostitution industry as a crutch. If things do get to that point where stable relationships do diminish in latter generations, that is a problem. But I’d say it’s a misdiagnosis to pin the source of that problem on porn. It’s an outlet, and in mass usage a symptom, while the cause for the destabilization of the family unit is other things: Such as government schools that are indoctrination mills; debt culture that ensnares and entraps many people for years of their life; or in western societies the decades of effects of endless wars that leave homes fatherless.\n\nIndividual women and men who want to live polyamorous lives will do so. A high time preference life naturally has its drawbacks. Everyone else who are comparatively in better positions to afford themselves more opportunities to accumulate capital and invest in their own skillsets will gain more out of life and relationships for exercising low time preference.",

Their decision is made without ignorance. \n\nThe porn industry is not the same thing; most people do not know what is happening in the industry, what *will* happen to them, what they will be expected to do despite their own wants, and so they are like the first group of smokers; ignorant to the reality while being sold a lie.

I couldn't love a porn star, but what's his personal life got to do with his professional life. He should be able to continue being an engineer. She must be a pretty good wife, too as he hasn't left her.  I don't think he should be punished for her mistakes. \n\nStill it has always made me wonder why women get into the business. Most of the ones who do are are fairly plain, average looking women, too.  I think to myself, surely they would be better off just trying to get one man, treating him with respect, gaining his trust, love and affection and work hard together with him to have the best life they can. I think they must be blackmailed or tricked into the business somehow. Of course these guys will say, that the girls have daddy issues, but girls from good backgrounds get into the sex industry, too. \n\nActually the main reason why I have never married, is because I see most women these days as porn stars, they all sleep around and do one night stands.  In my mind I think most women if not all have been around the block twenty or thirty times by their early twenties. I don't want to give myself to a woman, and work hard for her if she has done nothing but behave like a porn star or prostitute anyway. If this this guy can get over her being a porn star, and try to make a go of it with her, then I can applaud him for that. At least he knows about her pass. Most women will do everything they can to hide their whorish behavior from you. Or  if you do find out, they tell that it is not a big deal that they have a high body count and you should just get over it. \n\nThis whole sexual liberation of the last 70 years worldwide, hasn't just destroyed relationships, it has destroyed the potential for meaningful long lasting relationships.  As no one can trust anyone anymore.",

The videos and images are out there forever. Humans are not to be sold and this is literally selling your body. It is exploitation. For 'worse', Children forced into sex slavery is evil and yes, worse than adults because children are innocent and have no way of defending themselves.  'Complicit' as PornHub has been distributing child pornography on their platform and revenge porn. It isn't a secret that PH does not value human life and does not respect victims of assault. PH allows people to upload illegal activity and does not offer a solution for victims to have their content removed. 'Lonely' as porn is often seen in isolation in a dark room. It's destroying young men's minds and now many women who are getting involved in viewing this material. @pera.j.andersson",

Gender ideology is actively pushed by schools, universities, the psych industry and the mainstream powers that be, so the people who get caught up in it are a lot more innocent, and the damage is done much more obviously and much more quickly. So when they come out in opposition, it means something. It also has little to do with hedonism.\n\nBut ex porn stars? Nah. They're never vocal enough to be actually useful. It's mostly crocodile tears after their time in the sun is over and they face a difficult transition to normal life. The fear of being shamed for doing porn does more to discourage people from doing it, than a few half arsed essays and videos from soon forgotten porn actors. Think about it. Nowadays the barrier to entry for porn is zero. What stops young women doing it? Principles and forward planning? No. Fear of being shamed and socially downgraded.\n\nFrankly being too kind to these people might in fact give people the impression that there's a nice soft safety net waiting for them after they're done.",

Never mind  the degrading nature of most of it . Watching Adult movies is essentially cuckoldry as you watch somebody else have sex with the person you desire as you watch and pleasure yourself .  The whole nature of sex is completely warped now as love and sex becomes more separated .Porn addiction is now a thing . The amount of people exploited to make this content for money as there is a demand for it . It is pretty telling when a large percentage was removed from P.H because it was grape or C.P . This only feeds some sick minded individuals as the content gets worse and worse as with any drug you build immunity and need stronger stuff in larger doses . As for the people with post porn regret ? If you wanted to be a norm you should not do porn .",

Eventually some village idiot would say “oh that’s just superstition” and walk off into the swamp to prove it wasn’t haunted. Then he’d drop dead of his own accord with no obvious cause. He wasn’t pulled into the water by an animal, he wasn’t hit by a rock or an arrow, he didn’t die of exhaustion, hunger, thirst, or anything else obvious. If anyone went to check on him, they’d be walking over the unnaturally, nearly perfectly preserved corpses of anyone else who died in that swamp. That would reinforce the villagers’ beliefs that the swamp was cursed. Turns out people like that died of asphyxiation due to the methane emitted by chemical ridden bog water, which is also what preserved the corpses.\n\nBut just remember. No matter how silly sounding the superstition, no matter how wrong the conclusions they came to were, walking off into that swamp will still kill you stone dead.\n\nThese people rejecting the nuclear family as the foundational basic structure of civilization are the village idiot who says “that’s just superstition. Nothing bad will happen to me if I don’t follow my elders’ advice.” They’re at the point where they noticed they’re tripping over the bodies of people who came before them. They’re coming to realize their mistakes. They aren’t dead yet, but they’re too far in to make it out of the swamp alive at this point.",

Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.\"_\n\nHe continues:  _\"....until we know what the reason was_ [for the construction of the fence], _we really cannot judge whether the reason was reasonable. It is extremely probable that we have overlooked some whole aspect of the question, if something set up by human beings like ourselves seems to be entirely meaningless and mysterious....nobody has any business to destroy a social institution until he has really seen it as an historical institution. If he knows how it arose, and what purposes it was supposed to serve, he may really be able to say that they were bad purposes, that they have since become bad purposes, or that they are purposes which are no longer served. But if he simply stares at the thing as a senseless monstrosity that has somehow sprung up in his path, it is he and not the traditionalist who is suffering from an illusion.\"_",

The important things to figure out are to with how much sense I am / am not making…not any ad hominem affair. Quit smoking YEARS ago ( that sxxt really WILL kill you). There’s a question mark over my sanity on that one. Used to think Karl Marx was an important thinker ( so I certainly WAS completely fxxxxd in the head). Still look at porn every day…really don’t care about it as an issue one way or the other. Don’t go near cannabis since I figured out it was funding the IRA.

I find it rather weird how so many actors, be it in porn or normal movies, deliberately and willingly do whatever they need in order to get fame and big money, and then, once they have it, they complain how terrible everything is and how they need drugs and alcohol to endure it. If they did only a few videos and found out that they didn't like the industry and quit, fine, i totally understand that and totally respect that.\nBut it's weird how some make hundreds of videos over the course of several years, even though everything is supposedly so awful. \nIf they really dislike their job to the point where it destroys them emotionally, they should quit, look for something else and let those who enjoy the job do it.\nI'm not saying that they are lying or that the industry can not be awful, but I just wonder why the complains usually only come long afterwards, after their fame peaked or after they quit, and why, if it's truly so emotionally destroying, they still chose to stay in the industry for so long. The only real reason I could think of (aside from being forced, which is not what I'm talking about, or that they truly can't find another job to stay afloat, which is not that likely) is that they value fame and easy money over their well-being, in which case I'd say it's on them.",

There are a lot of British pornstars who work for a week or less, yet still end up somewhat well-known, due to how the British porn industry distribute their content.\n\nI know a woman who did porn for 3 days in the early 90s. During those 3 days, she did over a dozen softcore photoshoots, 7 hardcore porn scenes, that also had a stills photographer taking photos at the same time, and a dozen very short softcore scenes. She basically worked non-stop for 72 hours. She got paid a lot of money for those three days, and then she quit.\n\nThe material took almost a decade to be fully released into circulation, and her page on IAFD says that she worked in the industry for 9 years, which isn't close to being true, but that number is based on how long it took to release the material (trickling out material is a very common tactic, particularly in British porn.), and the fact that content was re-used to death on multiple DVD releases.\n\nShe still gets recognised to this day, despite being 30 years older, in very different physical shape, and all the porn images of her being from how she looked over a 3 day window.\n\nIt still interferes with her life, and she can go for ages being okay, and then just get hit with waves of depression.\n\nNo-one should do porn. Male or female. Straight, gay, bi, whatever No-one. Even the ones who do it for a bit and can seem fine, will have gotten some kind of damage from the experience.",

Now we just have MBAs that trash companies and ship everything to China.\nIf people had upward mobility through a genuine work ethic, maybe better things would happen.\n\nAlso, if these stars didn't blow money as fast as they earned it, they probably wouldn't be broke.

This is literally 2% of the male population.\nSo not forming romantic attachments, sounds f**king great to me and if I could go back to me at 30 and give one piece of advise, it would be exactly that. I'm not the only one either, a lot of 40+ men on the dating scene are thinking the same way, having been through the same sh*t. Lie and lie and lie, sleep around and never settle.",

Some people this american centric point of view when it comes to viewing issues and solving it.

The only thing that tells me is either young adults want to know their romantic partner more before they get to that point or young adult couples side to spend the rest of their lives together with having one child or two children without the marriage thing.\n\nAlso in terms of marriage rates the US has a marriage rate of 5.1 per 1,000. And then we look at some other countries ( in which these two are the marriage rates that I know from the top of my head is that ). Iceland has a marriage rate of 5.0 per 1000 while New Zealand has a marriage rate of 7.7 per 1,000. Basically the two examples I point out either have a similar marriage rate or a higher marriage rate per 1,000 while both of these two countries still have a higher rate of sexual partners on average.",

Because you clearly haven't seen all of the content under the aforementioned categorys nor have I (pornographic comics/books).\n\nEdit: I should also clarify as my first comment states my question as about \"pornographic comics/books\" and I was not directly talking about hentai or its doujinshi as these are not comics in the western sense but a form of manga (which yes is a different thing).",

She didnt come to LA to be a porn star but since she had been a stripper back home, she came out here with hopes to hit it big. She loved the attention, loved her shiny blue Corvette and the money as well. At one point she asked me to be her road manager as she was a headliner and did strip shows and I would run her pyrotechnics. I was tempted but I turned her down. I kept my job as a DJ at a popular club(where I first met her and several others like Debi Diamond, Christy Canyon), and I now realize made the right decision. The male talent is mostly freelance and when I did it, you got 200$ for a scene and that was it. I shot maybe 2-3 scenes per movie.  Porn today is way different than when you were a contract player for a studio. Mostly it's webcams and Onlyfans now. Many can travel and broadcast from anywhere. Here in Thailand, many set up shop because it's dirt cheap to live here. I think because of the internet, it's way to easy to get into porn and make easy money. Just realize at some point, like many here have said, you dont stay young forever. Be working on Plan B. Invest, buy gold, educate yourself. Be independent because that way you dont rely on anyone else for a job. Of course, if you do have kids, you do have a past that might haunt you at some point.",
