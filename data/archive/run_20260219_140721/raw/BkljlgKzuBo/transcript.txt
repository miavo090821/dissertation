anyway Let's uh let's move on to the topic of pornography now I'm not a big fan of pornography this this podcast taking a turn yeah I've I've watched my fair share as every young man or a man who has been young once with access to the internet has uh watched and uh it's not good for you it's an evil there's no question of it in my mind it's not just me being like hyper conservative the reason you don't post the links of pornography watching your Facebook feed is because you don't want people knowing because it's gross but it's the occasional person that does you just think why yeah exactly what are you doing they have no sense of propriety because what you you know everyone everyone does it but you know you shouldn't right and uh and it turns out that the porn industry itself is actually if you can believe this hugely disgusting and exploitative to those people within it yeah I mean you may remember what happened with PornHub recently it wasn't like last year oh what happened all of a sudden they deleted like 90 of their content and it was because they were found to be hosting a lot of uh rape or oh child porn I did I missed that actually they insisted that happened yeah they insisted from now on every user who uploaded had to be verified yeah so like yeah the Night episode just disappeared overnight so yeah if you want to find that you've got to go on Twitter um I'm not even joking like the an ironically yeah you some of the hashtags on Twitter that I've seen going around like well there are maps on there okay yeah yeah and then I get deleted yeah it's it's crazy but uh but anyway before we start if you want uh some life lessons go over the legacies.com sign up support this Fiverr a month and uh check out this life lessons from Labyrinth now I actually really like this as a kind of representation because you have the young girl in Labyrinth who is quite sort of pure right she's she's quite um saintly in a way they have David Bowie who kind of represents the sort of debauchery aspect of life and and this I think fits quite nicely because this is essentially like the before and after of people who have been through the porn industry right so there are a bunch of like and this is not like unusual or modern right so have you ever heard of a porn movie Deep Throat uh nope is this how things were actually named back in the day yes and well you say back in the day this is 1972 right get the next one right so back in the day for me the the the the the champ who starred in that was a guy called Harry Reeves right now this deep throat was like the the movie that popularized um hardcore pornography because it was kind of mimetic so it's so like quaint most now oh yeah it's oh my God he does a what well compared to what you'll see on the internet now yeah this is I haven't actually seen this so I don't actually know what's in it but I I assume it's just sloppy research yeah exactly to be honest terrible research but this is kind of Infamous everyone's heard of this right as it says a pop culture phenomenon the pornography to mainstream audiences uh but um this this champ Harry's um his life was terrible actually and he regretted everything he did he spent a decade as a successful porn star right but alcohol addiction brought him to his knees a religious conversion was the Catalyst for changing since the 80s late 80s he worked in Salt Lake Salt Lake City as a real estate agent his wife reported his death because I've been suffering from cancer right he played the male lead in deep throats and uh he hated it his wife said he hated doing porn he hated doing it but it was all he could do to make money right and his his co-star it's uh Linda Lovelace I think it is also became an anti-porn activist after doing this movie right so so you guys show you if if the two people involved in like the most famous porno ever end up becoming anti-porn activists well it should tell you something about the nature of pornography right the reason I'm laughing so much is because I hear I haven't seen the movie either no but the idea like oh my God they did a deep throat scene and then their whole lives went to pot I just imagine if they were still around today just to see the internet oh God I think well yeah exactly right exactly how much worse things have become but also their lives don't look that bad like stop taking the alcohol well that's the question right so if we get the the next one uh there are a lot this is not reserved for men or women for these regrets both of them regret doing pornography right so the first example on this is a chap called Greg now I never I don't I'm not familiar with any of these people to be honest Greg Guevara no no scroll down and you can see the first guy um his name's Greg and I watched I watched this video and I watched all the videos on this because this is from a website called fight the new drug right so uh Greg was apparently one of the most successful porn stars ever uh he had starred in a thousand adult feature films in 23 years right he first started important in 1988 uh became one of the most successful actors he was a four-time winner of the adult video news best actor award and was put into their Hall of Fame in 2002 but only after he left the pawn industry in 2011 was he able to share the reality of why he started doing porn and how 23 years talk toxic industry affected his life and he's the champ that I was speaking about earlier where he I mean this is it's actually quite harrowing he's like you know I just did it because it was easy money and I got you know more and more money as time went on but afterwards I realized that I couldn't form romantic attachments to women but I just could not see them as anything other than sex objects and I had no interest in being around them and it was just like right okay and so he ended up like essentially thanks John for that information um but he he would basically just spend all his money on drugs and alcohol to dull the pain of being so lonely and feeling so gross all the time and was he gay no no wait no I don't know I just start watering never mind no no he wasn't gay you just like the way the way that pornography made him treat women affected because he couldn't form an attachment to any of these people God yeah I mean did he have kids uh I think he does yeah because I'm wondering if uh that also affects his like non-sexual or familiar relationships with women I don't know I he didn't actually bring up kids I would assume he does but I don't know um but the point is this it ruined his emotional state like so he was just totally depressed this is why the other guy converts to Mormonism because I need I need to be seen I need Jesus yeah I know that's literally what it is right and there's another chap on this called Joshua who grew up in a small town in South Carolina wanted to get he was you know wanted to be a model uh moved to LA got sucked into the porn industry uh one you know he's very successful in the pawn industry uh you know lots of alcohol lots of depression and is now a passionate anti-porn advocate so again people coming out of this going you've got to not you just avoid this at all cost right anything like you know wide-eyed Country Boy Goes to LA what happens he comes out going stay away this place is awful you'll consume you you know no surprise uh and there's another article on that there are some women on this one but this is very interesting because like okay that's that's from the men's perspective where it's under it ruins my ability to love women well for women it ruins their self-esteem and their view of themselves and uh so there are lots of examples in this that are just there's just harrowing to be honest um so the the first this this woman here is actually not featured in this article she's featuring the other one but this that's Alia I think it is uh who was um came from an abusive home where she'd been sexually abused as a child and was essentially sex trafficked by an older man she'd met on like Myspace or something uh and into prostitution and then eventually into the porn industry and she was just like this is just awful is that a step up or a step down you mean Step Up step who cares I'm just wondering hellish life oh yeah yeah it's all hell yeah which one's more hell but uh and a lot of them are apparently quite brutal like uh Alex says one particular film was the most brutal depressing scary scene I've ever done I tried to block out for my memory uh due to the severe abuse I received during the filming the male performer had a natural hatred towards women in the sense that he he has always been known to be more brutal than has ever needed yeah well I imagine that a lot of male porn stars actually do kind of dislike women because they're essentially trained not to see them as human beings just seeing the sex objects and that's going to be a consequence of you know the like with Greg the previous one like you know it's gonna make you weird and bitter it's awful like Alexa says uh like most performed performers I perpetuated this lies in the lie that it was it was good one of my favorite things to say when I was asked if I liked doing a particular scene was uh I only do what I like I wouldn't do it if I didn't like it I would say this with a big fake smile and giggle what's a total lie I I did what I had to do to get work in porn I did what I knew would help me gain Fame in the industry it's a very bad goal yep Jesse says it was the most degrading embarrassing horrible thing ever I had shooting an interactive DVD which takes hours and hours and the she was crying and the agent would let her leave blah blah blah and just awful just the most degrading embarrassing horrible thing ever well that one there it's also just terrible working conditions like she said she's got a 104 degree fever and the dude was like stepping on her head for the goddamn reason yeah but just the whole thing is just awful right Andy says after a year or so of that so-called glamorous life I sadly discovered the drugs and drinking were part of the lifestyle I began to drink and party out of control cocaine alcohol next to my favorites before long I turned into a person I didn't want to be I after doing so many hardcore scenes I couldn't do it anymore I just remember being in horrible situations and experiencing extreme depression and being alone and sad you can also see by the G left the pawn industry oh yeah but then a 2014 went back yeah so then but yeah you know but she's undoubtedly gonna be doing it because she needs the money well what else she gonna do well that's exactly right you know after being part of an anti-porn activist group she's like well okay but that's not paying the bills no but it's also I I mean I'm not saying this is even necessarily wrong because we should demonize getting into this lifestyle because it doesn't seem like a good career choice to say the least but if you're in porn what are you going to do after that well we'll get to that in a minute um Jan says of course I lied to my fans I let them believe I lived a fancy life that was far from the truth I fed into their fantasies I said I wanted sex 24 7 and made it seem like I absolutely loved what I did and I was living this happy life I gave them hope and insight into their relationships by telling what to do I started to feel like an important nobody they knew Elizabeth the porn star they would never know Jan the real me I had to do whatever the producer pleased and I had to accept it or else no pay sometimes you get to a gig and the producer would change what the scene was and you just have to do it if you didn't like it and uh Jesse says people in the porn industry are numb to real life and I like zombies walking around the abuse that goes on in this industry is completely ridiculous the way these young ladies are treated it's totally sick and brainwashing I left you to the trauma I experienced even though I was only there a short time I hang out with a lot of people in adult industry everyone from contract girls to guns are actresses everyone has the same problems everyone is on drugs it's an empty lifestyle trying to fill up a void I became horribly addicted to heroin and crack I overdosed at least three times and had tricks pull knives on me have beaten to death she goes on and Jenna says it was torture for seven years I was miserable I was lonely eventually I eventually turned drugs and alcohol and attempted suicide I knew I wanted out but I didn't know how to get out and this is just such a common and repeated refrain from all of these sorts of people uh and the like people like Mia Khalifa who seem to be coping by becoming a leftist activist but um you know she says uh it was terrible decisions on her part I don't think low self-esteem discriminates against anyone it doesn't matter if you come from a great family or not so great background and she was doing it for male attention for validation and then you get those people like yeah but this is a terrible strategy but yeah of course it is I mean that's the message really which is just like could you think of anything stupid than I'm going to get into porn that'll be good for me no no it's it's a terrible terrible suggestion uh and but the things there's this sort of feminist view oh this is empowering but even those porn stars who are like yeah I'm empowered by having sex on camera but I do want to quit the industry so yes I I don't want my empowerment yeah I want the burger actually yeah she's she's looking forward to getting out of the porn industry even though it's empowering right and then you've got the consequences after you leave right and that's a social stigma that character that's carried with you as Bree Olsen found out she quit porn in 2011 and has been since trying to transition to mainstream acting for many she's been known best known as one of Charlie Sheen's Infamous goddesses one of his several girlfriends that lived with him during his 2011 breakdown uh also says that five years after giving this is in 2016. five years after giving a pump for good she still feels negative effects every day when I go out I feel like I'm wearing across my forehead all of the mean things people say to me on the internet that's how I feel about how I walk when I walk out the door I've gotten to the point where there are days two weeks at a time that I don't leave my house because I don't feel like facing the world I get so disappointed when I meet new friend and it turns out they don't want to be my friend anymore it's easier for me to stay inside my house people treat me as if I'm a pedophile they treat they don't treat me like I'm an sex worker they treat me like I would be damaging to children that's interesting isn't it it's also really really unfair I mean like Peter falls get traded way better than that yeah pedophiles are allowed to use PayPal well there are a lot to advertise themselves on Twitter with no problems yeah there's an advocacy movement behind me but the thing is I don't think it's entirely unreasonable that people would treat porn stars as if they are damaging to children because there are lots of children who are damaged by porn now you could say well it's really the fault the parents are allowing them access through a smartphone to all at this point and I completely stand by that which is why I don't think children should have smartphones but I know you really love eye on this question oh totally and I will I I will be Vindicated by the fact that my children won't have mental health issues when they leave the house I don't know though because if if someone who has gone through hell and knows the least wholesome things in the world and the most destroying of innocent things do you reckon they'd be better or worse at making sure that any children around them are kept innocent I don't know but I would say that this person deeply regrets having gone through that and would suggest that uh they shouldn't I know but that's my point it's like well surely she would actually be quite good with kids in the sense of being like don't show them anything indecent maybe maybe she's highly conservative of her opinions now um and but she says this right I think this is really interesting I wish that people would treat me like they'd treat a married registered nurse with 2.5 kids in Indiana maybe you should do that well you know maybe that's what you should do I Wish I Had a Million Dollars no no no but that's not a million dollars is a difficult thing to attain and like an unrealistic goal being a married nurse with two and a half kids in Indiana that's a totally plausible goal that a regular person can achieve she's still going to be someone who engaged in sex work though exactly that's part of her bag exactly so but but after going through all of this and after making all the money and getting all the fame that she got doing this she's sat there going God I wish I was just like a regular person like you know the the people who have gone through it are like don't do this I wish I was you you know that's what they're saying I suppose the worst aspect of all of this is it bleeds into only fans obviously oh yeah I mean like it's bad enough when you've got people who would I mean before the day's the internet I can't imagine how many women ended up doing porn oh it would have been a much smaller percentage and now yeah since then obviously it got way worse so they were the only fans being literally any girl with a phone on the planet and you don't even need an outlet and we see plenty of only fans regret as well men won't date me because I'm an online porn star and only fan so okay do you see that lady who's blowed up onto her she's got like 800 000 likes or something a couple of days uh she posted the oh guys say that they won't date someone who's done only fans well thanks I never wanted an insecure loser anyway so well that's good because I didn't want to  so but also you started the only fans because you're an insecure loser does that too that's why you did it well you wanted male validation and you didn't have any money that's why you started the earn events or money no both they want there's like Mia Khalifa I don't know the individual they no they all say this they all say they want mail they do it for mail validation and there's a huge financial incentive these things combined I don't know when I think of Bel Delphi and I think of money rather than mail validation yeah but that's because you never watched the podcast with Iran right I've seen some of her podcast yeah right well did you talk about that yeah there's a particular podcast where she's asked about her father and a relationship with her father oh it's terrible um they don't speak and they haven't spoken for like 10 years oh and I was actual daddy issues all of them it's for male validation this is what um the Alia one when I was watching it she was she was doing it for male validation they won because they don't have strong father figures in their lives and so they do it for male validation and the reason they do this and not something else is because there's huge amounts of money involved with things like only fans that's what it's all about I was calling my Dad yeah it's really what they want is to have a Skype call with their dads which is going to be less and less likely the more porn you do that's for sure yes um but um but she says at the very end right um well not the very end actually she says there are no royalties in porn right so she can you get paid a chunk of money and then you lose access to any money that is made off of that so she sees her own face all over the Internet and people are still making money off of her but she's shunned by society and broke and she says I send a very strong message to young girls don't do porn as much as you want to embrace your sexuality and say I can do whatever I want with my body you are going to have a life of crap in front of you you can never work with children after you do porn you can never work in the medical field after you do porn these are things that teenage girls don't think about how people treat you for the rest of your life it's not worth it yeah 100 true sorry I just can't stand that phrase embrace your sexuality this is the feminism that that's literally she has been destroyed by feminism that's what she's telling us but it's just it's it's not you can find someone and then you know do more than missionary for the sole purpose of you know procreation yeah it's never that it's it's become a plaster as a radio yeah becomes a porn star it's like well there are there are consequences to these things if you appreciated that segment from the podcast of the Lotus Eaters you can go to lotuseeters.com to get access to all the
