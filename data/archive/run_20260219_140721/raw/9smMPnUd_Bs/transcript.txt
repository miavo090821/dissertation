welcome everyone to another episode of escaping the cave with Carlos guito I'm a philosophy Professor the director at the Midwest of marks Institute and the Secretary of Education for the American Communist party I am also the author of various books including the Purity fetish and the crisis of Western Marxism from 2023 and why we need American Marxism from 2024 today we have a very special episode we are honored to be hosting as our guest Rabbi Israel David Weiss who is a longtime activist against Zionism and for the Palestinian people Rabbi wise thank you so much for joining us thank you yeah it's a great honor and a privilege to be able to speak to people around the world it's uh Our obligation and um as always I usually before I start a program I always I say I pray to the almighty to bestow upon me his truth his wisdom that I may be worthy of conveying his message and so child hopefully sanctify his name and bring peace to the world so I hope this will be a good conduit to be able to spread the word well the pleasure is all ours I want to start by asking you about Trump and this new Administration he's been making very inflammatory comments uh about Gaza about the Palestinian people and about what the US might be doing with Gaza and uh these are very concerning but I'm kind of confused and I don't know where this is heading because in the past Trump has been fond of making similar inflammatory statements right before he ends up Landing historic deals I'm thinking specifically about the case with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea where he said that they were going to be blown out of the map and then pretty soon he ended up Landing a historic deal uh showing up to the dprk itself and doing a photo op with Kim Jong-un and joking about trying to look uh nice and slim or something like that so what do you think we can expect from this Trump Administration concerning Palestine be very clear we not uh not politicians we're not uh uh prophets and we can't really know um what will what the approach will be but what we do know is that the almighty is uh great the almighty is compassionate and um we we look at him constantly that he should uh with his compassion bring peace stop Slaughter stop genocide and so on uh therefore uh we also say in our prayers in the high holiday prayers uh that that every Jewish person who says the high holiday prayer says that God should put into the hearts and minds of kings and leaders that they should strive for peace uh and Tranquility um and therefore so we we hope that uh that God will put into the mind of President Trump that he will come to the proper conclusion and uh and do what's right and that would be uh as we are very clear uh the total actually uh dismantlement I know it sounds very wild but it's the actual fact the the dismantlement of the occupation of the Zion state of Israel if you would look at the history history Jews lived together with Palestinians for hundreds of years under the Ottoman Empire they lived in every Arab and Muslim country in peace and even though there was no human rights go to protect them because the difference of religion is not an impediment to peace uh we have a distinctly different religion than the Muslims but we believe in one God and we were able to coexist in fact the Muslim countries and the Arab countries took the Jews in and um when we were being being uh murdered in in Europe many times it happened and throughout these hundreds and hundreds of years uh we were embraced and we were able to flourish as distinctly Jewish practicing Jewish communities under Muslim and Arab rule H was never a problem so uh I'm never saying I'm not saying there was never any bumps in the road but the fact is is historically we lived in flourished and put out our great rabbis in these communities uh Judaism is a religion to be subservient to God it's a 3,000 year old religion uh the Muslim scholars in all these countries knew what our religion is and they didn't deem us a threat to them because our religion does not permit even since the destruction of the temple 2,000 years ago we are forbidden to reestablish any Jewish sovereignty uh we are not allowed to kill a St we have to show gratitude for good dantas so we have to we are required by God really to not only not to steal the land from the Palestinians but to to show our gratefulness for our being embraced and taken in and the fact of history is that the Jews lived together Arabs and Muslims in Palestine we have many many commun people in our Jewish Community who who remember this coexistence how Jews Liv as they did in Iraq and Iran and Tunisia and Egypt and uh Lebanon and wherever you like in Morocco Jews in live in in now we having in Syria problems in Syria Jews live the communities flourished so the only the cause of contention the cause of blood is because the development the creation of a Zionist state of Israel which is a transformation from our Judaism of thousands of years which the Jews are loyal to into a New Concept into an erat Judaism which is nationalism which is Zionism to have a piece of land and the rabbis stood stalard and fast against this around the world we put out a book called The rabbis speak out which is a compilation of um the the of of the the statements of the leading rabbis around the world uh to discussing each one in their own style in their own manner uh in the very sharply um uh opposing the concept of the state of Israel for instance Rabbi Cohen I'm pointing to one a very RAB May Cohen who passed away in 1933 uh codify of Jewish law very famous from Ren in Lithuania and he said everybody recognizes his greatness he's one of the leading authorities in Judaism and pway 1933 15 years before the creation of the state and he said the zionists are dead LS of our people which causes the entire body to rot they are dead limbs of our people they they they try they conflate and put themselves together with Judaism but they are totally not Judaism it's a nationalism unacceptable the chief Rabbi of Palestine in 1947 pleaded with the United Nations and it's the United Nations documents uh as you can see uh this is Rabbi daninsky pleading with the United Nations where he said we furthermore wish to express our definite opposition to a Jewish state in any part of Palestine this was it's the United Nations documents this was in July 16 1947 before they created the state and this is the of Judaism he passed on that Rabbi we had the Gathering for another Chief Rabbi tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands this is in front of the White House when bi Natan came to see uh President Obama and on every time we we have the same demonstrations because it's it is totally not Jewish it's a nationalist movement that's flawed that's unacceptable that's masquerading in the Star of David in the name Israel it's a fraud um the the ones who made it I show a picture this is in a this is the the historic moment of the David benguan reading the decoration of independence an Independence Hall and you can see here's David benu and the picture of uh the herzo on top there now none of them are even covering Their Heads This Is The Day historic moment of the reading of the Declaration of Independence it's unbelievable making a ma imagine making a Muslim country without imams without ayos without sh uh making a Christian State without priests this is what they are it's a total uh non-jewish uh Jewish State it's a inat Judaism it's a false Judaism they're using the facade of my religion and they're trying to present it as as a Jewish thing and whoever opposes it as anti-semitic so president Trump uh and other leaders feel they have to uh protect the Jewish people they we we thank them for wanting to sympathize with the Jews who suffered by World War II as my grandparents were killed in alitz my father escaped the Nazis uh when they came to Hungary and on and on they the Jews suffer uff tremendously and therefore there are a lot of people who feel the suffering of Jews they're sympathetic and they want to help them and when they look at other people wanting to attack they automatically think it's anti-Semitism but it's truly a misnomer it's totally a a false issue because it's Zionism implementing a selfish flawed occupation of the indigenous people living in Palestine a community that was living the Jews and the Muslims and none of the communities wanted it the not the Christians not the Jews not the Muslims even the Jews as I say they they pleaded that they don't want it and since then they've been demonstrating in in in and then being brutally beaten by the police we don't carry guns or knives and and and simply they get brutally beaten children young children uh old rabbis assassinated beaten assassinated by the zionists in in in in their stri driving to uh to complete their occupation and um and and so their narrative is full of holes it's flawed how could they say that they they what are they doing why are they beating these Jews simply because we're standing on the streets and saying they're a fraud and this is what we everybody can witness and we do 76 years this is ongoing um so you should just understand what we're dealing with we're dealing they be being tread on with horses um and then smash the head smashed and on and on they're sprayed with with these with chemicals his stinkers wounds their clothes or makes their skin itch and this is scandalous and this is uh something that's on and on and um and and so they they are a false um entity a false un un unjustifiable entity and but they but to the world they scream if you say anything against them you're anti-semitic and therefore they're getting backing from the world so we plead and we hope that eventually um God will put in the minds of our president president Trump and the other leaders that they'll they'll come to the to the simple logical and clear and factual conclusion that they're they're supporting just like a something just like a parthe a parthe is today would never be acceptable if it would be uh created a state with a parthe yet South Africa was for tens of years recogn Iz in the United Nations but today nobody would dare to create a country with an apartheid Rule and be and it was the Grassroots that forced finally the politicians to come to their senses and recognize it's unacceptable the same thing we hope that although it seems that President Trump is speaking very sharply and total support for the state of Israel that he's a person who U follows what his what his thoughts are a lot of times is not influen or intimidated by others that he'll stand up and recognize and say this is wrong and we have to have a free Palestine God should put it into his minds and we we don't get flustered by anything because ultimately it's the almighty who rules the world and the Torah says why are you rebelling against me it will not be successful so we are certain that this Zionist state of Israel this endeavor will end we only pray to God it should end speedily and peacefully and we hope that maybe uh president Trump he will be the Catalyst he will bring it uh the almost we hope every day will the end of the total occupation of Gaza and of the whole occupation of Palestine friends we live

ACP us and if you can't support us financially at all at least help us get our message out there share this program on your social media share it with your friends and family and co-workers and get it out as far and wide as possible we thank you dearly the next question I want to ask you it's about Zionism the Zionist entity Judaism because it every single criminal action that the Zionist state has done it's attached Jewish symbology to it which of course naturally leads to people wrongly equating Zionism with Judaism and it eventually leads to the promotion of a real form of anti-Semitism so it seems to me at least that the Zionist entity Israel is integral for the survival of anti-semitism not just in the way that it attacks uh rabbis within Palestine itself as you have referenced but also in the way it supports governments that have attacked Jewish communities all over the world for instance the funding and and various forms of military and intelligence Aid that the uh Israelis provided governments in Argentina and other far-right governments in Latin America that were deeply anti-semetic and that in various occasion were very violent towards their own uh Jewish community so in general what role do you think that the Zionist entity in Israel plays in keeping anti-Semitism itself real anti-Semitism alive that's so that it's so ironic and again if anybody uses the common sense and intelligence that God gave them he would have to come to the conclusion of truth of justice and and totally oppose Zionism and stand up vocally with all the power against it because as you say Zionism goes around and I was mentioning in the Arab and Muslim countries but through the entire world Jews were living in communities and people saw God-fearing people were practicing the religion and they looked up to them I know stories of people in Iraq I've met many I've heard many uh anecdotes narratives from from Arabs and Jews alike where they speak about how they lived in communities and all around the world and as I say in every Arab and Muslim land which I frequent and I meet to thank God and by demonstrations and so on and people told the stories of how their parents and grandparents they live together with Jews uh even heon there was just met today I was a demonstration by Columbia University uh because they they expelled a few students unfortunately tragically because they simply they were going out and they were demonstrating for the freedom of palestin and they of course accused of being anti-semitic now uh so we tried to clarify this uh and and I remind somebody came over to me and this Zionist uh supporter and he started asking what about this massacre that about the heon heon um for instance was in the 1924 I believe it was the massacre now uh that they killed Jews that was before the creation of the state so he says you see there's anti-Semitism so I said whoa um we have the writings we put out a book called uh traditional Torah opposition uh to Zionism and uh and and there we we we bring many of the documents the records of the anti- zist and of the zionists themselves well one of the documents we have is Rabbi Bor Kaplan of blessed memory Rabbi Bor Kaplan was a student in heon at the time and it was there was a rabinal college in hebon and he was a student there and he spoke about how the Jews used to stroll and take strolls the young students in the streets of hebon amongst the in the Arab neighborhoods and he speaks very just it's really nice to look through the whole the whole uh speech that he gave about that um it happens to be that uh there was there's a tree of that was considered Abraham's tree where the Angels sat under it's a very famous Stree and they would go to that place and on and on he would speak about and then the zionists came in 1920s they came on bicycles with guns and they said and and the rabbi the chief Rabbi of heon the school Rabbi Epstein of blessed memory is blood should be Avenged called um called the Zion as he said because he wanted to discuss that what are they doing there what did they come to heon for and when they they but they refused to even give him the the the uh the respect of coming to this Chief Rabbi of the of the uh of this uh the dean and of of the university the reinal college anyway so he they went out to them and they said they asked them they confronted them they said what are you doing here so they said oh uh we came to protect you so he said wo isn't us God you protect us these guys you just inciting the Arabs we were living together in total peace but these guys came as Zionist and they uh they they went and they they they made demonstrations by The Wailing Wall you know by the Western Wall by the Temple Mount and um and the result was and they demanded it's theirs the Temple Mount and so on and they just agitated and agitated and then they came to heon and they and you and they conflated Judaism with Zionism and the people of the of of heon gathered together the masses of course were're not condoning what happened but then they they they fell upon the Jewish community and and murdered uh the the totally innocent Jews um this Rabbi bar camplan of best memory a very famous Rabbi he was a rabbi who created the Beth Jacob girls schools in the United States after the war after the second world war and he was this uh student in that school they're very the distinguished Rabbi bless memory and he said he was hidden he was saved because the he was doring so to say in a in an Arab house and the Arab U landlord locked the doors so nobody could come in he saved the Jewish students there so but others were murdered so he said they were directly the cause the zionists were the cause of the agitating and of creating anti-Semitism but for the theists that's the the ironic and the sad part of this is they have a win-win situation they create hate they they they exacerbate anti-Semitism around the world directly because of their attacks on the people of Palestine and the Muslims around the world consider themselves um one nation and they and they stand up for the people of Palestine and and people witness the the the terrible this the the genocide and the horrific um inhumane treatment of the Palestinian people in Gaza and so on and people are witnessing this for 76 years and especially in these last um year and a half and so so automatically they and they don't know to differentiate between Judaism and Zionism so they're uh they they they they look at Jews as um as as uh villains and and they look at them as inhumane and compared to the Nazis and this is directly a a product of Zionism and their actions so the Zionism runs around they said they had to create a state to protect us although we as a Jew believe that God protects us and and we're forbidden to make a state but they they they spew uh heresy and blasphemy they they laugh at the Jews who look to God even though it's Judaism Judaism is a religion yes so we believe in God that God is the protector God is the almighty but they laugh at us scorn us they say no God we was God through ages so so we have to have a gun to protect us we have to have a state and we say that's forbidden God foresaw there will be people like you and that's forbidden to do God wants us living throughout the world uh so but they don't care and they ridicule and they made the state and they claim and you ask both the Zionist say yes the state is what protects us it's our insurance policy and then they they and and just in case you question that so they create anti-Semitism for instance when there was the famous attack on in France on the supermarket and so forth so the uh natano took a plane and immediately went to France and said to the old the Jews they should pack themselves up and go to to to move to Israel and even then the Zionist got so frustrated with him they told him he's a person NR so they create anti-Semitism and then they scream that they have to have the state to protect us because they create anti-em so it's very ironic it is a fact that that's that nobody with with with any uh common uh sense with any uh true perspective with any with a a straight look he cannot deny that it's Zionism that the cause of exacerbating anti-Semitism throughout the world and yet the zionists with theira with their huus they they turn around they keep on Yelling that they that Z that people hating Jews um and are anti-semitic because they um and they hate the State because they hate Jews and they're anti-semitic and they totally ignore the fact that they're the ones who are causing the anti-Semitism and and and and they demand that you should support their building of the state and even though that's so illogical that they by doing this what they're doing they're creating more and more and more anti-Semitism without any light at the end of the tunnel so it's really like you say it's it's just it's horrific and we believe it's satanic what they're doing it defies logic it defies logic how this the United Nations ratified a state in 1948 that would be called under a specific religion the state of Israel when you have in that country the majority of people were Muslims and the second largest community were Christians and there was the Jewish Community all three didn't want to be under the opes of the state of Israel yet they ratified that now the United Nations was created that there should be peace in the world that they should be able to adjudicate any conflicts in the world through peaceful means and yet they went and they created in a Holy Land in the land where there was a beautiful fabric of Jews Muslims Christians living together and they went and they created this Zionist state of Israel a state of Israel that's that's going to be uh named clearly under a single group that automatically means there will be Bloodshed so it defies logic it's satanic and it culminated in what we're witnessing for a year and a half the murder the mass murder of the people of of Gaza and God forbid it's going on further into the West Bank and on and on and on so it's just very very it's we believe it's the works of Satan but we didn't give up hope because the almighty is still the almighty and we believe that he will ultimately bring an end to this we pray it should be speedy and peaceful and we hope that the world will see this and understand not to conflate Judaism which is distinctly diametrically opposite than Zionism Judaism is subservience to God it's to practice the religion as we've had for thousand 3,000 years and for 2,000 years spread out throughout the world in every country peacefully and it's not this new relatively new movement of 130 years or so uh called Zionism which is a selfish flawed purely political material nationalist movement to take a land and simply claim the land and of people of the Palestinian people that's beautifully put and what we end up having is this sort of vicious feedback loop where the entity that's supposed to defend Jewish people from anti-Semitism is the one that promotes anti-Semitism uh the most uh and you also have this very interesting situation where it's a group of people who don't believe in God but uh nonetheless claim that God gave them the land of Palestine that's an insult to Pure to common sense to Common what God gave us sense that every person should understand this it's an insult to us the way they play the world absolutely Rabbi Weiss I I want to be respectful with with your time so this is the last question I'll ask you unfortunately because of the influence of the Zionist entity and uh the economic and social institutions of the West you we exist in a condition where most Jewish people in the west are socialized to think that to be Jewish is to be Zionist to be Jewish is to support the state of Israel and the institutions that they engage with uh throughout their whole lives existence leads them to that and it's been able to really grab on to the minds of significant portion of the Jewish community of the Jewish people I think perhaps some of this has been changing especially with the youth and as they've been able to sort of break the uh the the bubbles of Zionist narrative escape the ideological cave which is of course the name of the show The ideological Cave of Zionism because they've seen chronicled on their devices that are in their pockets their phones this genocide that's been just basically live streamed over the last two years but what do you think is the trajectory that uh we're going to see from the Jewish Community from Jewish people do you think that more and more Jewish people are going to be moving away from Zionism well first we always pray and hope to God and we we try we conol we plead with people that they should not be sneered and cned into falling prey to this Zionist uh propaganda the Zionist narrative because the zionists unfortunately use this fact that we just went through the Holocaust I mean relatively recently right it's uh um 80 years or so right people since the Holocaust and people are still alive thank god um of who are Holocaust Survivors I know many people as I my father-in-law passed on recently but I mean I mean a couple of years ago but but like he was in the death march leaving Al schwitz and like I say my grandparents so our communities you know it's now a blood we feel it people fear uh live that fear still because of many our children and grandchildren of of of Holocaust uh survivors um so therefore when the zionists come along and they you know constantly uh present the story as if we have a conflict of religion which is so bogus and so so revolting to hear that the the conflict is between religions Jews and Muslims and um and uh and that that it's simply that they're anti-semitic they hate the Jews and they want to kill the Jews and they're compared they they're connected to the Nazis and so forth even though like you say how how ironic because they they connect they themselves are with with the connect themselves to Nazi parties the Zionist but anyway but just getting on to that you know what they use because the those parties that are anti Muslim they get they use that connection but getting back to what I'm saying they they they they use this fear mongering and panic mongering so that Jews are a lot of people around the world the Jewish people they're they're told the narrative and um they started their narrative well before there was smartphones before there was internet and so forth when there was a few basic news outlets and they really embedded themselves in these news outlets and therefore they were able to tell this narrative that the that uh the Palestinian people simply hate the Jews that's why they don't want them and they were able to create this that in the many you know it's a given by many of these uh um in in the Jewish societies uh um I want to exclude from that the very religious communities who did who thank God almost entirely didn't for prate to them but the uh the ones that were non-religious or marginally religious meaning they compromised in the religion so these communities uh were able to were constantly hearing the the the B the bombardment of of of propaganda of the zionists and they were told that the uh that the Arabs Muslims want to kill the Jews so therefore it it's not only it's like a such they use the emotional issue of you know oh God is redem in us because they counted again on these communities that non-religious and the communities that are marginally religious what they call Modern Orthodox that that's really a terminology that's a euphemism for a compromised religion it's that's what it means modern they're not practicing it right so these guys are ignorant mostly of the fact that the Torah forbids us clearly forbids us since the destruction of the temple to create the Jewish sovereignty and we didn't for 2,000 years create a a Jewish sovereignty um ultimately we wait for the day when the almighty will reveal his glory throughout the world um and then we believe it will be a metaphysical change in the world and all Humanity will come up and serve God God will rebuild the Temple and the Muslims knew of our knows of our belief system and we know that we they know we have a distinctly different belief of the end of time of the messiah messiah and they believe they'll you know there'll be Muslim with you know with their uh moset and we believe that the almighty is going to reveal his glory and create a new a third Temple only without any human intervention so they know our different distinctly different belief but it was never an impediment to coexistence because the Muslim Scholars knew also that we clearly forbidden any Jew to take up arms to try to reestablish a Jewish sovereignty to to try to occupy another people's land they know that for us to steal a penny is forbidden uh you know so that that the only thing is they know they knew that we have at the end of time a different concept of what will be that there'll be a metaphysical change and God will be but it wasn't deemed the threat to the Muslim life because we we won't do anything in in you know for such an agenda while Zionism came along counting on the ignorance of the masses and they and and they started speaking emotionally about how we used to live in the holy land and God gave it us eradicating wiping out 2,000 years of existence that all the great rabbis and leaders of Judaism said no you're not that when Jews were impatient they said maybe we should build a temple maybe we should go and uh um create our country or so and they always said no we're forbidden and don't do it and we never did it even though we went through the Inquisition and Crusades and we went through the called the Golden Age of Judaism where they were much they had Jews were able to afford to re to to establish Jewish uh Homeland but we never did it but they the zionists count on the ignorance of the masses and they speak emotionally oh God gave it to us and that's why they were able to start their Zionist movement amongst the non-religious almost entirely and then some who were from the modern religious and then they used on top of that fear mongering that like I say you know Panic mongering oh now after World War II you see it's the Zionist are GNA I mean the Arabs the Muslims are going to try to kill you like the Nazis so you have to protect yourselves but now thank god um being that there's a lot of the alternative media the the um the internet and you know the people have it in their smartphones and so people are are starting to see through the holes uh in this false narrative they're seeing they getting information from the religious Jewish communities they're starting to see that the very religious communities don't accept it and they start have to ask questions why is it that the very religious communities who give their lives for their religion pay for private education and do everything uh strictly to abide by the Jewish law and yet when it comes to this critical issue of having a Jewish state they're not here they don't want it so something is fishy something has to be uh studied so you have that and then you have the uh many of the students who are simply seeing that what everybody sees this horrific murder genocide killing of innocent people and just simply by like yelling anti-Semitism anti-Semitism you know after a while people start seeing through the Hol in this and that see that it's a it's just a facade and its Force so we are definitely seeing a a change a great change um as I say I'm going to the universities I would just I just came from Columbia University where there was a demonstration full of Jud Jewish students and full of you know around the world full of Jewish people standing in the front of the opposition uh to to to what's happening in Palestine so we see that as a a factual great change um sadly a lot of these people are doing it simply because what people call human humanitarian reasons and we say that everything is humanitarian issue is godliness and we say they should be standing out of there out there and doing it because they should be practicing Jews like God made a covenant with us that we have to keep Sabbath keep kosher keep the Torah and they should be standing out there because in the Torah it forbids us Judaism forbids us to uh to oppress and to steal and to kill and to have a state of Israel so so it hurts us that um you know that the reason they're coming out there is because of the Sim lot of it common decency but a lot of them also say it's because of their Judaism that they're standing out there and it's definitely a large large movement uh really the the youth and the the people who were not indoctrinated for so many uh for 76 years you know they have the youth that is really coming out in droves and storing out tens and tens and hundreds of thousands we have people around the world Jewish people who are out there and condemning this what the Zionist state is doing um and some of them condemning Zionism in its entirety and the existence of the state some of them only their actions uh ultimately we hope that they'll all Embrace Judaism properly as I say and and recognize that the the that the existence of the state is the Rebellion against God and it shouldn't be at all there and what and and God should with his compassion as I say bring a speedy total and peaceful dismantlement of the state our approach by the way as we go to the universities and so forth and we approach president Trump and uh you know and just any prime minister or president or any country is we believe that we're required as Jews to be loyal citizens in every country reside so our approach to the president is always with playing uh um um um not you know how we we do not uh uh uh speak U um without respect we we we give out we uh we try we very careful to present the truth and hopefully in this manner uh doing what God Wills of us you know that we should go to the to the leaders of the countries and plead with them and and cajo and and and and and and show them the truth of how they're being misled they're being cond that in that manner they will do what what's right and they will uh which which is in their power which a lot of people of these leaders have power that they should stop in in immediately the the the the the horrific genocide in the Gaza and now in the West Bank and and the attacks on Syria and Lebanon and on and forth they can do it and I plead with them I say you are enjoying this great position you have because God blessed you to have this position at the same time you are looking at your uh constituents for the votes and so forth and you're intimidated because you're afraid of being attacked as anti-semitic which the zionists are very very successful at doing uh by by APAC and the um the Anti-Defamation League and all these all these disgusting organizations but um false organizations they're not Jewish but uh basically what we say to them but But ultimately it's God who gives you life to God you're going to have to answer and you to him you have to be thankful for the position you've got and one day you're going to be standing in front of God and not only that you're going to be standing in front of your grandchildren and just like people who are silent and who had the uh the the power to do something by by by when by Hitler and the Nazis uh and and people are very feel have guilt R guilt guilt feelings because they were silent then well you have to remember you're going to have to answer also one day to God and that's the true Place judgment where you're going to stand and uh and the college professors maybe they from the students who were standing against apartheid they were fighting apartheid possibly so they know that you that there're supposed to be a beacon of light and that's what the University was made for to be a beacon of light to step step out of the box and look for truth and to be create Future Leaders of the world so they should be these professors and Deans and presidents not ing these students they should be proud of them they should be honoring them they should be standing up front and saying we're not going to take any go we're not going to take any of this anymore yes there's pressure from the board and all the money uh uh deep Wells of money that supports the college but we're going to stand up and do what's righteous and what's right we plead with them and God will help one way or the other because it's the almighty he is the almighty and regardless of who's going to stand by with us we are cry crying and hurting with the people of Palestine we're going to stand together with them and God help till God with his ultimate Mercy will free Palestine and uh and we could live together once again in peace and Harmony Jews and Muslims and Arabs as we've had for so many hundreds of years that's wonderfully put and I think the work that you're doing is tremendously important because in part where you're showing and depicting this history that you're doing through books and and various documents is that there's a very rich and long history of Jewish struggles against oppression against colonialism and that in many ways the history of the Jewish people is much more aligned with the struggle for Justice For Freedom against colonialism of the
