Thank you for showing the actual position of Judaism regarding this fascistic and racist ideology. \nFor anyone seeking actual refuge from actual antisemitism, backed by an actual superpower, the Jewish Autonomous Oblast established by the USSR still exists in Russian Far East.  It still enjoys its special status and Yiddish (which is officially unapproved in Israel) is still taught in school.  One of three Yiddish theaters is still open.
