let's talk about the new york times and critical thinking this is quite an amazing article i honestly am surprised i mean now there's a part of me that wants to ascribe some kind of knowledgeable intent to what's being said but there's another part of me that thinks perhaps just perhaps they don't really know the implications of what they're saying and so i think that um excuse me it's it's really worth covering uh what is being suggested here in some detail because this is just read the title yeah if the title for anyone just listening on apple or itunes or wherever else is uh don't go down the rabbit hole critical thinking as we're taught to do it isn't helping in the fight against misinformation by charlie warzell i mean that's mad isn't it thinking about things yeah is bad yes and what this is is essentially a in a handbook for online fact checking uh which i think which involves no critical thinking which it explicitly tries to resist the idea of critical thinking because you might go down a rabbit hole and learn something that is outside of the pre-approved narrative and so it's like right okay the essentially what this is is a method for resisting paradigm shifts because in in any kind of intellectual endeavor you have a way of thinking about things upon which the endeavor is performed and that is going to be an imperfect method and so any imperfections will reveal themselves over many numerous iterations in a sort of bayesian fashion and eventually you'll have enough people on the outside of the paradigm to say there are things about this paradigm that need changing and in fact we have a new paradigm that not only incorporates the old one but also this new information that isn't being uh considered and this is a this is a handbook of saying well look what you can do is just never get to the point of encountering new information that challenged the dominant paradigm and maybe you should do that it's like the handbook for being an intellectual surf is what this is right so this this references several academics one of them is a michael caulfield who apparently has an odd request stop overthinking what you see online he's a digital literacy expert at washington state university vancouver which is an interesting title because i am also a digital literacy expert i've been on the internet for many many years and i'm literate in using the internet and therefore i'm an expert at it you are too in fact almost everyone who has been born after like two year 2000 is probably innately a digital literacy expert so it's good that uh mr caulfield has taken it upon himself to explain to us what we already know he says we're taught that uh sorry he says that at this very moment more people are fighting for the opportunity to lie to you then perhaps at any other point in human history as if fake news is near which is not right but the presupposition is anything outside of the ordained narrative is a lie is someone trying to misinform you he says we're taught that in order to protect ourselves from bad information we need to deeply engage with the stuff that washes up in front of us you'll get imperfect information and then use reasoning to fix that somehow but in reality that strategy can completely backfire as new york times say in other words resist the lure of rabbit holes in part by reimagining media literacy for the internet hellscape we occupy stay blue pills and know only the official narrative on any subject that's what's being told to us would the people in power ever lie to you would they ever mislead you of course they wouldn't of course they wouldn't as they say it's often counterproductive to direct engage directly with content from an unknown source and people can be led astray by false information in influenced by the research of sam weinberg a professor at stanford and sarah mcgrew an assistant professor at the university of maryland mr caulfield argued that the best way to learn about a source of information is to leave it and look elsewhere this is a concept called lateral reading what do you make of that callum the best way to learn about something is to not look at it yep but instead hear what we have to say about it yeah i mean that's that's the as anyone who operates online that's the worst thing possible you can do yep i mean endlessly hear about what people say about another person as if that's ever going to be accurate yeah it's it's the worst the worst possible uh way of learning about something lateral reading it's an amazing term for received information as well it is because you are you are depending on an authority source that you are trusting as being an authority on the information that they are giving to you which means that you have to know that that person is not only competent but also doesn't have a malicious intent to try and deceive your mislead or anything like this but literally do not become knowledgeable on a subject allow someone who claims to be knowledgeable on it to tell you what they want you to know that's amazing is it because like how do you know that person is knowledgeable if you haven't read the subject yourself how do you know they know what they're talking about they could be making anything up because they're not which they do they've got the the official credentials haven't they well exactly exactly it's all an appeal to authority uh but and the the great thing about this is like the the whole thing is couched in the idea that you can't trust your own understanding of something like surely me reading the thing would give me the best knowledge of what the thing is except no and this this comes to a problem of perception so there's quite a long running discussion in philosophy about how we know what we know and this is all informed by the paradigm in which we're in and so the things that we perceive are informed by our preconceived ideas of the intellectual landscape we're already in so i mean for those there's an example of uh in western uh thought in western science the fact that the heavens move was actually uh sort of prohibited ideologically by the church and by the worldview presented by the bible so the idea is that the earth is the center of the universe and the heavens are static which actually isn't found in like chinese astronomy because they didn't have that particular view and so they many centuries before the west realized by just looking at certain phenomena actually the heavens are moving and because it wasn't like verboten for them to say it they just incorporated it into their worldview of the universe and it took western scientists or proto-scientists centuries to actually come to the conclusion actually god the heavens are moving and then i think it was galileo who pointed this out and obviously he was then persecuted for being a heretic and it was like okay well this is a really great example of how perception of the the world is directly informed by your own paradigm and can hold back scientific advancement just because you're not allowed to look in certain areas so you just don't look you just don't think to look i mean the catholic church is a perfect example that talking about it the fact that bibles all used to be in latin and then the idea that should be in the native tongue so the native people would read it was verboten and as soon as they did they realized the priests were lying to them about things yeah don't don't learn latin let us tell you what to think uh anyway yeah so for instance imagine you were to visit stormfront a white supremacist messaging board as you do i mean do people know about this place is it just something that's just in the common cultural zeitgeist yeah i went to the bbc then i went to the telegraph then it went to stormfront the guardian yeah and then the guardian progression yeah yeah other way around really guardian then stormfront but but that's the thing like you're promoting now this white supremacist website i mean i've never even seen but there's a device okay let's say i want to go upfront and read what the neo-nazis have to actually say even though you may see through the horrible rhetoric at the end of the day you give that place many minutes of your time even with good intentions you run the risk of misunderstanding something because stormfront users are way better at propaganda than you you won't get less racist by reading stormfront critically but you might be overloaded by information and underwhelmed overwhelmed sorry so the the idea that i mean you re you run the risk of misunderstanding something that's a risk you run at all times in all places whenever you are attempting to understand anything so the only way to avoid the risk of misunderstanding something is to avoid attempts at understanding anything as in just again receive the information from the approved sources and you will have no problem understanding anything because you won't be you'll just be given just bullet point updates and sort of the npc script and this is a way of trying to get people to commit to that i just love some of the points though that if you're giving them minutes of your time as if that's bad yeah like if i want to read socialist literature well that's probably a problem yeah yeah the idea that even reading it even giving it the time of day is evil and of itself like you're agreeing with the neo-nazis oh without engagement with you by the verboten text how else could they do i mean you know you'll never run the risk of misunderstanding if you never try to understand i suppose so checkmate that's literally what he's saying though the goal of disinformation is to capture attention and critical thinking is deep attention people learn to think critically by focusing on something and contemplating it deeply to follow the information's logic and the inconsistencies and this is what what he's saying here or what they're saying here people then think critically by focusing on something and contemplating it deeply to follow the information's logic and the inconsistencies we could really just describe that as understanding that's what you just understand something and so the goal of disinformation is understanding it's interesting isn't it a weird way but not it's what they're teasing out for us from their view that the human mindset is a liability in the attention comp the human mindset is a liability in an attention economy your view of the world is a liability is limited by me being a human how else am i meant to interact with information the natural human mindset is a liability an intention economy as in there's a there's a perfect narrative that serves power in this regard and disinformation might cause understanding and that's a liability so you need to train yourself out of it it allows grifters conspiracy theorists trolls and savvy attention hijackers to take advantage of us and steal our focus whenever you give your attention to a bad actor you allow them to steal your attention from better treatment of an issue and give them the opportunity to warp your perspective your mind may be changed by information that allows you to have a better understanding of what you're being told but i mean even if i take him charitably there he's saying sort of you're human you're subject to clickbait or propaganda style things instead of long explanations well okay sure but what if i actually just want to look at it actually that's up to me but you risk polluting your own thought process with uh disinformation that's kind of the point yeah that's kind of the point that's what intellectual growth is yeah this is very much end of history thinking here as in there will be and what this what this kind of is is like the you know how we were talking about all of the narratives are harmonizing into one right and it's the kind of grand establishment mega narrative right i mean it's it's the narrative to contain all other narratives and what it says is most simple is anything we didn't say is wrong right and so if it comes from us it's right it's proved you can believe it you can trust it because it's authority and we said it's correct and anything we didn't say is an opportunity to warp your perspective is a way of disinformation helping you understand the subject you don't want to understand the subject you want to be correct and being correct is now a matter of power it's not a matter of understanding and what this is is the essence of totalitarianism everything we didn't say is wrong is the view of totalitarianism one way to combat this dynamic is to teach uh change how we teach media literacy internet users need to learn that our attention is a scarce commodity to be spent wisely uh which is weird because that sounds like me it sounds to me like they're saying become someone who is unable to commit time to deep research and study i mean why would i want that in 2016 mr caulfield met mr weinberg who suggested modeling the process after the way professional fact checkers assess information mr caulfield refined the practice into sort four simple principles these are called sift isn't that a nice acronym sift through that information right so the first one is stop the second one is investigate the source which means interrogate the source for political bias the third one is find better coverage which means find coverage that harmonizes with the mega narrative and the fourth one is trace claims quotes and media to the original context which is what we've just been advised against doing we aren't supposed to read the original sources because that might corrupt us or steal our attention i thought if this is not a claim where i have depth or understanding then i won't stop for a second before going further than just investigate the source at caulfield he copied mr kennedy's name they're referring to um a conspiracy theorist anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist as they describe the person um mr robert f kennedy jr i believe um he put it into instagram popped up in google and he said look how fast that is he told me he's accounted the seconds out loud in 15 seconds he navigated to wikipedia and scrolled through the introductory section of the page highlighting with his cursor the last sentence which read that mr kennedy is an anti-vaccine activist and a conspiracy theorist wikipedia is truth wasn't that easy this is the exact opposite of what any educational institution provides you yes it is or at least anyone that's that's still sane i suppose unless of course you control the mega narrative and wikipedia is a a propaganda piece an outlet a megaphone for that narrative if wikipedia is this the source of truth then the question is who's controlling the narratives on wikipedia is robert f kennedy the best unbiased source for information on a vaccine i'd argue no and that's good enough to know that we should probably just move on i i have a wager even his supporters probably think no they probably think that he's probably this guy i've just met is that not the best source on vaccines but they might find what he has to say interesting and that's up to them surely and he might be right the question of bias is often used as an excuse to essentially call someone wrong without actually pointing out why they're wrong because fundamentally they know that bias is a facet of human life i mean there's no not really any such thing as an unbiased source on a vaccine right if you're committed to in you know promoting it or you're committed to opposing it you're going to have a bias in either way because you've put effort and time and energy and you probably financially incentivized into one of these directions and even if you're not in that you've got an interest in whether you take a vaccine or not you know is the vaccine going to be good for your health is it going to protect you from a disease does it have any side effects you know you as a person who would take a vaccine you have a bias there too you know you know this is true for anything it's not just vaccines it's true for anything it's a topic in existence exactly this is just the example they gave and so the idea that there's like oh well is he the most unbiased source well no but it's kind of hard to find a source that's unbiased but unbiased doesn't mean factually inaccurate what we're looking for is would it be the most factually accurate source of information on a vaccine and well maybe it is maybe it's not i don't know i don't know who robert f kennedy jr is but uh but the point is we don't need to know because we've already established that he's a conspiracy theorist because wikipedia told us so and we don't listen to those people because the establishment the power have told us that that's wrong so we're just going to carry on and he's wrong about everything i mean this is great great advertising for the new york times like what does our journalism consist of reading wikipedia yeah exactly okay we get into that in fact right so um like if that's where it starts and stops uh well that's that's actually something he brings up he probed deeper into the method to find best coverage by copying the main claim in mrs kennedy's post and paste it into google search and the first two results that came up from france's agent press's fact check website and the national institutes of health quick searches showed a pattern mr kennedy's claims were outside of the consensus a sign they were motivated by something other than science that's not how science works exactly science is not based on consensus well it's it's based on consensus in regards to the evidence let's say but it is not absolute ever like it never can be because it wouldn't make any sense it's not even based on consensus to the evidence well like like we were speaking about the paradigms a minute ago um both the catholics and the chinese would look at the stars and see the same thing they'd have the same evidence but take different interpretations because of their own lenses their own paradigms form the way that they interpret the evidence and so it's it's not even that simple and this uh goes goes to a theory by uh kuhn about how scientific paradigms work and i think this theory probably is expandable to any kind of intellectual paradigm at all um certain things simply can't be seen within certain paradigms and you don't actually know what's going to lead on to a paradigm shift because there was a material that was hypothesized called phlogiston and this was meant to be some sort of liquidy gas that would be apparent when i know you put acid on zinc or something like this and it was a load of magical well not magical but scientific properties were ascribed to this substance and lots of people did various experiments based on the idea that this substance existed but the thing is this substance didn't exist but the results of those experiments produced information about things that we now use today and so despite the fact that it was a false paradigm if it wasn't for this false paradigm we wouldn't be in what we believe to be a more accurate paradigm now so the point is consensus actually means nothing people can have a complete and almost universal consensus on an opinion that's totally wrong the catholic church with the heavens moving the existence of flogistan as a as a material that influences the world these things are not true but they were consensus opinions and it was people outside of the consensus that brought us into the paradigm that we're in now where we believe that those things weren't true because the evidence doesn't support it and essentially what they're saying is our paradigm is truth which in and of itself is a very dogmatic and anti-scientific worldview it's unbelievably arrogant the sift method and the instructional teaching unit that accompanies it have been picked up by dozens of universities across the country and some canadian high schools good news your kids are going to be taught this and what's potentially revolutionary about sift is it focuses on making quick judgments a sift fact check should take 30 60 90 seconds to evaluate a piece of content so keeping people in a state of momentary suspense never engaging with anything deeply other than with a sort of oppositional position to check its relative position against the the mega narrative so it's effectively turning people into autonomous gatekeepers for this narrative and i think that's just amazing that they come out with this and that people aren't supposed to be aware of that's what's happening and that's what they're trying to promote the four steps are based on the premise that you often make a better decision with less information than you do with more do you agree with that john's already laughing in the corner do you agree with that in any way shape or form why the hell should i exactly like when when has anyone made a better decision with less information than more how does that work i mean if you're lucky i guess we should be relying on luck new frontiers of science are being pushed here get lucky this is like the word the witch theory from that what is it what what university was that she was like you can't explain african science which is black stuff it was a south african university how does the shaman call the lightning yeah but that's the thing how can how can you make a better decision with less information i mean like it just doesn't make sense on any particular level like prudence you know just general day-to-day decision-making like good decision-making requires practical wisdom but that means you have to have a good knowledge of your environment and what's going on within it more knowledge on what's going on around you will enable you to make more informed decisions which we would call better decisions but i suppose it depends on what you mean by better if better means more in line with the mega narrative then sure i mean you know less information might be great in fact you don't want people to have any information really which is presumably the purpose of this piece kind of scary isn't it it's very brave new world to me i mean literally you should not think about things let us do the thinking for you yeah i mean this goes in line with also a couple of topics we've covered i mean the youtubers being accused of abominable thinking you know how are the owl being visited for uh the police to check on his thinking yep you would have thought this kind of stuff would i mean we always talked in terms of like oh it's hates or this kind of speech or something i never thought we'd actually get into the realm of talking about thinking being evil but that's where we are now i guess that's where the new york times is now by this point we go to the 2020s this is this is where we're going yeah yeah absolutely think of crimes no we we are in think crimes spending 15 minutes to defend determine a single fact in order to decipher a tweet or piece of news coming from a source you've never seen before will often leave you more confused than you were before finding out the information about something will leave you confused and so we the world controllers will just hand down the information you need we'll take away those inconvenient books that had concepts in that will just leave you confused and we will hand you down the narrative that you need no more thinking required this actually reminds me of the npc meme because i don't know if you've seen the videos like when they read something they don't understand you see a little like wheel turning yeah and they leaves you composed that's what that is that's what that is before you click and realize they're telling you something is a lie it's like they're talking to grandpa or something don't tell grandpa about the internet because it'll just be confusing to him because it's outside of his world he doesn't understand it i don't want that that's awful the question we want students asking is is this a good source for this purpose or could i find something better relatively quickly uh mr corfield said i i've seen i've seen in the classroom where a student finds a great answer in three minutes but then keeps going and is one and and ends up won over by bad information god what i'd love to see the example he said me too but i find it really interesting bad information is to give it a kind of moral dimension this immoral information this disinformation that will give you knowledge about a subject because you looked at the primary source rather than look at the authority you should avoid that okay you know that's what we encouraging students to do yeah exactly that's that's deeply concerning in my view i mean you don't want to get whatever by bad information do you i don't know do i anyway they they say we've been trained to think that googling or just fact checking one resource we trust is almost like cheating but when people use so when people search google the best results must may not always be first but the good information is usually near the top often when you see a patent referring to google just take the first google result you get yeah it'll be something that supports the mega narrative you can trust it it's like cheating but it's not i mean we know from the the whistleblowers at google i mean endless numbers now that google does influence their search results in different ways to promote narratives that they promote i mean even their vice president said this he came to parliament and they were grilling him about this than the other and he says no no we we um we prioritize what was it the the promotion of um homosexual lgbt issues or something like this i have to get the link yeah i'll show you but they manipulate the certainty but he openly said this to the parliament in regards to them saying why would i search like straight couples do you end up with a bunch of gay people and i was like well you know the first result a straight white couple is two gay men but uh but the information you need is usually in the top often you see a pattern in the links of a consensus that's been formed but deeper into the process it often gets weirder it's important to know when to stop literally stop thinking know your limits this is like a harry enfield sketch right like you look it gets too much to think again it's like you know it'll confuse you it gets weird you don't need to know any of these things let us the approved thinkers think this for you you can just take the narrative it's like okay this is just a way of creating sheep you know creating like and the the sheep dogs will bark at them as they go near the edge and they'll be funneled in to whatever field they're supposed to be going into stop at the limits of the mega narrative because you know it gets weird and you don't be weird do you yeah again all this like moral judgment judgmentational language like why are you talking like this uh christine aladdin a political uh assistant political science professor at nevada university uh has seen the damage first hand her students had been checking like reading things without checking sources or looking at fake news it was just uncritical acceptance if it fit with the narrative in their head and complete rejection if it didn't which is a highly ironic statement because that's exactly what the new york times is advocating well you're promoting me that's what they want like the only uncritical acceptance well this is an article arguing for uncritical acceptance of the mega narrative the students are confused when i tell them to try and trace something down with a quick wikipedia search because they've been told not to do it not for research papers but if you're trying to find something finder for sites legitimate or somebody has a history of it as a conspiracy theorist then you show them how to follow the page's citation it's quick and effective which means it's more likely to be used which is interesting because what this implies is that wikipedia wasn't always a tool of the cathedral right it wasn't always just an avenue to prove promote the mega narrative on politics or on science or whatever it was but it seems that this has changed so now usually don't check wikipedia it's not you know verifiable it might be suspicious who knows you know you're supposed to do your own critical research and now it's just like well wikipedia is the thing you can trust this will give you all the information you'll ever need that's it i'm sure you've seen i think was one of the co-founders wikipedia actually came out and said it's now become a vehicle for leftist nonsense oh yeah yeah i remember that it was a couple of years ago wasn't it yeah yeah uh as a journalist who can be a bit of a snob about research methods it makes me anxious to use this type of advice use wikipedia for quick guidance spend less time torturing yourself with reality with complex primary sources a passive hang on like you're a child yeah yeah exactly a part of my brain hears this and reflexively worries that these methods might be exploited by conspiracy theorists i mean my brain hears this and things that might be exploited by tyrants and people who are well actual totalitarians who want control of everything that you think like the new york times but it seems like snobs like me have it backwards which i mean this is a genuinely incredible commitment to submission to authority on display here think about youtube conspiracy theorists or many q anon or anti-vaccine influencers i mean i don't actually i don't spend a lot of time worrying about youtube conspiracy theorists but their tactic is to flatter viewers while overloading them with three-hour videos laced with debunked claims in pseudoscience as well as legitimate information the illusion offers the in the internet offers the illusion of explanatory depth until 20 seconds ago you'd never thought about say race and iq but suddenly somebody is treating you like an expert it's flattering your internet in this intellect so you engage you don't really stand a chance right the core message here is you're not worthy you don't stand a chance you are not worthy this is beyond you you're actually incompetent just do as you're told by the power right but the thing is i don't see how explaining something in detail is treating someone like an expert if anything i would say that's the opposite of treating someone like an expert because if you're an expert in something you use shorthand to refer to something right so i i might say oh well the cooney and relative hypothesis on paradigm shifts means blah blah blah blah blah and you block what the hell is that right and so i have to explain well the paradigm informs the way you view things and so you actually have trouble viewing a new and a foreign paradigm from which and so i've got to explain because you're not experts right you you don't know what that is unless you are an expert in that thing and so someone taking like three hours to lay out a position to you is what you do to amateurs so it's just not not true anyway what he described as a kind of informational hubris that we have we have to that is quite difficult to fight but what sift and mr caulfield's lessons uh seem to do is flatter their students in a different way by reminding us our attention is precious so manipulating students oh they're manipulating them well we're gonna have to manipulate them too so the goal of sift isn't to be an arbiter of truth but to instill a reflex that asks something if it asks if something is worth someone's time and attention and to turn away if not because the method is less interested in political judgments and students across the political spectrum are more likely to embrace it by the end of the two-week course the students are better at finding primary sources for research papers and in discussion they're less likely to fall back on motivated reasoning which is amazing because all of this is motivated reasoning to protect the mega narrative the we have reached the end of history this is the truth right now we are taking the scarcest most valuable resource we have our attention we're trying to use it to repair a horribly broken information ecosystem we're think we're throwing good money after bad so we've arrived at like the end of history right the the truth will always come from one place and that place happens to be wikipedia and you don't need to spend any of your time doing anything else other than consulting that this is kind of reminiscent of a piece that was published on everyday feminism uh like five years ago now now this isn't like this used to be the sort of source we'd make videos on and just laugh at on the internet but this has become sort of mainstream three reasons that it's irrational to demand rationalism and social justice activism what a condemnation of social justice yes well that's the point like what a condemnation of what a condemnation of the new york times it is to promote wikipedia as an article of truth like well it's the same sort of principle and i mean the the i'm not going to go through this but like this is just hilarious right so and i love i love some of the quotes here right the scenario is all always the same i say we should abolish prisons police and the american settler state someone tells me i'm irrational i say we need decolonization of land and someone tells me i'm not being realistic well i mean they're right yeah they're right i just just tell you and so the criticisms why it's a rational say uh that you should be rational is that being rational has no inherent value disagree for many different reasons i mean if something like inherent value is an empty concept because all value is subjective so you can't have something that's inherently valuable because you need an agent who desires it to imbue it with value so there's no point saying that something has no no inherent value because by that by that logic i mean everyday feminism has no inherent value so that's a silly thing the next one is rationalism is a tool made to hurt us who's us i mean who thinks that and then and then the third point is we are enough without rationalism uh which is the opinion of the beasts i think they also agree that they are enough without rationalism if they don't need rational thought then what actually separates you from an animal i mean literally it was it was the fact that you were a rational that separated in aristotle's view man from the rest of the animal kingdom so what is it in in their point of view that separates them the answer is they don't know but um but the point is this kind of anti-uh critical anti-rational uh world view seems to be seeping into mainstream discourse in a major way like the the everyday feminism one is just you know here's the lunatic fringe and they've been you know banging this drum for years but now the new york times is literally saying well don't go down the rabbit don't don't engage in critical thinking you might learn things of which we don't approve and that might change your mind on stuff and you don't want your mind changed do you and it's like okay well i mean if you're telling me a lie then yeah i do i want to know what the truth is but uh anyway that took longer than i expected but uh it was just gold absolute gold yeah it's pretty [ __ ] i'm finding it hard not to swear at such things it's ridiculous isn't it yeah like don't think also by the way rationalism is now the enemy okay okay leftists not my position like this is this is but this is something we've been talking about a lot which is they keep running up against reality you know they kept battering against it and that's their problem as soon as they run into something that they that is in the real world yeah they have to declare that all real world things are the enemy yeah and it's it's easier if you just don't engage with that thing just just think what we want you to say then you can stay in the ideology nothing changes exactly then the real world doesn't affect you and that can carry on indefinitely we promise [Music] you
