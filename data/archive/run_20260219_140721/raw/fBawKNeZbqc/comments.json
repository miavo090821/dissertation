        "text": "And the reason you think it is \"gehh\" is you've been conditioned to think it is \"gehh\". Mostly through lies. Pithy one-liners that people regurgitate as \"gotchas\", that are based on half-truths, twisted logic, or outright lies. E.g. _\"Mao made millions starve\"_ Which if you stop to consider that China has had far worse famines all throughout its history, and what do you think happened in capitalist countries during the Great Depression, and that China has had 0 famines since the one under Mao, and that millions of people all around the world starve _every year_ in capitalist countries, this accusation begins to fall apart.\n\nAnother example: _\"Stalin sent people to the gulags!\"_ When the US has the highest prison population of any country in the world, both in total and per capita. The US population is only 0.3 billion, compare to China and India's 1.4 B each, yet the US still manages to have a bigger prison population than either of them. Many people die in prison who have not even been convicted of any crime who were waiting for a trial or hearing.\n\nYet another: _\"Every time socialism has been tried, it's failed!\"_ More accurate: \"Every time socialism has been tried, the capitalist class has done everything in its power to destroy it.\" Starting all out wars or coup d'etating democratically elected socialist or even just socialist-leaning governments and installing dictators, killing millions (3 M in Korea, 3 M in Vietnam, 1 M in Thailand/Malaysia, 100s of 1000s throughout S. America), not to mention the thousands who the dictators torture. The capitalist class also try to cut them off from the rest of the world (sanctions/embargoes) intentionally causing thousands if not millions to starve and suffer.\nThe capitalists will step on your neck and stab you and twist the knife around until you agree to be their slave; but all of it veiled in liberal: civility, decency, rule of law, maintaining order, upholding society, individualism, meritocracy, etc.",
