on the most recent episode of The Joe Rogan Experience momar Gaddafi and the US regime change effort in Libya got brought up and the show got pretty close to some actually intelligent political discourse here but there's you there was YouTube videos of open air slavery so you would watch people bid on people and you could watch it on YouTube and that was in Libya that was after they killed Gaddafi that's true Joe very good Libya went from one of the most prosperous countries in all of Africa to an impoverished country with open air slave markets unfortunately after this the conversation devolves into Joe just being amazed about the video footage of Gaddafi's death where us backed extremist groups bayonetted him in the rear end did you ever see the the video footage of them killing him no oh oh you have to see it so yeah I would have rather heard them talk about Gaddafi's plans to build an African Development Bank that would have allowed African countries to get off the US dominated Financial system which revolves around the IMF and World Bank who are notorious for trapping African countries in debt making them subservient to Western Finance Capital cuz that really shows the economic motivations that Hillary Clinton the US and NATO had for toppling the Gaddafi government which of course turned Libya into a total disaster and Hillary Clinton the architect of this regime change effort has never apologized for it and she actually ran for president a few years after it happened but Joe is just kind of like a middle schooler not to be mean he seems like a really nice guy but I feel like it'd be so much more interesting to look at the broader political implications of the regime change effort in Libya here rather than just being like wow look at this video of them shoving a bayonet up Gaddafi's butt like I remember watching that video in middle school and thinking it was crazy but now I look back at the regime change effort in Libya and I think it's crazy that the US state department in NATO toppled the leader just for their own economic interest you know what Joe just needs to let me on his show let me talk to him about some of this stuff I am the communist Joe Rogan after
