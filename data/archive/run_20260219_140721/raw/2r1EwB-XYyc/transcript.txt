hello everyone got a little something new for you today i'm gonna be responding to a video from vice news the company founded by gavin mcginnis and his friend using using government money in canada which has now morphed into a giant media outlet funded by disney the murdoch family as well as george soros giant news media outlet generally considered now a liberal outlet which is interesting considering the kind of career path that gavin mcginnis has gone on but that's not what we're what we're here to talk about in this video vice is going to compare donald trump to rome uh so we're gonna go through it here and break it down piece by piece let's [Applause] i do think that there is a lot breaking down i absolutely do not think january 6 is the high water mark of course not do i think something like this will happen again at some point in the next 10 years yeah absolutely i do [Music] if a political system does not come down hard on this kind of anti-constitutional anti-democratic attempt to overturn the results of an election what do you do with that if you can get away with it you're just going to keep doing it all right so these guys are legitimately asking do the capital riots show that america is crumbling like rome because when the state apparatus the government doesn't come down hard on the capitol rioters what does that say about our democracy i don't know what does it say about our democracy that the cia funded right-wing elements of the bolivian military in 2019 so they went into the bolivian capital and told the democratically elected evil morales to seek asylum in mexico a cia u.s sponsored coup to overthrow the democratic will of the bolivian people was it say that our state department deliberately did that i think that says a little bit more about democracy than the fact that we haven't thrown every single capital rioter in guantanamo bay when people say this is the end of the roman empire that's when i say i don't think that that's true this is not a situation where we are entering total state collapse and there is going to be like a kingdom of california i think that would be overblown the united states as an entity will continue on is this what people think the capital riots were are there a lot of people who think that america almost cease to exist it takes a lot of organization planning and class solidarity to overthrow a country's government just ask the cia it took a massive effort to overthrow the government of iran in 1953 bolivia in 2019 like we just mentioned these things take not only a lot of class collaboration consolidating with the working class in order to suppress whatever working class movement is rising up it takes an insane amount of resources and planning a lot more than a handful of trump supporters going to the capital had and if there was an organization who had the power to overthrow the us government how would the effect of that be california creating its own kingdom and separating from the united states i mean for me it's kind of a small point but it shows how little americans know about what happens when we actually overthrow countries governments it's not that the countries break into small states militia groups rise up of whatever political or religious background and they fight to gain the position of power that's now been created there is a vacuum of power that groups now fight for this is what happened after the usd stabilized libya after they destabilized iraq and that's why the u.s is still in iraq fighting this war against different militias in the u.s you would probably see a lot of christian extremist militias right people who like run mega churches trying to lead their congregation to take on the white house if america actually collapsed i don't know but you know what i mean uh when when you saw these power vacuums created in the middle east you have like islamic extremist groups because that is based on what their conditions are in the u.s you would have like white supremacists and christian extremist groups fighting each other for power it would be horrible but that's what the us does all around the world is create situations like that but when you're talking about its political system what does american democracy look like what does representative government look like participatory government looked like which the romans had the romans for 500 years the romans had like a fairly participatory system because those guys did still have to troll for votes they still needed to win elections in order to get ahead so i think that there are things that we can talk about in terms of the political system transitioning from representative democracy to an autocratic regime the roman political and economic system was kind of similar to the one we have in the u.s but not through the ways that this guy is going to say rome had a similar mode of production in that they had coined currency so they still had slavery but they had a similar class system to what we have in the us where you have the capitalists who own money and the majority of people work underneath them and a lot of class struggle between these classes is what drove roman history if you read michael parenti's the assassination of julius caesar you hear him making the argument that caesar was essentially a populist he was against the wealthy landed classes in rome at the time who had come to control the political system and he fought for the working masses who were arguing for a better standard of living and demanding a better standard of living from those who had the coined currency so there is actually a lot that we can learn from rome the united states of america which is of course modeled on the roman republican system has institutions just like rome did with the consulship and with the tribunet where if you just start investing power and authority in one part of that system you can keep the window dressing of a house of representatives in a senate and a supreme court but we see this in sort of constitutional dictatorships with the window dressing of democracy but actually it's just an autocracy a dictatorship with the window dressing of democracy huh and you don't think that sounds like the united states at all you think that the people are making the decisions in the united states you think that the people are choosing to go to war the people are setting the tax plan the people are setting the wealth distribution the people are deciding how things are produced no of course not a dictatorship of capital a dictatorship of the capitalist class with the window dressing of liberal democracy is what the united states is right now and you see putin there at the end of that video and i'm not a defender of the russian federation but what makes them a dictatorship that the u.s doesn't do because they put alexey navalny in jail the u.s is currently putting daniel hale in jail a whistleblower who shared information about the u.s drone striking civilians as edward snowden did as chelsea manning did and as all these people did who the u.s state department has promptly gone after and thrown in jail or the u.s legal system i should say is russia a dictatorship because they supported assad the u.s has backed extremist rebel groups in syria for over 10 years assad was democratically elected he just won election with over 80 percent of the votes and you're going to tell me that the u.s is supporting democracy in syria whereas russia's a dictatorship when the us is funding extremist groups who are killing people and launching missile strikes in the area no of course not i mean what a joke the u.s is a dictatorship of capital with a window addressing of liberal democracy people aren't making the decisions capital is and by the way as i'm editing this before you all call me a supporter of russia you could call them a dictatorship too they're run by oligarchs in the u.s we call them billionaires in russia they call them oligarchs but the us is a dictatorship too that's all i'm saying okay please the american political system is well primed to move towards a presidential autocracy right the the office of the presidency and the executive branch the institutional framework is there for that office and the white house to become something like a truly imperial presidency not just as a metaphor but truly an imperial presidency that will come when these ambitious people and these ambitious politicians really just throw elections out the window and it all just becomes a power grab free-for-all where power is all that matters and nothing else does oh no you are telling me that america may become a true empire where all the politicians are obsessed with power well what have i been living in for the past 24 years of my life what is our current system if this is not an empire where the politicians are obsessed with power i would hate to see what that looks like tell me about i have a question when the u.s overthrew these countries that i'm putting on screen right now was that not true imperialism did they not have a true emperor for president when they were overthrowing democratically elected countries what is true imperialism to you you said earlier in this video that in a dictatorship people are fooled by the window dressing of democracy but in reality there's a dictator well vikes it seems to me that you've been fooled by the window dressing of our democracy and you can't see that capital is the true dictator and you take that mentality which i do see floating around out there the only thing that matters is power and winning and an institution like the presidency that is well primed to become an autocratic entity you put those two things together and you've got uh an american dictatorship oh yeah you see hunger for power out there just kind of floating around out there here and there there's a few people who seem a little bit power hungry you know not like jeff bezos or elon musk right just donald trump someone else like donald trump is going to turn the position of presidency into a dictatorship if trump could not use that office to turn the u.s presidency into an autocracy then no one's going to be able to do it not because he's so smart but because he's power hungry and he tried every step along the way to use his executive office to shut down the checks and balances but it didn't work he's not the president right now they had a riot but nothing happened so what is this fear of trump turning the office of president into a dictatorship the roman republic what happened there was it got down to a point where ambitious men who wanted power stopped caring about the various rules norms laws that govern their behavior ah see it wasn't the class forces that i was talking about in rome fighting over political power and material benefit it was actually that they had a representative democracy of very kind nice and respectable gentleman and then eventually those gentlemen stopped caring about all the rules of law and rome collapsed and turned into a dictatorship that's how it happened according to vice this is true don't look it up hopefully the us will never follow this terrible path of having our nice kind respectable leaders become power hungry and selfish i would never want to see what a country like that would look like what happens if you lose an election what happens if you don't get command of a legion what happens if your rival is going to put forward a popular bill and give them more votes and more clients than you're going to have make them more popular than you how do you respond to that and for 500 years they mostly just kind of did it in a round-robin rotational system where everybody was kind of happy and then around about the 50 or 60 years before caesar right all that started breaking down and they started escalating with each other see look at the way they describe the fall of rome right they do not look at the class forces they do not look at historical development they say for 400 500 years everything was going good and then caesar took over as a dictator and they killed him right compare that to the analysis of parenti in his book the assassination of caesar that i've been talking about where you had class forces for years developing and and discontent among the working class and those who did not have coin currency and who were who were being exploited and who did not have the same standard of living as those who had bought the political class rise up and have a populist leader in caesar who is then eventually killed in an act of class solidarity among the class who actually has the coin currency what makes more sense what sounds more realistic and like it happened in real life that or everything in rome was going good for 500 years until dictator caesar took all the power and then people killed him of course it was the class forces of course it was the development of history but this is why liberals are bad at politics and bad at historical analysis in general they have no class analysis so they end up obsessing over the personalities and the psychologies of people in wealth and power as you see them here drawing parallels between the people and wealth and power in rome hundreds and hundreds of years ago versus the people of wealth and power today donald trump and they go oh is this how history works what connections can we draw between these people of wealth and power no you ding dongs it's the class forces that drive history and the argument that parenti makes in that book is that we allow history to be told by bourgeois historians at the time in rome most of people who can read and write were those who were wealthy so those people like cicero who you may have heard of are the ones we allowed to write history now you have wealthy liberal outlets like vice today taking the same narratives from the wealthy landed class of the time and repeating them so we don't see the true motors of history because liberalism is based on a lie they can't show us that class forces drive history they just have to endlessly distract us by talking about the psychologies of julius caesar and donald trump and telling telling you that america could become a dictatorship any day or they could collapse similar to the roman empire when in reality the only thing that's going to cause that or cause a real change in political power is the conflict between class forces rome held elections every single year there is an election it's going to go against some candidate that candidate has on retainer sort of armed gangs and they said i'm probably going to lose this vote so on the day of the election i need you to come in with your gang and rough people up and beat them up they had their voting earns right like literal physical voting earns that you would vote into and they would knock them over basically to wreck the election itself i'm not going to accept that my rival got command of this potentially lucrative campaign in greece i want that campaign for myself so i'm going to send gangs to try to push his supporters out of the assembly so i can win the vote all of these things influencing elections via paramilitaries and gangs using violence to control democracy the u.s has done and the u.s did in bolivia in 2019 we were funding violent right-wing gangs who were beating people as they went and tried to vote for the socialist party so so far vice everything that you've described as dictatorship the united states already does so i'm failing to see how the us can transition into a dictatorship when we're already doing all this after the revolution of 1830 there is a moment when lafayette has to go out and stop a mob of people who are going to try to swarm into the national assembly building because they think that the people inside the national assembly building are writing a a new constitution for france that's more conservative than they would have preferred and so you had you did actually have like a mob coming in to stop the national legislature from doing what it was doing those things i see happening right now in the united states i think we all saw something like that happen on january the 6th the fact that they keep comparing the french revolution to the capital riot shows how little these people think about class the french revolution happened when the working people the masses the peasants didn't have enough food to eat while you had the aristocracy in the monarchy living in luxury so that caused a revolution and when they put a representative democracy in power and that democracy started writing too conservative a constitution you see another mob of people say hey move that constitution to the left to put more working class power in it the capital riots were not that at all the data shows that most of these people were business owners or land people who own land not people in the lower or working classes this was not a working class uprising this was mostly professional managerial class people who must spend too much time on the internet and got sucked into q anon or something so that they were willing to storm the capital but not a working class uprising for bread against the monarchy and the aristocracy who are living in luxury it was a you know as i said a middle-class bunch of crazy trump supporters and the fact that vice here is comparing the two as if it was the same group shows how little they think about class and what constitutes a class because really what january 6 was about was trying to disrupt the legal transfer of power from one party to another from one candidate to another from one person to another and they're just trying to get in the middle of that and use force and intimidation to stop that process which is a very different thing from the more famous moments that you see in in other revolutions or in other moments of history but there are many parallels to this this is unique for this moment in american history is not unique at all in terms of world history well i don't even like that they're still calling the capital riots a revolution but at least they acknowledge that there are differences between the capital riots and the french revolution although they don't elaborate on what those differences are for me the only similarities are that you can see the state here stepping up to protect the political class right when you had the mob of angry peasants and workers trying to attack the national assembly or demand something different lafayette and the state the military come suppress it when you have a group of angry trump supporters try and storm the capital the cops stop it and suppress it although less violently than they do when they see an unarmed black person usually but even still that is not the same thing again the french revolution was demanding bread and an increase in the standard of living for the conditions of workers the trump riots were a bunch of q anon people so the example of lafayette coming out to put down the french protesters is an example of the state suppressing an actual class struggle an actual demand for an increase in the conditions of workers the cops just beat up a bunch of middle class angry trump suburban people and what is with this hyperbole about trump almost becoming a dictator and we almost saw the fall of america you think if the rioters would have successfully thrown everyone out of the capital they would still be there today like running the country and making decisions that's not what happened it takes way more organization and coordination than that and class solidarity to that to overthrow a country's government you can't just walk into the capitol and stay there they still wouldn't be at the head of most positions of power in the united states like yes obviously the capital riots were bad and violent but these people did not almost seize power stop acting like they did they caused property damage when i have looked back at you know all through revolutions and all through the history of realm the unique factor about trump is not what he tried to do we're going to walk down to the capitol or that he's a bad ruler because when people ask me is he like louis the 16th or is he like you know czar nicholas the the answer is those guys were actually in my opinion better rulers and actually better politicians frankly than than donald trump was and those are historically bad ruler how do you measure in the abstract which of these leaders is better the historical conditions they were living in economic political military were all completely different louis xvi and czar nicholas were the heads of feudal monarchies who saw their governments overthrown by working class and peasantries who were literally starving due to the economic policies that they enforced the revolution in france that overthrew louis xvi was the peasants organizing against the monarchy and the powerful church who had been hoarding wealth and bread as the peasants were starving their intellectual leaders and philosophers were the enlightenment thinkers who were pushing ideas like freedom and secularism that the united states actually ended up being founded on different from that the revolution in russia that overthrew czar nicholas was led by lenin in a group of industrial workers and peasants using the philosophy of marx they wanted to move to socialism and it was a much different revolution and a much different group of people than the french revolution marx deciphered these by calling the french revolution a bourgeois revolution and obviously the russian revolution then would be a socialist revolution the capital riots wouldn't be anything like either of these two and trump would be nothing like either of these leaders and i don't even know how you're comparing how good they were but don't worry he will never explain i guess vice just likes to throw shade at trump and say he's worse than some of the people who are considered the worst leaders of all time so great journalism you kind of have to look at what was going on with some of the teenage emperors in roman history in terms of just how kind of flippantly nonchalant they were with the power that they had at their disposal and not like sort of the the excessive horrors that we know from like tv like with caligular with nero she'll have a new name neuropolis city of nero what does trump do that makes him similar to teenage dictators in rome he has a lot of meltdowns on twitter and he fires a lot of his advisors or people in his cabinet because he's extremely thin skinned so that just means we have a man-baby in the executive office that doesn't mean he's similar to a teenage dictator like caligula caligula who literally killed random people until he was assassinated for being a total tyrant the only connections that i can even think of between caligula nero and trump is they all had an appetite for sexual degeneracy and they all hoarded wealth but i think that shows more about the psychology of wealth and power than it says about the unique personality traits of trump that connect him to caligula but forget the connections between trump and roman emperors what has trump done different from past u.s presidents that makes you think he's a dictator similar to these roman emperors because he launched missiles at syria obama and biden did that is it because of his cia coup in bolivia almost every president has done a cia coup and obama overthrew the libyan government leaving their country entirely destabilized in a disastrous situation is it because he funded israel's apartheid in palestine every u.s president has done that since 1960. these are all extremely violent undemocratic acts that have been committed by every post-world war ii president because we already have a dictatorship and nothing changed with trump capitals always been calling the shots and capital was calling the shots with trump when they did all these heinous imperialist acts overseas these things are done for the expansion of capital they are not done on a whim they are not done because of the personalities of presidents they are done because politicians like evo morales come to power in bolivia and nationalize the industry meaning that industry no longer belongs to western corporations it belongs to the bolivian people and the us cannot have that so they go in and they undemocratically overthrow this country that's not something that trump brought along that's something that the us has been doing forever and then when you have liberal outlets like vice here who have no analysis of class and they're trying to explain dictatorship they can't they're totally confused they're left grasping at straws and deeply analyzing the psychology of a bunch of random leaders throughout history who they've deemed to be dictators because they don't understand that we already have a dictatorship of capital and it is in fact class forces and now market forces which drive things the reason people from vice think that trump's a dictator is because they don't know what a dictator is they don't know what a dictatorship is because they've always lived in a dictatorship pretending to be a democracy the fact that trump is more brash than obama the fact that trump is mean on twitter the fact that trump is not politically correct these things do not make him a dictator although liberal world will tell you that's how things work a dictatorship is when you control the economy the military and the state and the u.s state economy and military is controlled by those who own capital and it has been for a long time but just in terms of temperamentally and how they wielded the power that they had at their disposal so what what does the quote-unquote american caesar look like or the american sula or the american marius like somebody who's gonna come along and really push the system over and grab a hold of it i don't know that we've seen exactly what that playbook looks like but donald trump has shown us plain as day how much people are absolutely going to be willing to go along with that if and when it does come along that was an interesting conclusion there obviously trump didn't almost destroy our system right i mean there was a story that came out that apparently trump tried to pull out troops from almost every country where u.s troops are stationed in like the last week of his presidency but of course this was blocked by the pentagon because as i've been saying the executive office is not the position of a dictator there are checks and balances to make sure that capital remains in its place as dictator also trump basically summoned a riot of his angry minions i'm kind of downplaying the capital riots a bit here but obviously this is a violent event it's a big event um and and this shows us something about the current makeup of american politics but what is it i mean i have two conclusions conclusion number one the political class can be beaten watching donald trump run through the republican primaries and then beat hillary clinton essentially the human crystallization of the liberal or democratic ideology in america it showed the political class has a lot of money and power but they can be beaten we do still have elections and they technically still can lose these elections trump had an anti-establishment anti-elitist mindset and rhetoric he spoke to the working class told him he was going to end free trade deals the neo-liberal policies that have destroyed the american working class and he said he was going to end the wars because people are tired of wars and i was making fun of these people for comparing the trump supporters to the russian revolution but the the bolsheviks during the russian revolution said peace land and bread right we're gonna give you peace land and bread because the russian workers were tired of fighting in world war one that was basically trump's campaign slogan and he won with it right he beat the entrenched ruling class he didn't get anything done when he was in office he didn't actually do peace land and bread but he showed that we can gain political power in some way via the voting booth via electoral politics the current ruling class is just old and kind of dumb honestly i think it's about time we got rid of them they're getting too complacent so what's the second thing we learned from trump though the second thing that not the capital riots but trump's whole presidential presidency shows us is that there is worker discontent in this country people are willing to latch on to a populist leader i would argue that more people latched on to trump's rhetoric about bringing back manufacturing helping american workers and ending the wars then they latched on to his anti-immigrant more xenophobic rhetoric the working class in this country is seeing discontent they're not as overworked and starving like the russian working class in 1917 or the the french peasantry who overthrew the monarchy but american workers 78 are living paycheck to paycheck their cost of living is going up and up and they're extremely overworked and they're increasingly feeling like they do nothing at their job like all the actual manufacturing and industrial jobs are being automated or shipped overseas while americans are being pushed into the service sector there is a discontent and there were mass protests over trump's presidency that proved that if we have enough leaders and enough organization of that working class we could make a serious press to gain political power but once we gain political power we would actually fix the problems that are hurting people which is where trump fell short so let's capitalize on this discontent let's give the working class somewhere to put their discontent something to do with their discontent something more than what donald trump gave them he lied to them and used their votes to gain office joe biden lied to them said he was going to be the most working class president this country had ever seen or the the new fdr he was going to support unions it's a lie none of this is going to go through joe biden is a corporate puppet so let's talk to the working class though let's explain to them what the failures of liberal democracy and the failures of neoliberalism explain to them how class struggle and organization can help us actually seize political power and actually create a better world where the masses of society don't rule over us in a dictatorship of capital all right this has been eddie smith thanks for letting me review
