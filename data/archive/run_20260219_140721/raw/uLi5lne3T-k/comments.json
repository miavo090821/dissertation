You guys are all based and this is why I'm still subbed to you both because both channels are for the working class and poor via which socialism can work and we do need to come together or else this capitalistic system will just keep on being divided and distracted. I admit years ago back in the late 2010s I was supporting Bernie and was a Bernie bro democrat to the core but then after he betrayed us all in late 2020, I decided to dem exit and ever since then I learned and grew through these channels such as Midwestern marx, Revolutionary Blackout Network and other good leftist, socialist and communist channels. Then I became a full on socialist that wants real change for the people such as universal free healthcare, free rent, higher wages for the working class ect. We do want the same policies that Bernie used to talk about when he first ran for president but we are just tired of old boomers that have been in office far too long. This is why we need term limits as well and no more lifetime appointments such as on the supreme court. Take care Dr. Carlos L. Garrido and Rathbone and good show earlier.",

Tell me honestly. what do you gain, did you saw any changes, to be honest with you, I saw nothing, it was always the same old BS using identity and cultural rhetorics in winning your votes but never a concreate economics development plan. Why I use the No Kings event as the subject to warn Americans, because the billionaires understood what you wanted, so they manipulate you into attending the event and protest about it. While you were protesting, many of the speakers up there were bought by the corporations. Only you ignorant fools continue in believing the anti-oligarchy tour, it's all a facade, they are all part of the system and club and just because they say the loud part out and exposed the corporations does not mean they are the good guys. That was exactly how people fell for the political theatrics performance these politicians are great at roleplaying. If you really want change, stop voting for the democrats and republicans, otherwise you will continue to be trapped by the tribalism echo chamber which was created by the Ruling Class Elites.

    "text": "Everyone sees things subjectively, bit we don't have to immediately declare we are right based onnthe evidence that other is wrong; we can accept the validity of everyone's grievances.  I dislike the idea that leftists and others often hold that because their grievances are legitimate that only their solutions are acceptable, \"as proven\" by pointing to their grievances.  This is same logic that people apply to Trump being bad and conclude that Democratic Party is solution.  \n\nI'd like to hear more about sound money, or other specific central banking & credit creation & currency reformation.  This private corruption of fiat money creation powers is I think the central corruption of capitalism from which all others follow.  Simply taking central banking out of private hands woupd cure capitalism of most internal problems.  There still might be nationalist temptation to pillage abroad, but if workers for example were paid in silver there would not be possible the current situation, or long term accumulation of capital extremes, or disposession of workers, and thereby wouldn't be infinite money spigot controlled by cartel-like collusion of capitalist elites.\n\nLike N Dakota has a public state bank, or various presidents like Andrew Jackson killing the private-public banking cabal.\n\nBut leftists talk about redistributing tax and budget without recognizing that the currency itself is hacked & insecure, like doing arithmetic without defining invariably the values of numbers.  The math doesn't work!\n\nSo beyond acknowledging grievances, please work to provide a post-fiat, post-Keynesian currency & banking system, and make that central to the economic programme.  Without this the leftists cannot put hands on the wealthy, and settle for riotous mayhem against those within reach, namely the poor and beleagured humble petite bourgeois and poor Whites, blue collar workers that are not trans, etc.\n\nSo if you've got'em, show your cards, and if you don't, please endeavor to address this unavoidable economic fundamental.  Thanks.\n\nHR is anarcho-tyrannical, so is academia and others- rightwing with leftist characteristics, so small independent sole proprietorship like working as 1099 seems like only path... then leftists especially professional bourgeois academic marxists come and declare the enemy is the deplorable blue collar worker, while programs are intended to be avoidable by upper class professional ivy league progressives, while the masses are told they are class traitors for not signing up to discrimination by \"leftist\" elite narratives.\n\nThere then seems to be no intelligible solutions offered, but interminable subjective jockeying, in which case the solution is to accept world is f'ed and seek to minimize inevitably corrupt and elitist collectivists and fabian socialist style progressivism.\n\nIf leftists cannot address central banking & sound money they can be expected to simply grasp what is within their reach, ie never the wealthy.",
