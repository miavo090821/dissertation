Sadly the Cuban young generation believes it’s a lie according to my Cuban comrade, he told the young generation love American rap stars and think the embargo is a government lie.

Sure, there are clinics but literally medicine. Hospitals exist, but they don’t have running water or proper equipment. The embargo doesn’t stop Cuba from buying food or medicine from other countries; our government simply doesn’t prioritize it.\nThe economy was never perfect under Batista, but comparing 1950s poverty to modern Cuba’s total collapse isn’t a victory.
