so in one of my last videos i broke down a fox news segment and talked about how fox news is the propaganda arm of the republican party and today we're gonna break down a cnn video because cnn is the propaganda arm of the democratic party um and this is a really revealing segment here by chris cuomo as the democrats are trying to prove that trump was directly responsible for the capital riots we're going to see how cnn works essentially as just blatant propaganda for whatever the agenda of the democratic party is um while while horrible things are going on you know they're not they're not going down to the border and checking about seeing if joe biden's doing anything about the kids in cages they're not talking about the war machine obviously um they keep us distracted with nonsense like this so let's watch and then we'll discuss 13 minutes that's all that really should have resonated with senators today 13 minutes was the duration of the video compilation of the events of january 6th one of the worst days in american history and trump was all over it and what was wrong about all of it was obvious the hats the faux flags being used as battering rams and most of all the anger anger and animus against our country's laws that led to an insurrection attacking our democracy that is the story of january 6 and it is one that may not be giving an ending in the trial that we're watching other than the presentation of the horrifying reality that brought these senators together today this day today was a farce after all there's only one reason this trial is being held after trump's defeat and that reason is senator mitch mcconnell mcconnell asked to kick the trial until after trump was out of office this is a fact he never said he was doing that because they had to consider whether or not it is proper to try a president so late in the game that is a fact he said he wanted to give the trial the time it deserved he lied he voted to say it wasn't constitutional he didn't know that then it was another bait and switch democrats how many times will you pet the snake so even though trump is officially out of office now cnn still can't help but milk every last dollar they can out of the media spectacle that is trump they can't stop focusing on his personality his twitter his legal battles um not what he's been doing in terms of governance right not his increasing of drone strikes not his sanctioning of iran and venezuela in the midst of a pandemic they have covered the coven 19 crisis a little bit only because it's been very convenient for them to attack trump's comically poor response to the covid crisis and pandemic not that um now that joe biden's in office nothing has changed of course because the these liberal democrats of ours don't actually care about the working class but um when trump was botching the covet 19 crisis they were able to offer vague platitudes um and it had and strange attacks against trump um and play trump's ridiculous statements about kovit on repeat and bolster cnn's ratings um and that's exactly what they're trying to do here trying to um the hyperbole they are using about the capital riots are incredible you know one of the worst days in american history an attempted coup you know america knows nothing about coups ignore in 1953 when we overthrew muhammad mosudak in iran um ignore when we removed the democratically elected salvador allende and put augusto pinochet in power who promptly rounded up 20 000 leftists and murdered them in a soccer stadium um these were not um these acts that america did um were not horrible because they took place elsewhere right they didn't take place here this was so bad because it was americans attacking other americans and trying to steal aoc aoc shoes or whatever this is just america getting like a fraction of what we've imposed on the rest of the world especially the global south um it just shows how pompous and elitist these people are like chris cuomo you can hear you know how dramatic he's making it in his voice this was a coup and you know what it's all the republicans fault it is trump's fault it is mitch mcconnell's fault that this happened um but let me show you something let me show you a report from a real journalist ali vargas who was at the capitol riots or or who got this from the capitol riots um which showed you the kind of elements who were actually there at the capitol riots we had the fulan gong iranian monarchists as well as cuban gusanos now what are these groups these are cia backed and funded groups who the cia backed and funded in order to destabilize countries um that that were taking a left-wing economic path iran towards nationalizing most of their industries and centrally planning things and then china and cuba obviously had communist revolutions um and the u.s tells you uh over that the the groups they're backing overseas are these humanitarian groups who are standing up for democracy and human rights but it's a lie these are far right wing extremist groups so then when some of these far right wing extremist groups settle in america they're participating in things like the capital riots so you see how this this was not um trump or mcconnell's fault these capital rights i mean partially of course part of it lays on trump you know and his his cultish followers but a lot of the elements here were right-wing groups who have been who have been propped up by the cia you know and of course we know there's only so many disaffected trump voters who are susceptible to his his brand of fake right wing racist populism because we don't have socialism right because 78 percent of workers live paycheck to paycheck um so they're they're willing to follow anyone like trump who says i'm gonna end the wars and bring your jobs back even if it's a lie you know and he's able to trick them you know into being violent and angry but it's not all trump and mcconnell's fault right as as is proved by the fact that cia backed groups um showed up here and and were rioting right alongside the trump supporters and you even had people trying to blame um chris cuomo doesn't do it here but um i believe rachel maddow was doing this and maybe jake tapper they were trying to blame the capital riots on russia you know um this same the same story with russia as biden's announcing that where the us is going to crack down on russia we're going to be harsh on them ignore the fact that trump increased troop presence around russia um and increased our our true presence and and our destabilization efforts against syria who's an ally of russia um forget all the things he did that were hostile towards russia but it wants to be more hostile and actually it was russia's fault for the capital riots you know not the cia's fault for backing right-wing extremist groups and one last thing just to show you how much hyperbole liberals are using about this coup this attempted coup of disaffected trump voters breaking things at the capitol look what brooklyn dad defiant who who gained a following by tweeting mean sassy things towards trump said uh he compares the capital riots to 911 and says the capital riots were in fact worse because it was americans attacking americans and not a foreign country attacking us right because we in america would expect those darn dirty muslims in the middle east to attack us but not us good god-fearing americans we would never riot and kill people like how do these people think the world works it is insane to me one but but to the main point i want to make is you wonder why trump got so popular right people wonder how could conservatives fall for this cult of personality right um this guy who offers blind patriotism yeah america where america make america great well you have the other side you know and trump of course ran against hillary clinton who was kind of the epitome of liberalism but the other side is comparing when trump supporters break some stuff at the capitol to 911 when when three thousand plus people died and when you know firefighters were showing an act of real patriotism and real heroism running into that building risking their lives and many of them did die to save you know their fellow americans and it shows that collective spirit that humans have that capitalism hasn't quite eroded yet right we're still willing to run into a building you know and and die for our fellow americans or some of us are um and then you have the liberals saying thing downplaying this event and saying it doesn't matter at all and of course you know i disagree with how the neoconservatives in this country use 911 to lie us into all these wars but i'm still not gonna come out here and say that this fake coup attempt where trump supporters broke some things and and yelled uh racist stuff at the capitol was equally as bad as the 911 terrorist attacks because i understand fox news is gonna take that and say look how unhinged and crazy and disrespectful these liberals are don't you want to be a patriotic american and be a conservative no you need to be a patriotic american and be a socialist both these ruling class parties are full of nonsense only the ruling or only the proletariat the working class knows what's best for america because we're the only people who live like real americans we don't live you know in in this elite class uh living a life of luxury without actually doing real work every day those people don't know what's best for america they're doing political theater to lie to you and gaslight you away from moving america towards what can actually save it socialism communism peace [Music] [Music] you
