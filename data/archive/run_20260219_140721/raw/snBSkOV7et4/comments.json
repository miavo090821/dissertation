Grooming girls to be lesbians kissing in somebody’s backseat can be forgiving as someone on the panel said about lesbians that we all know but nobody has an issue with. The don’t see Boosie in the same demonic darkness that they view the black gays who have supported his career. I think it’s safe to say he is a self hating DL black man and it’s unfortunate because he could live in his truth and be a beacon of hope for other gay/bi rappers. Instead he decided a long time ago to hate himself and has instead decided to double down.",

Those types of \"christians\" excuse themselves from other sins cause it's more forgivable than being gay. Him being homophobic is enough for \"God to be working on him\". While there are many self hating DL black men, I don't think Boosie is one of them (despite his name lol and lack of evidence to support that.) It is contradicting that he rejects his lesbian daughter and walked out on the color purple with his other daughters for showing lesbianism,  yet talks about it in his songs. Yet, I expect men to contradict themselves. Especially hetero men. Liking lesbians for s3xual gratification vs real life  is something a hetero man would do.",

This was an excerpt from Lattie’s Find A Grave page:\n\n“To muffle the innocent boy's cries, the couple would sometimes stuff a rag in his mouth.\n\nCampbell did not like the 4-year-olds \"effeminate\" voice so to toughen the young boy he would starve him then beat him if he complained. On the hot August night, Campbell and Alicia stuffed a rag into Lettie's mouth, potato peels were placed on his eyes, his hands were bound, and he was hung by his feet in the closet. His complaints of having problems swallowing and that he was in pain from the broken collarbone and broken pelvis, were ignored.”\n\nBoth the mother and the boyfriend are serving time right now for this boy’s death. Life without parole.",

    "text": "27:45 This double standard is something I (black, m, cishet) had to combat in real time recently. Was having a conversation with an older woman at work, we'll call her Tanya (black, f, cishet) about how social media conditions people to feel entitled to know about the personal lives of the people they follow, and when a public figure decides to be more private about what they share online, the automatic assumption is \"oh they must have something to hide\" when the reality can be as simple as \"I don't feel like sharing this anymore.\"\n\nTanya and I were on the same page about how this is messed up and we should reevaluate how we interact with people online, but all that suddenly went out the window when she brought up a classmate of hers that came out as a trans woman. At one point this classmate had been journaling her transition online, and suddenly stopped, and Tanya is suddenly so inquisitive about why that's the case and is assuming her classmate is trying to hide her trans identity from people, literal MINUTES after we just had a conversation about feeling entitled to people's info online and how we can't just assume malicious intent when people decide to be more private. Never mind the fact that we live in the Caribbean (which is, as Olay said, CRIPPLINGLY homophobic) and that would be the most likely reason why Tanya's classmate stopped posting. I pointed this contradiction out to Tanya, only for her to insist that it's different for reasons that she somehow cannot articulate. Shocker.\n\nIt's an incredibly frustrating thing to deal with and I can only imagine what it's like for LGBT people who have to deal with these contradictory people on the daily.",

My intersectional identities of being queer, nonbinary, Black and Brown, and disabled because of having autism, I face an onslaught of violence from the very people that say they are fighting for people like me. I have recently been disowned. Change is a tough thing when parents, people, and community are not open to seeing the judge in themselves. Constantly hiding myself has done nothing but get me neglected. People just want to shut up and it is killing me. I am happy to fight to be seen. I am not gonna survive if my grandmother and father refuse to accept me. \nAlso thank you! Speak on that femmephobia is a big thing. That is why I am happy to lose a fight if it means people stop playing with us.",

Not sure that things would’ve been different if we knew I was adhd but I know it’s affected my mental health so much and I wanna make sure NOT to repeat this with my daughter.

ALL my school yard relationships were with females until I was scared to death at church! Grew up in a fundamentalist Pentecostal church. \nFunny my parents have 3 kids and none of them are straight! \nWhen going thru the process of transitioning and all the drs appts they needed consent from me and dad. At 1st we thought it was weird AF that the staff kept praising us for excepting them. It was never a second thought! Then I realized Oh...bc so many parents disown their kids, especially Black parents! So sad!",

But I looked it up and the person says benzino was never intimate only he was “open” to the idea. I couldn’t find any evidence of anything. Also 50 cent was one of the main trolls of that whole thing. So did benzino mess with a trans person?   I don’t know. Did benzino have some type of communication with a trans person that seems likely. But the host makes it seems like benzino was intimate or sexually involved with this person and again out of the trans person mouth on an interview I just watched they were not intimate. He was just open to the idea.",

Boosie makes good music & has horrible opinions (as do most rappers). I'm also kinda tired of us having to stop listening to black artists cause they are also shitty people and so we gotta collectively shun them while \"not being a monolith\", when the fact is most entertainers are shitty people and their works are still allowed to be enjoyed the masses cause said people are usually white and not rappers. I'm not saying lets break out the R. Kelly (gotta draw the line somewhere), but are we really better off as a people without \"Wipe Me Down\"? I think not.",

Boosie’s contribution to both hip hop and the Black community have been negligible. Moreover, we can critique artists without it meaning you’re being forced to boycott their music… which in any event, I’d like to reiterate, is only 1 song in the case of Boosie. Also, its not about separating the art from the artist, its about the fact that many in the community don’t think there needs to be a separation because they don’t disapprove of his homophobia and toxic ideas of masculinity that causes him to harm his own children and preach that harm—that’s the problem and that’s the subject of this discussion—why the community holds onto boosie and how much of that is because the community doesn’t disagree with boosie",

I like to play devil's advocate so hear me out nobody's above calling out what they don't like or feeling uncomfortable about you got to understand that people for thousands of years were raised on Christian values and the old ways of living Adam and Eve not Adam and Steve and I'm not saying that to be hateful I'm saying that that's ingrained in people's minds that's how things should be God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah no I wasn't just because of gay they completely lost themselves in sexual depravity but if you read Paul's story he was a gay man but him knowing that that's sinful he decided to be celibate we're going back to that one guy's point he can call out something that he doesn't want to participate in or associate with there's nothing wrong with that and if you want to say oh then I don't want to deal with somebody who's heterosexual go ahead but it sounds kind of silly when again it's been ingrained in everybody's culture for thousands of years not to say there's wasn't gay people back then I just mentioned Paul right but it's more accepted that it's the way it's supposed to be a man and a woman people can have an opinion you can too if you like but if you have so much pride why do you care about my opinion? I'm a humanitarian so regardless of how I look at other people's sexuality cuz I really don't give a fuck but I like the debating lol so I'm all for people not being killed because who they sleep with but \"I'm not for you don't want to be my friend because I slept with this person you're evil or homophobic\" because again in the Bible but also this is just how some people look at it that you can't accept behavior if you have differing values from it like for example I can't be friends with somebody who does crack or even drinks too much I don't even want to talk to somebody who does crack I'm not saying that it's correct but someone can look at being gay the same way that isn't for you to say that it's wrong you should just find the people that you are accepted from it's not that hard but again when it comes to people dying and being killed for their sexuality I completely understand the outrage but I also understand that everyone's entitled to their own opinion and lifestyle and you can surround yourself with people who support your lifestyle you don't have to surround yourself with people who don't and that goes for everybody the people I have around me like fully accept who they are I wouldn't have anybody around me that I felt some type of way about regardless of what the context is but anyway have a good day",
