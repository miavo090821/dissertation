I have a dangerous problem in general with black men or black women giving into rhetoric that ultimately will do nothing but legitimize and enable a criminal and illegal system against us I might I've seen people get hit with Fist and that's what it looks like a brick is something completely different and as soon as they we got something that said that she lied about it and they're coming online and they're holding up their picket signs it's always well what she do to make him do that that's always the question let's say Houston PD is telling the truth okay so she should go to jail I see black men and black women who trust each other all the time because I actually spend a lot of time around black people but in this situation nobody wants to be [Music] wrong a while back just in case anybody hasn't heard of this story somehow but a while back it went viral on social media when this black woman put out a video with a very visible physical um lump on her face saying that she'd been hit by a brick by this man and that none of the other men men that were around tried to help her that goes viral because that immediately becomes the gender Wars on the internet right because women are saying this is obviously so horrible and there are a bunch of men saying that they don't believe that she was hit by a brick so a GoFundMe get started a GoFundMe get started based on cuz she's in the hospital this must just true and Undisputed that she has this injury she goes to the hospital a gofund get started for money that she never actually got the GoFundMe was was paused she never got the money and the money was returned so now it comes out the Houston Police Department is charging her because they're saying that she committed fraud because what they're arguing is that they've seen a video where she gets in the car and she hits this man and that he hits her with a bottle that is UN they're saying that she was physically hit this did happen she did receive this injury from being hit with this bottle and they're saying that by this GoFundMe that she committed fraud even though in the to me this is a this is a [ __ ] non-starter case that is just born out of social social media because it would only matter it the only thing that they're accusing her of lying about here is the weapon the that a brick versus a bottle and If This Were a criminal case had she called for criminal charges on the man and he had been charged then it would matter because a a bottle versus a brick has something you know would would actually make a difference in terms of what the level of the charges would be but that didn't happen here what happened was a gofund me which is based on her actually having been injured and going to the hospital and on top of that the GoFundMe was paused no money she never got the money and the people were refunded the money so there is no harm so this is quite literally just a social media phenomenon that's just being gender Wars discourse that's what I think to the room more context as well in the very beginning and there are screenshots that are still running up on this GoFundMe did an investigation almost as soon as the GoFundMe was started they still have the screenshots flowing around where GoFundMe did an investigation concluded there was absolutely no fraud taking place and again like Olay said she never received any of that money the DA has also come out in the media to call the assault quote unquote mutual combat so again like Olay said he is acknowledging that she was hit by someone um why is he not being arrested that's my first question where the [ __ ] that motherfucker's case third of all and I think which is so so important because it it speaks to where we are in the Criminal Justice Reform movement he the da in this interview um that someone came to him and told him that she had previously tried to quote unquote defraud people before the the instance that he is describing is a request back back when she lived in a in a different state apparently he's he's describing a request but she was looking for Mutual Aid she was looking like you know people on Twitter or whatnot will post links to their cash app or something like that hey I need help with rent or something this month something like that the criminalization of mutual Aid it should really be alarming to everybody we're already seeing it in Atlanta with the stop cop City movement they have put that kind of [ __ ] in in in black and white as far as the RICO charges against activists so people cannot start Bill reforms people cannot help people with their bills and whatnot who have been incarcerated that [ __ ] scares the [ __ ] out of everybody so to me you cannot say she has tried to defraud people before when I could post a [ __ ] link right now and ask for help with my rent how am I how am I frauding people prove it prove how I'm fraud people somebody chooses to donate to me how am I how am I frauding someone how and so this entire thing and I want to this by saying I said this before we started recording I am not here to cop please for this young woman I I do not know her I have not spoken to her that is not what this is about what I think is so alarming to me is the fervor which we have seen before van you was on the episode we talked about the Carly Russell case and whatnot we've seen this with Megan the stallion it's this this Blood Thirst this this this quest of Mal information where let's say let's say the da is telling the truth let's say Houston PD who is undergoing not one but two Federal investigations for their corrupt asses is telling the truth okay so she should go to jail for what which is absolutely this this this is even a victimless crime this is a crime where she is the only victim she was the one who was assaulted homeboy not been charged all everybody got their money back from the G fund me but now she has to go to jail and they're talking about waiting for her to surrender herself to the cops for what who was kind who is the victim except for her so so I I I I'm in an interesting place of like not interesting place I couldn't kill L about the criminal charges here the the conversation at large is is more important to me I don't really know what constitutes criminal charges for defrauding someone in this situation uh I don't really know what um what you could charge Bas upon to GoFundMe and all that I don't know any of that apparently they think that they have enough money they think that they have enough evidence to get charges I don't trust the police or the da or none of that stuff what I care more about is how this affects how we talk to one another and I think that there's a lot of reasons for a lot of things that that you just said one of them is that we aren't playing Team ball or we are playing Team ball depending on the way you look at it this is seen as a a volleyball that we're hitting from back and forth this issue no one is looking at this as the way the way that it actually exists because no one wants to take an L because what we do now is rather than have holistic conversation about the entire scope of relations between black men and black women we use different internet instances as gotcha moments and as mascots to either why things are so bad or why things are or why people are lying so it cannot possibly be because we we've lost any level of trust at least in these places that uh are frontf facing because once again I see black men and black women who trust each other all the time because I actually spend a lot of time around black people and I see them doing just fine I really do I see them doing just fine just came back from Louisiana down there dealing with black people I see them doing just fine I see black men and black men women married coming out to talk bringing their kids up to see me the whole nine so I I I think it's overblown but whatever but in this situation nobody wants to be wrong so she so she comes out and she says if this happened black men don't want to be wrong some black men not all black men some black men don't want to be wrong that couldn't have happened she has to be lying let's find out why she's lying so them and then their emissaries go through a whole bunch of leg work to prove that this couldn't have happened because black men wouldn't do that it turns out in this case if we're being as intellectually honest as we can be that some things were left out that do change it when you say the reason why the guy wasn't charged well the prosecutor said why he wasn't charged he wasn't charged because it was seen as mutual combat if it's mutual combat it's not an assault there's no assault it's mutual combat they got to fight so I have oh uhuh I have to intervene as an attorney here and that's the and that's the only hat I want to wear today because my only thoughts on this are as an attorney period I don't care I don't care innocence guilt none of it matters to me I don't care I care about um how this would play out as an attorney and and the same things that van van is talking about how these things affect how we see each other as men and women particularly black men and women how these conversations are weaponized in our community and I think lead to two different kinds of extremes right like misogyny on one end and mandre on another um but from here this in in it happens all the time that the police are called because there is a domestic disturbance or men and women are are having some altercation like that and when a man they the police find that both people were fighting each other both get arrested exact that is what that is what happens all the time it happens on a regular basis if in New York City you get arrest uh a couple is is arrested for fighting each other they will both have charges pressed against them the court will issue an order of protection against each other in favor of them and what at sometimes they will do often not on the first court date because it's domestic violence they will say um they'll allow what's called a limited order of protection they'll keep the order of protection in place but a limited order meaning y'all can talk to each other if y'all want but if y'all commit any further crimes against each other this will be considered a violation so they would still arrest both parties so it is problematic to me in terms of the analysis that yeah you I'm not an attor I am not an attorney I covered stories like this I'm not I'm not I'm not just want to make sure you know I covered stories like this at TMZ for like 10 years right and I would be on the with I'll be on with uh I'm not an attorney I'm not pressing back I'm not pushing back against what ol said but what I'm saying is I covered stories like this on TMZ for years for years in places like Houston Miami New York Chicago whatever I'll be on the phone with pio's and they would what they would say is well we've deemed this to be mutual combat so blah blah blah blah blah talk to the lawyer about that so I'm not sure about how that works but I do know that I've heard it from police departments in cases over and over again I've written in stories this was seen as an this was called an assault but after video video was was looked at it was then deemed mutual combat and Chargers were dropped against everybody and that's true but here's here's what I think I think was important too and what that what gets left out of like conversations in terms of how we look at the criminal system is who brings the charges and who brings the arrest that makes the charges happen right police make a determination who they feel like arresting and taking that to the DA's office but when police actually decide that they want to go take both people or what happens and actually follow through how it goes both people are charged but what happens often times is the police make an indicator on who it is that they want to go and arrest and go forward forward against so what I think is only telling in this particular story is that here they recognize even if they're saying yes mutual combat has happened let's say I I go with that mutual combat has happened and that's why both people aren't being arrested but if you were acknowledging that it in in the eyes of the police that this cancels out right that she did something and he committed some harm to her that it's real what makes you what what becomes the motivation for going this further step to getting into this GoFundMe business to try to say she defrauded the public because she got money that she didn't get and I think that turns into how social media influen is social media and and and how we weaponize how you see these different cases being weaponized these different instances for these different agendas of you know the some black men that don't want to be wrong and uh a lot of black women that feel very often like what is being what is what is motivating this desire to go after this woman and I think often times these instances we don't know these people people don't even know this woman enough to know her name they just calling it The Brick lady just like these cases happen but they will weaponize it it it becomes so important to them for this larger piece that they they want to have this not it's not being motivated by something good that here these individual people will suffer right because in this case what this becomes about is the minute this happened there are some black men that jumped out and want to say oh it's a lie it's this da D look at these women and that that is not I don't think that's representative of the majority of black men but that is very loud online and then a lot of black women who want to interrogate the misogyny of that and this is in the next thing it becomes this you know and it becomes a much bigger thing and then you have individual people like I do believe is the case in this scenario I believe there's an individual like um person online that was going like calling the police department every day about this black woman apparently black woman calling the um you know women women are often harbingers of misogyny to call in the police Non-Stop and now this individual woman is getting some [ __ ] case you know over internet foolishness problem my problem is it's like for me again and I'm not an attorney um and I you know when I talk to O about these things of course she's going to see it in that view I'm looking at it from like this um how how you were saying van it starts a conversation online that it's very problematic okay um a lot of even though uh in the world that I live in with black folks it's same as y'all we love each other I love black men I love me a black man and you know I know that black women love uh uh black men as well and black men love black women it's it's not what they're trying to put online but in this situation because the whole idea was to believe black women we had that it it when it first came out with the whole brick thing and the video we're like why we if there's video why can't we why can't we believe what she's saying why can't we be on her side and then you had the group of men that came out with like no we need more evidence and as soon as they we got something that said that she lied about it and they're coming online and they're holding up their picket signs and and and and torches and saying we they must get an apology all the women are quiet now all of that and it's like no because of this woman and and you know her alleged lie or scheming or whatever it doesn't change the fact that we going to believe black women I'm sorry I don't give a damn if it was Karly Russell or whoever those are two women and there's a lot of women that have been telling their story that has not gone viral anywhere I'm not going to allow Carly Russell or or um I don't even know her name it starts with r okay yes I'm not gonna allow them to be the face of beli black women because there are so many women that you guys ignored and didn't make their stories viral because you wanted for this whole thing of um black woman be lying that whole thing and the media be lying and the police department ly I think like in this case right the Carly Russell thing um was different there was a lot more to that in this case this woman I I wish if people want to make a different argument about whether or not they think there's something Insidious as to lying um about or or to the discrepancy between a bottle versus a brick that's a different conversation but this I don't really know where we're anchoring this and this idea that this is some big Insidious scheme or lie or plot or something she was H yeah but that's but okay but so there's two things there one is the fault of the voices on Twitter okay because what was initially said was this guy hit me in the the head with a brick because I didn't want to give him my number right so that seems to not be the case okay like that seems to not be the case also the fact that she smacked [ __ ] out of him also was left out in that so like the emotional part of this is a lie it just is and I'm not saying that she's she's lying because she's Lex Luther oros man that's anybody like that so so the emotion part of this is a lie so that's a lie right so the real the reality is when we get so bogged down in this that we can't just be like she can't she shouldn't be the face of believe black women and she shouldn't be the face for for like all of the things that she was made to be a face for either domestic violence so so she shouldn't be a face for any of that but if I'm being fair when this first came out she was made a face for that it was what what happened was a lot of a lot of black men received tongue lashings about this incident look how y'all do us look how this is I'm not saying that it's not I'm just saying that those people are going to feel away when that turns out to have not no I refuse to say that there grant let me tell you something van I ref see this is I I'm willing to concede that everything that you said beforehand but here's the thing when that case first happened it it wasn't just because people are trying to cop please now and say oh we told y'all in the beginning that this [ __ ] didn't seem right and whatnot no what you said in the beginning there was a cacophony of black men online who felt that they could use this case to not discredit her but discredit all black women that this is why feminism is bad all you said earlier something about we don't play team sports as black people we don't play on the same team and we don't because in these instances black people are never more pro cop Pro da Pro criminal justice system than when a black woman is alleging that she has been harmed it's not that she her Rota this brick Lady it's not that it's not that she yes it is it's not that she just cannot her be wrong it's not that yes it is yes it is it's not true not true black black people are pro cop whenever it fits the outcome that they want it to fit right black people are pro cop whenever they want Tory Lanes to go to jail black people are pro cop whenever they want Donald Trump to go to jail black people are indoctrinated just into the American system of checks and balances just like anyone else black people are not pro cop just when it comes to that they're procop whenever it serves them for it to be procop black people were Pro cop when it was time for Jesse Smet to go to jail because they were having so much fun with the fact that what he did was what he did and they were like lock him up and throw away the key so they prob anybody else it would be it would be dishonest of us to not point out that Jesse smallet is a gay a gay man and and and because it's relevant it's very [ __ ] relevant to how he was received because like how yeah how let me tell you how I you know first of all in the if we just go based on let's look at how we respond and they wanted him in jail there is no May in jail in jail but the overlocking narrative is that people are not happy that he's in jail let's on let let's talk about hold on hold on let's talk about the no because there are specific no there are specific Nuance reasons to why the communities responded in different things and both though both of those respond back to a certain level of um lived experiences that happened in the communities the reason why Tory Lan that case became that way right is there are a lot of women and especially a lot of black women myself included who have experienced domestic violence who've experienced domestic violence or been been harmed and abused by men and had the community respond to them no matter even when they themselves because I've been this and I've written about this even when I myself protected the man that that uh assaulted me I did not want him charge I was trying to get his charges dropped it still somehow it turned on the community response is to [ __ ] on me is to say oh I made it up I lied and all of these different reasons and that is a common experience to the everyday woman and the everyday black woman so it bothers women and they feel that when a woman in in Megan the stallion's case is assaulted and she her first instinct is to try to protect this black man and to try to protect her own self by not going through to the criminal system and then he comes out and his publicist and his people H uh spread a narrative a narrative that she uh uh she just didn't happen he didn't shoot her and so she comes out and feels the need to say no he did do this to me still doesn't immediately go for the criminal charges and then people go oh [ __ ] what she's talking about let's wait let's wait for for the court let's wait till we get our day in trial let's wait that's what people it was the black men themselves it was the harbingers and [ __ ] for for Tory lanes that said oh [ __ ] that let's wait till we see what happens in court we wait till we see what happens in court we wait till we see what happens in court and then when we [ __ ] go to court and he gets [ __ ] convicted then all of a sudden it's like oh we don't believe in that and the reason I will say this a lot of black women by myself I'm an abolitionist I like I like I said I have represented men in court for domestic violence I have been the victim of domestic violence I'm not somebody who's going to Advocate or be happy or celebrate anybody going being convicted or going to prison the reason why so much black women felt relief when Tory Lan was convicted was not because you want to see that [ __ ] in jail it's because you recognized that there were a bunch of black men who were weaponizing [ __ ] like this and using this to discredit black women something we've experienced and real life saying if this man is not convicted they're going to use that to not just make Megan the stallion's life a Liv in hell but other women too that is why that is specific and there reason why iated I commented on comment out Jesse Smet being gay and and and these women being black women because those are all different groups of people within the black community that are treated under and experience a marginalized experience to the black men that's why I say so it's not that we're it's not that're pro pro cops when it when it's convenient for us in that time I I hear what she's saying it's basically like no when when it's time for the cops to show up and and do right we're going to want that that that's what we're always fighting for it's not that we're because we don't have a system that off other recourse but call C I know but but what I'm telling you but what I'm telling you guys right now is that you just answered your question what you just said that it was before is like we get so Pro you said that black men specifically or or parts of black men get so pro cop when it comes to this and my and what I'm telling you is there we everybody get I agre what I'm saying this is that it happens all the time like once again we all agree that R Kelly should have gone to jail right we all agree everyone because there comes a there comes a situation to where we're tired of of of and I'll just be honest with you um where we're tired of volleyball and this stuff back and forth and somebody goes let the white man take care of it that's just a real thing and so when you're so when you're saying why are people pro cop it's because the reason why they were procop in this instance is because they looked at the legal system as the final Authority as to whether or not their suspicions about this were true or valid and I'm saying that's just not the only time that that happens and there and there's a lot of reasons why that is on either side no reason makes more sense than any other reason pause right there because what we what I'm saying is why don't we interrogate where those suspicions come from there is specific times where we choose to get suspicious and that is what women be talking about when a woman when a woman when a black woman says she is a victim of something when groups when the groups within the black community that are not a heterosexual black man that's performing masculinity the way we wanted to we're [ __ ] suspicious it's only then that we get suspicious it's only then that we get suspicious that's what we're we're we're we're talking about but I do agree van I do agree that the black black people black people just like everybody else like in in a living in a police state Living in America is indoctrinated by Propaganda and an investment in polic policing and the belief that the criminal system is supposed to be about Justice whether or not it always is or not black people are not going to be exempt from that we're not and that's just the truth so I do think that black people are far more uh procop in some instances in general across the board than we would like to admit but that's because those are currently we live within that system that's the only tool we've really been given to deal with things um on top of that too pretty much the whole reason we're even having this conversation in the internet is choosing sides so we can't even complain about that cuz that's what the internet's going to do but it's because she made that video in the um the hospital with the face swollen and then even before then so at that point we have her side of the story she not only does she tell the regular story she says black men so like she's putting gas on us to go crazy online period so it's like this could have just been a conversation of I got attacked by a dude and nobody nobody did anything man man or woman she said no no no these black folks stood around and didn't do these black men stood around and didn't do anything so at that point online's going to do what it online does then AJ you brought up something real important context that's very important context AJ then so we're cool we got her side of the story internet's gonna do what they do then we find out you swinging on them first so we already we already thought it was a little funny cuz we've all seen a fair share of fights getting hit with a brick of serious you know it's not just swelling it's like that a lot of people was already on the fence cuz they're like I might I've seen people get hit with Fist and that's what it looks like a brick is something completely different so you can't even believe everybody wasn't even sold on her original story and then when we find out as mutual combat the water bottle we don't know it could have been one of them glass water bottles right but it also could have been a plastic water bottle we don't know at this point we're confused at this point so us not believing she's been made the poster child for all these things and that's just what happens when you when you put a story and you frame it like that for us the general public that's what's gonna happen you're I'm not gonna hold you I never even like me personally I want I just want to say this I'm not somebody who ever had to cop a plea because I never said I've never there's nowhere anywhere that I said one [ __ ] word about this case because I was never interested because I have a new practice of of asking myself whether or not something is legitimately important or is this something that is being a part of discourse and people are just jumping out ready to and I this is a conversation I I feel like Gabrielle and I was just talk talking about this yesterday I feel like the way there's a way that we have come to discuss things on on on the internet especially within the community that becomes very carceral and and and and and negative for us all around just overall just over overall because I think like I said because of these two teams and I think that's why it's important that AJ made that context it was frame that way she did frame that narrative and I think there's something to how we are playing into and how this I think internet it shows like the way we're having these kinds of two extremes of a conversation that we have on the internet so much is starting to play into how people perceive experiences and things that are happening to them in real life right like because there is something to that why it immediately was an indictment on all black men and why it becomes um weaponized like that on social media and that's what I'm saying I think it becomes two side two extremes talking right you get you get a lot of this people get upset because there isn't this people feel like there isn't an interrogation of why there's never really a real Nuance intellectual conversation about sexism and misogyny and patriarchy and things that are actually happening here in the terms of discourse and how people are suspicious of of of of a black woman because listen you can be you can be somebody who recognizes the criminal system you don't know what happened you weren't there like I've said all the time I don't know who did what who didn't do I've represented people in court and I don't know what the [ __ ] happened but I'm going to go in court all the time and argue not guilty and make refuse to minimize this enti as the attorney in the case so when people have that kind of attitude online it's just becomes like unproductive and then we get the when we go from there to missandry and all of it and then we just in a pot of like just anti-blackness amongst each other you can't have this but I refuse to minimize this entire conversation to what a lot of people are minimizing it into as to like gender Wars where a lot of people will come on Twitter especially black folks and they'll say oh well I you know marriage rate for black folks is 80% we see black couples in real life that does not degate the fact that one and four black women has experienced domestic violence in her life that the most likely demographic go missing that we are the most likely demographic to experience harm by our partners none of that negates any of that just because you saw a black couple holding hands on TV one day does not negate our lived experiences and we are constantly being gas lit by our lived experiences and so when these conversations like what happened with ro to pop up it is more so used as a cudel against black women espousing their very real lived experiences and that I will never seed any ground to ever I don't care what she did I don't care and she's probably going to go to jail anyway people are going to get what they want from this which is some kind of punishment everybody's got their money back that's fine it's the world that we live in but I will not be I'm not I'm just not going to sit silent while this woman and her case and her pretty blatant lie or at least yeah yeah for sure disinformation of what happened is used to harm the rest of us look look so oh my bad I'm sorry what yeah no I just wanted to go on top in this real quick and and present some Coral Aries that I saw because I actually came out with a video that had Mega estallion and row both inside the video of which I spoke about and there's only been one instance of which I've gotten almost like a campaign of from what I understand to be mostly sised men or just men in general men in mask coming in and repudiating just the discussion about these people row and there's one other situation and I want to make this Coral because I think it's really important is in the City by Karen case now the discussion with City by Karen a white woman in New York when she was getting a bike the city bike and then there were two black I think a couple black um youths uh they were trying to talk about the fact that they have claim to the bike and they went back and forth and back and forth and we had this situation where City by Karen began to weaponize white women tears and started making a bunch of noise and basically put these black men in very pecar situations all of us understand what exactly a white woman's tars can do to black men yeah the reason why I bring this up um is because even to this day I still get comments I've had to mute the word inside my channel in general city by Karen is muted you can't say it you'll get an immediate invitation to the block party if you put City bike Caren inside my [ __ ] you will have right now people trying to say oh tickets came out or the receipt came out Kitty City by Karen is is is innocent aren't you going to walk back your and this is the part that I want to make I think that we're missing a broader discussion about literally the incident and we're getting very caught up in the weeds of the legality and the he say she say most important regardless if it's a bottle or a brick the G get hit yes Point Blank it's Point Blank that's that's where get and most important we will find ways as everybody is saying to minimize or just absolutely throw out the entirety of what they're doing simply because there's some cast of Doubt like they like we need like a reasonable doubt in what we're discussing right now and the problem is like regardless about what Rose doing the problem is is as soon as I went on to Twitter I saw a block party of [ __ ] in the comment section of everything retain like pertaining to this girl a block party balloon confetti I'm talking just rry that there might be a gleam in in the glimmer of hope that this girl is somewhat culpable of something else and that's what I want to interrogate because that speaks to not only does that need to be interrogated not only do we need to talk as a community of where that comes from but there also needs to be some kind of of I I I I don't even know what at this point where we extrapolate these situations to other black women how does that make sense how does that make sense to say she lied and we're cele what we're not even they're not because I understand what you're saying for they're not celebrating that she lied they're somehow extrapolating her situation to possibly mean that any other black man who's ever you know accus but that's what I'm saying to the St two sides is to be fair we both we all do not I don't say we all do this and me L me an individual but we as women because again she did that initially by saying the Nar her original narrative AJ's original is her her narrative was that black men stood around look how they didn't they didn't help me how black man hit me and black men didn't intervene it it's it's odd it's like she I mean she in a very direct way in a in a very direct way she castigated black men and then she lied so look here's so so here's the thing all of these questions are not mystifying to me right like all of these questions are not are not mystifying to me so the reason why black men showed up and they do what they do is because they want to avoid accountability for the way they've been treating black women in their communities forever that's real they want to avoid accountability black men have been told for a long time that they are powerful in a very specific way so that there are all of these people behind the scenes that are trying to take them down in one way that they will take them down is to use women to take them down and so what they see is they see that even though that was a very specific thing white women right and they're now using it across the board and like the whole [ __ ] be Ling thing it's like they don't want to take accountability for the violence that they perpetuate in their Community for the rape culture that they perpetuate in their Community that's true I could almost I could almost say on the flip side of that though that because of the harm that's been done there is a intellectual roadblock from us just being able to look at this for what it is like my man here said a girl got hit look I would never ever ever raise my fist to a woman and nobody in my family that I've that's come up under me that I've taught would think that that was okay she invited that violence she hit him so it's a completely different thing it's a to it's a totally different thing like the girl she did get hit but the part that that she had a part in that and it's almost like we can't talk about that and we can't talk about it because I think that it's not only black men who don't want to come to the table and admit that whatever she did doesn't have anything to do with the larger scope of violence against black women or the safety that black women don't feel in Black communities I think sometimes black women don't want to say okay she lied all right but there is still a gigantic problem and so rather than just say she lied we have to figure out why she told the truth she lied she lied and that won't change the fact that while she while she was in act when she while she was in uh an actual untruth that there are women as we speak right now that are being abused by their partners and if people aren't smart enough to have that but that's my problem there though like she Li she lied and I think that we do have to because remember I was telling you earlier on ol I'm like I just want to know what the hell is going on it's confusing but I know that she lied that's that's what we I'm not trying to skate or put on you know my skates and skate around that she lied but the but the problem with everything else is how she set it up who she was to she knows that we're you know we're GNA we are she knows that we on this online like you said Olay like online everybody gets a little extra about certain causes and and and associated with their personal stuff and so it gets crazy so believe black women is a thing and and she knew who to or two in that moment the black men didn't believe me and what that would look like online it a lot of this is very problematic it was Insidious it was Insidious so no we can we can we can say that we can I think we can all agree about that um but I also think that um for how how a lot of if you go back online like you said like you said forign you get online and they're just having parties they're saying oh all the black women quiet now all of that but we really have to look at the truth here she Li what's going to happen was that true about the um cuz I know they tried to pile it on in the media and um everybody was saying now she's saying it's an allergic reaction it's confusing now the information that's being given is confusing they have her as some kind of criminal okay what she did was wrong I need us to understand that but how they're wanting her to almost be like living underneath the jail is crazy to me they gotta lock her up I gotta not lock her up she got to turn herself in let me get this point off real quick so so number one she got to somebody got this the thing all of us agree all of us agree that she's discrediting the women that we know maybe have had experience in our life who have had some sort of violence inacted upon them right that's I can't AJ I can't I can't bro no she's Noto you coming you hey bro AJ you coming you coming on High Learning next week I'm [ __ ] with you but I you you he knows it let me finish let me finish his point I want to hear where he was going I don't know if it was choppy or anything but what I'm saying is she when this story first came out she became the poster child for these situations real life situations and and everybody has an issue with that because we found out later she lied so we have to punish the people who are lying up about people who are actually afflicted by let me tell you how [ __ ] ridiculous all of this is and I'm buit even we're gonna talk and be okay my point is that she's allowed to be a human being pause pause pause pause the criminal system let's stop right hair let's stop right [ __ ] hair because the criminal system does not punish most Harms in this Society let alone [ __ ] lie the criminal that's not even what it's supposed to do or any of that and if we are going to talk I will give you I will give you that she lied on this yada yada y this is in the next thing why the Nar was crafted in a certain way but if we're going to just be talking if we're already recognizing all right we're we're two sides if we're two sides less uh men and women and these cases are being used as generalizations and representations of of things that happen in our society even if we say she lied do you know what [ __ ] like to the original narrative that has us so [ __ ] swollen in the chest that she suggested that black men stood by while while abuse happened to that [ __ ] is what is most common in the black community and to the black experience than a black woman lying about details around a story but still being assaulted like what what actually is more commment and I think we we actually as to what forign point and Gabrielle and everybody's trying to been interrogating trying to interrogate from the beginning is the the reason the why you're so upset and I think van spoke to that um wanting to avoid avoid accountability is you're so outraged at this woman do this individual woman spun a narrative like that and incited you to rage but why are you up on all your [ __ ] feet about something that the majority of black women do in fact experience in real life you're jumping up and down and what is her going are three black women on this call how many of you have experienced abuse by a black man okay so what do we do about the ones lying about it taking away what do what do we do about that no it doesn't take no that's a ridiculous concept you acting one one one individual black one individual black woman you cannot possibly [ __ ] suggest one individual black woman takes away from the experience of all black women who' experienced that you don't think that the black me real quick let me real quick I like talking over woman long story short she's not the right person to be on the stage for this there's never going to be a white person there's never going to be a stories people different point that none of these things a better indictment would be that none of these things that we as a community need to stop taking these individual instances and and allowing them to incite us and use them as as as uh things that are symbolic and and weaponized against each other just across the board and how this is divisive this is divisive kind of discourse and how we analyze things in honest Honestly though like because that creates the need for a perfect victim when you do it like that when you like when you when you when you do it like that the reality is these conversations need to be ongoing and being had by people who really want to get to the core of these issues and when you when when you War over them just like Trump and fonnie Willis now who she been with is now going to become a whole big deal right when it has nothing to do with the Merit of the case but everything is so high leverag now that rather than actually talk about the issue at hand what Endeavor to do is to poke holes into stories from each other so that we can be right rather than be nutritious that's why so I want to speak to this very quickly that's like AJ I ain't gonna lie I got I got TR you because well gohe my bad or you ain't got headphones on so you can't hear me my bad no I I want to give us some perspective because I understand that this is extremely American Centric and I want to go and give us some like Global Perspective so first thing I want to actually say um pertaining to row and I want to go and use aign me as a as a avatar for this because I hope you don't mind but you before so you ain't mind us um so first off with rope um another interesting thing that I found off with her is as soon as some pictures surfaced a row on vacation and then [ __ ] found out that roow had some shape immediately immediately we saw a switch in tone and [ __ ] were fine with protecting her and that goes right to the fact because at first they just saw a dark skin woman with a big ass gash on her face but after they found out that this big black ass woman also have some ass on her we can protect her it goes to speak to the same problem desirability I had that conversation CA I want to preface this byab this the last part this and this part hopefully mam you don't have no problem with but this is a bigger issue and M new war as it pertains to just the American system let's take it out of there in the Bahamas just about what was a two we weeks ago we had a black woman in the Bahamas that was gunned down because the person that she was a passenger of their car was involved in the ferious activity MH you want to know what the discussion was on behi in Twitter on my WhatsApp feed on everything the discussion was that this woman was in a car with a sweetheart and that's why she gets shot that's good for her it's good because she want cheting them man is good for or GS out here catching ride with [ __ ] and they know they like the T they like materialistic things and they want hang out with gunmon so they get gun now like gun prevailing discussion and that is Al [ __ ] cousin this the thing that's like this the thing that may there's like a slight disconnect in oh that was your cousin I do AP I'm sorry about that too sorry but um the thing that's kind of just like a overall um it's like we're still talking about the conversations that are happening online those are always extreme right I'm just asking the simple question of okay the initial thing happened what do we do in ter when a liar steps up to the plate and Frames something and then we find out later that you're lying what what happens to the LI think wanting her to be arrested is not extreme you don't think her in her life is not a crime you know the only like fraud itself there's a reason why they're trying to do something else with the GoFundMe but I want to be clear [ __ ] lying about [ __ ] that upsets you on line is not a [ __ ] crime not a crime not a crime why I hold on that's why I started this episode from saying that she never once called for criminal charges with that man that that was never something being pursued if she did this would be a different [ __ ] conversation if she had if she had jumped out identified no man no identified him she put his name she put his nameability there needs to be some accountability I think AJ is saying like there needs to be accountability for her okay and I do believe because yeah everybody got the money back everybody go home but yeah it's not only that in um some of the Articles or what what people are trying to stick on is that she's not it's not the first time she's done this she will get online ask for money because of whatever there's no I want to be clear just there's no there's that again we have to stop letting the police just say things and no way no way substantiated so so so with that being said I know what you're saying when you're saying I can hear it I understand and I feel the same way I feel like because it's caused so much mess and because she utilized and targeted certain like like literally knew that black women would come you know behind her for this or whatever she lied and this caused some so much of a conversation or whatever the case may be what how can how can she be held accountable what does that look like for her for her to just you know go on with her life or whatever the case may be now the extremities of her going under like being in jail for a certain amount of time for whatever then people got their money back but she did she did lie it started a war online because we're we're so sensitive but also because we are sensitive to these issues these are big issues that are happening in our communities and I feel like she just kind of played in our face with that so she should be punished and sent to jail and have her I'm having a problem with living in a rage world as a media person and a content creator and we only seem to want to public punish black women like this is a problem like let's pause here and and I'm I'm saying this not as somebody who who is a jump up yada yada Y no whoa whoa I I have a real [ __ ] problem everything that happens on the internet all day if this is a prison y'all need to put [ __ ] the um gorilla dancing [ __ ] gorilla Groove and [ __ ] handcuffs there's [ __ ] every [ __ ] day inciting hold on inciting the community to [ __ ] outrage and and and and and bait and stoken misogyny and mandry for views and for content and for all these different things and none of that has ever ever once ever once meant oh we need to have a [ __ ] tribunal on accountability or talking to criminal system or becoming you know chopping it up with the [ __ ] legal system that makes no sense here like she need to be Tak from her home from her from her job from her friends into the [ __ ] jail house she lied about something she lied about something in terms of a narrative that she fed to the internet for some [ __ ] rage but in terms of anything she lied about on a larger level of what would require accountability of the system no none of that [ __ ] happened let so let me give you let me give you an example of something so I I actually disagree with that I think it happens all the time I just think it's like for example DJ Envy right people are mad like just just listen just listen so DJ Envy so DJ Envy ran the same type of scam that [ __ ] be running and [ __ ] are scammers online of all the scammers that we could talk about that [ __ ] are scamming online they scam all the time they scam DJ Envy is getting a spef specific type of criticism because the people that he scammed are black and brown and that he used this huge black it's it's facts he us he used this huge black so it's being treated as some very specific cultural crime that he has to go to jail for wait say what say wait so so wait a second wait a second either this woman committed fraud or she didn't commit fraud she listen if she she didn't she if she if she if she didn't commit fraud and I don't care about her not going to jail but like the reality is the thing that we don't want to see consequences for people online other than black women I feel like we're emoting now that's not what I'm saying I'm not talking about online I'm talking about the conversation AJ is having when we talking about jail and this and accountability no if if we're talking if the accountability or the punishment is being [ __ ] on online she's receiving that I'm not disputing that djv received that all themm videos content that's an entire like you did not come here and see hear me say we can't [ __ ] kick her back in online we're obviously kicking her back in right now we have 48 minutes discussion right now A CRI but I think it's important since you since you raised that point DJ Envy is a [ __ ] involved with a with with with a with a with a man who had a excon who been scam who been scamming people of million accus to scam million million dvy and DJ mvy specifically used his name as DJ mvy in his career to promote and DJ MV has no charges he ain't missed the day he's missed one day work Club I know I I know but I know I know but what I'm what I'm telling you though is what I'm telling you though is like I'm not specifically using DJ env's case what I'm saying is people are saying DJ Envy needs to go to jail DJ Envy needs to go to jail and so what so what I'm saying is either she broke the law or she didn't break the law if if we're if we're going to talk about right now what the consequences for this should be then the reality is there should be some and I'll say this and question legal consequences I didn't say legal I didn't say legal I never said legal I never said legal I said there should be some consequences what are the consequences that you want to consequences he definitely let me just be clear here it this is America and I'm saying this as an attorney to you the police and the criminal system can do whatever the [ __ ] it wants the [ __ ] if they have you in court and they want you to and enough people are cool with it so once the public already hates you including your own Community if the [ __ ] uh Houston PD want her they [ __ ] have her no matter but I'm saying this what my illegal analysis is did no it's not for in terms of okay fine guys listen listen when I say consequences we're acting as if there aren't cultural consequences should she have to apologize for the way she framed this the answer is yes she should she should have to apologize all right never mind never mind you know what because you know you know what the real thing is the real thing is this this this is the real question conversation that we need to have the real the real conversation that we need need to have is have black men injured black women so much to where it's unfair to uh for us to ever ask for any accountability from them no apologize problem think the issue is I mean I'm just being for real like I don't want to see the woman go to jail y'all didn't want to see car hold on y'all didn't want to see Carly Russell with with suff when she actually broke the law left the record like I don't see nobody in jail I am quite literally jail all right I have gotten hundreds of [ __ ] nobody in jail she apologize jail and prison jail and prison are completely different jail light bed prison is for something Ser I don't think she should go to jail I don't like jail think she should go to ja I don't give a [ __ ] I don't want her in timeout I don't want her in jail I don't want her and that's and that's and that's be and that's because Gabby that's because rather than looking at this as a holistic thing you're playing for your team what team in that anyme a AJ what is AJ saying AJ what are you saying say what you saying this what I'm saying I'm saying jail and prison are completely different honestly what you're saying legally she didn't do nothing out of Lander and prison or nothing but look you did enough funny things and weren't able to finish getting that 40,000 out you need to at least be arrested and take a downtown so we can ask some questions maybe a light 30 days and then she good you know what I'm saying I'm not saying she deserves 10 years but feelings to HT you want a apology van wants a let's keep telling van wants a personal apology days in jail got money back fuckingn just everybody know I also said that I thought I also said I thought that jce Smet you apologize to the community too like I think that if you do something and you take a lot of trauma that has been wed up in black people for and you activate us and you activate us using that trauma and it turns out not to be true that you have done something not destructive but you've done something injur ha do you know what's my problem here's my problem then that the community is never that the majority of sins that are that actually happening black men heterosexual black men are not who receive the most of the harm and sins in this community but the only [ __ ] that activates the community is what happens to them so the only people get a [ __ ] apology is heterosexual black men meanwhile the harm that black women gay black people everybody else experiences every day no one can give a [ __ ] less because the [ __ ] that actually outrages us we come here all the time for colie Russell uh uh Ro whatever silly [ __ ] like this where a black woman is Accused a ling on some for some [ __ ] that didn't hurt nobody but her ultimately but yet we every [ __ ] day black men do and I and let me be clear I'm not saying I am saying this I'm not saying this to say overcorrect I'm not saying to do the other thing I have a dangerous problem in general with black men or black women giving into rhetoric that ultimately will do nothing but legitimize and enable a criminal and a legal system against us period that is part my issue because the reality I'll say this as someone who represented a thousand people in Criminal Court very rarely do I represent a woman at all much less you like black woman white woman very rarely do you have a woman the majority of the people in the criminal system are going to be men they're going to be black men they're going to be brown men they're going to be men and what happens often is you might you might want to it seems easy to engage in this kind of rhetoric and yada yada y this is in the next thing but the majority of who's going to be criminalized and prosecuted and hurt by the by the rhetoric that we embold and the and the um the the power and the legitimization that we give these H these these local police departments when these kind of [ __ ] cases happen again will only turn around and hurt black men the following day that's all I'm saying so to me it's just a dangerous rhetoric to invoke the police to invoke the police against a black woman when a crime has not been committed is absolutely insane this is exactly what I'm talking about I'm not talking to you man homeboy your boy said he wants at least 30 days for her you want 30 days for her and a criminal record for a victimless for a victimless crime because your ego hurt so she has to issue a public apology to we G make sure we work on that and you want her 30 days no no no hold hold hold on hold on hold on hold on so this is the way I look at this is the way I look at something so the lady that you guys were talking about on this is the way I look at stuff the lady that you guys were talking about celebrity who is the lady that was on this right when I was on Higher Learning this is the way I look at stuff once again I care about how black people feel so this is way I look at it I was on learning and I got her confused with the white lady that made the Tik Tok right so I got her confused with the white lady that made there was a white lady that had made a Tik toac about this before and I thought it was the same person I've been sick all week um and so I went on there and I went the celebrity lady I said that's a white lady she comes out she goes hey I'm not a white woman I am a black woman and you need to do your research do you know what I do because I've injured and harmed a black woman by Mis rcing her I would never want Mis rcing I don't know so you know what I do I go on there I go on there and I go hey I am sorry on the podcast I made a determination about someone it turned out to not be true I would never want someone to call me white when I am black I apologize to her I apologize to the listeners my ego and what I mean is not too big for me to apologize within my community I've had to apologize a lot the [ __ ] worked at TMZ for nine years y'all I'm sorry so so so I I don't think that that's that big of I don't think that that's I don't think that's that big of a deal I don't look at it as pause because I think you hold on but this is the problem with with the with with the legal system I think you're right man and this is something why I've written I wrote a whole thing about like looking at the Tory L case from an abolitionist perspective in a in a world where we don't have a legal system where we don't live in America with the white man over you hearing everything we saying and using it to to get you you could apologize if if it weren't if if it weren't for the fact that they were already trying to legally nail her ass to the world then I would be like yeah apologize to the community but anything you do now will be weaponized against you in court so the only thing she should do right now and I told her this is to shut the [ __ ] up absolutely she cannot apologize to anybody right now but I agree moral morally morally I think that's a good point but the problem is the moral the accountability and that's the problem with the criminal system and why [ __ ] become abolitionist is because the kind of accountability you could take and the kind of Pastor restorative just Justice you could take if you didn't have a legal system trying to kick your back in I think people wouldn't I wrote that about in Tory laning cuz I said it was notable to me from an abolitionist perspective that prior to the legal system's involvement prior to the court the the the system trying to press charges to first instance was to be apologizing he had called and apologized he was sending apologies that was before it became legally to his detriment to engage in that path after once the legal system is on your back and you looking at at criminal consequences that will in fact [ __ ] up the rest of your life in one way shape or another you have to protect yourself so the legal system prevents you from taking accountability I didn't say she should apologize now yes pleas man oh my God no I didn't know I didn't though I didn't though just at some point it would be nice to say hey maybe I shouldn't have whipped everybody up into this whatever oh my yeah yeah I'm not mad at her apologizing not apologizing right now from from the legal perspective of it at all right but like Also let's just like keep it in mind even though what I said might have sounded crazy I'm keeping the same energy for men and women so like when so Jess so what is it Tory Lanes he apologized he shouldn't have done that legally but he also should have if he didn't shoot Meg stallion got on the stand and he didn't he's hell quiet and we don't I want you to know I heard you and I disagree I heard you say that today on your podcast I watched it and I was going to call you about it I only got you on my first legal analysis absolutely he should not Tory Lanes didn't get and I think that's a dangerous thing with media teaches us right people teach us this that people no that's some [ __ ] let me tell you why people teach us that we uh that if you don't get on the stand that's a police that's propaganda that's put into our media that if you don't get on the stand that represents guilt and unfortunately then people go and and sit in juries and evaluate it that way Tory Lanes absolutely should not have gotten to stand just off the fact that Cory Tory Lanes already has a a criminal record Tory Lanes has a domestic violence history with his baby mother and and had already been on probation had he been on had he been um on the stand and that including all his music including every statement he'd ever made all of that would have been open to cross- examination and that would have made [ __ ] much worse for him so I promise you he didn't even it's not a reflection of his or guilt in the case so what about dude in Chicago the dude in Chicago he lied he deserved to get what's up like are we just ignoring the liars I feel the same way about both SE let me let me let me tell you and let me hold on and see a AJ now you know I love you now you know my boy you know you know I love you and you know you're my boy but AJ I just heard you just today just today with Jay nobl and Ton's being like I don't know if Tory Lanes did it y'all don't believe that [ __ ] lied with all the evidence in the world but but but Jesse a liar for sure Ro is a liar for sure Tor is the Tor is a convicted [ __ ] but you ain't believe that for sure bro man everything I heard about that case I'm so confused why is Kelsey up there please he shot he shot that come on bro he shot that [ __ ] you're losing me con listen listen to me listen to me if he shot her then I don't care that he got 10 years I personally do not care that Tory Lan is in jail for a if he shot her shot he did you shouldn't even be questioning that it literally they said it and he shot where this the thing he's exactly where he's supposed to be that doesn't bother me that doesn't he's in jail let's take this okay so since you me you should go to jail o since you are the attorney the legal part of it right and that's another question I have about this right so seeing this online seeing it in the spaces you know like the shade room and all of those blog type spaces that we go to for our news it's just so sad um and then on the shade room so she's on there um oh she they were they had they had a journalist at the at the court waiting for her she was supposed to pull up I think with um representation for her for assistance and she didn't show so what they first of all they didn't they didn't call her by name so that's why I was like what is her name they didn't call her by name hash brick lady and he kept calling her brick lady and then he said her name so she started with brick lady then stated her name and then continued on with brick lady in the caption for the video it was brick lady and they basically said that she was on the run she was a no and she was on she commented underneath she commented underneath the video herself while she was allegedly on the run and she said I'm looking for representation um I don't have any legal representation so that's why I did not show up I I don't I'm not on the run I'm literally just looking for legal representation and she put that there is no bench for her arrest she put that in in the in the shave room comment section and everyone because they didn't go do any research they didn't even read the articles that had half truths in them they didn't do anything they just kept going off of the two sentences and that shady video that the shav room put up and it was basically girl you on the run and you commenting in the um in the in the section and I was saying that to I'm like if the girls are on the run I wouldn't want her to be in there but about it I had to think about it and be like okay so she's she's probably there's no issue here so but my question is legally I looked at it from this point of view now now it messed with me and I told oay that I was like now I really she she messed up she lied but I really want her to get the right repr presentation because now problematic and it be it can become really Troublesome for her they're trying to paint her as somebody who is on the Run creting narratives around her oh my goodness I really want her to get the help that she needs so that's what I was and then that's kind of where I veered to because as a black woman we can go right there and as black people we know that when we get up in court they're going to try to make everything so bad for us give us the worst time for something like as small as this now when I say as small as this I'm talking about legally okay how long does it take to getse the most thing right now I want say something else got like uh she just going to work look so so so here's the deal we're talking about I'm talking about this all in the context of talking about it I want want to make sure everybody know something I don't really give a [ __ ] I don't care it's not that it's not it's not that big of a deal man as we talking right now it's we're talking about it in terms of talking about it I personally don't think that what happens with this lady really affects what's going on between black men and black women because I think that conversation starts way before it gets to Twitter I think it starts with how we connect with one another and the conversations and really the vision that we have for our community like the question is not about what happened on Monday on Twitter it's like what do you want from the men and the women you share your community with and that's a conversation that cannot be had in crisis it just can't be had in crisis it has it has to happen on a regular [ __ ] it has to happen on a regular [ __ ] Tuesday a regular Tuesday when we sitting around going okay how can we be better than one another right but if we're talking about it and we're going back and forth with it then yeah I have thoughts but man I hope she make a [ __ ] $10 million and live on the Rivier for the I don't give a [ __ ] like I cuz I don't think it's that big of a deal I think we all be on some new [ __ ] next week I really do I say one thing I want to say something um if she sees this which she will I'm sure somebody's going to circulate this somewhere for her to see if you see this baby girl listen when you get out the jail house or because they you

the Street the W Wall Street [ __ ] stole like5 billion and he the man didn't even get no money they froze I know but I'm just saying now guess what guess what it's time to do now now it's time to get some money oh all right listen this I always like to frame it institutions not individuals because the entirety of the conversation we focusing on row and not what row stands in front of or behind or for yeah like essentially what you have like the problem with poster children and poster child this discourse in particular is the poster need to be the the lit need just faces like if you all ever go to a black barber shop and you all see like a a poster of all of the different um rappers um Biggie and all let me see all kind of posters you need a poster of that when it comes to the Mount Mis who want it's turned into um block mortality especially for women and Fs because when you take a poster child you deprive that poster child of having to be anything but human and that's why you have a situation where a black woman have to be literally the perfect Victim Because historically black women have had to been two times 10 times better than anybody else so when you put them on a poster they got to be even more than that but if you look at it from an Institutional level like if you look at it from an Institutional analysis you understand that this isn't about Road this ain't about car this is about misogyny war and black F mortality and black fem assault in general because that's exactly what happens and I'm trying to go and pain it from a Global Perspective regardless I in a black country I'm predominantly black country yeah we've been colonized we had to deal with that but a predominantly black country I also see black women and black men courtship all of that I'm married to a black woman but I also see on a regular basis black women being killed black being being assaulted and them being um denied any type of a like any type of ears even to hear that [ __ ] is always what would she do to make him do that yeah that's always the question thank you foren for acknowledging that cuz I can I can appreciate that thank you forign well my M's a black women my grandma's a black women I mared black woman Lord and if I bring a black woman into this world I want to be able to know that if something happened to her that someone a look at on and be all like okay you know what what you do to him why you make him so mad yeah thank you all for joining me for the first episode of oay and friends for this year thank you run my blood pressure up sides and things like that we lose no that was good I wanted to go there it's because start over oh start over all right yeah so
