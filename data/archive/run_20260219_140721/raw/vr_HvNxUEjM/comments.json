But you really have the minds of the boomers from the days of glorious revolution fighting against injustice. I've been living in Co-City for 43 years, just in time for the beginning of white flight. The person who has an Auntie a DC-37 retiree, if she hasn't already, join The Organization of NYC Public Service Retirees. She will learn about the traitorous unions. And DC37 and the UFT have messed up the money for the working force and see that privatizing our Medicare will benefit them. So they tried to sell us old people out. But most of us are boomers and took the city to court and won, and won and won, got taken to Appellate Court and kept on winning. But we still fighting. So make sure she research the organization on YouTube and website.\n\nBTW, ya'll done raised up my spirit. It's still there, but caught in a sh*t hole body. I may not walk well, but can still learn and fight in different ways. I have seen Harlem being sold out years before Clinton was president by some of our black leaders, some of whom were depicted in Regina King's movie, \"Shirley\". Re: NYCHA...corrupt as hell, Adams....one term mayor full of himself. He was a republican before seeking office as Brooklyn Boro Prez. But knew he didn't stand a chance to win. So, he registered as a Democrat, but only in name. I voted for Maya Wiley in that primary still have my campaign hat. She would have won too, except she was going to \"dismiss\" the next graduating class of NYPD. \n\nSo, once again, I say good night. Yes I'm a member and have twin sis. Called us The Savage Twins well into our senior years.😅",

I appreciate the question about \"theory of change\" because while I still don't agree with most of y'all, it does help me articulate my own theory of change, from both my own experience in movement work and studying both domestic and international movement history, is the threat of ungovernability. Now this can take many forms, but is ultimately always orthogonal to existing political or economic structures. So I'm not deeply invested in electoral politics, even in a local level (though understand why people are), but will always support direct action and grassroots organizing. And I feel that some lack of understanding from progressive officials. Now not every critique is meaningful, but I do think if you're going to work within the system, you do have to accept that critique is how you are held accountable to your purported radical ideals.",

An example might be the plausibility of African American habit of laughing and running as a post slave trauma.
