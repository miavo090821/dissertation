hello everyone welcome to midwestern marks my name is eddie smith here with my friend and colleague carlos garrido um we've been asked quite a bit quite a few times especially on our tick tock to do some sort of podcast so that's what we're experimenting with here experimenting with the format we're going to start with a top five carlos and i have both compiled a top five list of our top five american radicals american communists socialists union leaders abolitionists things like that um and then this sunday we're going to have a live interview with thomas riggins a retired philosophy professor who's come aboard with us as a writer just to pick his brain about all the knowledge that he has so we're going to have that coming up sunday and we want to bring that to people's attention before we get started here and also today is a historic day for all leftists a historic day for anybody who cares about anti-imperialism and a day that really should honestly be a national holiday but we're just going to leave that on a cliffhanger and we'll talk about it later let's jump right into our top five list so carlos i'll let you go first uh hit me with your number five and why you picked them and what they did okay um so i think we could do like we each go five so i'm not just saying my five i think that'd be a good idea so my number five five five four was thomas paine um so i'm digging back on this one um thomas paine was part of the the early uh generation of revolutionaries he was an english-born american and he had ideas that i mean until this day if he was proposing them would be considered socialistic at the time he wasn't explicitly a socialist or anything but he had ideas about distributing land limiting inheritance of wealth he was uh a great critic of of sort of the irrationalities that come with capitalism he called it civilization so um there's articles where he's like you see the the indigenous don't have the absurdities of having like luxury in one place and then misery in another that's something that's unique to civilization um so again uses the term civilization but we can interpret it as as capitalism so he was one of the very very early critics of the way capitalism was was formulating itself um and he proposed what could be called some form of agrarian socialism with land distributive policies and stuff um and that's why that's why i have him as as number five i think he's very important um and he's perhaps the first and and most consistent radical in our tradition he was super anti-slavery he even has articles where he's like how was the west able to get slaves from africa well they sold him a bunch of booze and they corrupted the communities and then they were able to after they put them against each other then they were able to um to start having uh the communities that they allied with uh kidnap other uh other folks from other tribes and and make them slaves so he was honestly perhaps the most consistent radical in in that period um so yeah that's that's my number five just another quick comment on thomas payne um you have similar ideas to pain later on in the figure of george who wrote progress in poverty who is some say that was the most translated or read book at the time it inspired figures like marti dewey and a bunch of other figures but um knowing how to contextualize these radicals in their epochs is important because like a figure like george uh and georgism at his time was already sort of um it was too late to have those ideas we already have an industrial capitalism developing and he's promoting some form of agrarian distribution um but at the time of pain that was still sort of how the economy functioned right it wasn't an industrialized capitalism yet so that's what places thomas paine at the heart of uh of of radicalism at his time and next to other sort of uh radical liberal slash soft agrarian socialists of his time like uh like uh maxine rose pierre and and some of the other french who he also knew because he was active in the french revolution as well so a tremendous figure and one we um we should be teaching a lot more than right maybe limit our study of him to uh to common sense and uh we really have to read more because he's honestly a brilliant yeah he's like he's one and i'm sure this will be a theme with all of ours it's like maybe you're taught about thomas paine in history class but you're 100 not taught the radical history you know um which is which is you know uh uh probably a theme here at least with my list is a lot of these people are were praised you know our praise for maybe what they did in terms of civil rights activism but you're never taught they were staunch communists or socialists or radicals um like pain before you know the ideas of scientific socialism even existed um so i have maybe not a similar figure for my number five um kind of though a figure that's probably less taught though people probably don't know who this guy is um hughie long the former governor of louisiana also known as the kingfish he was assassinated um for his populist views and huey long was a critic of fdr to fdr's left so i remember learning about huey long in my american history class and they said fdr after the great depression wanted to strengthen labor because he saw what happened to workers and how they were devastated and he thought oh my goodness capitalism unregulated capitalism clearly doesn't work um we need to make concessions with the labor movement we need to make concessions with the socialists and the communists and huey long was saying if you don't change the mode of production itself and move towards socialism eventually the capitalists are gonna undo all the gains that labor makes and you're gonna end up back with this unregulated corporate um capitalist system with endless wars going on and i remember hearing that before i was even a socialist and being like hmm that guy was kind of right so i like to bring that up as an example to um you know and obviously we're trying to make any kind of gains we can for workers right now so that's why we end up pushing for a sort of social democratic person like bernie but ultimately if you allow private capital to exist it's going to grow and it's going to eventually crush labor and that is what huey long was arguing during the great depression and he was right if you ask me classic yeah good um so my number four again i think i don't think many people would know who this is but orestes bronson he comes from the tradition of the left transcendentalist and he's a labor radical he's inspired by by jacksonian uh principles of democracy um he's what's considered a jacksonian radical democrat and the thing about him is that he has a sort of radicalization that's kind of a roller coaster so he literally like takes a big old dip at the end of his life falls into catholicism and becomes like the most reactionary person ever which is like usual of people that fall away from a certain belief end up being the most extremist against the beliefs that they were right holding the most resentment um resound simone whatever but uh yeah so bronson's ideas were were quite interesting um so the following ideas i'm going to say from him were like at the height of his radicalism he was a staunch critic of wage slavery um he was one of those that felt that uh their the first revolution was not enough there needed to be a second revolution because you still have tyranny and privilege it's just in the factory it's not just political privilege of the aristocracies and and stuff um so he promoted something uh like a cooperative society that uh worked more so in terms of regions instead of like national sorts of uh uh nationalization of of uh of industry and stuff like that but um he had at one point um he was an abolitionist at heart but he tactically thought that the nor northern labor should side with the southern plantation owners because the southern plantation owners are seen as the key sort of enemy of the northern industrialist so it was sort of a reactionary position and um and you know it's funny like for the people that call marxism like clash reductionism if they were in that position and you were to tell them like what would be the marxist position here they'd be like oh no um it'd be clash reductionist it'd be this and what they'd be pointing at would be like sort of the bronson position which is funny because marx takes a completely different position but um yeah he was he was a critic of abolitionists but he felt that um that that you had to liberate also um should tell slavery just that wage slavery and its liberation should come first um like i said he ends up falling into this horrible um conservatism but at the height his ideas were were perhaps the most radical we had had at the time because it was a form of socialism that was no longer looking to escape society but it was looking to confront the class struggles present um even though he made many uh many mistakes and divided uh the the struggle of african liberation and black liberation from the labor struggle he's still one of those that that we should um bring back and and read his work and be fluent and who he was because he sets up a tradition for for labor radicalism in the us that's that's very um interesting and i think that we have quite a bit to learn from i'm trying to keep these short but it's hard to not go on there yeah i know i know it's hopeless to ask you like hey let's keep it short it was worth a shot um let's go uh my number four i cheated i did two of them um i did malcolm x and angela davis because there are two folks who were civil rights activists and their kind of socialist leanings are hidden from us especially malcolm x is a really prominent figure when you're taught american history but you're taught he was solely a civil rights activist and he was clearly a socialist as was martin luther king but the reason i pick angela davis and malcolm x is because they were like tanky socialists like martin luther king would talk about redistribution of wealth and like universal basic income um which is great but angela davis and malcolm x weren't they meeting with like the they had like at least critical support for the dprk um and they were pushing for really radical things and and you know the black panther party and and the civil rights movement and the actual uh radicals attached to the civil rights movement is one of the strongest movements that's ever existed or um and strongest parties that's ever existed within the united states um so yeah we got the chance to teach black uh labor history um for uh what was it black history month at um yeah at our college so we really got to read up on them and and their views on economics and uh and the plight of the black community in america and it was really enlightening um angela davis gets a lot of a lot of flack today people call her a lib it's like at the time she was doing her thing and her youth she faced down the u.s government you know they tried to take her to court and she like went and like talked to her talked her way out of it basically just like stood up for herself um and then malcolm x was of course killed um which is also a theme with a lot of american radicals they're either canceled or they're murdered and and these days uh the left cancels a lot of their best thinkers just for for the heck of it so kind of went on a tangent there but there you go there's my number four malcolm x and angela davis some goats just uh um one of the things that that's funny with malcolm x is that many consider him like this weird deviation of like the black liberation movement and many people think that like the norm was like the mlk sort of black politics but that wasn't the case the history of like black american liberation movements is is as militant and and holds similar positions to malcolm x so if we're looking at the lineage of the tradition um malcolm x stands there better than perhaps mlk would um yeah and then that's that's another excellent figure um so my number three um who's another giant in this tradition is w.b dubois um so we're we're taught and it's it's generally accepted that those who who win write the history um there's one exception uh and and the exception is the south after the civil war um it continued to have a hegemony on on how things were told and it continued to promote a narrative that slavery wasn't that bad that the slaves were considered as family and stuff and and w eb the boys did a phenomenal job in deconstructing that narrative and then showing the realities of slavery and and destroying the narrative of the southern historians that was hegemonized even after the civil war um beyond this he was a staunch critic of american capitalism american racism he has uh one of his one of his articles i think it's called the white soul or something it's written in 1918 and it analyzes the first world war from the perspective of race that i always recommend reading lenin's imperialism alongside with that because it really gives you a really nice insight when you work them both together in terms of the economic and the racial elements that led to the war and the european powers dividing up the world um so yeah the boy's another giant he joins the party in 1961 the communist party and and he's he's definitely the best of the best at least in my opinion in terms of uh of of black radicalism and just radicalism overall in in the usc um yeah nice continuing with the the theme of black radicals my number three is fred hampton um just as a young guy uh hearing hampton's story on rev left radio which is a podcast we both love um they had to stop taking uh applications to the black panther party when when hampton was recruiting for them because they didn't have enough work for people to do there were too many people who were applying to help out um and he was 20 years old and if if you listen to his speeches it makes sense you know he was just a powerful speaker um and to get so much attention and to sk to scare the cia and the fbi and the chicago police so much that they kill you at the age of 20. just by sheer you know they didn't even try and hide it they riddled him with bullets there were 150 bullets in his room um and this is someone who started the breakfast program where the black panthers would bring breakfast to impoverished neighborhoods and feed the kids and then educate them and read to them and then that's what he ended up being murdered for and the cia also burned the fourth the fourth floor of the black panthers headquarters where all the breakfast program um information was located so they truly saw this man as a threat um which is why he was killed and i it's just it says a lot that when you try and feed the hungry people of the country the state comes and kills you um so that's why i draw a lot of inspiration from him and he's my number three yeah he's he did what like the us left has been traditionally bad at which is like being able to combine nicely the struggles of like identity and and class um the sort of rainbow coalition that he did with the young lords and forgot what the white organization was was was tremendous and that's something that we see that when when you're able to mix in together the struggles from black liberation with class struggles that's when the fbi just [ __ ] goes nuts right when malcolm starts talking about class boom right when mlk starts talking about class and against the war boom um so yeah another great figure um my number two uh i'm not even sure if he should be on the list just because of his nationality but it's uh joseph wademeyer or vademeyer if you want to say it in german uh he was uh a one of the 48ers so 1848 the european revolutions that were popping off um the reason why marx and engels write the manifesto he was an active participant an active soldier at the time he started as a true socialist which is sort of this uh radical enlightenment um sort of branch and in in germany he ends up being friends with with marx and engels through their activity in the new uh rainey zatun which is the newspaper that they were editors for um he becomes a marxist and when he leaves i think in the early 50s it's angles and and marks that push him to come to new york because it was a strong immigrant presence here and and uh he comes to new york doesn't like it at first and then falls in love with it um he falls in love with american affairs with the american culture and that was actually kind of strange with a lot of the 48er radicals that came to the u.s they still had interest in going back to germany and having a revolution very few of them actually took uh the interest of the american struggle as as their own right and and wade meyer was was definitely one of those that was able to do that and he fought in the civil war um with other figures like august village and a bunch of other um 48ers so he's a real american hero he used the i'm pretty sure the first one to bring marxism over to the u.s so yeah i think he's huge for for our tradition that specifically uh has a a marxist analysis to it even though we're based on the american uh tradition of radicalism um yeah that's i i have him in there i don't even know if he could fit just because he he basically grew up in germany and came when he was already an adult but um but yeah he's he's an american hero he fought in the civil war um and yeah cool yeah i didn't know that much about him so um it's interesting to learn about i had a feeling you would pick more 19th century um and i would do more 20th century which so far i've been right um and continuing with that my number two is william z foster so i've been studying up on the history of cpusa a lot and like i said we've done a lot of research on the black panther party and those are the real two parties as far as communist parties in america who had a real influence um and william z foster was the leader of the cp usa from 1945 to the i think earlier mid-1950s but as we covered and as our friend alex the trade unionist pointed out um 1945 and on uh were the was the biggest time or the the greatest amount of strikes in american history where all these productive industries were going on strike and william z foster was the leader of the cp usa at that time encouraging these strikes um that that was the the biggest point for labor in u.s history you know it had been building with fdr as president after the great depression um but then after the war ended people were worried that all these jobs were going to go away and and you saw all these strikes which of course you know as marxist the real the real power and the real story there is the workers um you know which the workers who went on strike and who organized themselves and those unions are the real number two but williams d foster at that time was head of cp usa arguing for these things uh running for president too i believe um and and he ran uh with uh i believe he ran with uh person of color as his vp which he was like one of the first to do that of course you know in the 40s at a time when basically if you had a person of color as your vp you were probably disqualified or not like legally disqualified but people just weren't gonna vote for you but you know he had the courage to say this is what's right and this is what i'm gonna do so um yep that's my number two yeah and that's the tradition of cpusa like even the socialist party they were segregated at the beginning of the the 20th century and cpusa comes along and says no um they do base the uh the marxist leninist position and include the black liberation struggle within it better than any other organization that we've had to be honest um but yeah a excellent figure so my number one i was back can't be a drummer [Laughter] my number one is de leon um dania de leon he was born in curacao and he spends quite a few years in europe traveling all over really he gets to the us to new york i believe when he's 20 um either 20 to 22 we don't know it was a span of like two years that um that he could have gotten here but um he learns like seven languages which is insane he gets his law degree at columbia and teaches for a while and then ends up getting a lecturer position at columbia and through that time he was like academic radical he was a follower of the sort of georgian ideas that i was mentioning at first eventually he encounters marxism and starts to become more actively militant uh he uh so he i consider him the first american marxist um the first person that um that spends the most of his life in america who is actively a marxist although before you have frederick storage as well but um the most influential one is de leon and of course he was active and president of the socialist labor party and he was one of the founders of the iww he uh he he was one of the founders and the ideas that uh you're not going to do much with craft unions with unions that keep workers separate and then bosses can divide them based on how they organize themselves that organize yourself into one big union and you're going to be a lot stronger when it comes to the labor battles he made a few mistakes uh uh according to william uh i mean phillip foner who's a great marxist historian supposedly in that late uh 19th century the afl uh had passed a bill that urged i think the socialization of the economic sector um they they had passed like a really radical bill and then at that point uh uh de leon takes some of his uh socialist labor party people and starts his own sort of uh tangential union um and it sort of divides the radical elements of the afl but overall the picture of de leon is great he was one of the few that were also staunchly anti-imperialist he was against the uh the policy that the us was beginning to take uh the expansionist policies um so yeah a great figure and one of those that we really have to bring back he had excellent ideas on on on what it is to have a revolutionary ethic which we know are are things that lenin has spoken about uh in terms of the black panthers uh huey newton has spoken about it with his relationship of revolutionary suicide and reactionary suicide so he was a very principled man who dedicated his whole life after after being in colombia as a lecturer to the struggle and he's definitely one of those top figures of american socialism uh and communism nice i i really like your list it was different from mine as i expected which is why i wanted to do this this segment here i thought it'd be a cool segment um because i feel like i learned a lot just from listening do you explain that list so now it's time for my number one my favorite radical in u.s history is kim jong-un just kidding i gotta go we've been going with all these labor leaders and all these people who led um led uh labor movements or maybe who were politicians but my number one um marxist the person from america the person who's done the most for me in developing and how i view the world is michael parente the um god amongst men from new york who makes dialectical and historical materialism um incredibly fun and interesting to listen to and he doesn't necessarily use those words but the way he tells history um sticks to telling the story of class struggle um and he he tells history in a historically materialist way one of the best points he makes is when we look at existing socialist societies when we look at cuba we say look cuba is not as rich as the united states socialism fails and he goes why are we comparing them to what we have the the world's largest nation that's exploited half the world for a century why aren't we not comparing cuba to what they had before the revolution and what they had before the revolution was a military dictatorship with you know essentially slave labor on plantations where all the money was being funneled out of cuba into the west and post-revolution you have illiteracy abolished you know poverty um uh shot down unemployment way down um malnutrition way down um homelessness and then homelessness abolished you know of course the the gains of the cuban revolution are you know endless you could go on forever and he he talks about going to cuba and he asks one of the one of the people in in a smaller town like what do you think of fidel and they go oh i love fidel with all my heart and he's like why um and the person points to a hospital and he goes uh we have that hospital now um before before the revolution came and built that hospital we had to travel two days you know and usually we would when we had a really sick person we'd have to carry them two days and sometimes they died before we got to the hospital and parents like i'm not saying the cuban revolution's perfect i'm not saying that fidel and che were gods but you know the the revolution that builds hospitals and feeds the people and teaches the children to read gets my support and it's like that's the best way to view it you know it's it's people are always like do you have critical support for so and so it's like well all support is critical support because this is real life and there's never been a single human being in the history of um human existence who's been perfect um and that's how how parenting analyzes the world and and it's for me it's made analyzing geopolitics so simple like you don't have to defend countries who support your ideology tooth and nail and be like everything ever that's said wrong about cuba is a lie you know it's probably not there's probably a little bit of truth in it but but what you stick to supporting is building those hospitals and ending illiteracy and kicking out um the imperialist uh puppet dictatorship um so that's why parentheses my favorite and yeah that brings an end to our top five it was an interesting top five i like your list uh it was eclectic very eclectic between uh both of them um i if i do the list in like six months it'd probably be a lot different just because of the nature of where i'm focusing my research in now it's been 19th century uh so that you could probably see that reflected in my my list but um yeah parenti was super influential for me as well i remember reading history as mystery and just being like holy [ __ ] history is like one big lie and it's all uh manipulation and manipulation and manipulation and um yeah he does he does bring that marxist framework in such a common man way uh where where you just he explains it without like super uh technical terminology and and in a way in which everyone can understand and make it it makes it accessible for everyone and i think that's that's quite valuable um but parenthesis a beautiful segue into our next topic which is venezuela the elections and i think we'll probably talk about the the anti-blockade law um yeah he's a good segue because like you said he helps us interpret social estates in a nuanced way in which we can have critical support for them um and be realist uh so uh yeah do you do you want to talk about the the venezuelan elections eddie yeah yeah so we've been covering venezuela um like you said parenti's a good segue in the way i try and cover venezuela it's kind of in the style of parenti explaining how their economy got where they are where they're so oil dependent um and uh what the history of u.s intervention has been against venezuela and even what the history of u.s propaganda has been against venezuela and the history of u.s propaganda has been to um call the venezuelan elections fraudulent to no evidence so seeing the venezuelan elections which in 2012 former u.s president jimmy carter called the most highly monitored elections in the world um venezuela had their elections and the oas and the united states shortly after uh claimed that they were fraudulent so a month before this i covered it on tick tock and our youtube um venezuela invited the un and the eu to come observe the elections they said all right every year you say they're fraudulent um come observe and this is not new venezuela has invited the un and the eu for the last i don't remember i don't know exactly how many elections but for sure the last two before this one and both times the u.n and the eu decline and then the elections happen and they say fraudulent of course how do you know they're fraudulent if you don't go so this is what i said in my video i said they're going to say they're not going to go and then they'll say they're fraudulent and that's exactly what happened so there's all sorts of information you can find online about the venezuelan elections uh they were actually really interesting there was low voter turnout um the opposition party boycotted well there was a moderate wing of the opposition party that didn't boycott and then uh the the wing of the opposition that still stands behind guadal um the kind of most far right uh way out there pro-us sect of the opposition party boycotted the elections and then there was this low turnout overall um a lot of votes for the communist party um quite a few votes for the popular revolutionary alternative um who are critical of the new anti-blockade law which is the other thing we wanted to talk about so uh the chavistas as they're um a lot of communists and old school radicals in venezuela are disappointed with the piece of which is the socialist party psuv and maduro and their inability to combat u.s sanctions um and so maduro came out and did this new law or passed this new bill through congress called the anti-blockade law and the criticism of it from a lot of the old school radicals in venezuela is that it's a shift towards neoliberalism so it's a plan uh to increase privatization in certain areas in order to allow venezuela to breathe a little bit economically and get around the us blockade obviously the u.s has 155 sanctions on venezuela mostly targeting oil which basically the whole venezuelan economy is tied to um based on their history which is one where they're oil rich and in british british petroleum and dutch shell were sucking oil out of venezuela for years their economy became entirely dependent on oil this is the brief history there um so so now with this anti-blockade law carlos and i have been having the discussion of is this a drift towards neoliberalism or is this a way an attempt for venezuela to feed their people that from a pragmatic point of view we should support so one of the first things that's happened um now is i can't remember the name of the business you actually knew more about what exactly the industry was but venezuela's privatized um one of their something in related to the production of farm equipment which you would think is one they would keep so it's just basically part of the agricultural the the part of agriculture that manufactures the equipment to actually be able to do agricultural work um that's part of that's that's part of one of the things that they're they're going to be privatizing now um but yeah it's an interesting question because i think that we both shared the view when it happened that this was an anti-chavista move that this was a folding a move that folded and that um that was moving towards neoliberalism and and i myself i remember thinking no i think the problems of venezuela stem obviously from the blockade but um if venezuela was able to do more and to nationalize more than um that that's what the people want first of all but that's that's what would help them out more but i have come to i think take a more um a an approach that thinks with a i don't know how to say it with a better um having a little bit more faith and and piece of uh and and in the attempts that they're making to honestly provide for the material conditions of venezuelans the thing is that right now with the pandemic and the crisis the blockade is trying to strangle countries like venezuela cuba iran more than ever because it knows that the world is globally weak right now right and thus it is in such a uniquely hard position that when you're in that position you have to do anything you can in order to guarantee resources to be able to then distribute and have the social programs that you have it is in moments like that that ideas are are important right but you have to do as a governing body all you can to continue to provide for the economic needs of of your people right um so uh i with with with some readings of lenin that i had of of the later lenin the stuff he writes in 1921 he faces a similar condition he just had a couple years of wartime communism that that weren't necessarily making the material needs of of the people better they also get invaded by like seven countries right which which never helps um but um but he came to to this conclusion that there's gonna have to be concessions as long as there's global capital right because you can't feed people off of ideals you have to concretely feed people and as long as you have a revolutionary or worker party in power that you're fine it's going to be a risky move privatizing and opening up but it's strategies that you have to try and see how they work right and in a in a condition in the condition that venezuela is in where like yeah they're not too long ago they were trying to trade with iran and the u.s intercepted one of the cargo ships it's like how do you do anything like that stole the oil they literally stole a ship filled with oil um which is it's literal theft like you can't call it anything else right um when you're in that situation like what the hell else can you do i don't think the the privatizing mood move is not one that's done for its own sake the thing about privatization and i don't think i don't i don't see enough people talk about this is that the thing about privatization and when it's done in socialist countries it's not done because privatization helps create all of this wealth and development and stuff we've had the quickest development in the 20th century was the soviet union and it industrialized through a planned economy the role of privatization is because it allows you to participate in the global market and thus if venezuela at least i think if venezuela starts opening up certain sectors of their economy the privatization which i think is what the the anti-blockade law is trying to do perhaps they're hoping to be able to have uh to be allowed a little bit more participation into into global trade and and maybe a loosening of of the blockade but i i don't know what i what i do think is that the piece of does have the interest of venezuelan people at heart um so i do i don't think that they're doing that move as as as a step towards neoliberalism but it might be a a sidestep a concession that they think is necessary in order to maintain some of the other uh important social programs and the fundings for those that are what really affects the material life of of everyday venezuelans but it's a hard it's a complicated issue i mean i don't know what where do you stand yeah i'm i like you um and there's a lot of accusations of corruption against peace of but i don't think what's happened here is maduro and all the leaders that piece of have all of a sudden said hey we're going to become puppets of private capital i think like you said their intention with the bill is to feed venezuelans because that's always been maduro's intention like the perception of maduro in the west is so um it's just really hard to get a grasp on who he is because of the propaganda even if you're a leftist you know you kind of have this view of him as this dictator and a piece of is just this party that he rules over but piece of is large and it's got a lot of people behind it and then maduro is a former bus driver um who who has like we've criticized him for has kind of failed to um get around the u.s blockade in the same way that hugo chavez did but he's not like some tyrannical madman who's just sitting um you know in the lap of luxury like uh i mean obviously he lives better than the average venezuelan right he's the president and it's a really poor country so the people are poor and he's kind of rich but the the moves he's made for venezuela have never been with the intentions of explicitly hurting people or making them poorer obviously he wants to make them richer and obviously the way to do that is to get around the the us blockade so so i agree that those are his intentions and and now what you do is you just you know hope for the best um continue to criticize and call out u.s imperialism to try and get the blockade to open up see if you can get by then to move on that which you know good luck probably not but whatever and then and then just we'll just keep following the bill and and for us you know as an as a website that reports the news um in the west where not many people talk about venezuela we'll continue to cover it and and continue to share that with an audience who probably has read nothing but propaganda about venezuela their entire life so so yeah i guess that's where i stand on it continue to follow it and just hope for the best like root for them it's crazy how many leftists in the west i feel like are rooting against venezuela like they've had all these arguments where they're like oh i don't like maduro so now they're hoping for it to fail it's like why are you hoping for socialism to fail what kind of socialist are you yeah pathetic that's one of those things where like the the piece of uh i mean not the piece of the pcb um which in english translates to something different but the communist party of venezuela um and their unification with the other like popular progressive forces it's like i continue to ask myself like is that is that like an ultra position that that they're taking um and i don't know it's it's another thing is that we're limited because we we are here right we're not in venezuela either um so we're not able to do like this the same sort of work that we'd be able to do here right the same sort of investigative work even though we are getting sources from there right um but it's such a hard position but yeah i one of the funny things that i like obviously i think we agree that whatever the case is it's not like maduro opening it up the economy to private capital so that he can get richer with his family which is like what the gusanos miami are saying right it's funny because the other day they shared a picture of maduro's kid with like some designer shoes and they're like oh my god look these shoes are like two thousand dollars and this is the salary of a venezuelan and in like ten years or some dumb [ __ ] um and what's funny is that like that same group of miami people a lot of them are are what are called like sneaker heads and uh like they they buy a bunch of jordans and all the new dropping jordans and to people that's okay for them though yeah yeah but but they support capitalism and capitalism is when no sneakers we're no sneakers yeah that's right i mean communism is when no sneakers sorry but they'll like these are the i went to school with a lot of these people and these are the type of people that like if someone's wearing fake jordans they're gonna look down and be like oh the strap is twisted it's fake you know and they'll bully a kid for having like fake jordans or something and what they don't realize is that like venezuela colombia this whole area has like bootleg markets so the designer shoes were probably just boot like shoes but they don't do the same investigative work like manolito who just bought a pair of fake jordans and is wearing them to high school so [ __ ] this kid's son because they don't want her they're probably fake shoes too um so you see like people wearing like gucci leotards and [ __ ] it's like what motto of gucci was that they've never issued like that dude dealing with people from the venezuelan opposition i don't know if i've talked about this on youtube before about or on the podcast or whatever but i've talked to you about this it's like dealing with trump supporters except for all they say um to ver that you know verify every argument they have is i'm from venezuela and you're not but they the stuff they argue it's stuff like that and one that comes to mind is this guy tags me in a video he's like oh i'd like to see eddie lager smith defend this and he's like maria chavez the daughter of hugo chavez is the richest woman in venezuela she has like this absurd fortune i i google it and it was some weird right wing media outlet went to a bank and requested um to see her net worth from the bank and the bank apparently gives them a piece of paper and they read it that's the source on this and then of course um igor java's daughter saw it she's like the bank you know that's like illegal the bank just doesn't give people's net worth to media outlets and and she sued them for defamation because it wasn't true and she won like a million dollars because they defamed her and that was the thing this guy is citing and it's like it's such nonsense and when you're in america it's so frustrating because i see people in my audience taking that guy seriously and i'm like this is the equivalent of a trump supporter but uh just saying total nonsense in in support of his opposition party and against maduro but but people can't see it because they have no idea what's actually going on over there but i remember i got one argument one time that was like well all the people of the cuban communist party eat like lobster for breakfast like what the [ __ ] like first of all that's [ __ ] second of all second of all look at the inequality that they are focusing on a guy that eats lobster as opposed to a population that eats you know regular food whatever like soy uh ground beef was what the worst that they would get in the 90s with the uretha but they completely ignore a society where there's like duper billionaires and people that are homeless that inequality doesn't matter what i care about is the [ __ ] lobsters that the cuban communist party members are eating that's the real quality right there it's like yeah it's infuriating it's hilarious it um yeah definitely definitely have enjoyed meeting the far right sectors from all over the world as a part of you know um as a part of growing this uh this website here meeting the venezuelan opposition people um hindu nationalists uh israeli zionists whole lots of fun people with a lot of great opinions and a lot of opinions on me and carlos um so let's segue in that we talked about it at the beginning today's a historic day you know it's it's actually i was saying it's a historic day and it should be a federal holiday and people in my tick tock comments were telling me it's also the anniversary of sandy hook so that's sad that's not a historic day that's a very bad day um but er it is also the history of the day that moon tadar al-zaidi threw in a rocky journalist took off not one but two of his shoes and threw them at george bush as george bush was giving a speech um i believe it was he is 12 years ago today so it would have been well after the invasion of iraq well after um bush and all his cronies were exposed as liars and and i just want to say this is a heroic day one and two the people who lied us into that that conflict which is why this man threw his shoes he was probably i mean imagine being from iraq and then coming to the u.s and knowing what george bush did to your country and he's just walking around and people are praising him treating him like he's someone to be respected when he's a murderous murderous war criminal who invaded a country to maximize oil profits and people from his administ administration folks like john bolton and eliot abrams are now still around telling us we need to invade iran because they have wmds and people are falling for it and i have liberals in my tic tac of course you know we know liberals love to support imperialism saying oh israel iran is a theocracy look at their nuclear program don't we have to do something no we don't we actually don't have to do anything as long as it's identity diverse imperialism um but yeah it's it's such a legendary day um it's just if we have christmas for the birth of christ we should have at least something in that level um for this man who like a lazarus figure took off both not one both of us we're talking so much [ __ ] all right this was all an ironic part of the segment and and we hope to have made you laugh but um all right um we wanted to bring up something that's very important we have a we're going to be doing a talk next sunday at 12 p.m central time with dr thomas riggins he was a philosophy professor for many years in the new school for social research and in nyu two of the most prominent philosophy programs in in the country so he's going to be giving a talk on the relevance of lenin today which i think it's it's a very it's a very important topic that we must address because even in academia you have like marx is even somewhat tolerable but as soon as you bring up lennon it's like everyone gives you you know what's like what's going on what are you doing huh get out of here um but uh but yeah he's he's very important and then we i am of the belief that we must read lenin that lenin's insights are uh incredible and that his advancements to to marxism are are incredible and and have to be noted um and we have to study london seriously he was um he's a very important figure hell yeah um so yeah we're gonna have uh that next week and what we're doing is um we're allow we're we're setting it up as a lecture format so uh we're gonna have an audience uh it's gonna be done through a zoom call so if anyone that is listening to this now we're listening to it ahead of time like obviously if you're listening to it a year after it releases don't email me but um if you're listening to it in the right time you can email us at midwesternmarks gmail.com we'll have it linked under and we'll send you the zoom link for the lecture once you go in the lecture you can have your camera on you can have it off whatever but we will mute you and we will silence your right to speech but you um you're encouraged to provide questions on the chat throughout the lecture or afterwards and we'll select a few questions and have a q a at the end of the lecture um so it should be a 20 to 30 minute lecture and then a 15 a 20 minute q a session at the end so it's going to be a fun event we hope to do uh more events like this and um yeah i want i i just want to say i'm really proud of this event we're putting on obviously you and me both have a lot of respect for dr reagan's um probably pr i mean we both just have a lot of pride that he's on our site you know he's really smart and you know he's he's been doing this for for forever so we want to pull from his knowledge and share that and i just it made me think of nathan robinson the editor of what is it current affairs and he's a frequent contributor to jacobin i think just a couple months ago he was saying lennon's a mass murderer and nobody on the left should study or read lenin clearly never picked up you know admittedly has never picked up marks or lenin so i'm really really happy that we as a as a left-wing outlet in america with some sort of attention on us can be providing an alternative to that hogwash that you're getting from petty bourgeois folks like nathan robinson so absolutely i agree um so yeah remember that if you if you want to be included into the zoom call please email us at midwest remarks gmail.com uh and and we'll send you the zoom link uh 12 p.m central time next sunday which is let me just give you a date uh for those [Music] watching it's the 20th oh no it's just sunday okay uh the 20th december 20th i was about to say is it christmas on christmas i mean we could talk about lemon on christmas right we could around family you know you have the the sort of american memes it's like don't bring up politics in the table like in our case it's like don't bring up planet um you can bring up you can bring up social democracy but no actual socialism or lenin those are the rules at my table yeah yeah that's those topics are off limits but when i go to the kids table dude it's it's game over i'm just like writing down diagrams teaching them about exploitation and imperialism like while the parents aren't looking my five-year-old cousins and stuff they're all woke all right it's been a very pleasant talk um uh we hope to share the audio as well on on podcast networks so if you want to start listening to our podcast um i'm gonna say something that's very cliche but you you could listen to it wherever you listen to your podcast but yeah all right thank you peace peace
