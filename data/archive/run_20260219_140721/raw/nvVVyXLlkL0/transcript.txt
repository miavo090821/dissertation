hello folks welcome to state and revolution chapter four parts four five and six uh we got three pages of notes here today to summarize this text and talk about it and try and make it relevant till two today so part four of chapter four is called ingles criticism of the erfurt program i'm probably pronouncing that wrong um but this is the social democratic program of the second international and this uh lenin is arguing obviously that social democrats are opportunists they side with the bourgeoisie over the proletariat and that's what angles is going to be talking about here so ingles says that when joint stock companies become trusts and they start to dominate and monopolize industry private production and planlessness comes to an end and this also leads to imperialism so what lenin says here something really interesting he says this shows how carefully ingalls traced capitalism through its changes and through its evolution into a new stage um so capitalism one of the things about it is it is a system that grows right it is based on constant growth which means marx and engel's method of analyzing capitalism is constantly going to need to be applied as capitalism grows and becomes new things and what it's becoming now as these trusts are gaining full control of markets and industry um is just uh monopoly capitalism and this brings an end to plan-lessness in a way because now these these joints or these trusts can make plans for how production is carried out um and this lenin says should only make the proletariat want to overthrow the bourgeoisie more or through capitalism more because this is still capitalism right it's not crony capitalism um it's not yeah it's monopoly capitalism it's capitalism in a new stage right capitalism cannot stay it's this free trade free market utopia it needs uh companies will monopolize themselves form trusts and then this will lead to imperialism which obviously we've got a reading guide of that too um so german social democrats at the time are advocating for a peaceful transition to the abolition of private property um and before uh 1950 germany had a super repressive state constitution and being a socialist was actually illegal so the police could come arrest you um it's called the anti-socialist law in this book and lenin is saying that this has made the german social democrats into opportunists because they're scared of this anti-socialist law coming back they are now advocating for social democracy a social democratic transition and ingalls is going to criticize that he's going to say um he's going to say a lot of stuff um so ingles says in germany a peaceful transition is impossible and lenin and engels say something kind of interesting here they say you could conceive of it in a democratic republic right like in a liberal democracy a transition um a peaceful transition um which would make be the united states of america and you've seen that in a lot of the pink tied countries in latin america with evil morales hugo chavez lula you could say and of course they've faced havail correa and ecuador of course they faced heavy persecution from the west but they have nationalized industry and implemented and and raised social programs and built universities and done tuition free college um all these socialist things through liberal democracy but ingalls here is saying that uh germany's constitution is too repressive just because they don't have the socialist law um doesn't mean the people should stop advocating for revolution they still need revolution um and and he also says that the germans are arguing about petty political issues all day when they need to put class struggle first and dictatorship of the proletariat first um and ingles says look how oppressive your constitution is and look how oppressive your state apparatus has been you need to overthrow this if you're going to go forward with class struggle you need to seize state power so ingalls moves on here and he talks a little bit about the difference between different shells of capitalism i guess you could call them different political systems so he says that federal republics are better than monarchies but still need to be replaced by democratic centralism right by dictatorship of the proletariat and he says something that i also thought was interesting here he says that centralism does not mean bureaucracy right he wants communes and local governments local governments he says is much freer than federalism or bureaucracy provinces under a dictatorship of the proletariat need self-governance and universal suffrage so they can be no more perverse authorities appointed by the state right so um he wants he's essentially here arguing for decentralization right he's saying less state power more um people governing themselves provincial governments if there's representative bodies it's universal suffrage suffrage the community elects people from the community to run these representative bodies that make decisions about production and whatnot um so they're really really getting uh specific about what needs to be done right now you know post-revolution and arguing for for uh decentralization and also saying that dictatorship of the proletariat is still necessary all right so that is the end of part four so part five of chapter four and it's called the ninth 1891 preface to mark the civil war in france where ingalls draws different lessons from the paris commune so he says after um the paris commune was established the state disarmed the workers so after the revolution they were left unable to defend themselves so ingles says after the revolution there's going to be a counter-revolution right the bourgeoisie is going to try and seize power again this is proven to be true basically anywhere socialism is established and then mostly during the cold war era most the countries who um had revolution were not only dealing with the bourgeoisie of their own country but of course the west who would dump money into these countries bourgeoisies and have the cia destabilize their countries and whatnot so angles are saying in order to prevent this you the workers need to arm themselves and be ready to protect the revolution from the counter-revolution um so lenin then turns to russia because obviously like we've said he's writing this for the russian revolution it is going on um or they've they've had the revolution and he says in 1917 the social democrat saratelli i think that's how it's pronounced i don't know called to disarm the revolutionary workers and london said that this is the clearest moment where the social democrats side with the bourgeoisie and show what they really are right and we're not talking about like uh american context here right we're not talking about like bernie sanders supporting stricter gun control and being like you opportunist to the hag or whatever i don't know um we're talking about post-revolutionary russia right they've had a revolution and this guy is saying let's disarm the workers and lenin's like you are siding with the bourgeoisie you slimeball um so yeah different context but and of course i agree with london on that that was the social democrats at the time were siding with the bourgeoisie because they're capitalists so um now they talk about religion and lenin and ingles make a critique of religion and they critique germany for uh allowing religion to be a private matter even within the party um and they shouldn't they say people within the party are materialists right so they they shouldn't be religious because then they're making decisions spiritually rather than religious and they say religion breeds opportunism um and you know i would just like to push back a little bit here because you have places like nicaragua where the sandinistas basically needed liberation theology just because it was so heavily ingrained in culture and i think even i think the soviet union's you know anti-religious attitude hurt them and it hurt the amount of propaganda the u.s could put out there about them you know i a lot of people have messaged me concerned when they found out i was a marxist like you know this is anti-religion right you know this is against the religion you were raised in um and i think even if you're an atheist it's important to realize that just bashing religion can be alienating to people um and alienating to the working class of different cultures nolan is talking about russia right at the time and they're talking about germany and saying there should the people in the party should be materialist because religion breeds opportunism but if you look at the sandinistas in nicaragua you know the opportunist parties were the irreligious parties right they were um the the party who took power and was the most successful and led the masses was the ortega faction who who used liberation theology so so lennon now turns back to ingles for more lessons from the commune workers couldn't use the old state machinery because a democratic republic's states and monarchical states serve the bourgeoisie and need to be changed totally so this is like the central thesis of state and revolution right now there's a state that serves the capitalists wipe it aside turn it into a state that serves the revolution and then wither it away um and it needs to be totally changed right it can't function in the same way as the capitalist state um and okay so he says the commune was made to pay state officials the same as workers and this was to stop career hunting and career politicians and the u.s will tell you that most socialist states um you know became super corrupt at the top and they were just funneling money into themselves not really true um the the soviet bureaucracy wasn't even paid that well you know it's most there was a huge like government bureaucracy which you could criticize and say was bad but it's not like these people were making millions of dollars most the corruption you'll see in socialist states like i'll use venezuela for an example is people within the socialist government um collaborating with the bourgeoisie or with the western bourgeoisie right you could have people within the venezuelan government selling out to uh american interests as the cia is dumping money in there or you could you know their price control set on the food you could have people in venezuela traveling to colombia the u.s backed right wing country and selling the food and then the ussr of course you have gorbachev selling the country out to private capital which caused the humanitarian crisis in the fall of the soviet union as they switched to capitalism 75 percent of people want to go back to the ussr style system um but yeah the point is that most the corruption that happens in in socialist governments is with uh with the capitalists interestingly enough so lenin says that socialism is the only thing that can stop the revolving door seen in all capitalist countries this is so common in the u.s of course i mean they don't even hide it all our sec all our secretaries of defense are like literally weapons manufacturers paul ryan retired from politics a while back he's only like 30 now he's got a job with some company you know and and the lie that capitalism rewards the riches the richest people the people who work hard you know it's people who are born into political families and then go into these revolving doors and the only way to stop that is to pay politicians as much as the workers pretty simple idea here from lenin but i like it very practical um and there's no democracy without socialism he makes that point because the rich can buy the state um so ingles says that this is a this is a great part here i love this part angle says that people are born into a society that teaches you that the government is just that we have democracy and that the government and state share in the interests of society um and people at the time think monarchy switching from democratic to going from a monarchy to a democratic republic means that democracy has been achieved and ingalls is saying no not at all the state as much as they pretend to be in your favor right as much as lip services they serve you they exist to suppress the proletariat and hold up the interests of the bourgeoisie i mean anyone who's paying attention to american politics today can tell you that is what our deliberate democracy is no matter you know whether there's a d or an r next to the republican or the president's name they are upholding the interests of those who own capital and they are suppressing workers from creating any kind of any different kind of country ingalls says that the state only emerges when society is cleft into classes of exploiters and exploited revolution which must crush the state which serves an as an instrument of oppression by one class over another right um when humans way way back this is what ingles says in his book origins of private property in the state when human societies were way way back when they lived in community with each other they didn't need a state right because um the conflicts were mediated by the group but as soon as you have property ownership and society becomes a class of people who work the land and people who own the land there becomes a state to protect those who own the land from those who work the land and keep those who work the land in their place and this is true of feudalism slavery or capitalism any economic system based on private property and the way to to stop this is for those who who work the land to seize the state apparatus and use it to create the kind of society that they want is what ingalls is arguing here um and lenin's final point in this is that monarchy and democratic republics serve the same function um and lenin and engels recognize that the form still matters but countries must adapt to their own conditions so like um whatever kind of form of government you have is going to be different based on your country and the socialists in that country have to look at it and decide how to best do class struggle and best take the state apparatus in their hands and use it for the good of the workers rather than for imperialism and dumping money into uh giant corporations all right that's the end of part five all right part six is pretty interesting um maybe not the most important part but i kind of like it it's pretty short so it's angles on overcoming democracy so ingalls critique social democrat saying that marx used the label communist to express their views which differed from prudone and lasalle however the parties grow while the names remain so the meanings change over time so he's taking a dialectical view of parties and labels right he's saying social democrats start is one thing and then the name stays the same but the party changes and and same with communism that's a good point for people today right who fight so hard over ideologies i'm a marxist leninist i'm an anarcho-communist communist i'm a narco-syndicalist i'm just a sock dumb like these ideologies have changed over time in their meaning like i'm constantly updating lennon for today right like constantly trying to bring it into today's terms um that's what marx wanted us to do and lennon wanted us to do that's interpreting things um with dialectical materialism all right so how everybody's grown blah blah blah ingles didn't have a huge party but lenin does the bolsheviks um the name is unscientific london says and inconsequential using what what ingles said about the parties changing um and lennon even says he wanted to change the name at one point however the actions of the bolsheviks party have been scientific and have advanced the plight of workers he says so he's basically saying who cares what the name is we organize the workers and we're seizing power and that's what it's all about and that's how you build socialism that's how you move the the dialectic of history right the workers um the the majority seizing power over the minority um that is scientific and regardless of the name of the party who does that um that is the point of marxism and lenin says the bolsheviks are scientific because of their relation to the state which they want to seize and wither while protecting the revolution and then of course later after doing that they would be invaded by uh some bad people from germany and they would help save the world from one of the scariest threats we've ever faced um so ingalls is like going to make a critique of democracy here and he's like this sounds crazy no democracy what do you mean but democracy itself is the state recognizing that there's a subordination of the majority by the minority and socialism will lead to communism like it says and subjugation by man on man will disappear leaving no need for a state or voting which is only the illusion of choice anyways um so he's saying at one point once there's no subjugation of man on man and we're all living in community with each other there won't even be a point of voting pretty utopian stuff here lennon um so this is just why you're saying marxism is anti-democracy right because it's going to lead us to this society um but that's the that's the goal of communism the dream of communism and regardless you know socialism is better for the workers the in-between stuff dictatorship of the proletariat um uh where am i the no democracy argument uh voting right now is the illusion of choice of course new generations will be raised without the preconceived ideas about the state being beat into their heads by the bourgeoisie so this is a really good point this is how you can start to imagine communism right every generation that's raised up is different from the next um so we have these ideas you know and the boomers and older people are even more set in their ways right their ideas of this is a democracy you vote democrat or republican that's just how it works socialism and communism are evil but any every generation has different views and different ideas and our generation is much more marxist and then if we are able to achieve socialism right what kind of generation is being born into a socialist world and then the generation after that you know they're going to have different ideas based on how they're raised in the kind of world they're growing up in so you could eventually have a world where everyone's growing up in a society where there's no oppression by man on man over man right there's not one class who owns in one class who works everyone works and everyone owns and that's the kind of society people could grow up in and it would be sick it's called communism check it out all right that is the end of our uh review and summary of chapter four here by lenin pretty cool chapter i like some of the stuff they talked about i'm looking forward to reading and bringing you chapter five alright peace out everyone
