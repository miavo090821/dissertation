As an old guy, the youthful \"woke\" movement is often far too hypersensitive for me.  When I was young, there were popular shows that would be \"cancelled\" by the woke mob today:  M.A.S.H., All in the Family, the Jeffersons, Adam 12, Happy Days, Dean Martin Roast Comedy, Different Strokes, etc.  The hypersensitivity has gotten too extreme for me.  My threshold is high, and Sweeney doesn't even get close.  A great anti-woke film would be \"Back to School\" of 1986 - sure to be cancelled today but has become a cult favorite among anti-woke fans.",
