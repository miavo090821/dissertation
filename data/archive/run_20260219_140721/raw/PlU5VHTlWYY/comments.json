Remember opium addiction was a thing in China in the late 19th century before capital even developed much and before any “war on drugs” . Toil and misery is the demand side, the supply side is either the gov (brits in china) or the black market where secretly backed organized crime supplies it. \n\nThe gov promoted drug culture in the 60s as a kind of dreamy escapism from any kind of genuine radical struggle . And you see this today in folks like Joe Rogan and derivatives of the psychedelic movement. They sell drugs and drug culture as a solution to social ills. As some form of gateway to freeing your mind and seeing “the truth” that will finally let you be truely free and happy..etc. it has almost a religious connotation to it, not too different from the way Dharmic cultures sold their own religions as “salvation” from suffering. TLDR its a distraction. \n\nObviously it wouldnt work if drugs were just legalized and regulated. That would totally take off the edge of it being counter cultural, thus the “war on drugs”. \n\nAnother reason is that , its a massive black budget to use to fund illegal or grey programs outside of public oversight. Not to mention that much of this organized crime can be used as indirect enforcers of the elite, in case doing through official channels is risky. In other words there’s a quasi “brown shirt” element to the whole thing. \n\nAnyhow cheers",

Approach transgender people with empathy. Speak to them, befriend them, and hear what they have to say about their experience. I agree that IDPOL has taken too much preference over class struggle among the western left and that the ruling class embraces identity-related struggles as \"acceptable and approved\" struggles, but I feel that the more we focus our attention on \"combating IDPOL\" and delving into outright transphobia that we run the risk of becoming the other side of that coin; we will make the culture war the focus of our attention and let cultural differences divide us. Would it not be more productive to ignore and denounce the culture war altogether, to unite the blue haired baristas with the MAGA truckers under the banner of class struggle? Further, just because the ruling class puts identity politics on a pedestal to be a red herring for would-be revolutionaries, it does not necessarily mean that identity related struggles are \"bad\" and not worth engaging in, they should not take priority over class struggle.

That's not hatred, that's respect for intelligence and common sense. \n\nGender nonconforming men who live 'as women' exist in numerous cultures all over the world, yet they do not try to coerce people into accepting them literally AS women, nor do they launch political campaigns demanding access to regular women's spaces. That is a peculiar aspect of the toxic, narcissistic, corporate backed LGBTQ culture that exists in the West. 'Transphobic' is a term weaponized a lot like 'anti Semitism' is by Zionists- its a 'power word' used to shut down discussion by intolerant ideologues, because they know their claims cannot withstand scrutiny in open debate.",

Because US imperialism utilizes any and all identity to attack its enemies: the uyghur muslims in china are weaponized, the women in iran are weaponized, the poor in cuba are weaponized. There is nothing intrinsic to gayness that makes it any better as a cudgel to attack US enemies, and this is modern history 101 level shit.

    "text": "Sorry comrades but this video describe a phenomenon, it does not explain it. This video is way too long for the content it (does not) bring. To claim that the left went soft is a description that anyone sympathetic with Leninism will agree with. To have ML as a \"worldview\" implies going into the detail of all topics, it requires specialisation and of course professionalisation. For example,  \"sexual revolution\" didn't start with French guys in the 60s, Kollontai is a famous figure of this movement, this was the mood of many in Europe and Russia alike (Kollontai said a lot of crap, including her framing of raising kids like some kind of burden, her idea to \"collectivise\" kids is plain stupid, good it was refused by the majority). To say that the root is \"over 50 years ago\" (min 30), only shows that the speaker himself didn't do his homework.\nApologies in advance, I don't want to be too negative, but if the video is precisely about the decline of the left, it means that each one of us has to work to raise the bar, first in theory, then in practice. The whole issue of \"patriarchy\" gave much room for confusion, partially because of Engels himself and the flawed (but very bold) claims that Engels built based on Morgan very basic works about matriarchy. We know today that this interpretation is flawed, matriarchy was the rare exception even in very primitive societies. We don't need to advocate for patriarchy, but we have to correct wrong theories from the past that still influence this liberal-left worldview. The speaker mentioned Engels and his work on the subject, but only en passant, without any real critical view.\nOf course, this is just an example among many, \"sexual revolution\" as any broad tendency, does not have only one origin. But to claim that this is from the 50s/60s is to miss the history of Leninism itself (see Zetkin's short memoir of her visit to Lenin - they discussed the topic of feminism and modernism in general).",

        "text": "@vannajs5024 This is just false, the USSR was in many ways socially progressive to the West, at least at its outset. Conservative is a *relative* word, Marxism wasnt a conservative philosophy at the time by any means. Conservatism as youve defined it (various forms of bigotry) was both the norm and not \"product\" of capitalism. Social bigotries can exist regardless of capitalism/communism, which is why Lenin takes the time to write by anti semitism and why the CCP dedicates a proportionately large part of its national peoples congress to minority representatives (even though its a dictatorship of the proletariat). You right wing morons would call this \"Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\" I believe. Regardless the point remains, social understandings have advanced a lot in the last century as the world has become more globalized: just because Marx didnt himself say trans rights doesnt mean that we shouldnt let trans people have rights, unless youre suggesting that we borrow social attitudes and things like cosmography from the ancient greeks simply because their other ideas were worth internalizing.",
