and she said you're not a good dad here's here's the reputation of your argument how does it make you feel and Cam went from 65 to 5'6 real quick I felt bad for the clips of what I watched uh gam Newton because I watched him drown a lot of the time and if your only idea is like at least I'm somewhat present in the home and I can provide for them cuz he was like all of my kids live with me that's a difference on like he's like at least I present and I yet again really want us to come back to the table as a community and begin to deliberate on what that looks like for us she was saying

of Olay and Friends hello beautiful black people was that sample you know that samp I'm here for a beautiful I'm going to hand it off to uh to afy in a second so that FY could give the background for foreign on the cam interview he did not watch CU that's what brings us here a large conversation people are having about I don't know like men's willingness to have babies but not get married all of this just to the next thing so to you FD oh so you know I was I I love when o brings me on to talk about something I wanted to talk about but felt like I missed and didn't want to Circle back to for my own efforts but now I get to kind of just like on the whole thing without it without any of the consequences really coming back to me on my channel it get to all be your responsibility um so Cam Newton who is a NFL legend um quasi Hall of Fame figure but definitely a legendary figure in the NFL as a qub back as a black quarterback as a cultural icon within NFL um stop playing I think last year was his first year retired and started podcasting and immediately joined the barbershop podcast uh network of ofy with um wallow and Joe Button and literally math Hoff in the barber shop and don't get me wrong I dabble i f with a lot of the just I I need that energy and now I want to be clear as we roast in critique there is a place for that to always exist in my heart I I don't want to speak for everybody else but you will never get a full condemnation of that environment from from from FD signifier because that's an environment that helped create FD signifier but to be specific cam brought on a a therapist of some ilk I've heard people say her credentials and that doctor in front of her name is doing a lot of work Maris you want to it's doing a lot of work it's doing a lot of lifting okay she went to University of Phoenix Dr Phil Doctor version of the doctor drar probably got low key we leave that alone for now cuz it's already goingon to be enough on us to either way regardless of her credentials live in Philly regardless of her credentials she did get in on your boy Cam and I think a pretty clear and I can't fight her on it way which is you can't just walk around with eight kids by three women and like present yourself as a high functioning patriarch uh family man like without critique and like make it seem like this is I'm not going to say normal because I don't necessarily agree with the like presenting Norms as the ideal for black family structures or anybody's family structure but you can't have it cake and eat it too I have a take and I I'll start with my take and then I'll let y'all jump in for whoever wants to take it I'm a father of two um I am a product of a man who has four kids by four different women and I'm from Chicago I'm from the southide I went to hcu I know a lot of that have kids in a variety of different situations and most of the men I know with kids are effective fathers they're effective they're doing what they can they're not dead beats I I oh I wouldn't really with them too tough but I don't think you can be a good father if you have more than four kids by more than two women I just don't cuz you can't you can't in for who has a child in in in house right now if you are not in the household and this something she said when that child wakes up scared wakes up pooped like literally pooped it his body like pooped half his body weight into his his clothes um comes home with with a bully comes home with extra homework like all the things that you have to be there to do you can't do that by dividing yourself literally 64 different ways 64 different combinations of fathering you just can't do that and that is a critique that needs to be held against like I don't want to I don't want to promote the myth of black fathers don't do nothing I don't want to promote the myth of black fathers all abandon their kids all that stuff that's not really factually sound but for the for the brothers that are pop propping up families and then moving on understand that each time you do that you're reducing your Effectiveness as a father and like I think that was her main point and for that point I think she's dead got him dead to rights so I'll start there and and I'm G start because I was the first person here uh I'm kidding we so sorry for the sake of time raising Canon because I know you die at some point in raising Canon now y'all know me I usually wait to speak last but today I'm going to speak first first of all um I'm not going to attack black women on this phone call because there's too many here um but I will attack oami because oh you railroaded me with this I'm here so I don't get fined I said I'm here so I don't get fined um there is no world in which I would be wanting to participate in this conversation because we not talking about Palestine we not talking about Cala at make me like for the last not talking about no intellectual you brought me in for the and by way I brought you in for the exact kind of thing you would make me talk about for four hours in real life this exactly the kind of thing Malcolm would debate me down about too now two ow credit as well she spends her whole life talking about all of the actual matters that matter to the larger sphere of life in humanity so she's a warrior but um I would have liked to have been on those this one particularly uh I have multiple reasons why I don't want to talk about it FD and AJ and big body for number one number one my political stance and my personal stance is life is I'm a part of the party of nyb have you guys heard about the new political party my your business party it ain't your business it ain't mind your mother and don't none of you pay nobody mother bills no none of you pay your y'all avoid taxes like Trump in this mother every single one of you [ __ ] commenting got four five kids on your income tax or you pay and write off [ __ ] with your business stop this stop it you don't care about them kids you can't none of you tell me about none of them kidss names none of their mama's names you don't know where they go to school you don't know where they you don't know their health so in my opinion first of all I want to just state if I'm talking about this subject it is not about the individual Cam Newton it's not about the wonderful beautiful honorable doctor that may have been discussing things with him where I'm not here to talk about those individual honorable not like H all the hate talk about Dr Umar S I don't want to talk about her I don't know these people because I'm a and I'm have to stand on business and I can fight but right now I'm injured I'm injured right now I can't is also 66 260 like that's not a normal dude hey but look BR and listen if I wasn't on crutches I squabble behind whatever I stand on but the reality is I can't talk about these individuals because I do not know them and I do not want to make a practice of doing so what I can comment on is I hate the negative cultural connotation of black men being discussed as if they are not predominantly 66% in the household taking care of their children this is a smear campaign being misappropriated or mis misdirected as some kind of larger cultural conversation we need to have about black man and it ain't Fair because he don't represent us number one not because he's lesser of a man or more of a man [ __ ] all that he is an extraordinary circumstance he is not a part of the data set that is a that makes more money than most people can imagine to make in their lives he got an extraordinary circumstance with extraordinary circumstan circumstantial women with extraordinary extraordinary circumstantial children and he's talking to a woman who is trying to apply certain normal Common Sense beliefs to an extraordinary situation and this is all silly because until you are in that extraordinary circumstance and by the way you don't have to you don't have to subscribe to what people believe in or what they want do with their lives if girlss want to go be smart let them be smart if they want to go do stupid [ __ ] with stupid [ __ ] let them go do stupidness if that's what you want to do but I just can't frame this conversation as a cultural Touchstone for something that's a larger problem it's not that's fair not that's fair but I think that's fair I think even though with the extraordinary circumstances of him being obviously cam ning and being very wealthy and y y I think the general I think it's not unreasonable to still think that even with a lot of money even with exceptional like Fame access resources and stuff I think that puts you in a better place to be able to do better in terms of fing and Parenthood than maybe like your average person but I think what like is still required of parenting what requires of the day-to-day raising a child being with a child every day I think that's still going to be lacking even in that even in the most extraordinary circumstance which I think takes us down to the conversation camon is not representative I think that takes us down to like the average situation to say all right if we could think that it's probably even an issue it still runs into a lack of you know uh uh this can still be a problem people deciding to have being so comfortable with having multiple children and multiple different homes and how that may impact um uh the child raring you know if if this is still going to be an issue even there that should that I think that is why the the purpose of having a conversation will well for the regular for the average person we're seeing in our in our communities which right it's not representative of every uh every black household or every black father situation but I think people really want to touch on why so many people or why so many men feel so comfortable with the idea like they don't think of it as much of a as the same level of long-term commitments or like life change of seriousness to have kids with different women in different homes versus likeon so I'll commentate on that and then I'll let the floor have it I'll commentate on that and let the floor have it in my personal opinion when I said extraordinary circumstance I just want to make sure I'm clear I'm talking about any with eight kids talking about money I'm not talking about Fame my daddy seven and he's an extraordinary man um an extraordinary man and he comes with his faults and and his assets and his Li he got all that but I'm just saying I just want to make sure that I'm clear here the extraordinary circumstance I'm talking about is any human being that has gone like FD said past four children you know what I'm saying I I just think that at some point if we're talking about functionality look we put men on the moon somebody can figure out a function to make something work will everybody get what they need probably not resources get limited who knows whether it's time whether it's care whether it's space whatever but how many people see their kids every day in the first [ __ ] place all this [ __ ] is weird I don't I don't [ __ ] around with people who have one kid and suck but if we're talking about eight it just becomes extraordinary circumstance that's what I mean by extraordinary circumstance eight kids so you guys proceed have the conversation about that and I'll chime in when I can but the ccan is eight kids CU there's poor the FL Malcolm I'm just you really passionate about this okay this eight part this extracurricular so I'm a very I'm a I'm a very um non extraordinary father um and the newest one at that have one I have one um five Monon old child and it is an extremely um humbling Endeavor that I've thought quite a bit about and I haven't seen necessarily an adjacent discourse to this which I think is far more productive to have especially given that not all of us are fathers not all of us are parents here but this is one thing that we all are um and that's Community um so first off I want to point out the fact that this is a very American Centric conversation when we talk about black fathers not being in the homes if you go anywhere else outside where there is the black guys FBA people get mad at us too we you don't know it's gonna come it's it has to happen so like let me tell you something you know I'm so used to you giving me the American Centric indictment every o Friends episode but this one time I thought I was not in the in the in the I thought this one for sure it's happen it's got to happen like literally there is far more representation and diversity of dead beat to that of the year and everything in between that falls apart there so when you talk about this type of thing and the reason why like I wasn't engaged with this for the most part is because literally the fact that like I have every repres representation across the gamut when it comes to that but NE not only that though a really important part is we have to yet again weigh in on what an effective father is what exactly as that like in that vernacular what is effective what does efficacy mean in that case um me waking up 4:00 in the morning changing the baby diaper and everything like that making sure he's still breathing all lot of the stuff he like sleeping on the stomach so now I got to turn this [ __ ] over on his head to save him from himself right okay I got to that's effective right I could be there for theur of everything right um but I'm more so concerned about the idea of what exactly fatherhood has looked like across the spectrum because you could have a father that is there on a regular basis in that household doing a net negative to that child a net negative to that Union and that's a part that like necessarily we don't even have to talk about because you have a lot of different instances where the father plays this Bill Cosby always in the home able to juggle a million different kids but is also deliberating and and delivering a net negative to a bunch of different people because they don't have a variegated needs of expression of all kind of different fathers whereas which we get into Community when you have not only me being a father to this child but you also have um Unk you know if if peanut don't like what I saying right now or dad you tripping like you know you a you didn't do this part this or you didn't have this life experience he can look there FD and say you know what this ain't got no dreads FD got dreads I'm going to go and get dreads like unle FD you know what I mean and like that's important because also what if that child doesn't want to dress like me what if that child doesn't want to like women like I do what if that child doesn't want to um Express themselves in the way that I am that's where the variegatedness of community is exact and I mean that's valid too if you want if well actually no I I want no chrisan walk Inside My Child please call I can't have that but it's important because like we yet again put hus on this very myopic um traditional family structure of what a father is supposed to look like and what it's supposed to be and I yet again really want us to come back to the table as a community and begin to deliberate on what an effective unit in family structure for a black family too since we are all darker and blue what that looks like for us and that does not only mean me and a g and a dog [ __ ] on the lawn and a white picket fence and it also doesn't mean that a father has to be effective know differents there but there's many arrang that are this not taken into account that I feel as though we are limiting ourselves to when we just focus on what exactly this family unit that wasn't built for us is supposed to be like well cuz that reminds me yeah it reminds I'm trying to get in before this internet decides to act up um but it reminds me CU I'm an educator and so like sitting there and with my students I play an active role in so many different children's lives right and so parents have to work with me in order to ensure like is my kid learning and I worked at of all boys high school so it's like now I'm like developing relationships with fathers who want to be present who are also lacking a skill set in some spaces cuz I'm teaching social emotional learning and having to be like well let's navigate these emotions let's navigate conflict resolution and all of that and so I'm listening as everybody's talking and I'm like yeah part of it is like redefining what community looks like and seeing like different representations of how other men impact Community as well and so I'm hearing there's almost feels like a single narrative that's happening which we know is dangerous because there's PL representations of black men in this call alone but the second piece is also like as I'm thinking around like this conversation and the difference of parenting we also don't need to follow a traditional suit if we're looking that there's a mom who is making she's the bread winner which means a father may have to show up in Partnership a little differently right and so we start figuring out one what is the family structure that works for y'all how are you existing in this partnership together financially may not be making as much as black women or some cases they be making more but do you know what you're doing right and so I think what I have witnessed in terms of different parents that I've come into and different family structures they are much more communal because they're in intergenerational households so families units don't even look the same as is and I'm like I'm in Philly so I can't talk for everywhere else but I'm looking at where um I'm the children that I service and their families yeah some of are all still figuring it out parents are somewhat getting a little younger too so they're also trying to figure out this space um so I think around like the reactions I saw to C Newton and I'm like yeah some still like in this idealist idea of what a man should be versus like what you can be because we don't have to follow traditional Norms either I wanted to touch on two things between Malcolm and forn and I think actually Maris kind of built upon something that forign said as well cuz Malcolm pointed out an important thing about that I've talked about in a lot of videos of just like the gender Wars content cycle and the requirement for figures like Cam Newton to put himself out there to to to get eaten up for clicks right and and just a same with you know this girl don't want to go to uh Red Lobster on a date and here's a balloon pop video like i' I've made content about it and we got to get to that too um but I wanted to make sure I gave validation to that so that there's no confusion as to why cuz some people especially some of the people I think going to try to respond to this are going to look at that as deflection and that's not deflection that's correction as to like what the actual true Narrative of the situation is true issue is said another thing that the reason why that resonates and why that's able to um Captivate an audience so much is because it's engaging with for lack a better word like deep wounds within black men and women that regardless of the the the data set are relevant to a lot of people which is the performance of gender and um uh for mentioned one of the thing last things he said is that we're talking about um Family unit uh formulations that we were never meant to be included in the the the two the two the the wife husband wife two and a half kids and the dog and a pick a fence was never supposed to be not supposed to be a part of that equation and we fought hard to be a part of that and then that fight have ended up in a lot of weird spaces you know you know what I'm saying there's a lot of cool things that have happened but there's a lot of weird [ __ ] that happens and one of the weird things that I think is relevant to this story with Cam is finding alternative ways for men to claim manhood that are I'll just say not the not the best ideas to promote not overly healthy and don't lead to conversations especially online where everything is turned up to 10 that are useful for anybody whether they're you know uh in a family unit in a non-traditional family unit seeking a family unit whatever and so right and so for for cam in particular for that like for me personally because I'm also a former educator right and so I've I've been in the the parent Council and had Parents trying to explain why a kid's dysfunction is not reflective of what's going on at home you know what I'm saying and I've heard and I'm he's already he had a physical reaction to that cuz he knows what you hear and it's like I'm hearing you I feel your intention but the details you're presenting to me are not having the effects you you think they're supposed to have and for for cam particular this is a man as as uh I put earlier 6'6 250 lbs so the physiology of masculinity solidified a multi-millionaire legendary professional athlete so the provisionally and socially in iconography solidify you can't tell him [ __ ] but we get to this this the other part of provision which is not monetary but social emotional and you don't just see this with Cam and this is why it's dangerous because it's relevant but also irrelevant you see uh they cam um Aon Nick Cannon um and probably some others I'm forgetting about we love to pay attention oh gas Khan uh every every leader of a hierarchal patriarchal empire ever every everybody but specifically with black men though it's representative of us as men in a way that is so Insidious because black men are required to beat down that image cuz Elon Musk doesn't represent white fatherhood you know what I'm saying but you're right all all all South Africans right exactly [ __ ] [Laughter] Elon mus is not does not represent uh all white men he represents Elon Musk Cam Newton represents all black men especially because he fits in all these other categories so snugly and thus there's a a almost reflexive defense of his what do we call extraordinary behavior that we have to content that we have to contend with and also contend with the fact that it's unfair that we have to contend with this you know what I'm saying so it's not a fear thing but it is a it's an honor thing which ironically connects to my my counter to you right which is yes I will not I will concede that because of what he represents as a symbol that it needs to be discussed and addressed but I hate the fact that we give that occupies spaces of symbology instead of individuality instead of community instead of persons who are an anecdote they become the entire they become the the entire uh data set and of nuance and I think that we have to address that that is not okay and and address that unfortunately people too stupid to realize that it's not going to going to that going to that point I think I think the extreme voices is what normally happens anyway so the terms that were used in this the the terms that were used in this interview anyway were high value men right so I would say that term was like popularized during the Kevin Samuels wave one thing that one one thing that Kevin Samuels would always say is that rappers entertainers and athletes don't don't um embody this high value thing because they've gotten to that status in a different way compared to somebody who put in 30 40 years built a business from the ground up right so already just off of that looking at Cam Newton as the voice as the spokesperson for how a relationship could be how a relationship could go and how he should how you should uh order your household is already kind of invalid he Hees to do it and he a big voice he's Cam Newton so a lot of us are going to tune in and we're going to watch it but we're always going to get those extremes in situations like that can we if wna if his focus is progyny and not in in fact fatherhood right his focus is leg he's doing what David Gein does with buildings he's just doing he's just building things right yeah go ahead and I feel like but I feel like I feel like right but like I feel like hear a message and as long as there's checkboxes and they fit majority of the checkboxes they'll embody that they'll embody that message and regurgitate it out like they are the example because I fit 75 to 80% of it right whether they're whether whether they're qualified for it or not and it's like it's it's it's nothing we can do about it you know it's just at the end of the day but I think another thing that should also be like focused in on is that I didn't watch this full interview of course we probably all saw the like the super viral moments where she was just like cooking this right at the very at the very beginning of that interview when it was all set like when they sat down she was saying that I'm here for a conversation and cam was like I'm here so I can win so he was already going into it he he was going into it with uh he's going into it with the I'm the representation of this type of man I'm here to win this debate on whatever you have to say so I know a lot of us didn't see the whole thing I saw the first 20 30 minutes and then outside of that all the hyper the all the hyped up Clips but that does need to be known is he was going in to win a debate not to actually display how he feels about relationships what he deems as healthy and what he deems the title of the videoed I had no idea or or or one of the videos is how are you a 41y old relation he getting cooked he once he didn't like that social Med started trying to do her away I will say I what I did think was interesting and I'm not going to comment much on it but I guess I kind of wanted to alert it to FD but I was noticing today cuz I was like okay let me watch this for real and I noticed she didn't say high value man she tweaked it the high functioning and low functioning concerns me because not for nothing I was like all right the same way we recognize the propaganda of it and it being wrong like you know what I mean these high value low value Framing and these like thought process boxes that we coming up for like men and women this is still bad like I'm noticing something I was like okay it's interesting how like things have to be perform like if you recognize the business or the role of the performance of what Kevin Samuels was doing you have to notice it here it's just interesting how differently it has to be performed because she's a woman right like when Kevin Samuels would get these viral moments and you first heard about high value it's because he would be like dumping on women and making these women feel real bad about themselves because that's what's necessary for his performance as a man but for her she does a lot of like coddling in it but it's the same Frameworks like you know she the Frameworks a little bit so I just wanted to alert that and two the question that I I think the reason why everybody feels like they need to debate it is because the I guess I think the the substance the essence of what C Newton was saying is what is a popular like it is more popular than any like eight kids and a lot of kids and yada Yad y but I do think we do see a lot of people a lot of men that and and women and a lot of people that are willing to have children like they will knowingly they willingly they voluntarily have no problem being like let's have a baby let's have a baby but let's not get M but they don't want to go get married they don't want to build the home they don't want to do the commitment and I think that that being a common thing that people feel like they're dealing with in dating and in and in the community right now is why people feel like they have to debate it so I just wanted to put that to the group and back out well I think that that actually says a lot as well because it's like one like when they were engaging in that conversation around like what value do you actually provide like be able to put on their legacy cuz I can at least say I rais this boy right and so like I think that is part of conversation that's kind of being had I think the second piece is also like as they were talking and I I watched too much of this interview I'm not going to hold I was real disappointed to myself I said I really sat through this um but I said no I'm losing it however in a lot of that conversation there were moments where she was Raising good points but I realized like he did not he did not possess a lot of self-reflection to like oh actually let me sit with this and let me actually identify the things that I actually value and so that's the thing that he was missing a lot of is like he was unable to answer why do you value having this many children and if your only idea is like at least I'm somewhat present in the home and I can provide for them because he was like all of my kids live with me that's a difference on like he's like at least I'm present so I feel like we're also up to like this pathologizing of black men's experiences and what are the unintended consequences of that so we have a lot of anxiety around that and it also showed up a mirror for a lot of people who are just like actually I am in a situation I don't know if I'm actually providing the way that I should because I with so this one idea of patriarchy and I'm actually not able to accomplish because now you want me to raise kids I actually don't have a commitment to my partners you have to on that one by the way way they dragging his current girlfriend I I refuse to allow any other man to get into that but if you could touched on that on our behalf no we not going to we we got well that's a that's a step I was also gonna say Maris say though to finish the finish the land of plane um but I see like a lot of it is us trying to really navigate one what does a man look like today because that idea is changing and I would say and we might get to this a little later but I was like also noticing like in this current political climate and social climate we kind of moving a little bit more to you know like the Tre wife is coming back everybody's just kind of like let me go back to D values because some people feeled of like I was I was promised the thing I was promised if I work hard enough if I show up if I raise these kids if I do this thing this is what I would be rewarded for as a man as a person but reality you're not getting those things especially us as black men we're like dog where's my stuff at like I should be getting some reward for at least I've made a child I helped make a child right like something but I think we are struggling with like what does this look like for us and defining it for ourselves and that's something I try to do exercise with my students is like what do you think you're how do you think you're supposed to show up and who are you versus who the world external forces that world tells you to be and us as black men always get to have that space and black boys don't get that space to be like well this is what I actually like and this is who I actually am and this what I value but we have to hit these goals that are put on from whoever that's VAR St these archetypes that have been left well not just put upon us but also interweaved into our social programming from day one right and and of course they are insurmountable odds because programming and marketing has gotten so brilliant that we're sitting here talking about something so stupid because the marketing has already happened we're already socialized to respond this is already thing makes too much money it makes too much money draws too much attention we're here discussing it and oh I do want to hear what you have to say about how they're doing your girlfriend or whoever is I don't know what that is but I I just wanted to add it's funny that when we watch these manosphere red pill [ __ ] interviews where they get these dumb women they're dumbb that doesn't mean they're bad people but dumb women it's just dumb it's not like I'm calling them a bad person intellectually they are stunted and they end up next to men who are slightly more intelligent in certain Arenas and probably not either because they're dumb too but slightly less dumb vers and practice in the actual activity I it's it's not that they're less dumb it's that they have the control over the it's their platform so what so what ends up happening to me is we watch these people get victimized bring up poor points things that should be nuanced things that mean more they could have a valid point but they don't know how to express themselves and quite frankly I I I I felt bad for the clips of what I watched of Cam Newton because I watched him drown a lot of the time and that doesn't mean that I think he's like this like and it wasn't because I I I'm not commenting I don't want to comment on him as an individual but I wanted to comment on how it made me feel like if you're a doctor and you're trying to help somebody and I don't blame her cuz don't bring me in there if you don't want to get beat up bro like don't don't invite me if you don't want to smoke so that's fair as well and he was looking at it competitively but I don't think that's what's healthy for what Maris said which is us trying to present alternatives to archetypes like big body forign said about different um communal structures different ways about going about what we want to accomplish in rearing children it seemed like it was just what what FD said a gender War um prop piece and and this man was clearly ill equipped she realized somewhere through that he was IL equipped but then because he was being so it like because he was so boisterous about it I guess she felt like well now I got to lay it on you and then we just watch somebody get bullied and then I was just kind of like this is stupid but you know there's this thing and I feel this way as a woman I feel I have to say this cuz I feel this way whenever get washed whenever men get washed in in in in settings and dynamics that they walked into that is the playing field that is the even when it's their platform they set up the conditions they get washed and suddenly become you know what I mean like d David and the woman go Guy this is his platform he brought her there specifically with the knowledge of what her interview was with Nick Cannon like he went but if I said that about the young ladies if I said that about the young ladies that joint fresh and fit you guys would hang me so let's just I'm just trying to be even here I feel bad for the young ladies and I feel bad for Cam Newton I don't give what I'm saying you feel bad for him I don't think there's anything wrong with him I don't think there's anything wrong with feeling bad for him the part that that I'm making sure I feel like is important to distinguish right it's like when you when when you when you say all right when are you looking at this and basically it's like you know he's drowning we bully him this isn't a conducive way for him to be able to like reflect like no I actually think she went out of her way to actually cuddle him try to offer him a lot of Grace that he didn't deserve he was actually incredibly like disrespectful to her like underhanded to her in a lot of different ways throughout the interview and he intentionally set it up to be that way it just didn't go his way and I think like and if you look at and know this to be true because I'm saying if you look at it if you zoom out what she's doing in the role she is serving she is creating what is the the woman performance the woman equivalent of what we see in the C Kevin Samuel's World it just looks different because she's a woman and it has to look different so what I'm saying is by being a woman she already had to perform it where I can make myself yeah I'm sure you're really incredible I'm sure you're a great father I'm sure just based on what I've seen thus far she had to do all at all all of that there's a bunch of soft pedaling things so I don't think it it's I I think we shouldn't look at it as as oh she didn't do what was necessary or like that's not the way you see a man drowning or or yeah like he's drowning but he he drowned but he jumped in he took off his vest he took it off took off his floaties and jumped in and tried to bring with him the Arizona University of psychology she did not do her job as a medical professional she should have known the hypocrite wait wait I will I I will agree that just in terms of like therapy like if we if we're promoting like this this going to therapy back like 35 years like damn am i g get go to therapy and get ate up by a bad [ __ ] is that what therapy is yes yes it is my friend yes it is but I want I wanted to um engage with why cam got so small in front of us in the moment cuz I think that's a little bit more interesting um like long he more previous according to his own um his own advant he's preach he's a because he's a preacher son no he said he was small he he he likes to Pro propagate that he is in fact small please I'm in Atlanta I ain't talking like this cuz Cam's still around I got no enemies here in the city I ain't adding cam to the to the the equation no no so why did so there's there I thought that was something profound to Cam's sudden drowning in this how he suddenly seemed so small in moments that he put out like I which I if I if I'm going give him one piece of props it was that he put out the parts that would be the most watched where he look the worse and the worse it unfortunately didn't probably have the effect that you would want it to have which is kind of self-reflecting that relate to a cam and saying oh is that how I look and sound but either way Cam's manhood got checked in a way that he's probably not experienced ever maybe like like ever like cuz cuz cuz here's the thing and this is this is my projection and and my personal perception of the situation we're talking about performing manhood and masculinity is is what what a lot of this comes down to so we already gave cam all the accolades right but we know fatherhood traditionally for a multitude of reasons that have nothing to do with an intrinsic Brokenness of black men fatherhood has been one of the most perilous and difficult Frameworks of masculinity for black men to master and achieve in for all those reasons we already know and to be blunt a shortcut certain black men who have means which we're not talking about a ton of black men but certain black men who have means who have access who have accolades who have resources have said I'm going just take the shortcut the [ __ ] say on the paper provide I'm providing shut the [ __ ] up every all these kids fed all the moms are house all the clothes are bought all the schools are paid for you can't say [ __ ] to me and on paper like in on a from a from a a thousand foot view they're completely correct but most of us know and this is historical that's a a lot of us grandparents or if you're unlucky the the the the side grandparent right or your mama was the side grandparent you know what I'm saying how many of us went to Grandpa's funeral and met two other families you didn't know about that you couldn't say you couldn't say [ __ ] to Grandpa about because he paid those bills and those kids are taken care of and those in those hous were were paid for right he also he also didn't have a podcast well that's that and that's where we get to the the thing right so he knew enough well he wouldn't have talked on it either he also wouldn't said [ __ ] our grandpar our grandparents didn't say [ __ ] we had to find out because he had because he had one thing because he had one thing it's called Shame he had shame even if he had the kids on the other side he knew better he's like you know what I ain't going to embarrass mama with it I know let me just let me just all of a sudden so that like I personally that's never made no sense to me provision without like emotional backing with fatherhood like that first off I'm just saying it never made no sense to me but for other dudes especially dudes that had that growing up that saw that Grandpa or that Dad or and that have that money and access it's like yeah that make perfect sense I can get out of this [ __ ] real quick get back to what I want want to do so yeah I'm a good dad and she said you're not a good dad here's all the reasons why here's all the data here's here's the reputation of your argument how does it make you feel and Cam went to from 65 to 5'6 real quick cuz he felt shame for the first time ever and I think that's what's resonating with a lot of men in and outside of that experience because [ __ ] didn't feel good the [ __ ] didn't feel good Shan don't nobody like to feel Shan he he could have felt a little more shame said could done a little more he got his lick back he could he could he he didn't have no shame when he put them lawn Johns on in that in that hat so you know it wasn't it was it was the shame was you gotta see him too bro you gota see him too bro it is what it is but real life I do believe that bro could have have sat in that shame a little bit more for educational purposes because it did feel like the changing of name of the video and all that stuff felt a little defensive and deflective and and I don't want to talk about him as an individual I'm just saying the masculinity of Def when when men find themselves under the hot the hot Spotlight you know I would like to see us do better with with acknowledging the reflection I'm not saying he did or didn't don't got nothing to say about that man but I would like to see men when there is something presented that has some kind of marriage to be okay with being like well maybe I never looked at it like that you know these are the things that were taught to me and I'm doing the best job as a baseline male and maybe I need to reorganize or maybe I'm fine with what I'm doing I don't have to be your your set of what you believe a good father is he doesn't have to do anything none of us have to is that how the Nick can I think there's still like a baseline yeah the Nick can one would win similarly it was Nick one went that way to where it was like really bad Nick looking crazy yeah but it wasn't he didn't look as crazy as cam I don't think Nick was the type like Nick knows when he's like look through it too much Nick does he knows he's doing too much yeah yeah I think FD like to what FD was saying is like cam new seems like he's never experienced like be able to say that to maybe they want to I think he knows what the critiques are like like generally like certain questions he knows like what a general critique but I don't think he's ever had someone like deliver it to them and there's something to having it delivered to you in a way that doesn't give you a lot of room to lash out cuz normally I think how you might be he might have been delivered those kind of critiques would be done in a way in which he'd be able to be like you're being bit or you're being this like the lady just packaged it way too nicely for him versus Nick Cannon is the constant source of our attacks for having a million children and not being in the home so Nick Canon was ready Nick Canon his job is buffoonery his job is J his job is Jester he's already primed to receive ridicule he already knows because a part of his comedy a part of who he is is being able to accept every day yeah I'm acting a fool but this is what I'm choosing to do with with the other part that he who shall not be named on some Baltimore [ __ ] um I don't I think it's likey says the people who probably brought him that critique he either pays for or don't have enough status to talk to him or the things he doesn't value do not Merit their conversation and in this conversation there's a camera and somebody you requested to be here and she read you down my bro and guess what that's okay because there's certain critiques that she made bro I was like baby you got to look at yourself too like everybody got to look at themselves in this conversation because this doesn't feel pure it doesn't feel like it's meant to get get us anywhere it felt like a combatant it just felt like but I also don't want to change it into like a him versus her kind of situation right like I think what I want us to kind of stay in a little bit more of like how did this black man deal with public shame right if that's the space that we want to be in and he and he didn't deal with it that well he decided to lash out at the end of it and because now all of this thing that you're able to kind of cover up with your provider your masculinity your money and all that good that status that does not matter right now because people are seeing you as a human so I think the uncomfortability that I'm seeing at least from other black men that I'm witnessing react to it is like yeah he might feel it might like a victim because we also ourselves have not also been able to do that internal work so we're just like this feels familiar I don't know why but I'm having a reaction to it as a viewer right and so I that's one piece from a consumer standpoint and then because I'm not giving this man that that much grace like I'm really not to a certain extent um because I also look at at men who have the capacity to change as well and I kind of use my dad as the example I grew up without my father I met him at 24 and meeting him at 24 after he got out of prison he was like I have to learn life again I have no idea how life works but even seeing him in relationship now he's like son I can't provide the way I wanted to for you like I can't do the things that um men are supposed to do I didn't teach you how to tie tie I was able to teach you this X Y and Z I missed out on 24 years of your life but I see him in relationship in his current one and he can't get a job right now right like they're struggling he's struggling to figure out like can I get this job he has a mental mental health Disorder so thinking around like all these sentatives of him being able to like function and attain masculinity in that way he then was like well I'm going to do something that may not feel the most masculine so the way he's able to support his partner is like hey I know you had a long day I understand you're bringing the money in this way but at least I clean the house I made sure to get the um your kid to school on time I'm able to support you in different ways so his idea of providing was forced to change fundamentally because of the lack of access that men should be able to get into right and so I think what I would have loved for us to kind of see a little bit more is like this recognition of like damn maybe I don't need to Aspire to this one way of what masculinity should look like but do I have the humility enough to change fundamentally on how I show up as a man and so like I look at somebody like my dad who has that kind of capacity to change and reorient his brain forced to a little bit but then also kind of thinking around like in his C for Cam Newton and his conversation and his uncomfortability I'm like nah [ __ ] like you actually have the means to actually find the tools a little bit more but it's a conversation on like how much individual Choice do you want to put into this space are you do you need to be forced to sit down with this are you humble enough to sit there so I kind of looked at of just like nah [ __ ] there's capacity there you're kind of like pushing back now because now the world gets to see some of the some of the that you fall short of I'll let you go after it I think the one thing I was just going to say is I guess to offer some I mean maybe context or to be fair to shoot like men but specifically black men some Bale is I think in general the family structures we've been taught we we we're we're taught we're taught are very binary right like it's the way that people would think of the mother is the pro like the mother is who does the emotional and the father goes out and does the financial and the this and the next thing and I think when you add on that to the fact that like black men are historically like set up to not even have access to a lot of these things not have these Avenues when they're able to overcome them especially and constantly being indicted for it too like constantly being indicted for not having the means or not being able to provide not being there I think there is an element of like and in so many of our other choices and and the way that we historically think about them and talk about them it always has felt binary like when make a choice like you choose to be a to be a career woman or to be a mother to be this or to be that so I think like I can see why men came to the conclusion that it is okay for me to be a provider because I I guess like I have um funny enough ha our like extraordinary circumstances and I'm like is that kind of like more similar to the way my life was raised because I'm my daddy's second family where you know my daddy has his first wife had his first wife and had his uh two daughters with his first wife and then he had my mommy and had us he nothing but daughters and I oh yeah my daddy like believe but six daughters he was for real yeah like and I can remember that like when I met my like when we found out about each other like my daddy came to pick me up or pick me and my little sister or F Me Up When We Were Young maybe like somewhere between four to seven and like picked us up we got in the car and he was just like these are your sisters like them and doing to each other and like didn't they say nothing I swear to God like whole whole catastrophe like you know um and my Daddy has always had an element like my daddy's always been someone that's like and I give a lot of credit for it for it like as an adult like I can give a lot of credit to like my daddy was a provider my daddy put all his his daughters through put us all all the children through school um and and he's always been somebody like I remember one time in like Primary School in grade six they made like a mistake and they thought I was one of the kids whose like School fee wasn't Bay and I called my daddy and my daddy was like L me don't you ever if somebody tell you your bill ain't paid your daddy ain't paid the bill they are lying don't you ever even question it you know what I mean don't you and that was like and my daddy always had that element of like I'm a provider I take care of y'all I put y'all in school that matters so I don't need to be emotionally present in any other way like you know what I mean like at at all like at all so and that is that has that has like I can't say that's not you're not graded for that on the rubric of parenting you know what I mean if father that I understand how it comes to be I got ideas from something y'all just said which is can we talk about white patriarchy for a second cuz that's kind of what's going on yes we have to because lowkey because lowkey lowkey so here's what's going on though Real Talk Maris said yo he talked about his father and how his father contributes to the household in a not a traditionally non-masculine way and to to to add to that the reality is black man been doing that forever forever because 78% of us are not just new feminist with L locks and [ __ ] it's it's your uncles that had kids with your auntie your uncle watched them kids your uncle changed diapers your uncle did all that [ __ ] your granddaddy depending on what type of family you had maybe didn't but his his cousin did you know what I'm saying and that's because of this the nature of the economics of the black home didn't allow for black men to embody that traditional white patriarchal um uh framework no we didn't get to allart who does the jobs neither did Black black women we weren't afforded that we were not subscribers so here's the thing though so that's why in the chat about the nuclear family was a mistake like that was actually a really fascinating article to read cuz I'm like oh this broke down to economics of like why we should attain or look to seek to attain this kind of stat the nuclear family nuclear family I probably say that wrong twice in a row and I don't give a [ __ ] that family framework only exists for the sake of capitalism for the sake of white patriarchy because a handful of white landowning rich man say you know what I got enough money all this [ __ ] y'all do that I got the money what you going to tell me you can't tell me [ __ ] I I got a second family and you gonna feed him bet you bet you not and so the one thing I fight with you know certain types of I I respect them overall more than Manus types but they they tend to underplay the desire that black men have to perform this specific type of patriarchy because black men Fair unfairly we tend to be the image of all things bad about patriarchy while also being the people less with the least amount of actual active patriarchal power within American society like we just don't have that [ __ ] because in order to Institute an actual Archy you would need coercion of some form whether that's institutional money whether that's physical Force whether that's a group and we don't have it now we might emulate it we may reflect it which oh I already know we know we reflect the things we see I get it but but if we're attacking sources right power sources right I personally don't believe in no isms I don't believe in no capitalisms I don't believe in no patriarch ISM hierarchy look my because at the end of the day bro individuals have came up with different forms of ways and theologies and ideologies in which to perform how we believe this life is going to go and how we're going to operate in it you can CH all of it can be fck up and all of it could not work and all of it could work some of it benefits some of it doesn't we have to choose if something's going to work properly there are instances where the nuclear family works there are instances where a community Works where a more traditional or non-traditional section works it depends on who's involved but one thing I know none of them shits gonna work if everybody is operating from ego none of them shits is gonna work if we don't look for our neighbor if we're not looking out for the feminine for the M for both if we're not looking out for what the male identity is supposed to look like is just hey look bro at the end of the day you know what we call a real and a real [ __ ] someone who stand on business period whatever the business may be I don't give a [ __ ] if it's taking out the trash rearing the child being there emotionally providing financially we'd love to be able to be great at all of it but some of us lack and that's why you get a partner and a companion that's why you learn that's why you have these conversations with Dr Bryant and whoever the else so you can figure out where you're lacking so you can be better so you can service the population the household on a micro and macro level we all ain't going to be Superman you might be better at cooking you might be better at changing diapers so let's come up with the with okay well I'm not going to have you changing diapers and cooking and cleaning maybe I need to switch out it's simple I don't know why we and I don't know if we keep identifying and placing our issues with institutions or institutionalized thinking if we're going to get anywhere because that's a ghost these individuals perpetuate these these these ideologies so let's start looking at the individuals in my personal opinion I hate the way the cam operated in that video I hate the way the Dr Bryant formed it is functioning because there are high functional crack addicts I know white boys that come to jail doing Co they go to jail for doing Co and the white boys that are running all of our running some of our most uh our prestigious organizations functioning very well off heroin so in the at the end of the day that's not functioning is not the issue I don't give a [ __ ] about functional nonfunctional the question is are the kids okay the question is are the kids fully formed is everybody doing their best that's what I want to talk about are we doing our best I want I want to disagree with you about individual versus systemic and this is because people would this like what cam is doing is very indivi like the fact that he's able to do what he's doing is because an individual level you can't tell him [ __ ] because he has all the resources all the power and all the status to say what you going to tell me and and since I'm 6 fo five and and not on crutches right now but you gonna tell me to my face Mal you better have that gun ready you know what I'm saying well they all told him we all have told right back right but but I want to say the last thing cam represents a framework through which some black men who again aspire to that image of white patriarchy can access it because they have the power and the money and the resources and and like historically again coming back to a handful of our grandparents you can't tell them [ __ ] just like you're telling me right now you can't tell them [ __ ] in real life and so like the reason no I never said you couldn't I just said it would be smart but also let's let's also not make white this has been tribal even the do the there white there's a reason for it's white because it's white here like you can't like what what was happening in in in Africa in a variety of different situations is a little different and there was a multitude of things happening here it's just the image that they provided for us they said this what this what we do here but by the way y'all can't do this [ __ ] and a couple stood up and said hey I can and they're doing it exactly like these white men have always done it but have never gotten punished for so it's like it's so much happening here because part of me wants to continue to drag cam but part of me is also like cam is such an emblematic is so emblematic of the problem of dragon Camp if that makes sense well we gota I mean that that's true but I will look we'll take this debate to another day you and I gotta have this de also this C bro like that what we got yeah was fire it's fire you know what it is know it's vintage you know you know here Qui let me Flex on all these [ __ ] real quick I arguing with you with you with you with you I'm just kid no listen listen listen check but look the doomi tribe was a real tribe right like like and if we go back to the Zulu tribes we can do this all day where the marketing is the same the marketing was different but whoever had the biggest bag whoever had the most goats whoever had the most goats and the most land had the most [ __ ] stop it stop it stop it [ __ ] everywhere and everywhere and [ __ ] ass everywhere who have Acquired and sequestered and Annex resource have access to do what the they want to do that ain't white that's human it's just that the white people are the Apple iPhone of doing it they just did they postc colonialism is just the iPhone of [ __ ] that humans be doing they did it at the grandest most egregious level them so individually so let me land a plane individually we can sit here and say oh it's white F we in whel land they just doing the [ __ ] that have done everywhere all the time and they did it bigger and better they're the Michael Jordan of up [ __ ] okay that's what it is and the only way to beat Michael Jordan the only way to beat Michael Jordan right is you gotta have somebody who's more of a symbol who's bigger who's more popular who's attained all the things that we think we want but is a better human and and highlights those better Humanity parts we need better marketing for the better parts of humanity for the better parts of man for the better of woman LeBron [ __ ] too let me get out Mar go ahead don't do that standing on business stand on business what you talking about right I like it did you transform into Uncle Lulu right right before our eyes look at the drip they got lul goodness let me see let me see Lulu drip no these are these are all the ornaments of patriarchy I was say okay I was thinking about like while you were talking I was like I was like I was like I don't really agree with you on that like the individualist term is cuz like if we absolutely are looking for like black men to really start marketing this better right we have to go away from that individualism we have go away from this idea of like I need to get mine and only take care of mine because in reality I'm like all we're doing is just like you know if us black people we drive the culture we're driving the conversation we're face of so many of these things we need to actually start Reinventing and reframing exactly how we show up in fathership how we show up in community how we show I never said I just think from people how people can receive it right um and that's why I wanted to okay got you got you got so really just kind of tracking like one we actually do need to address the root of the problem is that we've been falling into like this patriarchal kind of system and I'm I say white patriarchal system and so because of that we're still trying to build out this thing but the only way they really um Whatchamacallit deconstruct this entire system is honestly for us to say like well are you actually in community with each other do we actually know how to take care of each other like I know I can go down my block and I can go see I helped his kid get into school and help him out with his homework I can go down to look at Mr Jim and Miss who are the elders on our community but when pH was having a heatwave and we didn't have quality drinking we I went down and which just like yo do y'all need this right that's like we have to show those examples of like here's what community actually looks like but often times even as me as a teacher that defaults me to having to be nurturing as black men which we don't get to experience so my kids have a conundrum every single time and they're just like wait so you care about what I feel like oh I have to actually wck with this thing and so like well Maris I wish well Maris I wish that we had you I wish that we had a podcast with you arguing with doct because you are a symbol don't engagement it's not the individuality and so I that's the what we should but struggle with right like even like so so I want I want I want to touch you I never said an individual capitalist ideology of me getting mine and getting say everybody I said individual I meant we need these individuals who are key PowerPoint marketing marketing marketing symbols right these people who we follow behind right I wish that they were of better quality as as FD was saying because if they were Mars this conversation would be different and I think that we have to be okay with the fact that look this is a reflection of who we are and where we are as a community the reality is Cam ain't doing nothing different than than already done like he's doing what I got I gotta respond to that though because the thing that the thing that maris's testimony that you alluded to and I I think alluded to incorrectly is that this is not and you start you started with this Malcolm this is not an actual reflection of us and we don't control these it's not even accurate it's not even a it's it's not even an accurate reflect reflection of our interests and values it's a reflection of Market forces and we cannot control and dictate those markets we don't we don't we cannot control that no we cannot and I know algorithm suppresses me every time yes I I I know this I know this after having I got 800,000 plus subscribers right now I fought for every single last one of them mother and a good and now that I've gotten as big as I am a good 50% of them are white now and I I used to didn't have them problems and that's because he no it it's a good problem right it's a good problem but like I and it's it's because the algor like let me tell you you how I started out though my first video to get more than a handful of a handful of views was on Buck breaking that weird ass documentary that TQ Nasheed did and I was the only in the world that was like yo this is weird y'all see this weird [ __ ] and the YouTube algorithm was like n you like that [ __ ] show this to all Tariq Nasheed boys this another one of them and like like and I talked to that YouTube about that sh I was like yo why the did y'all show why did y'all feed my video to that like Tariq n my dislike bar was half that [ __ ] don't happen you what I'm saying but I only won by like by being very systemic about how I manage my page the connections I made and and getting cool with a handful of white folks with power you know what I'm saying and let me will tell you you won like 51 bro you're lying FD you won because you 50 cented all of the that des sented and hated you gave you a platform to be found by people that with you that's the whole point that's marketing but I doesn't provide that was your mix that's not how it happened that's not how that works I W because shout out I won because shout out to cadan Bo a non-binary black film was like cuz cuz black women on cuz cuz the way that the algorithm and this is like real talk the way that YouTube's algorithm views black women oriented content is fundamentally different than the way it views black men's um black man oriented content and they just did not believe that there was a place for a progressive black political conversation for black men until I lowkey built that [ __ ] from scratch and i' I have you can go to my page there's 500 different videos I've shared of mares Devon of foreign man foreign land and other mother that when I found him they had 5,000 people and they they getting ready to hit 100K and it's only because I know how this system works I've been able to manipulate it and I'm scared every day they gonna be like you see what this doing cut that [ __ ] off because because they because they don't want that because and and meanwhile Kevin Samuels while I was growing my channel went viral for disrespecting the black woman and had a million and a half subscribers before he died the the reality is it is very systemic individuals are important and especially on the left and amongst black people with Progressive ideologies we do have to come up with a more effective branding strategy than to just point out white supremacist capitalist patriarchy to that's like that sh don't make no sense to me how do I eat here and now I get you thereo I just but but it's still the truth though is what I'm saying it's still the truth we no for real for real like like the Casual [ __ ] like me I'm tapped in because I know Olay you know what I'm saying but as soon as I hear as soon as I hear patriarchy I'll be like all this like I just be what what you talking about right now just get to it bro because the reality is Bro Look and look this is I'm not saying that actually because I love my female audience I'm not gonna do that I I don't with Ary I don't with arches I don't [ __ ] with no kind of Ary any kind of hierarchy I don't with it I am not a power prone person but what I do with is is is actionable items and the reality is you know what a hit is you know when come out of nowhere not Tik Tok come out of nowhere but when there was who was out there pushing CDs in the streets and N just happen to with a song that they did and it propagated naturally and organically it does rarely happen in the algorithm because the algorithm is fighting you with 100,000 more [ __ ] that's being supported I I get that but every now and then every now and then something happens that they didn't calculate a Ola Ola yimy get breaks through an FD breaks through a Maris will eventually break break through but it's I want you know like I think this club you broke through broke through yes in my opinion I mean in my opinion a breakthrough is is Kevin samel that's a breakthrough proc no that's a that's a mega breakthrough I'm saying a don't demerit your work that's what saying you guys are doing the hard work I I know because I'm a subscriber right like you can't tell your fan who's seeing other fans who discuss you outside of knowing you when we congregate and go hey you know who really be popping that [ __ ] [ __ ] oh oh yeah on my page fact that's a whole you know what I'm saying you have done now now wish do I wish you were as big as Kevin Samuels or whoever the else yes that's my conversation that's what I'm trying to express by my not my individual idea on how we should procure resource and keep it for ourselves not for the community just to express thank you Maris for clarifying I'm talking about there are individuals who we can point to as symbols who are going to light the and guide the way to where we're going and that's the [ __ ] that needs this is why I impress upon marketing because if we just say well I can't beat the other people yes you can bro you figured it out marketing but but the thing is though like the algorithms all these different things are act like it's not a conspiracy right like they are act me what you're doing like not for nothing I have multiple channels multiple platforms like depending on what you know me from you know an entirely different right so I said is to say this is main Alina I have Alina pop Alina has almost 100,000 subscribers when I tell you aurina is new has I don't know 11 or something aurin pop gets pushed in the algorithm way more in my main Channel like I I almost never get people coming to me like oh I just found you like in the algorithm them off the off the blue everybody who watches my [ __ ] on aurin knows who I am watch me through another person's content like in this ecosphere we've created in cornbread too everybody on lurina pop is some new I don't know at all like you need to do well go ahead Maris a lot of that is like my issue a lot of the time is like there can't just be that thing my biggest video is like a Beyonce reaction video to like Cozy's performance right like it is crazy like that it did number yes they do but it's interesting yeah but but reality is so much of my content though I love to have like these genuine conversations I talk I interview two black men every week right like if we talk about real life [ __ ] but that's the reality that does not get pushed because that's an actual dialogue the reality is like the videos I know I'm going to eventually start creating again have to be like let's take this coach your lens let's then lay some political stuff underneath it so this way at least I'mma get you with the attention grabber boom let's actually weave some like learning opportunities in here and let me land the plane at the end of it so I literally have to make like a lesson plan that's accessible to everybody let me talk to y'all about these Aries real quick hey hey he go Derek Jackson though right Dereon that [ __ ] up but hey you know how gender a construct right hey hey [ __ ] we not doing this we're not doing this today FD don't do this you be that really is what you what you be having to do like it it it really feels like the worst of because the the the algorithm and all these stuff really fuels you to talk about people and not talk to them right like it doesn't Fu healthy discourse and I and I'll put it I'll put it to you right like I have like I have different series on my channel right like iconic talking to people talking to the that they like we'll talk about they what they don't give a iconic is by far the least successful thing I do right so like to put it to you this way I have an interview with Amanda seals on iconic that has 21,000 views right I have and I have an episode of oay and friends about Amanda seals that has like over 130,000 you see what I'm saying I have like an interview with Jamal Bowman that is up on iconic probably has barely over like 10,000 views all this time I put out an episode like a Members Only video that I imately put behind pay wall I had it out for a couple hours talking about Jamal Bowman's race that had ,000 views within a couple like like an hour you know what I'm saying so to bring It full circle this is why we got to talk about cam because because like cam provides me and other that Malcolm says we need to give a spotlight to give the microphone to is what I often say it gives me a time an opportunity to talk about patriarchy and gender and masculinity when I when I got [ __ ] when I was like when I like all right Newton Cam Newton y'all hey [Laughter] soton silly you know why he's silly cuz man he trying to perform white masculinity in the black man's body know how no matter how masculine that black man's body is he ain't never going to be successful that performing that black masculinity cuz he ain't Elon Musk cuz Elon Musk got 12 kids by 11 women and the children don't even like his ass they none of them live on him he the richest man in the world he's the he is the epicenter of dead beat daddy syndrome and we don't ever hear of that [ __ ] cuz that bought Twitter and said you can't talk no he also he also doesn't try to be a spokesperson for relationship that's true and which is why again we we bring it back to like we gotta talk what the [ __ ] just happened to Malcolm teleport I'm out here living this patriarchal life right now you feel me getting this money while you listen tell me anything you ain't got no chain okay I'm here up in the PO I'm wearing a old anime shirt to be fair I'm gonna FD we really should have a convers I wish I wish to have a conversation about you on another platform separately and I'm inviting Maris and oh because she gonna cook me about patriarchy because I do not believe it's colored I think that it's propagated by color I think that it just so happens that these white mother won they just won they're they're genius I don't think you can so here's here's the thing there's a merit to that analysis right yeah the the thing that I I'm stuck with is if we're really about fixing the problems for black folks then we really need to be about dismantling patriarch regardless of how it works who did it who got or whatever but I want to come back to and and this is the thing that I'm I'm struggling with um is why does it not matter that the people on top have a certain look gender standpoint politics like I'm I'm Miss I'm missing that I want to make sure if I'm going to argue against it that I understand what I'm what I'm saying you know what I'm saying like like and AJ feel free to jump in as well yeah I'm about say I think the reason that the color doesn't matter so much is because whoever's in that position would be moving off the same patriarchy pretty much much so if it wasn't white people if it was somebody else if it was a gay person it would just be gay people moving with patriarchy or whatever you know so that's why the color doesn't matter as much y'all I now listen I look what I prefer so so here's my thing so it's called patriarchy because it's you know paternal it's it's masculine eyes it's gendered for men and men get you know let me not let me not go into the scholarship [ __ ] my bad yeah there a whole another the long story short is it ends up looking like men in white men here's here's a here's a good way to describe you play video games at all AJ you ever play Skyrim you hate it okay cool why you didn't ask me I I have played RPGs before though I've been playing Skyrim since it first came out so you you going to catch this immediately what is the easiest race to win if you just if you rent it Skyrim from Blockbuster and said yo I need to beat this in a week who you going to play with probably elf probably elf right we already know who it is it's the it's it's the white race it's nor the regular white people this is the breakdown I'm trying to make the system of that game is designed so that if you want to beat the game with the least amount of trouble you play as this particular race the nors the nors are all white blond hair blue wide and they have ice resistance and ice magic and the game has mostly ice enemies if you play skym you know half the enemies throw ice ice Spears at you and if you have ice resistance that means you take less damage um and so if it's pretty much like it's pretty much like Lord of the Rings if you're an elf you're the period yeah I I'm so if we don't so like imagine being in the same game the kajit and being like yo I can beat the game I got to do way more [ __ ] than you do but I can beat the game but let me but how about we redesigned this mother so that I can go into Villages and buy Goods like the dos and the and the the Dark Elves and the light elves can I have to steal not because I'm a bad person because the kajit and Skyrim are literally they are victims of racism and they don't let them mother in villages to just buy Goods to complete their damn Mission and they're the Devin if you're playing Skyrim the Nerds here the Nur know I'm cooking the Nerds know I'm cooking in the chat I think I I think what it is I think what it is at least I can speak for myself it's um having so much conversation on on that instead of building what we have to be equal that I'd rather be building with action with actionable things and having conversations about actionable things that build us up or at least make it a competitor of of what that is before having 40 conversations about destroying a system that's not that's not going to be destroyed it's like we might as well build something that can compete with the system instead of talking about how Val I'm shut up cuz I know I've been dominant I just I got to say this you're good no you're good that's completely valid and in spirit I agree in practicality that is completely impossible we like like and I know I know [ __ ] have done the math on this we cannot we cannot build [ __ ] equal to compete with them everything we got is a is a handout from their system and and and and and the reason why it's it's that that that perspective is um desirable and like compelling to certain including me at one point in time is because I got access to a little bit of that [ __ ] so to me it sounds good yeah let's build let's let's do Greenwood bank which is really owned by a white Bank you know what I'm saying cuz now we can get all the invest in our [ __ ] we get to manage this [ __ ] we get a little richer and we get to say we doing the thing but you look at the by line at the bottom of Greenwood bank's um uh website it says this is not a real Bank this is fintech and so like then we I guess we have to have a conversation why are these selling out there right guess what the answer is it ends with an Ary and the is Ary that's what we're talking about so we need to get so we need to get rid of these well no you got to selling out because of the system what we we really what we really need to do is we so and and all of this yelling you're not wrong in that and we had a whole there's a whole pull it up here on the screen that o did with me and for and a couple other about how we're failing to provide more compelling messaging about this [ __ ] that's real [ __ ] you know what saying shout out to my boy John Lewis who's like to me one of the best normal talking that [ __ ] that's not that's still making good videos but that's not filling it with a bunch of isms and Aries all the damn time so there's a there's a there there but it doesn't make the reality and the solutions any less what they actually are and we have to we can't walk away from the reality of the solutions because they're not compelling we can't completely walk away from them because they're not compelling because we'll end up like there's a history of this particular debate we're having has happened at every juncture of black struggle in this country and in every juncture we choose do what you're saying instead of what I'm saying which is why we still which is why a handful more will get in but it's still you know 80% 70% at most that's out you know what I mean we're still pursuing the potential reward of patriarchy so like as we were talking a lot of this time it was just like let's not care about the system because there's still a potential that I can still benefit and get to that top position and that's what a lot of people are like looking after they're looking for the hope of benefiting from patriarchy and so the reality I also agree with like we also need to just be talking around like what does it what feels tangible of dismantling patriarchy right and so does this look like everybody has access Tangles what are the tangibles and I think that's the question that a lot of the keep asking but the reality is you're asking this question but we don't have the basic understanding of how this initial system works so if you don't understand how a process works you don't know how to actually dismantle it we might just end up replicating the same [ __ ] over again and so there's an education component and then there's a practice component of it as well and so when you are asking around like how do I actually um feel like patriarchy no longer winning or I'm not a victim of this circumstance or this thing is not overpowering me I think a lot of times we talk about patriarchy a lot of respond because they're just like well it's a system that is there we can't do anything about it and so now I'm feeling way about it versus saying like actually let's break this system down and then what are the steps to rebuilding the steps to rebuilding is actually engaging Community the steps to rebuilding is actually having to do some more of the communal work the self internal work but how do we extend that out how many people do you like I mentee five different boys Mentor five different boys and so hopefully like Each one teach one expands out out and out and out because my friends will go up to me and they'll be like oh you learned from Mr Richards yeah they learn from Mr Richard they can tell like there's a tangible thing right and so like that's what I I worry and I have that access point because I work in education I work in college access but that is the space where we're missing out is like our reward for dism patriarchy won't be seen probably In Our Lifetime or it may only be felt in small pockets of community until there's a critical mass of people who are just like oh this ain't actually working for us anymore instead of trying to chase this aspiration that patriarchy to us and to give some I say all that but I got to dip I got to train my staff peace I want to give a little I want to give uh some love to Malcolm since he's back when when I hear Malcolm and y'all talk about the fact that y'all are in community with some of these that's maybe with with men in question specifically and are trying to course correct a little bit that's an example of something that we're talking about that's community building and if you can't get him to act right you can at least maybe you can be the Unk that provides the emotional support for those babies that aren't getting get from dad because Dad got to be over here with family number two instead of family number one and number three on a regular basis you know what I'm saying there's there's a lot of ways I think one of the challenges is we can talk a good game and anding myself getting their feelings about when that game don't apply when that game gets lost and it it comes off preachy and and then start using the the the $50 million words and the in the critical theory bars and [ __ ] that are really that really doe with my white audience that I've built over the last couple of years but a chunk of my black audience half my black audience know what the [ __ ] I'm talking about but a CH my back audience will constantly say why you using all them big words and at first I get mad but then I be like let me let me get out my ego let me get out my ego and and and and like if my real goal is is accomplishing this [ __ ] and not just hearing myself talk and making the number go up I do have to do that work and that work looks a lot of ways but it's rooted in dismantling of the isms and the ARs if we talking about black people winning we talking about black people all of us winning is rooted in dismantling that is as an Archies now we can talk around that rename that [ __ ] we can come up with some hashtags but and when hashtags get co-opted though I do I do have one I do have one question the building the community part you said is essentially impossible because we've been given everything so the dismantling you see as more of a possibility than the than the than the actable items building a com a competitive Community right building building a competitive uh a competitor to to White patriarchy white capitalism and all that that is impossible building a resilient Community for the purpose of resisting those things is very possible there's plenty of examples of it throughout history and if you look through that history the the the reason why those particular um things are often killed it's either it's either ni it's it's first it's usually white folks that that throw a bomb light a town on fire you know what I'm saying that's the first or or they or or they get to infiltrate the M exactly and and they usually infiltrate on some you know we get hatest too we don't got to be like this and that's kind of the thing that's the thing that we got to resist and that [ __ ] ain't easy I that's one that's one reason why I'm like look I'mma shoot these videos and throw some money but I ain't trying to be in the middle of nothing because I don't know which one of the is going to do it I don't know if it's gonna be me you know what I'm saying CZ CZ don't nobody think like none of these if you go back and you look at uh what was the dude that K that got Fred Hampton killed uh I can't I know you're talking about name is though yeah he a think he did nothing wrong you talk to any of these dudes that you know I've low-key name dropped some of them talk a good game they don't think they doing nothing wrong they just see the situation differently partially because they ain't educated the way I I think they should be and and that's why it gets complicated and so we do got to start from like not even square one like square4 it's hard work it's hard work the [ __ ] we need to reach don't don't like how we talk I actually was just on AJ show and I saw the first comment was like you know I kind of like I like o but I hate Olay in France yeah they like they were like uh they it said U I literally agree with almost everything Olay says but I hate how she says it I was like I I saw that let me tell you something normally I'm not going to hold you no no offense but normally I'd be like when people say [ __ ] to me in my com but when I started your comment section I was like oh I know why you don't like o friends I was like that's not for you baby boy your Cali I was like all we need that crosspin we I I'm I love my my community and and this [ __ ] I'm I'm on I'm on the and I need to be on of YouTube more cuz I love listen you don't I wish you would stop I actually wish you would stop talking to the [ __ ] D because you be talking to the worst and then they come around here treating all the women that you talk to like [ __ ] I'd be like yo it's crazy to me I be like it's it's it's and that's the tough thing it's like you dabbling you dabbling and you like yeah yeah we gonna work this out and like start to got some views though like and the thing is that don't there's none of that's true that's true every every insult whatever talking about me don't have they have they get views that i' I'd hurt myself over you know yeah that's that's a fact we are in a complicated conundrum of things but thank youall for my my all male episode [Music]
