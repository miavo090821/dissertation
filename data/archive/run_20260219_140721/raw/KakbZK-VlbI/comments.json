And as I expanded upon, no family system around the world raises their children alone. So being guilty or feeling shame over needing help is putting unattainable expectations on ourselves. So there is a need to deconstruct that narrative and alleviate people of that guilt. Tradwife influencers pretend for social media to be the ‘sole are taker for their children’ while they spend four hours making homemade cereal while being perfectly put together, they can do that because they have mad money and they're paying people to take care of all the tedious important stuff. A nuclear family is a facade of independence, the majority of these families live within 50 miles or approximately 1 hr from their parents or other extended family. Do you really think they aren't relying on aunties and grandparents for childcare?",

    "text": "Why do these men not see having children with multiple women as a long-term commitment? The answer is easy, because they aren’t in the home. They are not raising children. Men like Cam are weekend parents at most. He wouldn’t even want more kids if all 8 his kids lived with him and he was responsible for them 24/7. With that being said this is why these men don’t want to get married either.. why live in the home where I am responsible for a lifelong relationship and the daily emotional care of a woman and child when I can hit it when I want and see the child when it fits  into my schedule then I get to retreat and recharge at my own place where I more or less get to feel single. This is why it’s so easy for fathers with children to date over women with children because the men do not actually have their kids?!",

Across all cultures, women are the ones to birth the babies so naturally those numbers are going to be higher on the woman vs the men because the men could literally have children they don’t claim as their own and the world will never know. This can impact the reports. Women unfortunately do not have the luxury to not claim their children. But those “data points” do not answer or justify that a large portion of black men who actually HAVE children, do NOT serve as providers for their offspring in comparison to black women, not by a long shot. And that reality is problematic and indicative of how many black boys and black girls that you and I know who grew up without a father and are currently growing up without one. I don’t care what the numbers show, basic science tells us that for every black woman to birth a child, it requires a man in every solitary case to fertilize that egg, so she’s not procreating in an incubator, here.

They are not the absent parent in this equation.\n\nIf your argument is that they should not have had the children in the first place, then you, sir, are advocating for widescale celibacy until marriage (which black men DON'T want & have NEVER supported) and/or widescale abortion (which is extremely dangerous for women).\n\nLet's not forget that most single black mothers did not intentionally set out to create broken homes. They had children by men with whom they were in a relationship and who they believed would be there for them and the children. An error on their part, yes, but in no way is it equivalent to the behaviour of black men like Cam. To imply that women who have been lied to, abandoned and who have stayed present in their children's lives are equally culpable for the creation of broken homes is ludicrous.",

There's no real intention of Newton building a \"home.\" As Dr. Bryant also emphasized, children from these situations may grow up with deficits due to an emotionally ineffective father. This is a powerful conversation you're all having about fatherhood and the different ways families can be built, but what's crucial to highlight here is that Cam Newton's actions reflect irresponsibility, even though he may believe he's \"taking his time.\" The consequences for the children involved are real and long-lasting.",

A lot of men fail to understand that, it's not an extension of your baby momma , just bc she carried the baby doesn't make it any less yours. And i know some slow people may see this a justification for men to have a say on abortion and everything surrounding that, but keep up its not that. Also i highly disagree with Malcolm bc it feeds so much into the \"high value men\" narrative. Kids should have parents who support them on all fronts regardless of gender and simply put if you see child rearing as an inherently feminine/woman thing that then leads you to be comfortable in having multiple children- without taking into consideration the needs of multiple children in multiple households and on a scientific level special needs that thos kid may need-  with multiple women.",

No they don’t. \n\nNothing in me wants to leave the house i have with my husband to move in with my aunt and help raise my little cousin 😂 i can babysit here and there but thats all. and id venture to say most financially stable people do not want to either\nNow this notion of communal living and helping to raise other peoples kids might work if the following conditions apply:\n1. You and your family live in poverty and staying together in one household would benefit them and you with stability because without the financial support of each other, it would be hard to make it\n2. You have a widowed or single parent or relative that is lonely anyway and wants to help with child rearing\n3. The people helping you raise your kids also have kids and you are helping to raise their kids as well\n\nBut outside of that, people who are not in those specific situations and were raised in US are not interested in selling their homes to live in a communal setting where they raise your kids with you.

That was so resonant, it felt like a revelation when put in those terms. That's why the solution of the slaves is to dismantle the institution of slavery, to break the chains, and 🔥 the plantations, not build an institution that can compete with slavery. Even that plan is rooted in the  capitalist premise of the supposed \"free market\" economy, and it gives us oppressed people a false sense of agency which is not afforded to us because of the oppression we face. Look at what happened to Black Wall Street. No, the only solution to oppression is to remove the weed at its root, that's what being radical means. Love Olay and Friends! 💜",

He was military so survivorship benefits were a mess to figure out. All the Black dudes in my family (barring the one who died early before kids in a freak accident) were loyal and present husbands and fathers. My grandpa was Chinese and also died very young and his best friend took over the family as a father figure after his passing, but he ran into some immigation woes so he was absent for a time before they managed a marriage to bring him back into the country… so my Asian step grandpa was the closest to an absentee father in my family for a hot minute. All this to say race likely has less of an impact on these things than the narratives would have you believe.",

    "text": "Last comment lol: \n\nI think an evergreen point that was hit somewhat directly and somewhat indirectly is the importance of being open to reimagining the ways we speak about these topics, but the importance in NOT compromising the truth.\n\nOften times they’re calls to rebrand a message to make it more palatable and effective, & that’s fine. And often can be necessary in situations. Rhetorical skill is an ever evolving journey. \n\nHowever, I think it’s often mixed with a call to change the message, which not only ends up losing the core that was built, but also moves away from the actual goal.\n\nIt reminds me of how pundits talk about political strategy. Sure, it’s important to try to make your policy and your message appealing to new/other people, in order to win a race and do the good you want. But if you’re changing the good message and changing the good policy as a whole, now you’re just winning to win. That’s when it becomes less about community and more about self. \n\nThe point of capitalism lol.",

No kingdom was built by one person, and no systemic structures was built by a sole individual.  And that's where the rest of his spiel goes wrong because it relies on hyper-individualism and exceptionalism as though society was built by individuals with no input from group dynamics other than addressing the individual at the head of the group.\n\nAnd then it just turns into \"who am I to judge.\"  And...if you have no judgement, then you have no opinion or ability to actually work within the group to figure out how live together as a functioning whole.\n\nIt's smart-dumb babble designed to disengage without being questioned on the \"why\" because the answer falls into hyper-individuality and \"who am I to judge.\"  Because it uses the \"exceptional\" to justify doing nothing.\n\nJust because one methhead can perform his task competently does not mean that you want 4 other methheads doing the same tasks or any tasks.  Because meth does not work like that for the group.  Just like just because the \"nuclear family\" worked for one family does not mean that 4 families weren't fucked up for it. Because the nuclear family was created as an excuse to buy products and services and outwardly look \"healthy\" to anyone outside of the herd rather than an idea that centers around fostering a functional, healthy family dynamic within the herd.\n\nThen again, Malcolm laid out who he was in the first moment he opened his mouth.  He has no real opinion, just information that keeps him safely unengaged.\n\n\nThe situations that Cam Newton and Nick Cannon are in is extraordinary.  Not because they have multiple kids out of wedlock, but because they are rich and successful Black men in an environment where \na) they are expected to perform in a certain, almost minstrel -ly way because they are Black men\nb) they are surrounded by \"enablers\" and \"predators\" because of their fame and wealth\nc) they cannot extract themselves from that situation without risking losing that fame and wealth to support themselves and their kids and/or baby mommas.\nd) they are aware of how fucked the situation is (on varying levels) but can't or won't do a thing about it because they risk losing the money and fame.\n\nI'm not saying that what they're doing is right, because it isn't and that kind of environment is going to have a negative impact on those kids. But I think that in their heads, they're making the best of a bad situation with the options they have that allows them to keep the money and fame.  Which is selfish and toxic.\n\nAnd people are talking about it because the minstrel show that Black people are forced to perform must always play out, no matter the economic circumstances.",

    "text": "“Oh this is an extraordinary situation that doesn’t need a bigger conversation about it” isn’t the right thing to say when ppl mention the inactivity of fathers in the black community. We ALL know men who do not take care of their children. We ALL do. This isn’t some shooting star situation. This is regular circumstance we all see and most experience everyday. It’s more extraordinary to see a father with 1 baby mother in one home with all his children. You’re not being as effective of a father as you can be if you do not live with your children.\n\nJust replace “father” with “mother”. Is a mother more effective when she lives with her children or when she doesn’t? Y’all understand it when it comes to a mother role but totally miss the point when it comes to the father role. And again, we have differing opinions on father roles. A lot of father role opinions are misconstrued.\n\nFather isn’t just “go to work, play with kids, pay bills, and go to sleep”. Father is leadership, counseling, mentoring, fixing, understanding, comforting, loving, cherishing, teaching, nurturing, healing, etc. it’s WAY more than ppl think because why? Ppl are so used to fathers not being in the home so literally JUST being in the home is seen as a big deal. \n\nLet’s raise the bar folks. And the first step in problem solving is acknowledging the problem. If we don’t acknowledge the problem, we can’t expect change.",

My step sisters and I both experienced this with our fathers and seeing them with new families or new children there’s a resentment that naturally occurs.
