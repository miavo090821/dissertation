She has never once thought of herself as a victim of anything, she just knew that she had to work hard if she wanted to live a nice life which she now does. I’m very thankful for how hard she worked to take care of me and my brother and to me it just sounds like you have a weak mentality if you blame all your hardships on others.",

The WOKE cult relies specifically on frustrating those who challenge their opinions, because they have learned that it is not necessary to make their case, only to circle around with incoherent random statements, as if when added all together, make their case. To the WOKE cult, it is not about winning the position with facts and reason, it is about leaving others with no way to make an argument against insane double standards and false logic.\n.\nIt takes a special kind of person to tolerate THAT kind of situation, stay on point and not get thrown completely off their game with emotional frustration. Were Vince or any others to walk away, due to the iNsAnE rhetoric being spewed, the WOKE cult will interpret that as a \"win\". In reality, they would have ALL lost, because when dialog ends, we are forced to address impasse in other ways. \n.\nThe cult is not concerned with bringing someone to their position, they are concerned with shutting down any other position.",

They literally only see and judge people by their skin color. As a white Jewish person myself it’s often funny when folks like this talk down to me cus I bring up the fact I’m Jewish and it’s like a circuit or fuse breaks they are unsure what to think since they don’t actually think for themselves they just regurgitate what other people they see online say. All these people look and think exactly the same thing it’s hilarious. For people who are desperately trying to be unique they are the least unique people out there.  And yeah white supremists don’t mind certain groups of people, like I said from the ones I’ve talked to they seemingly buy into the anti Zionist conspiracies and just don’t like living around black people cus they tend to ruin everywhere they go. Which to be fair to them even tho that’s a mass generalization of people, at least they are honest when confronted and as Daryl Davis has shown as long as you are cool and prove their misconceptions wrong they will accept you. These woke people will never accept anyone who is white no matter how nice they are they say it in their Bible “white people are racist and even if they are allies they are still inherently racist”.

All whites are evil. \n\nMy ELEMENTARY SCHOOL kid came home crying because the black kids openly said: \"all white people are idiots.\" All three of my kids had gone to this school. So we've been there for two decades. Never had an issue like this occur before. The teachers were upset, and crying about it as well. I know - my wife teaches at the school  and talked directly to them. But they said they didn't know what to do about it. Fine.\n\nI get that.\n\nBut if they races were reversed? I bet they'd have some ideas of what to do about it.\n\nWhites are marginalized. By \"allies\" and by minorities. When companies advocate elevating minority voices, they do that by excluding or diminishing ONE type of voice specifically - an on racial grounds.\nWhen black groups push for more blacks to be in leadership positions in companies - that often doesn't just lead to hiring more... but also to relieving present white employees.\n\nAnd the most important thing: White are right now only in the earliest stages of this marginalization. You don't tell a group of people \"only whites can be racist\" for any other reason than to EXCUSE the racism of anyone who is not white. And to excuse racism against whites as okay. And that allowable racist IS hate. And hate won't go away. Hate will manifest.\n\nA co-worker I know is a recent college graduate. And is black. And has PLENTY of stories to tell about the kids, and discord servers where minorities had no shame in the terrible things they would say about white people. Calling them pigs. Saying they hated them. All without ANY concern of the racism of it.\n\nMarginalization is the least of our concerns. If we don't move away from \"equity\" and back towards equality - the future won't be mere marginalization. And kicked knees will look like a walk in the park.",

It IS wrong to claim only one group can be racist and, as you said, it DOES create problems. A lot of this is masquerading as \"academic\" and factual when it is anything but. Political Science is what my degree is actually in. The CRT trash you see is just that: trash. Vast majority of this stuff that is pushing what you complained about in that comment is based on bull shit. What they tend to do a lot in the commie/progressive \"academic\" circles that push this is do a study (often fairly flawed), find 30 different potential reasons, and then settle on the one they want it to be with no further work. Its not just with the race part either that people will do that. I believe I am preaching to the choir with this one, but: the \"experts\" have led us astray.\n\nP.S.

When I got to college, my professor my junior year in civil engineering asked me to explain why we were so much better off with diversity. I couldn’t provide much of an answer and realized that that’s just what I was always told growing up.\nI don’t care if 100% of people admitted into med school are Asian if they’re the most deserving. I don’t care if a school is 100% one race if they have great education standards. I just don’t care one bit about ones race/background only if they were most deserving and earned it more than anyone else. If it leads to a diverse group, great. If it leads to only white males or only black women, great. I cannot for the life of me understand why diversity is shoved down our throats unless it’s for nefarious reasons or a way to take power over certain groups or people.\n\nPlaces like Japan that are 99% of people with Japanese origins have very low crime, murder, civil unrest, etc.. and they’re one of the least diverse nations in the world.\n\nIf diversity was so, so, so great, wouldn’t countries like Japan be a very undesirable and failure of a country in some kind of way? I can’t think of anything that they are in the bottom 50% of nations in. Maybe fruit prices. I know fruit can be quite expensive there as nearly all of it has to be imported from other nations. Alright, never mind, there you have it. Japan’s inability to grow and provide their own fruit will one day be the downfall of their country. That’s a bummer to hear.",

I have had friends from cultures in the Middle East to east Asia, and even Africa (my lovely friend Anna) and yet I’m told that I’m racist. My niece is half Indian, south East Indian, and my great grandmother was a Gypsy, who originated in India. I’m English, and the rot has set in there too. Everyone against each other. I have never met a white supremacist, and racism is quickly squashed, as many families in England have mixed families, or members, who they love, obviously. \nHuman beings are somewhat tribal. It used to be that if you went to the same school, or lived down the same street, you’d feel tribal with those friends and neighbours. Now….it’s ALL about what country you’re from or race you are.
