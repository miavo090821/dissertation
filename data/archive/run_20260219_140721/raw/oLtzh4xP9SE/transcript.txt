welcome welcome ladies and gentlemen boys and girls and children of all ages as long as you're over the age of 13 because YouTube requires me to not make content for those people in order to be compliant with the Copa guidelines today we are going to be talking about a vice panel now we've actually done this before we did the vice panel with Sydney Watson Pearl Davis and all of those babbling feminists and that was an absolute hit with all of you guys but many of you probably don't know that Vice is a copyright troll so they claim that video they still have yet to release it and I just want to point out that if they claim this just like that one I will fight that to the ends of the Earth Vice you are not entitled to steal my money but today's video is actually about Asians and we have talked a lot about Asians in this country and that is one of the reasons why this panel piqued my interest and of course the conservatives on this panel absolutely smoked and humiliated the left Wingers lead first and foremost who I'm told as a content creator haven't heard of him before look forward to seeing what he does in the future this man on the bottom right and this woman that's sitting behind him these people absolutely killed it and needless to say these two were the absolute worst this Indian guy who is not very straight in his mannerisms not saying anything just saying and of course the blue-haired woman but before we get into all this before I entertain you Razzle and Dazzle you this video is sponsored so let's Chuck it to the sponsor bring it back over here talk

of you guys think the term Asian American is useful that's one two three four five we've got a couple so the first thing that I want to point out because Vice opens with asking people about the term Asian Asian American Pacific Islander and all that about whether or not that is a useful term and I actually agree with the people on the panel who did not find this to be a useful term I can tell you from living in an Asian neighborhood East Asian neighborhood with some Filipinos and other types of Asians mixed in there that Indians and what people are called as South Asians are not in any way similar to East Asians in fact East Asians tend to be very distinct based on their nation state and don't like being aligned like let's say Koreans with Chinese or Koreans with Japanese or Japanese with Chinese etc etc so to be clear I do agree that it is kind of weird to include all these people under the same bundle but the thing is Asia is the largest in terms of population continent in the world so obviously you're gonna have a good mix of people so I can actually agree to a certain extent with the people who made that point in there because I've seen this in my own life and in America we don't typically think of Indians when we think of Asians in the UK Asian typically means South Asian but we think of East Asians as Asians over here and we think of Indians as Indians pakistanis as pakistanis etc etc or so on and so on you get the point I mean something what you point out is that we kind of all have a dual Consciousness or our dual citizens of this country in the world which say we go home we might have a different culture a different food a different language that we speak we go to school and we have friends who might not share or understand what that language culture is and we have a desire to both be true to the Heritage but then also be accepted successful and otherwise in the non-nation American world that we live in assimilation is it a good thing it's a bad thing is it a burden is it an opportunity so the vice host brings up the topic of assimilation and he talks about Asians as if they're in conflict with the force they have this dual identity Dark Side versus light side and honestly it's comical the way that he presents it but the answer that we get from Vince is so good that I just have to play the clip for you so you can understand why these left-wing progressives absolutely had no idea what was coming nor how to deal with it I think assimilation is not just a great thing it's a necessary thing no Society can hold together where people have nothing in common they don't speak the same language they don't practice the same things and you know you may look at something like just food habits or what you eat and think that's fairly frivolous but the truth of the matter is that on a broader level we're talking about more big picture things differences in race culture religion all these things people have fought Wars violent Wars killed each other over these things for thousands of years if America is to hold together assimilation not just good or bad necessary I don't think it's going to be possible for America to survive as a stable functioning Society if people don't to some degree say well here's what we're going to commonly agree upon everything Vince said right there is a hundred percent true we need something in common in order to function as a cohesive society and those Petty differences or things that people label Petty differences have led to multiple different Wars and multiple different issues now I tend to think one of the things that we can have in common as a people in America it's the easiest thing is a shared language the idea that everybody eventually learns English and even if your parents come here and they don't learn English the Next Generation learns the language and that's how they fit into the country it's a very basic thing it's really the one thing that we can have as Americans and of course people on the left wing are trying to run parallel other language curriculums all across the country to even take that thing away from us we definitely need this obviously we're not going to agree on religion 100 of us we're not gonna agree on racial or ethnography or whatever a hundred percent of us we're already a diversified country in those ways so English as a Common Language doesn't mean you can't have a second language or certain Traditions that are culturally distinct should be the thing that we align with this is what we expected of German immigrants way back when they're as white as can be this is what we can expect of non-white immigrants going forward who gets to choose it the majority culture I suppose and what's the majority culture people with power and who's people with power people with Power white people well I don't I don't know [Applause] I don't know if that's necessarily so true I mean so this woman is the most obnoxious person on the entire panel everything that she says is stupid and for some reason she's saying white people in a very stereotypical Asian way and I just want to point out that everything about her is offensive specifically to my eyes I know that people get mad at me when I talk about body language on this channel for some odd reason but everything about this woman's body language is disrespectful and childish throughout the course of the whole segment she's making stupid faces she's churning she's performing for the camera rather than having a conversation and it's really unfortunate because apparently this is the Korean representation on the panel now I know a bunch of Koreans I grew up around Koreans some of my closest friends that I consider as close as family are actually of Korean descent and legit of Korean descent Korean immigrants and all that and no they would not be happy with this woman's performance in any possible way it's pathetic it's humiliating she is shaming herself as we are watching this on the video and of course everything that comes out of her mouth is incredibly wrong and dumb yeah I don't think a particularly white quote-unquote interest controls things like in America culture do you believe white supremacy exists I think there are people who believe in it I think there's people who all believe that their race is superior so you don't believe in white supremacy do you believe America is a white supremacist State no not at all and not found no white supremacist state would even like allow us to be doing this like I don't understand so why supremacist this is KKK people walk it so right there I love the way that Vince shut down that stupid question immediately that he's like do you believe America's white supremacist State he's like no he's like if this was a white supremise to say we wouldn't be doing this Asian exclusive panel for vice right now actually I go around New York City I notice that like I guess Brooklyn a little bit different most of the people here are not white and they're doing their thing so I don't if white people completely ran everything why would they allow all of these minorities to complain and try to become grievance grifters race Hustlers based on their minority status obviously this is not the case what does doing their thing mean to you going to work are they making words are they making the same amount of money are they getting the same access to opportunity I think they're getting great access to opportunity please don't talk it are they equivalent are our communities and communities that are leading culture to your point because you point to popular culture or something where in your view white people don't have the power when the reality is it is the white Executives who are profiting off of exploiting predominantly black and brown bodies for their financial gain to them parade to us and tell us that we're thriving when the reality is it is women of color and it is black folks it is in America because it is Hispanic folks it is people from marginalized communities who are disproportionately being impacted by every adverse thing that Society is facing while the few at the top who don't represent our communities read our profiting there are massive disparities based on race based on class based on gender based on all of these things that shouldn't exist so this guy who's definitely the second most annoying person on this panel is supposed to be on a panel talking about Asian Americans now he let off by claiming that Asians make less money I'll let Vince redress that first and foremost because he will smash that then he started talking about Executives and all this stuff and then he started talking about the blacks and how you have to save black people and Hispanics as well even though we're talking about Asians on this panel and we don't need you to Virtue signal about those other ethnicities I'm Hispanic everybody knows it half Puerto Rican right here I do not need this Indian dude to try to save me no thank thank you it is radar profiting there are massive disparities based on race based on class based on gender based on all of these things that shouldn't exist well nobody denies that there's disparities what did I tell you about how obnoxious this girl is just everything about her is repugnant and disgusting what does doing their thing mean to you going to work are they making words are they making the same amount of money so yes it is 100 true that Asians make more money on average on top of that Asian women actually out earn white males in several sectors and I think overall at this point so it's just not true that the white male white supremacists whatever are creating negative disparities against Asians if white people were so good at white supremacy you would think white people on average would be able to out earn Asian people on top of that this guy is Indian in specific Indians are the highest income earning demographic in the United States in Canada and in the United Kingdom on top of that if you wanted to look because he talked about those CEOs those Executives that are disproportionate definitely white what you would actually find is they're not disproportionately white they're disproportionately Asian and specifically disproportionately Indian a bunch of places and you know them well have Indian CEOs the top executive at these firms are disproportionately Indian when the reality is that the white Executives who are profiting off of exploiting predominantly black and brown bodies for their financial gain to them parade to us and tell us that we're thriving so everything that this whiny brat said throughout the course of his takedown of Vince Dao was completely wrong and not supported by the facts and not supported by the evidence and eventually this leads into a conversation again about black lives matter and how we must pay homage to the black lives matter movement for some reason however when you talk about bending the knee yeah that is a wild way I think to look at Society finally trying in some ways to right the wrong that's so wild I mean even like you're supposedly white politicians you look at what they did in 2020 they quite literally bent their name Nancy Pelosi Chuck Schumer the entire Democrat basically caucus in Congress literally bent the knee to George Floyd into black lives back they quite literally did that and that was a bad thing I think it was a stupid thing I think it was it was just ridiculous pandering terrorism yeah black lives do not matter I do think that black lives matter I don't support the movement known as black lives matter you ever say all lives matter of course as a Christian Our Lives matter I love that Vince is saying no unabashedly he says all lives matter because he's a religious Christian and yes it was dumb to bend the knee quite literally to Black lives matter and all the major corporations do so as well then they get into the model minority and I'm just gonna let the first guy speak before I cut him off at the knees and tell you what was actually put forward you know after World War II they used us to separate other people of color they used our race to say that we were the best race that we were the model minority because we were the smartest we got the best jobs we did these things and we were able to assimilate to what their idea of what they wanted they wanted example to use of people of color that they could then use against all the other people of color and what they also did is they caused infighting between our communities so that we wouldn't look at the actual problem which was white supremacy so everything that this guy just said is completely stupid utterly buffoonish and you should not be surprised now I'm not sure because I don't remember because I wasn't paying attention if this person is specifically of Japanese Heritage I was born in Manila Philippines but it's really important that you understand that the model minority article was actually specifically about Japanese Americans it came out on January 1966 I would love for you guys to read it for yourselves so you could understand that these people are just wildly going off without reading the article obviously because the claims that they're making about this article which by the way was written by sociologist William Peterson are just not in it so when you go to this article what you actually find is that William Peterson is documenting and by the way pointing out glaringly that there is a lot of discrimination against Japanese Americans however the thing that he points out is that Japanese Americans for whatever reason tend to thrive in the United States of America despite the fact that there is a ton of anti-japanese racism and all types of discrimination that actually takes place before World War II and after World War II so he talked about how this is an after World War II thing the article was written after World War II but the sociological phenomenon that it observes actually takes place well before that and what William Peterson is actually documenting and by the way this is something that we've talked about on this channel multiple different times is that discrimination does not drive people into poverty discrimination does not necessarily make people worse off because discrimination is typically a response by a majority group against an already successful minority that they become resentful against another example highlighted by this article is Jewish people Jewish people are often discriminated against because because they're more successful than the majority population because Jewish people have a culture that promotes success their illiterate population more so than the surrounding populations that they typically are minority within the Armenians are actually the same way this is one of the reasons why the Armenian Genocide happened so what he's actually pointing out is that the myths that people believe about why certain groups are in poverty are actually not supported by the facts in reality discrimination typically comes after the success of the minority within the majority country this is what we see in Malaysia where they discriminate against Chinese people because they're successful in fact they actually have affirmative action in Malaysia for the majority population I will link a great article from Thomas Soul about middlemen minorities so that you could understand that it's actually atypical to discriminate against minorities that are unsuccessful because the largely discrimination is the result of that Minority being more successful than the majority so everything that's said about this article is just factually not true the idea that it applies to Asians overall not true the idea that this is something that is because we changed the immigration laws in the 60s to let in only well-educated Asians therefore it's a self-fulfilling prophecy is also not true this documents the phenomenon pre-1966 which is before those changes to the immigration law that people who try to deny that Asians tend to be more successful more hard-working have better families can't get around okay so statistically it is true that Asians right on average make more money like in terms of medium make more money better test scores get into better colleges all that stuff I think the question is why is that and I don't know if model minority whatever that label wants it's actually a myth because we cannot be um well no listen well let me finish my point so Vince Dow points out that Asians on average get more money and they do better on standardized tests Etc and this girl's like that's a myth because we cannot choose they can't all be lumped in together again this is such a stupid unbearable point because they were talking about earlier when they're describing disadvantages lumping people together this guy just lumped all Asians including Indians with an article specifically about the Japanese the specific discrimination that the Japanese face and how the Japanese were still prosperous but all of a sudden when you're talking about the on average statistic for Asian Americans you can't lump them together by the way if you broke down white people by Heritage in the United States of America you would also see the same variety and disparity in incomes and all those other things because white cultures are incredibly distinct unique and all of that we need to observe what makes people successful and unsuccessful and I think when you look at trends that are generally true in the Asian Community not of everyone but are generally true usually you have families that are sticking together you have um you know people are taught to work hard in school not get into trouble I think that translates place to lie Asians on Master are successful so right here as Vince Dao is laying out the facts undeniably so you have this guy and again I'm focusing on body language smiling like an idiot and nodding his head no despite the fact that not only is this true overall of Asians they have no refutation for it but Indians specifically it's more true of them than anyone else as they are the most successful ethnic group in the United States the UK and in Canada but he's like oh no that's ridiculous you can't lump us all in together except when I wanted to lump all the non-whites against the whites in together earlier then it's okay because then we're talking about woke nonsense and I don't think you have to be Asian or white for that matter to not have kids out of wedlock not you know commit crime not not cause trouble whatever it is it's just a matter of like well common sense that's what makes people successful and if that's so called assimilation having a nuclear family buying a house going to school whatever it is then yeah okay call me a pro simulation so they're getting all upset but he's just laying out the facts the things that will lead you to not be in permanent poverty in the United States of America according to the left-wing organization called The Brookings Institute is if you graduate high school you have a job and you have kids after you get married you do those three things 95 chance you will be out of poverty in the United States of America that is your pipeline to success that is not that difficult Asians do that more than white people they have better families not only do a lot of Asians have the parents in the household both of them for the kids but they actually have the grandparents in the household because they don't think it is appropriate or traditionally they don't rely on a system like Social Security so you have two generations of parents working to raise the kids and it's unsurprising that they're successful on top of that we will get into something else later on when they get a little worn down on standardized testing so I can prove this point that it is from within the culture that they succeed not due to all all these advantages or whatever I think there's a difference between assimilation and Erasure yes the way that you're kind of going about it seems like okay like you know of course like we want to be in community with people and I don't think there's a problem with being in community with people from different backgrounds that's not the issue it's also embracing the diversity that we inherently have and accepting that and being okay with that and celebrating that so this girl says diversity is our strength who cares you just added nothing to the conversation what Vince was saying is that you don't have to abandon your culture completely but yes you should assimilate and by the way you should do things that will lead you to be successful by the statistics and turns out when your group does that overall you're more successful by the statistics that's very idealistic I think but I think we should acknowledge the fact that diversity quote unquote is not a factor that is our strength it's not a factor that historically or even in the current strengthen societies people don't come together form societies form families form communities because they have nothing in common they come together and do those things because they have something in common right again Vince just crushing these people he got the diversity as our strength thing and he's like no no look you need something in common it's all fine to be from a different background to eat a little bit different food or whatever different hair color different eye color all that but you need some common ground to form a family and that Common Ground you also need it to form a society and it doesn't have to be everybody's the same ethnicity even though there are countries most of them in the world that are built on that it doesn't have to necessarily be the same religion even though again a lot of countries share the same religion but it has to be something that they have in common not just highlighting the differences we talk about race and such black and white terms the way you talk about it is it's either with America whatever your definition of America or or not you're talking in very black and white terms and that's actually the problem in discussing race because we're Asian Americans we're neither black we're neither white when you're having a race discussion you can't be talking about in such like lines this woman is so deficient in every point that she tries to make during this segment it actually might be quite problematic to use one of those Lefty words for me to address her arguments as if they are sane coherent arguments she just said you're talking about race as in if it's a black and white issue which would lead you to believe she's saying one way or the other but then she changes that to black and white even though this guy is not specifically talking about blacks or whites the people who keep obsessively bringing up black Americans throughout this conversation are the Wolves Golds like herself and it's just absurd everything is in the gray it'd be more in common that a society has with one another the more likely they are to work together and build things inside I hear not constantly be fighting each other and at odds with each other so he responds by resetting his position doesn't back down doesn't give up an inch to this woman who is just incoherently babbling and then she responds and maybe this is an edit by Vice but I don't think it actually is in the stupidest way humanly possible think to yourself what is the stupidest thing somebody could say response to what he just said and I guarantee you she's gonna top it unless you get it right did you think the Japanese internment was a good thing because that was a real assimilation situation you know what I mean no I don't I don't think the term assimilation has negative history she just said Japanese internment is an example of assimilation Japanese internment you utter insane buffoon is quite literally the separation of an ethnic group so it's an anti-assimilation policy and then interning them but even worse than her bringing up this idiotic Point did you think the Japanese internment was a good thing because that was a real assimilation situation the term assimilation has negative history even worse than her stating this as an adult human that has a body temperature somewhere in the range of 90 something degrees is the fact that after she says it multiple people within frame are nodding their head yes it's quite literally the stupidest point that is made throughout the course of of this whole Vice segment might be dumber than anything that was said in the other Vice segment that we covered and you have three people on camera nodding their head as if that was a coherent sensible point and facts associated with that word so we do have to be careful in how we choose because assimilation for people of color have not been good to us historically that's factual this is completely 100 unabashedly false assimilation actually is the best bet for minority group in a majority Society historically remaining a distinct minority separate from the majority often leads you to eventually become targeted become hated become exiled or even killed all from a country the justification for some of the most horrible acts in human history was all about how these people were distinct they lived in their own neighborhood so they were isolated they dominated specific Industries distinct from the majority population this was the basis of the Armenian Genocide the basis of the Holocaust the basis of all manner of Horrors that have been inflicted upon minority groups so no you're just wrong so let me discussing a model minority is a classic example of assimilating Asian Americans no it's not it's a classic example of internment I mean they in turn that to um why do they intern them so Vince says the most obvious Point ever which is this is not a classic example of assimilation what the hell are you talking about and then the Indian guy jumps in because he realizes that Vince is not somebody with an IQ around 55 and he's actually able to respond to the stupidest Point brought up throughout this whole panel so he's like why why why which is an annoying Lefty technique and again just shows how childish these people are in mannerisms and level of dialogue why do they have that to um why do they intern them because they saw them as others because they saw them as dangerous not really well yes they saw them as dangerous because and I don't agree with it but left-wing president FDR at the time saw it as a national so he points out that FDR did this and again they're arguing out of both sides of their mouth they just said that this was an example of assimilation aka the Japanese becoming Americans and the negative consequences of it but then he's saying oh it's because they saw him as others so these people can't even keep a coherent thought in their head and form it within a sentence without it contradicting itself now look I realize that this video is getting kind of long so what I'm gonna do is segment this off because this was the Vincent Dow domination portion of the vice panel were through the first 20 minutes they only really showed all these people going after him and him giving them the back of his hand metaphorically rhetorically one by one by one however these two other people on this side of the screen were actually studs in this panel as well they took it to these other people there's great Parts about Asian hate and violence and all that that we have to get into because we have crime denial we have people pretending that whites are doing the attacking and all that and these guys just shut it down not to mention this guy has some of the best lines about Kamala Harris so if you want to come back for that if you want to see that video like it I'm doing the engagement thing yes I'm doing it leave a comment telling me so and I will revisit the second half of this panel in a part two and let Vice claim three of my videos and I will fight back against all of them because Vice you're not gonna copyright troll me you're not gonna intimidate me but hey those are just my thoughts let me know your thoughts down in the comments below if you liked the video you show them by leaving like subscribe for more content follow me on my social medias support me via the support links in the description box of this video this has been me talking about Vince Dao destroying all these other people till next time
