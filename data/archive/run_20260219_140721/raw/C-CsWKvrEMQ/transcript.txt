I said she in the whole Olympics and she blocked me so certainly she's saying worse about this young man every day all day there was one part in the apology where he said it wasn't my intention to violate your boundaries but it was a poor started calling you a sex freak is insane people joke me joke like men will [ __ ] a hole in a tree that is not a lie accountability for me is maybe he actually looks at her and reads her as somebody who doesn't have boundaries [Music] thank you let's let's start with Mariah Wells then Marlon I guess so that's the latest news that she's threatening to release the sex tape yes yeah apparently she's listening yeah she's on her last resort as the resident abolitionist Mariah Mills need to be in jail and she needed to be in jail two weeks ago under the jail under the jail and Foxy should be stolen in the streets I I really need us to understand like I'm not joking it's harassment oh yeah it is actual harassment like it really imagine could you imagine like if a woman if a woman was messing with a man first of all in a transactional relation let's let's stop there this is a transactional relationship nothing she has shown indicates a romantic relationship of any kind that man is that man isn't in one video girl Snapchat video he had nothing other than Miss I'd like to pay you for your services I'd pay you handsomely at that right girl being on salary move to where I'm I'm playing did you even what's that movie where the guy thought he was talking to someone that everyone could see the whole time was it sixth sense like I feel like that's what's happening right now there's no proof that she actually knows this guy other than text messages not one picture not one picture I mean it makes sense because I was sitting there you know I watched the NBA a lot and this is what he clearly was busy doing I don't know like he has a long history of doing stuff like this and this is just kind of a par for the course I it's hilarious I don't understand why how she is able to still be talking because there's just I cannot understand how this is possible because first of all I this is my problem is not that we are an advanced level hold on that's not the issue it's these bad politics with the hoodom that's happening because the thing she say no hear me hear me and hear me good there is nothing I could say to [ __ ] shame that woman worse than she is slut-shamed the other [ __ ] and the man she is a sex worker calling him every kind of assistant a porn star calling you a sex freak is insane like that this is all he's just being 22 like he's a little boy and he has the opportunity to [ __ ] everybody with a lot of money around the town and he's doing it so what is it where where's she from where she kind of sort of like from do you all know is it Dallas is it Houston somewhere in Texas something like that no because I saw it um so there was there was a clip though there was a clip though of uh you know the Pelicans sitting there having a little interview and he was just like uh oh I love that place oh it makes me so happy I think it was Dallas or something like that yeah so I'm not sure if she is from Dallas she is the thing that made him happy maybe there's other people I'm not sure but it's clearly some women he's not even his favorite [ __ ] by her own admissions no hear me no my only problem with Zion is his choice in [ __ ] and the lack of ndas that are present because why I read I was reading the tweets I was reading the tweets I was reading I said girl if you can put up evidence I'm gonna go through it this is this more Discovery than I ever seen let's check it out ma'am first and foremost this woman says half the year she's out of commission body is in pain needed surgery struggling down bad so she not [ __ ] have to hear anyhow what kind of investment is this now you talking all this your big sacrifice and thing to your to his life and careers oh after everything I did for you you made me wear braids and wear black don't piss me off don't piss me off I was crying when I saw that one comment right there that one and the one and the one where she said she's sting me money you're my livelihood you pay for everything and you mean to tell me you cannot fend for yourself without this [ __ ] and you want this internet after you he's costing you money I have wanted hey son listen to me I have been swole with rage since her first week I mean but In fairness to her like porn stars are not able to get FMLA she told you she's down bad like her body is hurt she cannot work and she needs her source of income like another thing she's 32. she's 22. I told your jail how do you get jail wait wait wait how do you get surgery and look older yes ma'am that's crazy yeah it's giving Tim Burton's character yes it is and I didn't say it but some because I it's important not to it's important onto what it said her body looked like a deep breath [Laughter] can you so so you said she blocked you Yes actually I'm trying to figure that out how'd she block you like why did she know to block you she probably saw the video I heard she blocked a lot of people I didn't tag yes but the video did well people blocked her because I'm like what did you know to block you because when have you tagged her that's what I'm just so confused her under the video she probably searched herself I mean somebody like judging from her tweets she seemed like somebody that searched herself a lot um yeah because she's looking for every bit of attention from this now she's talking about dropping a rap verse earlier this week she was saying she's gonna drop a rappers so to really make it all she said I've been to eat their hair yesterday this is my thing right and because I don't want to make fun of it because I I think like it's on like I don't mind making fun of people I'm with it but she seemed like she actually like not well you know my thing to him because I'm looking at Zion like I would like one of my I got kids dying my age I'm saying I'm looking at Zion like like yo is it any dude in your life like telling you how to manage this [ __ ] like you 22 and you rich and famous all you gotta say is I want to have sex and I'm gonna give you some money and that's that but judging from the way he moving the world the way he talk even the way he dressed it's like he ain't got no he ain't got no game to him yeah oh geez none so what ends up happening is you when you're 22 like a lot of times like you don't just want to have sex like he wants in love [ __ ] right so he's gassing her in a way that he ain't got to so then what ends up happening is it like like Nobody ends up tweeting 75 000 times in two days if you being honest with them about what's going on I mean every once in a while you get a stalker whatever but 99 of that [ __ ] is him doing too much when he ain't got to I'm not saying anybody should do it but if you got non-figures and you famous and and like he could just be like this is what it is this is what it isn't and let them make let her make her choice about whether she with it or not and she probably would be with a judging from what she's been saying but as a 32 year old woman I feel like she has to have some perspective like this is a 22 year old kid whatever he's saying to her like why are you letting him sell you a dream but he wasn't going crazy on the internet well I'll tell you evidence if he worked if he worked at KFC she wouldn't have bought that dream she has no friends but like it's easy to buy a dream if somebody said if the person's selling it to you I mean like the upside is so she's like you know what maybe he is in love with me you know what baby he didn't do that and I think it's important I honestly think we you know there's a default to assume that a man has sold a woman a dream right in this case the woman is presenting all of the every interaction she has had with this man for all viewing purposes and I combed through it and I'm here to show up as pro bono representation he did not leave that woman on he he literally [ __ ] for payments that was the agreement everything says that Snapchat this I'll fly you here did y'all watch p-valley he wanted the relationship coach and Mercedes hat okay I have money let me move you close he literally said I don't have a girlfriend but I'm moving here would you like to be my full-time and she blank the word out certainly girlfriend was not the word Dale he everything in that he is he said how much do you cost I want to go about this he said how much if I want you for four days I'll pay you this amount I'm trying to go go about this with respect where's the love she was sending him nudes with only fans logo marks on it so so you're trying to be the exception to the rule did she think that by her sleeping with him they'll make her check his mind is that what you think that's what happened and then they both don't have friends like that's very important to point out on the Pelicans there's already talks that he doesn't get along with any of the teammates he has no relationship with the organization and at the same time you have someone that first of all he's been caught up with this before he got caught up in high school at the end of his high school career uh there was a Snapchat it's a series of Snapchat screenshots which is why it made sense that she was using SnapChat because he got caught the same way he used his own name and he was saying a lot of the things that he's saying now obviously without the money part but he was caught quote unquote simping through his uh his the screenshots and I remember at the time it was a white girl so everybody just blew up about that um but now it's looking like also Mariah Mills there's a video that came out of her on Wendy Williams asking how do you get friends so it seems like two very lonely people that found each other at a very convenient time and both have what each other needed and are kind of doing that to keep that part of their life stable if that makes sense and now he's ruining that stability I think like I think if Zion were a woman I think we would be analyzing these Dynamics much differently this 32 year old woman who had first of all this is her job this is a profession by her own admission she has this relationship with other men who pay up for sexual relationships and that's cool that's fine there's no problem with that do your thing Miss but she does that she is chosen who is he's 21 22 now she's saying it's been going on for years this is a young boy who we just said by our own admission is in an area where he's alone he does not have friends he doesn't have this you are a much older woman she older than me and I'm a grown broad he's a child to me and she older than me all right and you are now in this sexual relationship with this man with with this young boy and then at the first sign of him doing other things or whatever living his life in no way reaching the terms of your sexual relationship you have now gone but his career his reputation you've been on a spree talking to every business sharing his intimate religion his intimate um sexual desires whatever it is if that were a 22 year old woman and a man was doing that he would want him in cuffs we'd want him in cuffs alive I think that's my issue with this whole situation is the fact that the genders were reversed there wouldn't be no two-week tirade of her just harassing this dude that just wouldn't happen like absolutely he would have been shut down Paige would have been suspended he would have been off the map so it just that's what bothers me is like we're laughing at it but are we laughing because it's the woman doing the harassing yeah exactly exactly I think it's the nature of in which she's doing the Horizon personally I don't think it's necessarily the fact that she's harassing because I mean as guys we've seen this with our friends we've like we've seen these situations play out right but I think it's just the nature in which she's doing it is just and I at first honestly I really thought she was just doing it to get adjacent follows to her only fans and get her money up in that regard but that's what I look like I really didn't think that all this was just you know normal behavior that she was just exhibiting I really think it was just a ploy to get more eyes onto her page which in turn gets her more only fans I I think it's a little bit of both I I think she isn't well judging from her tweets just a number of it's like semantic [ __ ] right but then on top of that she's also like wait everybody looking all right let me drop a rap version oh everybody looking let me drive business let me like it's not either or it's both I don't think it's just that it's um the whole if it were a man thing I I don't disagree that we will respond different but maybe we should respond different just like if a white person tells me when a wife a white person says some [ __ ] that a black person says or vice versa it ain't the same like the power dynamics are different like men when men start like the [ __ ] that Zion is doing if Zion was doing what Mariah was doing um he has men have the ability to kill women much easier men have the ability to stalk he's also powerful and Rich so it's like I I agree we would treat it differently but it's not just because oh it's a woman so you know I mean it's because the power dynamics are different a little bit today let me tell you why I say that I understand what you're coming from on the power Dynamic but let me tell you why I think I see it differently as a defense attorney I see it in terms of the criminal system right which is where those things go I I have represented hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of men on these kinds of cases I'm being charged with harassment for much less you called the woman three times texts a woman three times she ain't like call her friend won this and you in court you're in court and that's true and I represent I've represented over a thousand people very rarely is it a woman for the same thing like the criminal system actually feels much differently when it comes to treating harassment and things like that so maybe societally societally we don't respond to men or take it seriously but in terms of how the criminal system treats black men for much less than a fraction of this that's why I find it be a problem that she could be doing this in plain sight in this way no that's real that's that's that's real yeah I I think a lot of I mean again like I've never seen a situation where a dude is getting where woman's responding like this yeah we do they do something or say something outside of them because she presenting the text certain texts what is he saying when they together what is he doing you know I'm saying because this is purely like you know money for like if it's just if this is a business relationship she's she's acting real wow and here's the other thing she said her period was late like she said you know the first day she was talking about you know I might be late you better hope which suggests that they're having unprotected sex like yes why is he there that's well that's what she was complaining about a lot yeah yeah so again like so either he's letting her think that she's the only person that he's doing that with or he's having a lot of or she knows it like either way it's something but he's also he's also putting her in dangers right like and he's also like troubling her her professionalism like especially when when it comes to sex work they have to present papers before all those interactions and so she her first concern was if I have something it's on you like that was what she was tweeting like a lot was if I get something it's on you which already indicated it was it was unprotected sex so I think she was mad at him I guess disrupting her livelihood at first and then it spiraled into something else her livelihood but also like maybe like yo like you had me thinking I was the only one you was doing this with now again that's not even stupid to think that that is crazy if you see if if you if you see her tick tocks and stuff like that I think this will make a lot more sense like obviously you see her uh tweets but it matches her tick tocks is what I'm saying they're video versions of what is happening on Twitter see she got a tick tock account look look I'm just saying this thing I'm good I think it was actually a boy it was actually you know I ran into her account a while ago and then just seeing that this situation happened and I'm like oh this makes sense she seems extremely alone they're French I don't I don't know if I would just say alone though it seems she's a little she's a little off though I'm serious from The Wendy Williams interaction it did seem like she's a little off like especially even just asking your friends part of me was asking like thinking like is she serious is this an act uh yeah yeah exactly no I don't even exactly know so she'll like she'll she'll post a series of tweets dissing him and then post a video of her twirling so that's why I'm like what's the deal I don't I don't really understand she she posted a video at one point I don't remember exactly when she did it but like part of like the thing that she said in the video on Tick Tock was just like would you date somebody or mess with somebody who used to do movies that was her thing and then right after I had saw that this whole thing happened and I'm like I don't know the date of that video but that that's wild that's that's wild so I don't know I'm kind of confused on what actually is going on like her mental state um is it the fact that she doesn't have very many friends is it I don't know what it is it seems like a lot of things but to go on what you guys are talking about you know taking sexual assault or harassment seriously um just like I mean I'm laughing now and that's just kind of like part of the the issue that we're talking about is you know I think sometimes when a man gets sexually harassed or assaulted um people laugh like I remember I was in Vegas one time I'm not even making this up like I even laughed like this girl was trying to do some wild stuff you know trying to pull you know I was on the Dance Floor trying to pull my pants down and do all this stuff and then the whole situation after it's over everybody started laughing and I'm even laughing so like it's not yeah it's funny but it's not funny yeah so even this whole situation that we're talking about like we were talking about the power dynamics is truly interesting because it really is and I'm not sure how it would have played out if it was a different situation especially since men do have that power and ability to harm women in a way that women do not it's just true that they just like I'm sorry if she really tried to I probably would have kicked her in her chest like any person like that's just me being honest yeah but I didn't have to I didn't have to take it that far because I'm just like it's easy to get you a ball for me but you know as women don't have you know it's not the same I think that's a part of the the problem is your ability to get her up off you is a lot easier than our then their ability to get us off them right so I think that that's where a lot of that humor comes from like what what uh Mark was saying it's like the power dynamics in terms of physicality I think leads to that humor in it because oh she's not gonna actually do anything to that guy like but you know what I mean but but the problem with that is this right it's the same way like so like people think of like rape and these things like straightforward but it's not in the law like rape it means you know sex by force without consent but all those different words mean something different in every different jurisdiction and there'll be some places that Define force as like physical Force like was there some kind of actual this meanwhile another place so if someone to say you you you and Timmy you threatened somebody that I'll do something later but you don't physically hold them down whatever a jurisdiction like that won't see it as rape but we know psychologically oh people are people respond to different kind of threats and environments and different kind of situations differently and I think back to a time when I was I was a learning community leader in college and one of my mentees who was a freshman asked me after class like stay behind after to ask me whether or not it could be sexual assault that he was a boy to tell me like a man to tell me this story about this girl like assaulted him in the elevator but him feeling and like paralyzed with Fair because on almost and feeling like because he's a man he's supposed to want to or whatever it is so feeling uncomfortable and letting her do that so I'm like it isn't always just that because just because a man is physically able to overwhelm a woman does not mean that he cannot be in these these situations and I think it's important that we talk you know we think of it in that way because that's why I wonder I'm like you know is there a certain level of you know uh a lack of personhood we're assigning to like black men and boys you know which is kind of why this is what I wanted to talk about tied into the tsukiana stuff because on one hand and I think we this is obviously the larger conversation we gotta have um this is obviously sexual assault what happened is this is sexual assault this is sexual harassment what happened to sukiana on the other side there's that other conversation of when sukiana sexually assaulted a little boy a black boy and not the outcry so I wanted to put that to the group I was just saying I think the whole March situation it makes me uncomfortable I mean designer situation makes me uncomfortable sorry yeah I think the whole Zion situation just makes me uncomfortable because whether she's off mentally or she's being she's not something is off with that and then the age difference to me is also weird I get that he has money more than she does but being in your 30s this caught up over a 22 year old that's off it's just and for you to be we're weeks in at this point she's been going in for a couple of weeks now yeah over a 22 year old to being yourself something is off it's off and calm down I don't know what bag is that nice to wear I'm 27 and I 2 someone 22. somebody 25 I'm not looking at you twice so it's like maybe she was down real bad I don't think so think about it like this she she's living in we're all living in this Society where like um reality TV is what's in all of this stuff all this drama is lucrative so it doesn't really I mean she might have at one point been actually upset about this and then no one stopped her she kept going she's getting attention from everyone and it might lead her to being on some reality show like she probably knows what she's doing whether you know if we're perceiving her as off or something like that I mean it's pretty calculated the stuff that's saying the I mean she's cropping her messages just to show what she wants to show she's creating the narrative that she wants out there she's comfortable with the information she's putting out there so I mean it it makes sense we feed off of this stuff and I mean just the fact that we're talking about it everyone is talking about it it's on CNN like it's everywhere she's getting what she wants Adam yes yep and that's exactly why she should be under the jail and that's why she should be under the jail don't hand me out I really no we have to stop and she's antivizing this I blame Selena Powell I blame Kat Stacks I blame all of them I blame no jumbo I blame academics I blame everybody who is emboldened this [ __ ] because honestly if we let it happen once it'll happen again this should have been like you said that's because it wasn't stopped and because when people believe something is lucrative and they could keep doing they can make a business out of it they do [ __ ] like this and this is a [ __ ] scene this is obscene yeah I I think that's the part that bothers me is that there's so much space for these kind of spectacles like 20 years ago or even 10 years she would have went off she would went on some website you know what I'm saying she went to my radio show in New York or DC or whatever and it would have lasted like a day or two and they might live on YouTube forever but now she can live narrate all her frustration every time she has an emotional feeling she can live tweet it and we love watching a car crash we always love car crashes but now with Twitter and Instagram and all that [ __ ] like we have it's so easy to to watch the car crash over and over and over again and it makes it easy to and if this woman were to jump off a building you know what I mean or God forbid or if Zion was so embarrassed and so ashamed from all the stuff that she's feeling about help you know what I mean like you know I I just I just I think we always think these things are funny until they're not yeah exactly you know this ain't gonna end well it's just not I mean yeah it's not the new parties are gonna end well I think about it like if if a man I was involved with in any sexual relationship we have an understanding agreement nowhere we me and we have that relationship and for whatever reason he's upset with me and he goes on the internet and he's acting me on Twitter every day I'm trending he is telling all my sexual proclivities all my whatever all my blah blah blah blah blah I know I've had I've been you'll be upset for Less you'll be upset for less and she'd be upset for Less cause like we said she blocked me I said she in the whole Olympics and she blocked me so certainly she's saying worse about this young man every day all day if I go on Twitter right now from a different browser because I am blocked you will see that she is still Tweeting about him as we speak that means she's going to sleep every day going on and on and on like this no she's still going yeah it's been too week says she's been doing this and I feel like it would be a different situation if the messages she were showing were like oh I'm in love with you I want to be with you you know I want to make a life with you but the messages she's showing is okay how much is it going to cost me for for you to come here um how much do you want for XYZ she's sending him pictures nothing about this is speaking to love or a future with this man and I just feel like he's 22 and you're embarrassing him publicly and I mean you're 32 and this could probably help her career because I mean she's in the sex work industry she I mean all she needs is eyes on her projects and she's making money but what do you get from tearing down a 22 year old like and he hasn't said anything about it yet he's not taking up this opportunity to drag her anything he's just kind of letting her go at it and um it's not in his best interest too like I mean he's I don't think he's taking the high roll here as much as if he says I really loved her it wasn't like that he looks crazy because he just announced he's having a baby and didn't so announcement if he says this was just uh sex work he's a he's a he's a role model I mean they just gave job rant 25 games for holding up a gun because of a morality Clause not to say that he would get that but I mean it's not good for business he's he's a he's in the Jordan brand yeah he's got a sneaker you know you know what I'm saying like if being associated with his [ __ ] is so bad he's his team right now is pretending it's leaking news that he's getting traded just so somebody could be talking about something other than um continually even his stepfather his stepfather spoke and told us believe half of what you see none of what you hear and that he's sticking by his son and so even that is an acknowledgment that they see and know what's going on and Zion stood in the back conversations she's part she's posting the conversations of him begging her over time allegedly to stop doing this why is he still texting like anything she's and on top of that is getting to a point where she's blackmailing him it's not even just like yeah oh I'm putting his stuff on Third Street like she's literally saying my wire transfer hasn't come through I'm about to drop sex tapes I'm adding what are you doing it's the maliciousness it's malicious it's not being funny weeks ago yeah after day one for me I wasn't laughing anymore and here we are two weeks later and she's still going and this at this point legal action is being taken at some point it has to because it was never funny this is getting ridiculous I don't know if it's like I I don't know if it's a lack of self-awareness or something like that or just so worried about the bag that you would just make yourself look this insane in front of everybody like I know people are laughing but they're not laughing with you they're laughing at you well she has no friends so it doesn't really matter you know I mean in that Wendy Williams interview Wendy Williams told her that oh it's because your body the way you've done your body is so overboard that women probably are threatened by you or think that you're something that you're not and don't want to be friends with you that's what Whitney told her right and she goes she goes well it's worth it you know and so she was perfectly fine being friendless and no friend lets you tweet this long this is crazy no that's no that's not yeah that was my friend my friend would have done been in my house and put me a little computer in the water log out a wellness check yeah I think we've been shown that some people will go to Great Lengths to be and to be the main attraction on Twitter on social media in general like as far as people laughing at her some folks don't care about that as long as they're getting a bag at the end of the day they'll be the main the laughing stock of social media to get what they're trying to go for so I just feel like it's seeing her behavior I think that she doesn't care that we're laughing at her as long as she's the main topic that's her Focus which is dangerous I mean yes we're laughing at you but you're I'm afraid of people who will go to Great Lengths to for a bag and she's past that like you have nothing to lose and that's scary like and the problem you're behaving as though yeah what's even scary about that Cindy because I think you're absolutely right and I think it isn't just that it incentivizes her attack like that I think that's like something we are stoking in society in general you know what I mean like everybody looking for these opportunities to Trend to this to blah blah blah like no sense of Integrity everybody living on our content over everything type of mindset with people's real lives but I mean I just I just think that goes to what I was saying like this reality show culture that we have that's going viral on social media like you have to be a spectacle to get attention and once you realize that and you know you start capitalizing off of that it's very dangerous I feel like a lot of people even in their personal lives want this moment where you know everyone is watching them and they'll do anything necessary to make that happen for themselves absolutely yeah that's real no that's fast and I will say her basketball knowledge is extensive Marlin what do you mean by that what you mean by that she knows a lot she knows a lot about the league everything [Music] she told that young boy that she found after he already had a 200 million dollar bag she's gonna say to him ever after everything I did for you like I I stood by you I told you you was going to be the next LeBron no she tweeted that she tweeted that when I saw that I was crying when I saw it back on the court yeah right now I know he is he's still getting the cheeks I mean obviously injuries don't stop getting shakes I mean his hands I've had the injuries um so what I want to talk about is tsukiyana though these videos because it's not there are two videos everybody's talking about the YK Osiris video but more than the y k o Cyrus what I really want to talk about is the other video it's the other video for me let's talk about it make this game crawl yeah have y'all seen the other video boundaries and he said f those boundaries and I know the funny thing is it's not even funny I know men like this I have been around men like this and people swear up and down these type of men do not exist they do and they have friends and they got more friends and they do all of this and then they in the little group telling them that this is okay it ain't no problem well she want it she want it it's that entitlement right yeah like they feel entitled to sukiana is a great example because she says and does all the sexual stuff so she ain't got no boundaries right she don't want to be respected yeah right that's all made up with that like what that's crazy here's my issue with that though she is not the only sexual artist out here and that's my issue is like well yes she does she's more I guess provocative than others she is not the only woman artist out here who is sexual and I think what bothers me is I do believe there is a colorist aspect to it and a body shape and size aspect to it because I ain't never seen cardi B's boundary value like that like I ain't never seen that not saying that they're awesome but I'll also say she she has sex on camera on yeah the internet so I think that aspect plays into I think people feel a little bit more entitled because of that okay Anna is a Persona like she is an artist she is you know making content at tsukihana but at the end of the day she's a woman named Destiny Henderson or something like that and that's who she needs to be protecting so it doesn't matter or I mean that's what we need to be protecting it doesn't matter that in her music or in her videos she's doing provocative things or she's saying provocative things she is a real woman she's a real person she has personhood and it should never be oh we're we're balancing whether or not she should be violated on her own um performative actions like there's no circumstance where she does not deserve to have her boundaries honored or that she deserves to be harassed in public settings and have people around her not do anything with her yeah especially when she's sticking up for herself too Cindy I also find that like because so often men will argue to separate the man from the artists or separate music from it from who he is as a person when it comes to a man doing like harassing or rape or whatever the case may be but when it comes to sukiana it's her music and that's what she is so right no that is that is all right Kelly is R Kelly it's not the same person as his music but but notice you're exactly right notice which people defend who and why you're talking about exactly that because they pick and choose and it becomes very obvious because they feel like they have ownership over women in general exactly they like women to them do not have their own personhood don't have their own ability to say no these are probably the same guys that sit there and they get married or something and they feel entitled to somebody for sex if they tell them no yeah oh you can't have that you married to me I'm the man of the house these are the same type of people I'm telling you and you hear them and they act like they're not saying what they saying what are we talking about man you think I'm stupid you think other people are stupid what is actually going on here and that stuff is very pervasive it really is it's all in our face and what I also get upset as as a man is other men not doing [ __ ] you know I think we're like in the videos that we're talking about there's all types of men that didn't do [ __ ] yeah and I think worse than other men not doing [ __ ] but we really gotta hone in on is candy the women there giggling and laughing and like going out of here to legitimize it because that's what there was a there was an effort candy made to be like oh that's just how he is like oh this idea that men can just be like this this is just what men are and you need to accept that and adjust today environment like like you have to adjust to what the man is it's in their biology they're supposed to be aggressive the boys will be boys supposed to do all this stuff boys both boys will be boys like that's such a [ __ ] joke good I'm not mistaken wasn't that Candy's podcast yeah yes it wasn't the guy like a co-host yeah that's your normal co-host I think her regular co-host yeah so my thing is why aren't you checking somebody on your show she says he does this all the time more importantly the fact that she's cheating you sound like a whole sexual predator he does that repeatedly it's not just like repeatedly he does it like yes he pulls out his phone shows her he's heard his dick pictures then he's making all kind of comments and he's pressing up on her and at every point no point candy is horrified shocked anything she goes at her baby laughing like that's how he is which says that's just how he is which means that is something she finds acceptable permissible this is so this is something that they're comfortable with and what does that say about what we have what it what is already normalized and acceptable in our coaching community that like we have to even come to back for this or that Meek Mill is like tweeting yeah oh about oh oh you know oh my gosh Meek Mill coming out to eating like we gotta be we gotta be cool with this like oh now we gotta be cool he said he's like he says oh silky hold it down on some streets don't ruin his life don't press charges you know hold it down for the streets sir exactly why are we so quick to want to defend him and not so quick to want to defend tsukihana like I feel like the same deference should be given to her she was the one who was violated in a public space and no one is like jumping to her defense but oh please don't tear this brother down please give him another chance don't ruin his career but at some point like you have to be held accountable for the way that you act in public settings and you don't get to just I mean he apologized but you don't get to just go over and try to kiss somebody like this nothing about the interaction called for that behavior is mad scary to me because so first of all the incident itself is y'all was just talking about like it's like it's wow like you just walk up to somebody and do that like that's that's crazy right um and then the comfort with which he felt the company that you felt doing it but also the fact that no one intervened no one said like yo what's going on imagine if a dude that walked up and did it to him I'm sorry imagine if imagine imagine if a dude that walked up and did it to another dude right like think of like how everyone would have been oh [ __ ] would have shut down right because it was like this oh yeah that would have been swinging right yeah right yeah but this is the way that it's like oh well you know he can do it and and no one intervened and this is where um men everybody but especially men have to be more than just outraged we in the moment we have to say yo this is crazy like at what point do we intervene if it is a full a full you know rape we would have probably stopped it right if it had been if he'd been beating or we would have stopped it but like what are the boundaries right we just conceded that her body was up for for grabs and for touching but then when he apologized his apology two more things real fast um one was to me like I don't know like like you just said the amount of defense that people gave like let's not let's not throw him away you know what I mean let's protect it or you know how she gonna be doing all this stuff in the world and still not expect people to treat her like this as if there's some correlation between those two things when we wouldn't say that about black men who rap about gangster [ __ ] and shooting you know I mean or or people there's all kinds of people men rap about that we wouldn't expect the police or our Ops or other people to to to take us up on in real life right yeah even whether it's true or not but with women Suddenly It's oh you rap about sex you talk about doing this eating this you're tasting that so therefore you must want this at all times it's crazy to me and then the last part of it for me is like yo like even when he apologized um and he said I misread the situation I appreciated that he apologized because his apology was better than most like the people keeping for him yeah or like listening he actually apologized it was one of the better apologies I've seen he he clearly said what he did wrong and why but for me the question still is how did you misread what about that situation did you read as an opportunity because the fact that you could just see her there and Rita's opportunity makes me wonder what other situations you've read that way oh that other men um all of us I'm not all of us you know can say oh that's a misreading of the situation if that's our analysis then it's like does that mean whenever we see a sex worker we think that we can do what we want to them does that mean whenever someone's provocative sex or sex positive or is this that suddenly that that's a situation because this ain't nothing but that is I also think that there's a there's an aspect of not knowing when content isn't content anymore I think there's there's a lot of times the content over everything things go overboard in the name of content where it's someone will seem like they're being entertaining and they'll feed into whatever narrative the other person already has or their brand and they think it's warranted because it's content yeah and I think in this situation with his track record specifically I don't know this guy for his music I don't know a single song he's ever made but I know every antic he's ever pulled off on the internet right and I think this I thought I think he thought this was going to be one of those Antics that would go viral and it would be left as content and an antic and it went to a completely different place that he didn't realize because this blurred line with content where you feel like anything is good as long as it's entertaining and goes viral oh okay so the other thing I wanted to talk about this related to what we're speaking about right now is um just like permission to do things like her Mission like like asking do you want to do blank or making it obvious and I think that is completely lacking I think a lot of men have no conceptualization of what I'm even talking about like in this they cannot read the room like I like I'm gonna be honest with you especially when I was younger and I was in college I used to make some women uncomfortable because I would ask yeah do you want to have sex and then they would look at me like I'm crazy and I'm like I'm dead ass and then sometimes they wouldn't give me a straight enough answer so nothing happened yeah and that's just how it was Just Gonna Roll either you're gonna answer the question did you ever answer a question or not but there's a lot of men that don't understand what I'm talking about at all because they feel like they have some sort of controller or ownership really over women I don't even know if a lot of men see women as people to be honest the way they act and I think this is just another example go ahead oh I was just gonna say on that what you were just saying I think there's a lot of stock that goes into doing things without having to be asked as a man when you're dating and there's a lot of uh reward in doing things without being asked and knowing when to do it and so I think that that is more harmful than it is helpful because a lot of times women reward men for not asking and just doing it you should just know you know what I mean and I think this is a double-edged sword yeah I didn't think that's a double-edged sword because then you create a gray area where someone thinks that they could do what they're thinking you want them to do in a moment where you may not be thinking that at all you know what I mean so I I think that part is where it gets very complicated and very murky that's what I was saying you get this reward system that you feed into and now it's hurting you okay I was gonna say there's a very big distinction about what you do in your private private you know private interpersonal relationships between women and men than what you do on a public like I mean we can talk all day about consent in private relationships but right what about we're on a panel with five other people makes you completely stand up and go and try to kiss you there is nothing yeah that warrants that there is nothing that no question was asked like oh go ahead you know no I agree but I think that's what I was saying to me is the general danger between us continuing to like incentivize a culture over everything kind of meant like world combined with a with hypers not understanding and having the right understandings around hypersexuality or these kinds of things or sexual relationships that's what I'm saying is that larger danger because you see how it happens I could say even I'm sure every I'm sure everybody who is a public figure and media anyway whether it be YouTube mainstream has experienced some other person in the arena that thinks like y'all like thinks you understand that you should implicitly be beefing for entertainment for Content or do certain things and expect you to get it or go along with it because they do kind of live in that world and it is kind of this I've seen people like operate like that and I think it is what Marlon was saying like I've only ever seen I don't know why KO Cyrus music either I've only ever seen him in stuff like dancing for Drake and blah blah blah and stuff like that where he seems to be making a fool of himself or someone or someone is being made what you're talking about yeah okay I believe yeah oh my God the man literally Shooks and jives but that's the thing but that's the thing that kills me though and so he did that in front of everybody right so that leads me to believe that he definitely has no conceptualization of consent right I don't think in public what's he doing in private yeah I think that's my issue with the apology because while he did Apologize there was one part in the apology where he said it wasn't my intention to violate your boundaries but it was because you didn't ask for permission you had to violate her boundaries to do what you wanted to do that was your intention because you were so deliberate and doing it more than once but I think the escaper for me is maybe he actually looks at her and reads her somebody who doesn't have boundaries that's what I think is the I think that's the statistics black women in general is not having boundaries but they definitely look at sex workers or hypersexual people or sex positive there's a whole bunch of categories that we have we say oh she's she's this she's that so therefore the truth is very much so that they don't that that they this is the thing when people when you talk about rape culture like there's a reason why you say culture is it's pervasive throughout the entire culture it's in it's through the society and you realize that people don't have an understanding of consent or drawing boundaries because people's response to both sukiana situations were like to post a clip before or after these interactions where her her into her um her behavior to them is sexually this or open or inviting which has nothing to do with the particular individual interactions where she's assaulted where she is you know saying no and we see that you know to the earlier point we were saying you know when Mark was like you know maybe if that had been more it had been a different kind of act that maybe we would have stepped in and I don't think we would have because if you look at even like a Meg situation Meg gets shot and the conversation was exclusively about men bringing up her sexual whatever and whatever relationship he had with them I was like like that has anything to do with being shot so if they do that then they will sexualize women and act as though you and you can you can send things to a sexual relationship has somehow opened the doors for any level of abuse or whatever comes after that then of course it's not surprising they do it in a situation like a tsukiana yeah yeah yeah you're absolutely right to only what a man's perspective or perception of it is like as women black women in particular were very hypersexualized our bodies are viewed mostly As sexual objects I don't even think a lot of men think of women as individuals they you know they only consider you know what gratification they can get from the woman like they don't care anything about their internal lives their internal perspective it's just about like okay if you're presenting yourself as a woman who is you know sex positive free then okay you're free for me as well and even if you aren't presenting yourself that way I don't want anything to do with you because I'm not getting anything out of this interaction and I think a lot of men put women in these compromising situations because they don't think of them as as people and that speaks to how women are treated especially black women in society like yeah I mean we seen it from Kiki Palmer's situation with Trey Songz how everyone villainized her for even feeling uncomfortable um in the situation where he was trying to dance with her grope her in a music video or have her you know in this video that she didn't consent to be in because she was simply present there and her body is simply available to you know do whatever he wants to do to for his music video I mean we've seen it like you said with Meg I mean the stories are countless from celebrities to Everyday women you know we don't necessarily get to control our bodies or what we want to happen to us because that's just kind of not what's the standard in society yeah and it goes a step further yeah go ahead it's on both ends of the spectrum because at the same time asuki hottest videos going out Miss Home Depot was getting docs because men would have said that they can see her being the only fast girl and begin testing over that so it was like that whole week of sukiana and Miss Home Depot was [ __ ] he's insane like people joking joke like men will [ __ ] a hole in a tree that is not a lie we're also very contradictory because it's like at one on one hand we're saying yeah we want this sex positive very openly liberated woman but at the same at the other end these there's just as much as much men and some of the same men chastising women who are in that way who are choosing a sex worker career who are presenting themselves as hypersexual being so right but those are the same issue because you're only seeing the woman as a sexual being whether they're curious exactly for themselves or you're making or not no I think all of this is tied together which is why like originally even why I wanted to talk to them all together because this is why I was saying like bad politics like you could have a bunch of all of these situations involve so much about like one hypersexuality but two misogyny and also how we we view different groups but also how we all suffer in it right because we've we've been described we've described a bunch of situations based on how we view sex how we view men and women's Dynamics and all these different things and we have watched a bunch of different scenarios where every different demographic has been hurt in the Mariah my own situation we see where a man how a man is dehumanized in these situations through these ideas and sukiana with the little boy we see the way children are not protected over because how we View mobile boys and men and then in this situation with two Kiana's it's all we see how we we view women we see it all the way and it's all tied together this um the society the society and we all become agents of misogyny and patriarchy and all these different things whether or not we one two are not because you see even in a Mariah Mill situation she's a sex worker but she's still everything about her rhetoric is Aunt is misogynistic and is [ __ ] Shaman and blah blah blah she's holding up the other women and and she's even sex shaming him and all these different things because she's still educated in the same Society otherwise even though she's engaged in this work that's why she feels the need to like distinguish herself from the other kind of sex work and create this hierarchy because it's still she's still trying to honor that and then in a situation with a sukiana we see the way that tsukiya sukiana's sexuality or a Persona is used to dehumanize her in that regard and then in the flip side of that we see the way with a little boy because we don't let little we don't let little black children be children we don't view we don't let black boys be black boys no one feels the need there wasn't the same speaking up for him until it was time to negate you know what I mean people only wanted to bring it up now you see these black men that are bringing it now just to negate the treatment of a woman because that's the hierarchy we've got going going on in terms of and we're just creating an oppressive system amongst each other I think it's so frustrating uh like just being a man and experiencing the things I've experienced and people in my life or people who are not in my life anymore it's so frustrating when you're talking to other men who like are just so they don't get it critical and it's just it's just and then they do this thing where they're just they're Woman Haters as I like to call them and it's so frustrating because you hear this stuff and I'm like nobody made you do that nobody made you cheat on them nobody made you hit them yeah and here we are what is this conversation this is crazy I'm like do you hear yourself do you actually hear yourself and there is no getting to a lot of these people to be honest I've said some very close to me in my own family or whatever the case may be there's no honest conversation to be had it's just gonna go back to the default thing of just hating women and I I mean personally like I have to deal with this all the time and my own close relationships and I'm just like I can't even talk to you dog I couldn't even I don't even know what to say because there's nothing there there's nothing else to say like you're reporting backwards you know what I'm saying I'm just like this is this is ridiculous but we but we have to I try my best in my different friend groups and people I grew up with or whatever to try to have these different types of conversations and these conversations get railroaded immediately like let's say toxic masculinity for instance yeah oh no we ain't talk about that no cut that out no we're not doing that and I'm just like I'm like maybe maybe it might be you and what you doing like what there'll be a conversation just like oh women this women that and I'm just like is it you is it are you messing with ain't [ __ ] women like what actually is going on here because why is it always their fault yeah you ain't never sat there and had some self-reflection or anything like that and some of these individuals are doing some of the craziest dirt and then sitting there confused like what did I do accountability is not something that's required of men like you don't have to be accountable for the way that you treat women because across the board this is an acceptable way to treat women so why are you calling me out when I'm just doing what I'm allowed to do you're really doing too much I'm trying to have a good time speak on it yeah and yeah not to mention a lot of men think that the world's so much better that they think oh it's not like how it was back then I'm not treating you that crazy like so which what are you complaining about you got this you got this now you can do this now it's like you get a bank account no but you know it's a funny thing though like I said for me it's like you see these on both sides you're those exactly what you're seeing from men right you're seeing all of that and then you also see because like I said it's not just that men are agents of massaging and patriarchy we're all in the same women become very much so deeply so and women will be like fighting and arguing to advocate for like dynamics that oppress us and harm us and you know not thinking about the long game and I think I saw that even with like well I had a follower tell me they gotta unfollow me um off of saying Mariah Mills is harassing Zion she said you can't be speaking up the men and she was like and then another one say to me wow so women can't grieve now and I'm like it's Miss Mama's um grief like what makes you you know and it was just this argument did someone die oh God insisting that like she should be a lot like it's so like it's somehow different like men are any less people you know in terms of of a feeling or harassment or anything and I do think there is and this is something you know I checked this in myself like I was once me and Nia talk about this all the time we always say we we don't read Bell hooks until we ready to be told about ourselves but Bell hooks will say you know we'll point out to you like how is women like we have these conversations maybe it's a fear of not wanting to admit that you don't understand men or that you don't think of men as you know human in the same way that you think about yourself to get that you don't get them you know and you know and I think that is true like I once had a client check me I once had a client a black man I was calling in to tell him I I just called him to tell him I was gonna get him his case dismissed but he started cussing me out immediately first right and like I remember just being like trying to cut him off to say to him like I don't work like I have you I know I have the good news or I know what is an answer to your problem and he said to me how do you you can't know what the [ __ ] I want if you haven't listened to me like you have not heard what my issue is or listen to me or I've gotten to talk to know what I want and I remember thinking I did not like him but I remember reflecting on that like you know what there is a certain level of me operating like okay I love the black man I have his best interests at heart so because I have his best interests at heart I don't have to hear him I don't have to understand him I don't know because I'm calling but what is the good news or what's to save him and I think that that is something I'm seeing here like the inability to see like why don't we see Zion the same way I would see myself if my girl was happening to my girl like is he any less a person is his feelings any lesser are we any of do men have any last sense of privacy or shame then we do no so you know and I think it plays on both ways I would have anxiety if I was him he's like crippling anxiety if she was tweeting like this about me for weeks and she actually had yeah it'd be on my mind I would become a threat I would become a threat I would have been trying to end her um two weeks ago I said listen y'all hey y'all better than me I would have done put every narrative by morning The Narrative was gonna be about how it was a young boy when this grown woman came into my life to manipulate me and I would find everything oh oh she'd be a predator by morning [ __ ] around with me she being cuffs quickly well maybe that's what the the Pelicans are gathering their their evidence right now just to you know at the top of the conversation her behavior is predatory this is a child compared to her he is he's a child with a million dollars yes but his money didn't age him in any way didn't make him any more mature he's not prepared for a situation like this he is fresh into the league like and she's like okay well I can manipulate him because he is Young like if he was a seasoned um NBA veteran she would not be able to carry out what she's doing right now exactly definitely praying on the fact that he's a child yes well this happens a lot more than we like to admit because they they I know I know women that watch the draft and gather social media handles and correlate spots the night of and oh we're gonna link up here like it's a whole calculated game that this this NBA thing is well Sports in general when you have these young players that come in with tons of money tons of upside and you remember Deion Sanders I think he coaches um I think he coaches um college football and he had Brittany Raynor come in and teach a class on you know being aware of women who um prey on athletes and what signs to look for and I think I mean I mean the NBA and the NFL I think they give like Baseline Financial um courses to these players but they really do need to be giving them some like sexual harassment and you know how to conduct yourself now that you have Fame around women because I think it would help them greatly if you're in a situation where you're coming from high school or you're fresh out of college and you've never been exposed to a lot of women now throwing themselves at you a lot of women now looking at you as though you're an opportunity for them you're not going to know necessarily how to navigate those situations and when you're 20 21 22 23 you you you basically are like just imagine you've been in a drought and now you have a surplus and you're like I could do this I could do you're not gonna make good choices so and that's real people pray we'll pray on that yeah yeah I think this is really this is really interesting so I didn't play football or basketball or anything like that but I was a student athlete in college and stuff like that um and I would never forget this because it it was very different I don't know how many schools actually do this but uh we would have a little sexual harassment talk with this organization and they only if I remember correctly only talk to the men um and when I tell you it was very uncomfortable it wasn't exactly what you're talking about but it's more so talking about like consent and stuff like that right I mean the story that they told is is if I tell y'all right now y'all can be like what the [ __ ] so it was basically it was I think it was an officer go ahead no I said tell us what'd you say tell us oh uh so um I guess it was an officer or something like that and I guess the officer was like coerced into giving this person sexual pleasure right it was the most extreme crazy insane situation I've ever heard because I don't even sound possible right but you know kind of like when you would you go to uh like when you're in high school or maybe you're in seventh or eighth grade you learn about sexual health and they tell you the most extreme case of of getting an STD like if you get this you're gonna explode like it was very much one of those things but the thing that's important though is like I came from that understanding that a lot of my peers had no conceptualization of consent had no conceptualization of sexual harassment or any of those things so that was even in that way so getting that type of thing which they absolutely need they need a whole I mean it's embarrassing and we completely do not engage in this conversation whatsoever people are you know you can't do sexual education in a lot of places they just straight up ban it so so you have people who graduate from high school having no no idea what any of this stuff is they come out like Plum idiots and so what does that say about our society what does that say about our education system what does that say about everything I think this is a massive issue that we just don't even remotely deal with during the pandemic my city dealt with it a lot like I don't know about anybody else's City but in Toronto there was like a lot of calling out of abusers and photographers who had taken advantage of models and yeah all types of just horrible situations that had to do it directly with consent and I think the more that we highlight these things especially in public social media and all those stuff like the kids are watching you know what I mean and the kids are learning that I have conversations with my cousins um during like the holidays and stuff and they're far more advanced in that area than any of my peers ever were at that age yeah so I think the more that we highlight these conversations like it's it and the more we put a spotlight on them the easier it is for people to digest it and learn what's going on for real absolutely we need to stop shying away from it like yeah this is just really ridiculous because at that point I realized like who else on campus is getting this conversation it's just the men student athletes what about all the other because you think that you're saying that they only gave you a course on like how not to harass someone how not to violate someone but they don't talk anything about how not to be victimized or what to do if you feel that you're in an unsafe or compromising sexual position and I think that speaks to alamy's point that like men are not given the the authority to say like oh look I feel uncomfortable about these sexual situations that I'm in and you know men should want to have um sex all the time or you know if you're getting attention from a woman you should be you know grateful and into it but a lot of men I'm sure feel very uncomfortable a lot of the time in the situations that they're put in by women and yeah you know athletes and student athletes in particular you know because they are a group that is lucrative you a lot of people go after them because they think that they can get something they should be given the tools at least to say like this is the reporting structure if you feel uncomfortable these are your resources um instead of just saying don't you know harass or assault [Music] literally sitting there saying that men cannot be raped people believe that this is all men and women both men and women believe that it's scary it's literally it's literally crazy and I'm just sitting here like are y'all serious and this is a real conversation that people have been people really believe it and I think sometimes people don't want to have the conversation because like I was saying like with the follower feeling like oh you're defending men something I I want people to often understand is no I'm looking out for my best interest because ultimately what we teach men and how harm perpetuates comes to you and I'll I'll give you an example of this I have an ax who sexually who who uh violated me right and and when I explained like that was a whole thing of trying to trying to make him understand that right that you you have sexually assaulted me because you can't even he he looks it is like you know I upset you you know what I mean in our relationship but he doesn't see it as as the assault right and then I remember he told me a story a woman did the exact same thing to him like the same situation and I'm thinking to myself and he's so like he's telling me the story to tell me how uncomfortable he is and how horrified it is scenario but I'm thinking to myself oh he's gonna get it now you know what I mean because God put him in the same situation now and he's gonna get it and he could not when I called it sexualist that he was sexually assaulted he was wait like something he didn't enjoy happened to him or he didn't like that or he didn't want to interact with this woman anymore but he didn't he couldn't see it as sexual assault and because he couldn't see the sexual assault for himself he damned sure can't see in a sexual assault doing it to me so I think that is the thing that we need to understand is like when we teach men like when men are themselves existed in a society where we're teaching men to dehumanize themselves not to see themselves as as you know they see themselves as feeling like they have to go along with every sexual scenario or whatever it and don't see themselves as having boundaries that can be violated how the [ __ ] they gonna respect ours yeah yeah go ahead a lot of men are told that they're they're gay if they don't want to do something or exactly like you know what I mean I've been in situations where I straight up was just tired I was just tired and I was told that I was an entire different sexuality I'm like all right cool like okay I think it's even it's even worse when you're a celebrity too because there is an expectation that you [ __ ] groupies and you you enjoy all these sexual Endeavors and yeah it's just it's it's bad all around but I do I really do agree that if men were to stop looking at being especially sexually harassed or assaulted as emasculating as you would look like less of a man if you were to admit you felt uncomfortable in this situation I think that's a part of the problem yeah yeah so we got there you'll see how it all time is Cindy touch I kind of wanted to go back to one part we kind of we touched on a little bit but the way that women have internalized misogyny plays a role in this topic as far as how we facilitate in men feeling emasculated because they admit to feeling violated or not being in the mood but also going back to sukiana the amount of women who felt like what happened to her was what she deserved because how she presented herself yeah yeah I felt like well if you don't want to be treated that way then you shouldn't I guess there were men saying that but there were what scared me the last it was the amount of women who were saying things like well I mean it would never happen to me because I don't dress that way I don't act that way and it's like babes yeah women will disappoint you being harmless security misogyny women will disappears but it was so it's scary to me that while yes the culprit is misogyny and that's a You Know a Man created thing the way that women have internalized it to where we can be predatory or we can facilitate and how y'all to feel comfortable to admit that your own discomfort that's scary too because it's like okay we you would think that if anybody would get it we would get it as the as the one at the hands of men's behavior and to see us not getting it it's like wait a minute girl like you know what is going on me and I definitely embedded the Purity politics right Tyler Perry sisters and one episode there's an episode storyline where one of the women is beat up like fully assaulted by this man that she met that she brought over and we were horrified that in the show all three of her friends these women were casted to the story lines was that they were blamed they were like oh she been you've been sleeping around you having a hot girl so much of her fault mind you the character itself wasn't even having a hot girl so she slept with like two men in the show like two three whatever but anyhow they're like you bring these men mind you other women in the show have been assaulted you know like who are by men that they're in relationships with whatever but the minute she is assaulted by this man she just met they're blaming her and everything and I remember me and Nia going on Twitter on purpose to the hashtag to see other women black women be so horrified with us like why no they were saying the same [ __ ] thing like the same thing and I was like we will never be free is because to see all those women's opinions and like them saying you know having this morality and feel like they're Superior because it wouldn't happen to them because they don't act that way you have girlfriends who are assaulted who had on sweats and hoodies who didn't act that way who wasn't dressed that way who are reading your opinions and those are your homegirls and it's like that's what also scares me is a lot of the revealing of how people really feel about the situation also reveals that your friends might not fully be your friends because they're holding these really unhealthy mentalities about who gets assaulted who gets violated and you're someone who was violated and you didn't do anything you would sleep you know like and that was awful scary to me as women's and even solidarity just kind of dissipated real fast and even deeper than that even deeper even deeper than making it seem like oh it's women because of what they're wearing or what they're doing it also it how it also feeds into rape culture and people not believe in people is because it presents this idea that the person who rapes you are so sexually assault you or harasses you as the boogeyman is this evil man that's there rather than reality what I realized in law school in law school we would go over cases rape cases and the class would be divided truly on what was raped what was harassment what was that and never come to a resolve and it's something I think we need to recognize is it isn't this Boogeyman you know this wicked man with a mask off first of all women and people and women men everybody non-binary people are mostly sexually assaulted rapes harassment people they know and trust people who not only people who purport to love them but who believe it too like I just told you about my ex that man believe he loved me but he has no concept his understanding of of sex boundaries and everything that's what's already hardwired in a way that causes harm to me regardless of what he wants or he believes in his heart so it's like it isn't these Boogeyman it's the people around us our friends are this who we love who are all being indoctrinated and educated into this you know and we're all perpetuate men and women because you're right I know I have male friends and that's how I realize like level of dehumanization is I have male friends who will tell me who's scared to tell a woman who go through elaborate schemes to get out of [ __ ] women because they believe because the woman is going to go make fun of them or go call them or put their business out there and blah blah and it's inherent at me really oh [ __ ] you're a person like me you could be shamed like me you could be this you worry about this you'll be in positions you could feel coerced or pressure but it's easier like sometimes like me and my being here talk about this a lot where I'll think of sexual encounters from my early 20s and I'm like I don't feel like I wanted to do that I feel like I felt I felt obligated or situationally pressured to this or blah blah blah sometimes it's safer to engage than to resist exactly exactly that's unfortunately relatable yeah yes yes yes would you realize it once and then you realize it a bunch of times like the minute you finally unlock like wait a [ __ ] minute wait is this and then you see a bunch of things differently and I think that is the like there has to be a more nuanced conversation to these things it's very like there is this need I think especially online to pretend like this is very black and white and it's bad and good and everybody has a clear and it I've never seen that in real life when you when you talk to people about these things the the amount of lack of understanding that there exists among us all male woman blah blah blah and different like gender roles and societal expectations where operating off of are crazy because they're right I remember them acts in the classic I was being so divided on what is consent or what was rape or was this but then when you ask people whether or not they want affirmative consent back to what Jay Sean said of women being like at you asking them explicitly feeling like you killing the mood or you blah blah and all these different things and so we all become participatory in this like larger system that hurts us right and then you end with the conversation of okay now that something happened do I have to ruin this person's life and then you get what everyone was saying about the the boy who assaulted tsukihana don't ruin this young man's life like don't exactly don't destroy his career and I think even on a personal level you feel like this you know you may be put in a compromising situation by a classmate or someone that you you know consider to be a romantic partner and you're like if I speak up about what you've just done or what you're planning to do then I'm gonna destroy your life now now you're gonna have to be engaged with the criminal system I'm gonna have to be engaged with the criminal system and that's going to ruin both of us so I feel like there's a lot of just trying to protect yourself and trying to protect everyone around because once you speak out about certain things then you yourself become a target of hate and it's just unfortunate that you know that's basically the motion anyways [Music] yeah yeah this unfolds on the internet oh it's over yeah doesn't even happen on camera does does half the internet even believe her no yeah no no no no no no no the part no the part when she said she said uh she went on Twitter and right before she deactivated she said I feel hurt and I feel unsafe or uncomfortable like um like No One's Gonna believe me or something to that effect and people are we're questioning that like oh can he kissed you but it wasn't that big of a deal like oh you're doing too much now and blah blah it's always like damned if you do damned if you don't a lot in a lot of these situations but that's that's a great point that you just said because it kind of talks about what we're already talking about that idea that men have in their head that they're supposed to accept any sort of advances towards them like if a woman comes up to me and start making out with me I need to make out with her otherwise I'm gay or what's the case whatever I'll be accused of like you you have to engage on it or people go look around like man I woulda you didn't do that why didn't you do that what's wrong with you and then the people that do stick up for you are only sticking up for you to Counterpoint and discredit women it's not yeah because you actually got harassed they want to use you as a Counterpoint to discredit what women say oh you did that so I can do that then right like it's a lot of people trying to make two right two wrongs are right and I think and I think that again that goes back to like when we it's it's the same thing but when you see the difference with how we talk about teachers that prey on students when it's the student is a is a is a boy or a girl right like the minute a minute it is uh the teacher is a woman it's oh I would have wanted to be doing that in 19 years and you know how many times I know so we hear it even it don't even have to go on an interpersonal level the amount of black male celebrities who have seen sit on interviews and describe their uh losing their virginity or when they started having sex and they are telling obvious stories where they were predatorized as kids I've heard that so many times it is unreal and I know so many black men that tell you stories where you're like this you were preyed on this is is crazy you know you're telling this story either you know from this perspective of like oh yeah I became a man at a young age and you're you're saying it as a rite of passage and a badge of honor but then you know I or you're saying it as you reflected after a long time like oh actually I was you know taken advantage of and I feel like there's not a lot of space for especially young men to say like okay the first time that I had sex it wasn't necessarily my choice it wasn't something that I was interested in but whenever it's a woman who is explaining what happened to her as a child it's always like you know you want to comfort them and you should both parties should be you know comforted and given resources to deal with a traumatic um sexual experience but when it comes to men it's always like oh you're good like you know that you should be lucky you that that happened to you that you had sex when you were like 12 or 13. you know I had to wait till I was 18 but yeah you should have like you should have it should always be your choice you should never have that moment stolen from you whether you're uh a man or a woman like you should always be in control of the sexual experiences you have and no matter what like whoever you are a celebrity you know a young child you should have autonomy over your own body to say look I'm uncomfortable with this and it shouldn't happen to me it speaks to how we view fragility in both men and women like we there's this hard exterior that men should and do possess that women don't and so we should cuddle and you know like take care of the women in those situations but man you guys walk it off like it's not that big of a deal yeah there really should be some kind of therapy for just sexual trauma for men because I think a lot of the reason why men don't want to hear these kind of talks is because it makes them to think about things they might have done or had done to them and if they think about those who do they go to to be able to talk about it outside of a therapist you know but yeah what Outlet do they have to mentally and emotionally process those experiences they don't really have one even if they were the aggressor or the victim so I feel like I wish there were more it was more normalized not just therapy but to talk about sexual trauma with men and just y'all have your own space for that only that word that we're not a part of that's just for your space but that's the hard part that's the hard part because I've been in these situations with my male friends and we'll literally I'll try to talk about these things and they shut it down immediately they're it's just like it's so programmed that a lot of men's Brains that they're not willing to even have the conversation even if it's harmful to them and even to others I personally I don't know what to do yeah in that framework I truly don't know what to do a lot of times that goes back to like how we're taught to express feelings from a young age like I can't remember who was discussing this but talking about how when little boys cry it's like yo what are you crying for but what a little girl cries it's like what's wrong what's the problem talk about it so it's like when you grow up as uh as a Boys Don't Cry and you're in in that environment it's a lot harder when you haven't been given the tools at a young age to then just get these tools overnight and learn how to speak about your emotions and talk about what's bothering you because you feel like you haven't had that outlet for 18 20 plus years so it's like there's no you know much level of trust you need to be able to do that and yet we expect them too it's a lot and when you can't when you can't when you don't have that experience you don't know who to trust with that type of information that's how you know what's real when when one of your guy friends tell you something and it's like shocking you realize in that moment what level of friendship you're at with the men when the more feelings he talks about to you yeah it's my friend group it ranges like there's guys who I'll never know what they're feeling in my friend group but then there's some some of my friends who are very open with talking about it so it's like I feel like you do reach a different level of man when you guys are able to express those feelings to each other and talk about in a healthy way because you're like yo it's relieving you're like oh [ __ ] somebody else is doing this too like so yeah right but I feel like it would be helpful like you know in sex ed that's taught in school to be more of an authentic conversation about you know not only the mechanics of sex but the emotional components and you know the consent components and just giving from a young age instilling um that there is a space that you can speak about these things freely and I feel like if we're if we start that in schools um then it would be much easier for people as they grow older to understand and you know have compassion for people who are in um compromising sexual situations and not go immediately to blaming the victim or you know trying to tear down um the certain aspects and components of the circumstance to validate you know the interaction for the man or for the woman in any perspective we're doing that at like age eight I believe seven seven or eight they get uh there's like these consent books for kids uh that they're starting to implement we're doing that over teaching them about their bodies boundaries and respect and all that stuff so I know that but there's also pushback on that which is I was about to talk equally as crazy to me like this what age yeah like what age they should be taught these things a lot of parents are not happy that they're being taught these things at that age so it's like you you constantly have this push and pull of conservativism and like trying to be liberal at the same time and it's just great it's a lot there is a lot of that like out here in California just unrelated to this but related to what you're saying having all these random school boards and you know moms and dads and whomever are losing their minds losing their absolute minds and boycotting and all the stuff right so this is like a point of contention and the crazy thing is the parents are probably not going to teach them anything that we're talking about yeah yeah they don't want it to be taught at school but they're not going to talk about it at home either but what also bothers me is a lot of these conservative families who don't want their kids to know this their kids are being molested like by church leaders like hey you you guys need to know your kids need to know consent because there's other like your kids aren't the world isn't innocent for kids it's just not yeah and I feel like I think it's crazy that these parents are every other week it's a church leader being a mugshot that I'm seeing being charged for pedophilia every other week and I'm not exaggerating so it's like for y'all to be the ones who are so proud to be Christian and whatever your belief is y'all need to be the main ones advocating because if they don't get too good for y'all like your kids you didn't know you didn't know emotions are liberal come on hey emotions and share emotions and empathy and stuff that's for liberals I just find that to be very interesting and they're the main ones trying to prevent that kind of information when y'all should be the main one spearheading it because it's for it's for everybody like you said it's literally for everybody and it will make our society or societies better absolutely it just don't make everything better we need to stop running from this conversation that's that's the thing that's frustrating to me because the thing I learned to sex a I learned nothing but basically if you stick your dick inside it's gonna explode that's what I learned like explode as in you're gonna get a disease is that mean girls is that mean girl scene I wasn't I was looking they were showing all the images and stuff I said oh Lord I don't want that fear twice like that's all it was it wasn't about the reality of it all and it was literally we had to get permission slips and do all this I swear I really only remember it being a maybe an hour or something maybe it might have been multiple times I don't even think about abstinence pushed yeah and I'm from Ohio and I know things are getting even worse in Ohio so I can't even imagine the lack of things that they're learning over there or getting getting especially the closer your your state is with church and state it that's when it gets even like a little bit Wilder because it's like they don't want those things taught at all yeah at all yeah I think it's beyond like just even just the sex education thing to which I was talking about earlier with how we talk to like young boys about their feelings versus young girls I think there is a level of we do not let we don't treat little boys like children they never get to be kids with feelings we're training them with this like hyper masculine toxic masculine like anti-emotion thing and then somehow at 18 we expect them to be fully actualized men with all these tools we didn't teach them like something I'll notice is even like with the John Moran situation I have never seen more pushback than me suggesting there be any level of Grace or like societal role and how John Morant comes to be and a lot of what I'd see is like women saying to me they'll be like oh he's a grown man he's 23 he has a kid if we never if I'm saying to you that we raise boys in a world where we teach them that masculinity that this is how they show that they're full of their men violence guns these kinds of things blah blah blah blah that's how you raise them you are you teach men you teach boys and men that they're supposed to act out or they're supposed to you know violence aggression other things and talk about their feelings of what they're going through why is it surprising that at 23 years old you give who was just previously that's how your race that's the world you're living in a young man why would he have the tools with another millions of dollars how was he any last to Whitney was talking about earlier is like we act as though being like if you give somebody money or you give somebody Fame that changes who they are architecturally as a person or what like trials or tribulations they have to deal with or the lack or presence of tools and I think that's something we keep seeing it's like you never let alone you never let black boys be boys you never let them have emotions and feelings like everybody else and then you're surprised that they don't handle it maturely that they don't come to you and also that we we access we can't conceive of black men even having something to be going through I'm like why is it inconceivable that a 23 year old black like who is who had to spend their entire use one grooming themselves as to even get into this career they were never even a child like everybody else did in order to get there there's a amount of sacrifice that even has to happen you're already commoditized you're already seen as a product then you're in an industry and job that extends to your entire person alive and you're being scrutinized by millions of people why is it inconceivable that you might act out it's not even in the NBA that starts in high school now because with social media when you're the hot kid Zion Williamson has been I've known that kid since grade nine like we've watched him grow on the internet he's been famous since grade nine because of his ability to put the ball in the hole so it's like he's had that level of scrutiny since grade nine I can't imagine that during your most your development years you are under a magnifying glass not to mention everyone's depending on you now now you can't let people down and you have to walk this tight rope of perfection you can't go out like your friends and you're not afforded the the um the ability to make mistakes like your friends do you know what I mean and that's all we did as teenagers is make mistakes so now when you're in this league and now you finally have the money you're by yourself parents can't tell you what to do coach can't tell you what to do you're exactly right and they got this extra smoke for [ __ ] for black people just just ready just ready to go and we join in the worst part is that we join it I know like I'm telling you I would have expected but even in particular with the drama situation it's not only that women will jump on you it's that man will jump down your throat too it's crazy like you talk about the Tory Lanez and they talk about how you hate the man and then when you try to give a John marant race they the ones on your head and I think it's like oh yeah this hey and it's and I think it's because it's a certain level of like being Haze like because I've been through it or because there's no Grace for hat for me I can't have Grace for another brother in my situation and that just Fosters this certain level of continuing to dehumanize one another because I was dehumanized like right I remember I tweeted out with the whole drama rant situation I tweeted out that I feel like it's for myself sabotage from all the pressure of his life changing so fast and yeah I people will up my ass like no no he should just work with it he should deal with it because he's here now we're all trying to get to that point so you should be okay with it and it's like people look at success and think that because you want it so bad anybody who has the kind of sense you want they should be okay with it and they should be fine yeah but your life changing like that and no one around you can relate to the pressure to the change that can result in you acting out because you don't know what else to do especially him being young and it's like there is a lack of empathy for people who make it because everybody thinks that oh you made it and you're making all this money so you must be better than me and you must at all times maintain the standard of better than me in every category because I'm trying to do better and it's not working for me and you know what's scary about that this is what's scary it's a dehumanization of celebrity with the most terrific terrifying part of that a celebrity has changed in our world the threshold for who is a beloved become a celebrity gets very low people start viewing you that as a niche area you have 10 000 followers on Twitter and other people who don't think you're a person you know they think you're not a human they need to perceive your followers they put the same standards on you as they put on uh on a ditty responding to drama or whatever it is I'm insane because I hear this every day anytime I mention online if I go to Route somebody I point out some negativity that I get people like why don't you just ignore it or you get all this lover blah blah blah blah like the average person I know every person I know everybody I know has some kind of trauma because they mama said something to them one time they didn't like or they daddy or a classmate or one comment could sit with you for the rest of your [ __ ] days like people will be immobilized their day that week different based on one passive aggressive comment a co-worker man but yet they act as though you because you have followers or your family you have money you somehow are less person than them and you can imperviously exactly you just could consume people [ __ ] on you at any given time and I think that is something that gets left out of the conversation and if you live in a world where we live now where people are on content over everything or regular people can try to become famous or achieve this kind of thing then we engage this world we now are broadcast dehumanizing everyone in our society and then the demon today is well you chose this yeah yeah I think yeah you're not supposed to be a human yeah when you become famous and stuff like that you're not supposed to be human you no longer are human like I I you know you know I watch basketball a lot you know see Charles Barkley say some goofy [ __ ] and I'm just sitting here just like nobody is saying everything that he did John Moran did is okay I'm not [ __ ] saying that no I'm just saying y'all talking crazy y'all want this man to be a slave what y'all talking about is insane 40 million dollar negro thing all of this it's literally it's literally insane yeah they won't even humor that multiple things can be true it was so I've never been more frustrated like I put out what I thought was the most thoughtful analysis I could I'm like y'all don't give me this much pushback when I say abolish the [ __ ] jails open the prisons and like I'm like all this brief because I'm like hey could multiple things could be true like yeah sure it's an enemy a policy they have every right to punish him if they're fine you could think it's stupid you don't have to feel sympathetic because he did it twice whatever but it can can it also still be true that there are a lot of respectability politics and need to police the black man motivating What's Happening Here could it be also true that like there are reasons why there are pressures or things he could be going through in life despite however much money he has that explains why things get out yo people who respond you're literally showing them the racist comments that people are saying you're showing it I have the problem showing them and they're like nah I don't agree with you sis cause cause he's Rich it's just something what what do you mean you don't agree with me on this thing because he's Rich he should be perfect and not to mention he's in a state where everyone has guns like we seem to like just skip over that it's this is a part of regular life for him so it's like why are people so surprised that he has a gun in Memphis has grown up in like Memphis like Kentucky like the Carolinas gun toting places I'm like so that there's no contacts for that at all like this and again people think right here and I'm like it's unreal to me that you could live in a country where they celebrate guns all the Republicans and everybody guns and patriotism all their families are looking up at every [ __ ] Christmas photo but yet you want me to believe this black boy with his legal gun this young black man in his legally owned gun with no crime committed is the end-all be all devil fool and deserves any level of punishment [ __ ] y'all like you know what I mean that is so true I'm great you brought up that the politicians itself especially the Republicans who have all their AR shotgun all the stuff kids all of that stuff that is perfectly fine ain't no energy for none of that even our own black people ain't no energy for that it's kind of like whatever but John Morant oh I got all the smoke for you is it because as we want them to be him to behave in a particular way around white folks yep yeah that the people people who are so pro-gun um you know pro-second Amendment want gun rights for everybody haven't said a thing to defend him having a little oh yeah and they're they're you know big consumers of basketball but they don't have the right thing to say in his defense because as a black man he shouldn't even have that done to begin with when we say exact Amendment right as we don't mean for him we made it for us exactly suspend him from the league we do not care he should not have that gun so that that could be what's normalized in the black community that you can't that you shouldn't be able to have what's legally allowed to you yeah it's the where's instead a signed criminality he just go ahead yeah they're talking about oh he needs to be a role model for the community and all this stuff but no other person that carries a gun is a bad role model for children like you won um you want everyone to be able to have these guns you take your kids hunting you know who is it that's being influenced by this man who has his one gun and minding his business and also I think he's influencing other black men to get a legal gun and that's the problem that's crazy right now and it's it's nuts like when you see um the level of dehumanization right because this is back to the pressure and how we could feel what do you see a lot of the animosity you see black people having firmness because it's perceived I did it you made it you should be so grateful you should be this let me just say this only with black people are black people expected to treat getting the actual rewards of their talent or their success as being grateful to some like universe pluckiness white people are never expected to be like to put the whole white community in their backward to be so grateful for the universe that they received the accolades associated with their talent why there's a black boy black man being good at sports or being able to achieve the success commensurate to their talent oh you a [ __ ] thing like they should be so grateful they made it why is this idea that like we should be so so yeah that's the motivation it's like you got it you got to look no he's talented in a way that the rest of us are not like every other athlete or whatever it is they have their individual life and goals to pursue their way and they should not have to feel like the whole [ __ ] Community feel some personal stake or anger at them about how they live in that individual life or how he's going through his 23 year old emotions or whatever the [ __ ] a black person is so lucky exactly exactly and imagine wearing that pressure on your back of people looking around you from a young boy feeling like that that's my thing yeah simply living in the gift that he has and he is making a way for himself and for his family and the rest of the the world is obviously watching him because you know we are big consumers of sports entertainment but he doesn't have the whole black community on his back like it that's just not true like he is making a way for himself and he is making a way for his family like there is no moral implications for him not following the rules on the whole black community he doesn't want to do it that's on him and that's the end of the discussion like he knows what he's supposed to do and if he doesn't want to do it there's no conversation about the type of person that he is there's no conversation on how his behavior influences young young people he's a young person himself like the only person that he needs to be accountable to is his own child who is like Hey Dad like that's my money too so like it's not right there's no there's no greater moral implication yeah he has a legal gun he's flashing it because he wants to and okay yeah people are acting like he owes them [ __ ] yes like that's the thing to kill me I'm like this man don't owe me [ __ ] I [Applause] a lot of times people take up this like uh ownership over it like as if like as if you suggested this person for a job and now they're making you look bad exactly exactly and it's always you know what I've noticed and this is something in general I feel like the black people will be most concerned about like respectability politics and trying to like like um police how about people act in certain rooms are never in the [ __ ] room they're always the ones always trying to remember somebody in the building I've never been in can't get in they have a perception of what the room looks like but they don't know yes yes that'd be the most annoying part to me is the fact that like go ahead go ahead no I was saying that was that's the thing they do all the time like I can't tell you how many times I've seen black people online tweeting at me that my hair shouldn't be red or my nail shouldn't look like I can't do the thing they watch me do they watching me on the news telling me I can't in this particular way or you can't this you can't you see me you know what I'm saying I know I know y'all seen I know y'all saw the discourse and unfortunately this apparently I think took place in my state the whole dentist [ __ ] like not being able to wear a bonnet house shoes and [ __ ] I'm like look hey there's some people literally argue people down here my hair my hair is long you know sometimes I got my Afro out and stuff like that and sometimes I'm gonna like if I get my wisdom teeth pulled out or some [ __ ] I might wear a [ __ ] Bonnet you gonna do it you rip my teeth the [ __ ] out or do a root snap this is the goofiest [ __ ] ever addictions not everyone wants to worry about it in public that's cool that's fine what bothers me are some of the ones who don't wear bonnets projecting such anti-black rhetoric on those who do I have had my comments full of black women calling me all kind of cockroach ghetto ratchet trash cause I said we should be able to have we should be able to receive Health Care no matter how we look if you don't want to look a certain way that's cool but to look at somebody who looks like you and in your mind you classify them as trash as a roach because you know what it is I promise you they are what I realized about about responsibility politics so the same things the same phenomenon we've experienced earlier with other things we've been talking about is when people feel like they have had to experience something or they felt like they had to be confined to a certain they had to play a certain game or have certain rules and post on them they thought they had to do that to be in the system they have so much resentment and animosity towards anybody they perceive as not operating within the rules that they felt you know yeah so they cannot because I have it's always people it's you know listen Twitter and Instagram are totally different worlds like demographic wise people on Twitter to recently I think Facebook the thing pieces on Twitter is because Twitter's a bunch of college people is J Cole listeners versus Gucci Mane listeners if we don't win Instagram versus Twitter right when you think about what you're seeing right but when you see Twitter is that all in a black and black always wear everybody the black people are going going hard for no gangster respect to believe politics in the bonus but you go on Instagram and the people who the respectability politics are there to hold the ones fading for it in the shade room comments like when I saw and I bought everything going so hard and every one of them I click on is a working class person who would be excluded from these rooms and all this [ __ ] that they talking about based on the the standards and that they're trying to keep and that's what I realized it's like people feeling resentful like who the [ __ ] are you to go and go and wear your body and think that you're still going to be successful or respected when I couldn't do it yeah yeah 2017 I started this hashtag you could you could look it up right now durags in public and delivery is because I my hair was my hair was long for a long time like that's all anyone had known me for and then I cut off all my hair right and I remember going out in a durag and people looking at me crazy and I was like what is the big deal like there's literally designer durags so it's like it's not like this is just meant to stay in the house I don't understand and I started this hashtag and yeah and it's like people you see people like going out and so many people shared their stories with me where they like they wanted to wear that the durag to just put out the hashtag and take a picture of all that stuff but they actually were getting looks in public people asking them why they're wearing that like it's just crazy man and now to see where it's gotten especially with durags I think durags is a lot more acceptable yeah than bonnets but on that note Jack Harlow last week took a picture wearing a bionic and took pictures with fans and it was just like oh Jack Harlow where's up on it like it wasn't what is he doing out in public with this it was oh [ __ ] like so I'm just it's just very confusing a spark difference in the comments yeah and I think that is all about again internalized anti-blackness right because there's a reason we impose the instructions we had a hierarchy amount of because the reason why we left my black man off the hooks but do rocks before we let black women in their bonnets off the hook and it's the reason how we see these things because I saw a lot of comments of women being like Oh you could wear a scarfing but not a bonnet why because the Bonnet is black because it's just more right I'm gonna take off some satin to put on some other satin yeah right yeah like yeah I I over here like like for instance I had a situation right where uh I was at an event um always it was a wedding and it was the day before we was helping set up and um I just kind of basically got my hair done so I was wearing my Bonnet there was no reason for my hair to be out or not like that and I'm putting stuff up and uh somebody there was just like like do you always wear that so what kind of question is that [ __ ] I think I wear when the [ __ ] I want to like what kind of what is no this is my first time like what is this man talking to me about my Bonnet and then the Bonnet that I have is kind of like purplish pink or whatever a lot of violence do not come in God colors or whatever and I also don't care they don't care and so I did that and he was just asking all these questions I think it's a little strange that you uh sweating them another man over this this is kind of oh what's actually going on here and then also here in my apartment so like at my apartment this you know white lady at the front desk she said something that was so interesting to me and I just didn't know what she thought I was gonna say to her she was just like you gotta just be you're just so confident confident like what are you talking about she was just like oh yeah you know the thing on your head like what are you talking about what do you mean like this is the thing that has a function that goes on my head I don't understand this conversation I think you're trying to be nice I don't know what you're trying to do but I don't really take it in the way that you think I'm supposed to take it it's weird maybe oh yeah don't even get me it's very much I didn't know what to say to her I think I said something just like okay and I just walked away because I'm just like what exactly what am I supposed to say to this I got this hair on my hand do you not know very many black people are you confused are you talking about the color of it I mean there's so many different levels here to what you could be talking about but the fact that people will come up to you have the address of you over it and I don't even know you and then it shocked when you give them a little bit of smoke yes because one thing we're gonna have is the audacity people always think that's something I've recognize people always think you need an explanation for doing anything overtly black it added something I I realized if someone asked me in me doing this as the second only in friends someone said to me on Twitter I feel like it was racist or that you went out of your way to get everybody black and I said blocked if a white person named the show Becky and friends and six white people was up there that makes sense to you that white girl have all the white friends every watch is it's explanation to you to have a group of black people you know or you feel like you you're so shocked that there isn't a token wiper there's at least one white person there because you are taught to believe that whiteness should always have a seat at the table white men should be present it is the default this is a deviation and I think what happens is we internalize that ourselves and we we portray it out in every other aspect of ours Society like you see a black person doing some black oh don't worry about that yeah but my thing is like how are people not cognizant of the fact that they're realizing that this is blacker than usual you know what I mean like I remember seeing a commercial like a a Serial commercial years ago and it was a black man white woman light-skinned daughter and I noticed it and I'm like the fact that I noticed this means it does not happen that often so like right when you recognize something like that and it's abnormal to you why aren't you questioning the opposite why am I not seeing more of this why is this such a rarity oh my goodness because this reminds me the whole conversation of like forced diversity the people losing their mind because they see a singular black person in a commercial and then they'll literally say crazy things like there's no more white people at commercial I literally see this and people are dead [ __ ] serious and so to go back to what Olay will say I had an interesting thing happen when I was in college or whatever so I'm sitting there you know chopping it up with my cohort or whatever and they found out that I'm in a black fraternity or whatever and they looked at this person looked at me like I just committed a crime he was just like don't you think that's counterproductive I hate when they say that [Music] I'm [ __ ] confused what you mean by kind of I was so taken aback I didn't even understand what the [ __ ] and I was just like what do you mean it was just like it's a black only fraternity no the [ __ ] it's not I have white what if there was a light only for eternity yeah it's great months like it's the stupidest [ __ ] argument it's stupid in the world he was like that I I went to school I went to grad school with him for two years I didn't think he was that type of person and it was just so embarrassing and ridiculous and I'm like do you know why black fraternities exist do you know why black universities exist y'all wouldn't let us speak to the people that look like me and you over here blowing at me for people that look like you and saying that we like we're somehow invented the separation or Gaslight delineation it's like just something crazy and then some some people were looking at me like I'm like because I was like educating him and I was getting really [ __ ] annoyed and people around me were just like whoa calm down it's just an honest thing I don't know like nobody really is crazy and I'm just sitting here like he made an accusation that I'm self-segregating when I went to a university a pwy like what are you saying I'm surrounded by white people at all times I was on a track team full of white people I was literally there's only two black people on my track team wow that's why you know it's white here's the thing here's what I think is important right like because they must always be centered and this is well conversation me and you were even having an early this week about just like I truly believe in ignoring white people like I really on on certain respects because the fact that they ask you the question is a reflection of them feeling entitled to you answering them responding to their needs and sending them because we can't ask no other group to explain to us why they do [ __ ] within their community we can't do that there's only them they only only with us and the problem is we take the same responses because we're so used to them doing that that's what it means to have whiteness centered and white privilege and white entitlement we do it ourselves we're constantly responding back to other black people that aren't doing and go excuse me what are you doing not thinking about what white people are gonna say thank you yeah you can't do that in front of NASA you can't do that in front of me at the Bowl party oh you're not gonna be like we do it to this one we do that we always do it yeah yeah excuse me I got you like you being like you're misbehaving by not taking into consideration white thought white feeling White Center and what I realize is is something why even like why I created Olay and friends I'm like in real life I talk to nothing but black people are not they love to treat you especially I think when you're a public figure you're a media person they love to make you feel like you are so special you're such a hard fan you're a needle in a haystack you know there's a scarcity of Black Talent and that's why they could only ever have one of us in the room because they can't find any others meanwhile in real life I know nothing but Dynamic black people in every field all across the place who are and who are able to have all these conversations because we live a very political life right like not all of us are commentators Jason is a damn archaeologist on this call you know like we do all kinds of other things right but they don't let us they they never let us just have those best things where we have those conversations where we could be around the people we would talk to who we would be in community and then you realize when we talk about issues we have lots of political deep nuanced conversations about things that affect us and our community without ever thinking of or centering whiteness because why would we it's not actually the default or centered in our life but whenever we are larger on the macro they want us to live for the white view the white perspective the white gays and that's what I find frustrating yeah so true y'all thank y'all we have had the longest but we'll let me just chat I am so glad I'm so glad you'll joined me for my second episode of Olay in France thank you also Marlon thanks for having me absolutely Marlin I've been following you since like high school I think you I want you to think I found you on Twitter Fame I've been following you since he was making things you're making today thank you thank you I appreciate that so many yeah I think uh your dollar been working yeah that skate that nightscape is failing yeah you might pick up the phone in the other room [ __ ] this [ __ ] all up there's one of those free trials you get out the cereal
