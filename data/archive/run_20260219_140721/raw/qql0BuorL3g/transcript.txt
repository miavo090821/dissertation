what's up guys sean here and today we're doing part two of joe rogan ruining Adam ruins everything but before we get started I want to give a special thank you to everybody who moved over to my second channel dude monkey HQ it took me a really long time to get a thousand subscribers on this channel that you're watching right here so I appreciate it so much that so many of you jumped over there and gave me that boost to start out on my media channel going forward my non-political media stuff will be over on that channel I will continue the Game of Thrones Season eight review series on that channel so if you're interested in that go over there and subscribe and I will be uploading that probably the same day that this video comes out now that we got all the housekeeping stuff out of the way let's get into the actual topic in our last video we covered the first half of this segment of Joe Rogan's interview of Adam ruins everything we're really gonna go through like a cultural change on how we think about that you know it's it's morphing so quickly a sports with trans athletes who are you know competing with the you know with their gender right that's a that is a sporting world that I'm more interested in right and I think we should find a way to make that happen now in my last video I pointed out that Adam was clearly taking the politically correct position even though he knew it wasn't factually correct or based on the evidence and that's why Joe Rogan was so easily able to pick his position apart with basic follow-up questions however the part that I left out was my position on trans athletes competing against their gender now although I have mentioned this in a previous video that was a really long time ago so I decided to reiterate that position now so you know what my position is because I think the solution is so simple it's kind of absurd that it's not already implemented and that solution is men's sports should be anybody who can actually qualify sports now the reason for this is pretty obvious men's sports are generally more competitive than female sports they have the better athletes and there's no real reason to protect men from somebody transitioning from a woman to a man because that's not uniquely unfair also I've always been of the belief that if a woman can compete with the men whether she's trans do or just a normal woman then she should be allowed to compete with the men because if a woman can throw 95 and get outs on the major league level the Mets need the bullpen help now on the flip side I would limit female sports to only biological females the only reason that female sports brackets exist is because generally women cannot compete on the same field with men especially if it's a physical sport as pointed out in my last video the sciences in biology hasn't changed the facts have been in for a long time and it's not fair to force women to compete against people who were born men female sports should only be for biological women who have not transitioned that's what they're designed for that's what they've always been designed for and allowing male to female transgender completely undermines their purpose and function one thing is you know your postulating a particular person who decided to transition at the age of 30 right and they were very big and strong before right and they decide to transition at being trans it's just a way that people are right they're just people who are trans you know and this is something that we're gonna accept and support right you're seeing folks transition much much earlier age you know there's so but then and and so if someone is if someone is you know transitioning from the age of like you know 7 years old right and you know working with those hormones you know from that age right they're not gonna have you know that their body situation would be very different than the one that you that you postulated right um there's no reason to give kids hormones and there's no reason to decide before a person's frontal lobe is completely completely fully developed which doesn't even take place to look 25 now once Adam completely lost the biological advantage argument he try to segue into children transitioning to argue that when they grew up and became athletes they wouldn't have those same advantages however what Adam unfortunately didn't realize he was about to step into was that children transitioning is a non-starter for joe rogan and then they began to argue about that and this is where adam completely lost it the research I've seen is that trans kids from a young age they are incredibly consistent in their what you know when they're expressing the gender identity and a big general is in that and a lot of human beings now when Adam realizes that he's giving an anecdote he then jumps to say oh well I've seen studies that I can't quite name that children are remarkably consistent when they express their gender identity the problem with that is that's complete nonsense and in fact studies show the exact opposite of what Adam is presenting in fact the only studies that show that children are very consistent with their gender identity from a young age have very small sample sizes or taken well into the future where people are asked to reflect on their past choices who are already transgender so all those studies really show are that people who have gone through transition as adults when thinking back had those same feelings for a long time they don't show that children are conscious and able to make these choices when they're children they just show that the people who have made the choices as adults would have liked to have done it as children so big generals in that and a lot of human beings yeah yeah but that's that's fits this narrative by saying they're incredibly consistent boy if you polled these people like what are you talking about like a few I mean that's I look I don't have the research in front of me that I saw so I can't like go into the details on it but like yeah was I mean was you know it was research that was surveying and tracking like trans kids who declared right and be from a young age did it change the answer was generally no it really didn't and you know I have a friend who has a who has a trans kid don't know the kids exact age but you know in the age range that we're talking about and you know he's explained that like well you know my child from a very young age consistently like said I am a girl like and has never contradict themselves never changed their mind what I love about this part is that jørgen just ask some basic follow-up questions and Adam completely abandoned his data and he moved on to his friend his friend that has a trans kid in the age range that we're talking about and Adams like my friend says that their kid who is either seven eight nine or maybe ten at the maximum because this is the nature of the conversation at this point has been incredibly consistent the humane thing and the thing that he felt was going to do as a parent was to like embraced that choice on his child's part right and yeah that's the embrace of choice meaning hormonal II I shouldn't even phrase it as a choice like like embrace that identity but it is a choice right I mean if I'm choosing to add hormones to a child's body that's a choice it's it's that it's a choice on the point on the part of the parent it's not a choice in the on the on the part of the child and if you needed another red flag that shows that you should not trust Adam Conover when it comes to this topic this is it all of a sudden Adams like well I shouldn't call it a choice because trans people exist that's just the way they are it's not a choice how could I even say it's a choice that's horrible and Joe Rogan just knocks that down because clearly it's a choice and it's a choice on behalf of the parents the other thing I was gonna say is that I do know also among the trans folks that I know are the trans people who speak about this that I've heard so many of them say I wish I had access I knew this about myself at a very young age and I wish to God that I had that we had I had had the ability to receive you know these hormones at a young age there are people that have gone through transition surgery and said I wish to God that I never did this there's a lot of those people too so if you're looking for anecdotal evidence and you want to be objective you kind of have to I'm sure Joe Rogan immediately smacks this point aside as it is in fact an anecdote and it should be pointed out that just because a child of seven eight or nine has never backtracked on their gender identity that doesn't mean you should start chemically transitioning them because they could still backtrack in the future from their gender identity who they feel they really are I'm all for you doing whatever you want to do when you're an adult when your mind is formed but people change their mind they change their opinion they change their thoughts some will in some world and the ones who won't they always have the option to do something later on in life but if you do something too hormonal II block a child very very early on there's no turning back from that remember we are speaking of a child and children who haven't even hit puberty yet so the idea that we should allow them to completely alter their lives and sterilize themselves based on their wins and not our adult better judgment is ridiculous but you have to address the fact that there are people that have gone through transition surgery and said I wish to god that I never did this I'm very curious and this is what I go consult my friend or my recent interview set to print Anna Hills work on this to see how many see how many are in each group right now which which which sets of these folks are the outliers now there's a little bit of a back-and-forth here about which group there are more of in terms of numbers and I'm not really a fan of this conversation but it does lead to my absolute favorite question of this entire segment way that being is it worth it being gay isn't a choice yeah okay but if that's who they are if they think that they're a girl why do you have to give them hormones to make them more of a girl because I'm sorry can you expand on the question it's a simple question if you say that the child thinks it's a girl so you're gonna give the child hormones mm-hmm if the child thinks it's a girl let it be a girl like you don't have why you adding hormones that clip is amazing and it should be shown on the internet from this day till the end of time that was such a basic and beautiful question and Adams inability to answer is the mantra t'v of all the problems with the modern day left you see the modern left is not prepared to debate a single topic and when you can't virtue signal your way out of a situation or call the person asking questions or trying to debate you a bigot they're done they can't do anything you see Joe Rogan with this one question revealed that both of these people purport to be in favor of transgender people and transgender children to a certain extent but Joe Rogan is the only one with a rational view on transgender children while Adam has a deeply ideological one I feel like if a child thinks they're a girl let them live as a girl but you don't have to hormonal II engage with their body with chemicals it just seems crazy it seems ill-advised this seems to me to be a leap and that you're making this leap to confirm your ideology and to confirm that you know you're a hundred percent cool with trans people and you're 100 percent cool and you you're gonna recognize this child is but you're doing something you're doing something to this child's body that you can't turn around and if this child decides at whatever age we decide that you can make rational decisions to transition as trans let them fully develop first let them be a person Rogen is not against what is called a social transition when it comes to young children child says that they're a girl they're very consistent on the fact that they are being a girl but they're too young for procedures and hormones so they are allowed to just live as a girl but if they ever change their mind it's like you know take off the dress and you're totally fine conversely Adam believes that children at the age of seven can decide to permanently alter their body on a biological level based on his political ideology despite the numerous and negative consequences because according to Adam trans kids are amazingly consistent and if they're not you know that's just an outlier so so what if that kid got sterilized and their body got ruined now the problem for Adam is that he lives in a bubble where everybody thinks that that is okay and that is the correct position and everybody who doesn't think that is OK Adam sees as just generally against transgenders as a whole but people like Joe Rogan and I put myself in that camp don't really care what people do with their bodies when they're adults and they don't really care how so much you decide to raise your child except when it comes to the point you're doing something that would permanently damage that child because the fact is regardless of how you feel about gender or transgenderism there is no reason you should ever transition a child and there are a million reasons that you shouldn't and I'm gonna give you two very good reasons you shouldn't do this whether or not the child decides that later in adulthood they want a backtrack or go forward with their gender transition number one if your child decides to backtrack they regret the transition later you are making the decision to sterilize your child before they hit puberty that's awful and horrific number two even if the child as an adult decides that they want to go forward they don't want a backtrack and have the procedure especially for male to female transgender 'z if you prevent them from going through puberty without getting too graphic for you guys there actually isn't enough material because it doesn't grow enough to have that procedure to change it to the other organ so effectively what Adams position is is that because he wants to see transgender kids normalized in the future we should allow kids to transition chemically even though that could have very negative consequences no matter what they decide in the future again I stated in my first video Adam ruins everything is supposed to be a show that puts facts over everything but here you have Adam Conover taking an absurd position for ideological reasons based on anecdotes and that's why Adam can't stand up to the smallest amount of scrutiny and follow-up questions Joe Rogan is a cool guy I like his show I like him but the dude is not a tough interviewer you shouldn't be stuttering and stammering this much with these basic questions but Adams not used to being on his own he's not used to being questioned like this especially when he takes an ultra progressive position so that's why he fell apart in this part of the interview but what evidence do we know what evidence do we have that this is a powerful absolute like intelligent smart way to handle a child's life over the long term like when these kids grow to be 60 as opposed to kids who don't get the the hormone shots when they're six these people are 15% more happy there's nothing like that but yet people are jumping into it because it seems like the thing to do I do think that when we're talking about an issue that affects those people right the first thing we should do is listen to those people again the facts that evidence guy who's supposed to go against conventional wisdom and what people feel is true tries appealing to what transgender people feel in order to get out of this argument first thing we should do is listen to those people right so the children listen to the children and listen to the adults right who said I used to be that child okay you know but they are not that child and you know to you say look everyone's different so for them to say I was that child that's nonsense you were a similar child in a similar situation you were not but they don't know how that child is feeling this is an excellent point by broken transgender people who say I was that kid are not literally that kid and therefore should not be allowed to make judgments about that kid they may have empathy for that kid they may be able to see themselves within that kid but that doesn't mean that they are an authority on that kids experience look so I all I can do is defer to the experts that that I know about this right I'm not an expert on the subject right so it's just sort of my off the top of my head look it's fine to say you don't know something you don't have all the information and then ask to move on to another topic but Adam doesn't do that when backed into a corner he says he doesn't know when he doesn't have the research in front of him but then he throws out claim after claim based on his leftist talking points as I pointed out many times these are not tough questions from Joe Rogan yet he completely pom belong this subject so much so that Adam reverts back to we should include transgender people in this conversation we really can't speak on this because we're not transgender and we should appeal to the humanity of transgender individuals when we're taught when you and I are talking about this right now we're speaking pretty hypothetically right we're talking about a child that is not in the room that we don't have we're talking about a fictional trial right so what we really care about are the actual people right and when we talk to the actual trans folks right and talk to you know say hey what do you think you know how do you feel and you know include them in the conversation I think we have a different conversation about it you know as I've said in my previous video nobody is debating the humanity of transgender people that's an absurd talking point that lets us use to get out of arguments when they don't have the facts on their side it is a rhetorical trick meant to virtue signal to lefties and it's meant to shut down the current conversation when it's not going well for you I think the reason that this podcast and the clips associated with it got so much attention is because Adam and his show present him as his truth teller somebody who's above the fray and seeing somebody like Adam who's on the show that's so tightly edited in a long-form setting completely fall apart and reveal himself to not be above the fray to be clearly on the left side of the political spectrum on a lot of these issues it allows us to view his show with this new context going forward especially when he's covering political topics anyway that's all I really have for you guys today
