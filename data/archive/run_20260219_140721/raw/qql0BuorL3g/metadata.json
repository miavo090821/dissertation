  "description": "Music: www.purple-planet.com\nIn this video I continue my discussion on Adam Conover, the host of TruTV's show Adam Ruins Everything. I continue where I left off on the discussion on sports, then move on to the subject Adam decided to bring up. I explain why I don't think this was a good move for Adam, & why I believe this part of the interview reveals more about Adam's thought process than any other part.\nSupport me on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/SeanFitzgerald\nPaypal: https://www.paypal.me/Iamsean90\nSupport me on Subscribe Star: https://www.subscribestar.com/seanfitzgerald\nGab: https://gab.com/Iamsean90\nTwitter https://twitter.com/iamsean90 \nBackup Twitter https://twitter.com/AJWSean\nSecond Channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/DudeMonkeyHQ\n\nSources: Sources: \nOriginal Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcAPU6paCxo&t=208s\n\nStudy analysis: http://www.sexologytoday.org/2016/01/do-trans-kids-stay-trans-when-they-grow_99.html\n\nPrevious ARE Response: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEWJIHuD1uI\n\n#ARE #JoeRogan #IamSean90\n\nFAIR USE NOTICE\nThis video may contain copyrighted material; the use of which has not been specifically authorized by the copyright owner.
