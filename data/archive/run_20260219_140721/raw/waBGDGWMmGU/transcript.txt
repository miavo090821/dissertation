I had a couple things written down from Hassan like I said he disagreed with me bringing up the dprk or or um had some disagreements about the dprk so I'm right now uh trying to create an effort on Twitter to get myself on Hassan [ __ ] show and on Tik Tok so go to our Tik Tok um and tag Hassan [ __ ] or go to our Twitter under the um the Tweet where I'm trying to get his attention and tag him tell him to have me on the show for a discussion uh so we could talk about the dprk and you know areas of of agreement so um hopefully I'll handle the dprk thing with Hassan but what I wanted to bring up here was uh um this this guy cam asks me how do you set prices in um a nationalized Health Care system or in a socialist Health Care system and Hassan answers what I answered when we reacted to the the Jubilee middleground episode on the midwestern marks YouTube I said you set them based on cost you have people pay um for the healthcare services what they actually cost to produce rather than paying what they cost plus what it takes to pay the profits of shareholders and and giant pharmaceutical companies which is what we play pay now which greatly inflates prices and then Hassan even brings up a video of uh medical prices being negotiated in in China and showing how they do it so I thought we could check that out can I can I real quick just was he trying to say like economic calculation Pro that thing Jesus yes that's their only argument how do people still believe in that in 2023 it's hard to believe by the way I I I I wonder here if uh if this motivated uh future Homestead is calling our friend your Ratatouille the only Jewish person on this uh panel is getting called a rat I don't appreciate that what's going on future Homestead I expect more of you than these debased racist jokes now I'm just [ __ ] with you future Homestead is anti-Semitic confirmed the midwestern marks audience is anti-Semitic as a Jew wait till they find out Noah is Jewish they're gonna stop watching up in a sec to keep their income under a certain level so they can collect a certain amount of you know government money to be taken away and we have a problem in this country where 45,000 people are dying every single year because they don't have access to basic health insurance and I think if we were to nip that in the butt and nationalize those giant pharmaceutical companies and make sure that that Healthcare is provided to every we would actually also as far as novel chemical compound development goes uh the overwhelming majority of publicly funded research contributes to that dramatically and every other country with socialized Healthcare systems and uh uh better uh publicly like more uh ease of access to public institutions all the way up to college unironically perform better than the United States of America in per capita novel chemical compound development America obviously beats the rest of the world in totality because we have a [ __ ] ton of people here and a [ __ ] ton of brain drain however when you look at those metrics European countries still beat America on novel chemical compound development per capita which means that they make more with less those are less costly initiatives for the most part and they yield better results so it's not even efficient they stimulate a lot of innovation a lot of Labor and a lot of hard work in this country because people would be less bogged down by medical bills and would be more healthy in general so without a market if those are if those farmal industry specifically is nationalized how does the state set prices effectively um before you get to that point do you want to say what do you mean wa what it doesn't make any sense how does he think this happens in China it doesn't make any sense they just think they just believe in the economic calculation problem like it's a Dogma right they claim no no no you can't set prices based on cost no no no the you know even though there are all sorts of countries who do this in practice you know those aren't aren't real you because of e the economic calculation problem we can't nationalize anything otherwise there won't be prices yes there will be you just charge based on cost and it's not like the Market Per Se totally goes away there's still goods and services being exchanged meaning there's still Supply and there's still demand which is what the neoc classicals claim is the setter of prices um so this argument doesn't make any any sense not only that giant conglomerates do this all the time like within the the the the ECP was flawed when it came out but the fact that we've had computers capable of giving people inputs uh for like 50 years uh and they've been used for that long just makes it seem silly and makes them seem ideological like every economy of scale is planned period the question is who is doing the planning and in whose interests y by cost by how much it cost that's it like what do you what do you mean oh that's great that he got it right yeah that's great good good to the developers and and that's how you do it and he's also a little bit confused like I was like what do you even mean you mean how do you set price it's it's only if you believe in this dogmatic idea of the ECP there are no prices under you know a nationalized system that you would even think that there is literally oh I think this is the video that I know you're going to point yeah here here it is here's how China negotiates his drug prices after three initial offers in the farmerette what a government that actually seeks the best interest of people looks like but this is also similar to I don't have a I don't have authorization for a lower price official says 4.62 per pill I feel there are still there's still some room left with such a big Market in China I will give you five minutes to call your CEO for a price by the way this isn't even this is like if I'm not mistaken this is literally not the state nationalized uh uh pharmaceutical company this is a pharmaceutical company from a European or American pharmaceutical corporation that wants to enter the Chinese market this bargaining process occurs in every country we did not need to use a Chinese example for this we can use an example from every other country with the exception of the United States of America every single country on the [ __ ] planet in every single developing nation in every single developed Nation every single nation across the board this bargaining this bargaining agreement occurs before a drug enters the marketplace America is the only country where this process that you are watching doesn't have to be China okay remember imagine these guys are white and imagine they're speaking not a scary language like Mandarin but instead a a language that you understand like American English okay well not American English but Canada Amica actually well Canada has negotiations as well pharmaceutical price negotiations so yeah imagine if they're speaking English in the UK UK English oo not scary they're they're white now okay they're white and they're speaking in English in the UK and it's like oh I proba you want this [ __ ] medicine the [ __ ] Market yeah and then the other guy's like oh no mate my CEO told me I can't [ __ ] send this drug into the market in it it's too low of a priz and the guy's like you want a [ __ ] license you better call up your CEO mate and [ __ ] tell them we're not buying unless it's cheaper and then they go like [ __ ] no all right in it what about my profit incentive and then the guy goes we know you're making profit it doesn't [ __ ] matter it's going to sell like [ __ ] hot [ __ ] yeah and then boom all of a sudden they arrive at a point they arrive at a price point that is more manageable and that's how you keep pharmaceutical prices low in every other country with the exception of the United States of America where that process is illegal with the exception of the uh with the VA which Obama changed on his way out and that's slowly started to sneak into like insulin I guess but the reality is that uh it's illegal uh to do pharmaceutical uh price negotiations in the United States of America so awesome yeah right I mean he's hilarious uh but not wrong the idea that this is like the prices that they're paying are just magically worked out by this Market is just beyond silly you know like oh people all say well no we don't think we'll pay the 562 and they're like well [ __ ] what are we gonna do I mean what are we gonna do Governor right like uh Jesus Christ I don't understand how otherwise intelligent people just shut their brains off and go yeah that must be how it works Works uh the you know these corporations are just like whatever people want we give it at that price that is a silliest way of doing it prices are set before you buy anything there's production costs labor cut like all that goes into it yeah and I mean I I think the vast majority of so I was looking through the comments and and trying to like categorize them as as best as I could on the original Jubilee video and there seems to be different sorts of comments there's the comments that are just using racist stereotypes against malumo um which we talked about that when he was on I hadn't seen the comments yet I saw him after I was like holy [ __ ] he was [ __ ] right as [ __ ] um there's the comments that are like uh kind of like praising Eddie and and you know saying that the Communist side won and then there's the comments that are are like telling Jubilee how they could do these sorts of debates better whether it's like letting them last longer and most most people are used to listening to podcast or um doing things like letting people bring in stats and notebooks and all these other things and making it explicit that they can do that so I I think that the reception was pretty good guys we are in the USA we have had billions of dollars spent by our government to make us as anti-communist as possible the fact that Eddie and malumo and other people can go on to defend communism communism in front of millions of people people and the reception is not 99% negative is a huge [ __ ] win the reception has been I want to say largely positive to our side and then it gets picked up by people by Hassan who you know I don't watch him but every time I've seen him it almost seems like he's getting better and better and better as time goes by which is the natural tendency of people who study um and then hundreds of thousands of millions of people see it through him I don't know how big his audience is so it's I I I think if we step back and we look at what this represents in terms of like the transformation of the social consciousness of the American people is incredible I don't think we have ever been in US history at a time quite like our own where so many people especially Young Folks are open to the ideas of Communism and debating them openly in forums such as these exactly and it's getting harder to reject our arguments right it's getting harder to deny partially because of the growth um of a socialist superpower like China and everything that they've been able to accomplish as our buddy Diego rousar and says it makes it a lot easier to argue for communism or China's making it easy because you know they can like when the the economic calculation problem first came about in like the early 1920s um Von me's was saying you know there there could be no economic calculation ever it's impossible to to calculate a socialist economy period trust me and not we can pull up a video of them calculating prices in China and negotiating prices in China and be like what are you talking about Mr cam Higby what do you mean you can't calculate prices they're literally doing it as Hassan said not even just in China but in every country in the world because we're the only country that doesn't have um any form of of Public Health Care or any kind of Public Health Care system so socialism is becoming undeniable right because what communism is is the real movement of history and Marxist theory is is actually you know a blueprint for building a a a superior economic system to capitalism that actually takes care of of the people and allows them to flourish rather than exploiting them for more and more and more profit and we're seeing that reality we're seeing it with the Cuban Health Care System we're seeing it with China's overall Economic Development we're seeing it with the belt and Road initiative right and and it's becoming undeniable that socialism is a superior system to capitalism and we're getting more and more and more and more Young Americans who know their Theory who know their [ __ ] who know their history who know the history of existing socialist countries and they can no longer be lied to by this imperialist propaganda voice crack not only are they immune to the imperialist propaganda themselves are largely immune you know I guess none of us are fully immune but not only do they have the the theoretical background deconstructed themselves but they're teaching it to others and they're explaining it to others and then people are are growing up um with alternative information and alternative narratives about communism that the Boomer or Boomers and older Generations never got because communism was completely ripped out of Academia out of entertainment media and out of the news media so we're moving in the right direction folks and that's why Hassan [ __ ] needs to have me on his show Absolutely and and here's the thing um China the example no one second I I I was talking I thought I was I was though that's all fine in Dand Yeti but that voice crack was beta so it ruin it's a red pill moment of of the
