The fact he has 10s of thousands everyday watching him engage with the modern worlds conflict of capitalism vs socialism is one of the best methods of getting our ranks up.\n\nHe may not be a good fit for more radical members who have already done years in school learning it all, or are more boots on ground activists in the fight, but he is also a staunch support of alot of programs that he donates to, if he cant be a more boots on ground fighter, he atleast uses his privilage to help fund causes that he agrees with and encourages other to do the same.",

That would depend entirely on every other detail of how society is run, what the new laws and constitution permitted, etc. It would be very susceptible to the influence of moneyed interests the same way people are tricked into voting against their best interests under capitalism today. At a small scale like a worker owned co-op it is possible for it to work when everybody is given all of the behind-the-scenes details and numbers and everyone is invested in the same outcome. Add a large scale it probably does not work. You might be able to have local Democratic control within the guidelines of higher level controls.",

    "text": "I think a issue with the jubilee video was that it sometimes sounded like China vs USA and i think maybe it would have been more beneficial to go away from that and talk about the socialist policies in norway for example, especially when the capitalist side sometimes brought some of these countries up as good capitalist examples, when in reality a big reason on why Quality of Life is so high there is because of government regulations and social policies that restrict Capitalism\n\nAnd a lot of the times it seemed like the Capitalists in the Jubilee video blamed everything wrong in for example china or Cuba on Communism and maybe that needed some pushback so that a viewer just picks that up and realizes that a lot of the shortcomings of the „communist“ countries are not because of communism but because of other factors like the Embargo on Cuba for example. Also the fact that they constantly went for civil liberties being restricted in dictatorships as being a communism issue.\nI mean the capitalists in the video would not be susceptible to counterarguments there i am sure but it would maybe have been good to still give them to educate viewers in that regard and not let the capitalists run those talking points and pocket the viewers on those things.\n\nAll in all i think you did really well and with all due respect to the capitalists in the video but in my opinion the communists looked a lot smarter and well learned here.",
