this is not a conversation this is a commemoration why the reason why we believe what Kendrick is saying is because we believed it first it was the culture and people who believed it about him and Kendrick is just speaking to people Kendrick didn't go at his bars Kendrick went at his person his character he said he want that dead battle is revealing that he never fit in because the same guys that he thought he was cool with are the ones that are turning on it Kendrick was making disc records for Drake but also for what Drake embodies Kendrick is is protecting the culture right now Drake is like a Madden game he just slightly changes every year without adding any substance but I feel like at this stage of the game when you have made it when what is the excuse for you to be this way anymore [Applause] hello beautiful black people hi it's by the way but hi I I promised that I was going to reconvene the group uh and we've had an eventful weekend I'm actually not convinced that we're not going to have a eventful night like I'm waiting for Kendrick to drop at any moment like but yeah we we are here to duno in in a formal way I I expect Tahoe to be fighting for his life trying to act for battle and as y'all can see look at Tahoe's lighting look at Taho have a mic I am ready to have this conversation with you beautiful black people this is not a conversation this is a commemoration this is a this is a eulogy are y'all going to actually show that much respect to the dead no no [ __ ] the Dead wait did did Tahoe did Tahoe pick Drake in all of this yes Taho oh my God no no hey hey hey my dude easy buddy let's let's be clear let's be clear what I said was we don't know how Drake is going to respond we don't know and we didn't know that's what I said as of last week I knew Kendrick what powers he had I was very aware of what he was capable of and I must say that each and every one of you had to be just as Blown Away by Kendrick's response as I was oh yeah oh yeah real quick I'm sorry random thing you're like not centered I don't know if that's bothering anyone else no he's doing he's doing a third of the screen style thing I think first off thank you for having me in this space and secondly I think that also like I think everybody we've been talking about this beef possibly happening for like almost a decade at this point like since since control you know everybody thought it was basically just going to be aggressive aggressive aggressive and I thought the way Kendrick has pretty much created an experience out of every TR I did not expect meet the Grahams was completely out of left field for me I did not expect something so chill Drake to yeah oh yeah Def and and and what was even more out of left field I think and probably bringing it up to what's happened in the last couple days is I did not expect the fumble on the Heart part six that hard like I thought I not that the B Sharp line is the worst bar I have heard in like 10 [ __ ] years dog that's like that's like maor shut the it's so [ __ ] like that's like a high schooler just decided like hey be and sharp oh I can't wait to write this scheme in my little notebook that's like so [ __ ] bad dude and a ghost a if a ghost riter wrote that for him you need to fire that [ __ ] now I I so I expected the Heart part six to be horrible when I saw it because like Jake Drake doesn't have Drake isn't good enough and his Ghost Riders aren't good enough to prepare something useful in that short period of time it's just not it's just not a thing clearly go ahead no no I was saying starting with the heart um part six and not you know talking about Kendrick drop right before it I I don't know I think maybe we save the best for last no no we have to because anything Drake dropped was going to be received in the light of not like us like anything like let's talk about not like us cuz oh my God that [ __ ] a banger like that that [ __ ] SL so hard bro I was at dinner with my wife and it was like our first like dinner out in however many weeks date night kids at the [ __ ] grandmother's house and we're talking about what had happened the night before and I'm lowkey like down cuz everybody took the grams like a the end of a bad movie I wasn't feeling it and so then I get a text Shout Out who who U this is a tribute to Anthony fantano who also dressed for a eulogy um the night of and he is like Kendrick Dro Kendrick Dro I'm like oh [ __ ] and I tell my wife baby Kendrick dropped again and she like visibly like it's almost like I said something mean to her yeah her energy visibly like decreased yeah we're both in hold on wait we're both in a restaurant like this like yep can we can we Al can we just appreciate also the combo of 6:00 a.m. in La meet the grams to not like us especially after on tailor made freestyle he was like oh by the way I can keep dropping we're waiting he kept saying we're waiting on you he's like dude here's three in a [ __ ] row a trying to what as soon as as soon as so all right as I'm start cuz I'm the most biased as soon as I heard family as soon as I heard Family Matters I was like oh this is over no forid it was it was over before this even began no true Family Family Matters was strong when Family Matters drop I was hype as hold up cuz Marl was about to come in let's not pret let's not pretend he ever had a chance Drake lost the moment he he made fun of mat getting shot Drake lost the moment he dropped fat D Drake lost the moment all of these things happen because the court of public opinion was already against him and then you pair that against who he's going against somebody whose pen is not to be played with it's like no way he was rappers have come back from that and other rappers who are less than Drake have been able to come back from that bad of a public opinion what I what I find so insane never faced anyone with this bad of a public opinion when he faced me everybody loved Drake when I thought I thought he I thought I thought Drake versus Meek Drake had a lot of [ __ ] against him like was Drake was I feel like Anette was about to jump in yeah I feel like I understand the court of public opinion but Drake absolutely did this to himself it's not just the court of public opinion this is a spiritual calling this is like a spiritual this is spiritual warfare this is you're not living right your soul is [ __ ] up and everybody sees you you hate yourself so much that everybody hates you too we don't trust you because you don't trust yourself let her finish preaching let me finish because seriously like you have to recognize that you're go he went up against somebody who his whole body of work is I'm doing work on myself I am not perfect I'm [ __ ] up but I'm going to Bear my soul and I hope this helps the masses and that is my art and then you you Drake come up here and you have the nerve to like it's to me it's a couple things it's a couple things it's like if you are if you're talking about rapping right nobody ever said Drake Can't Rap fine I I also think if you have Ghost Riders you're automatically out but that's just me but on top of this it to me I equate Kendrick and Drake to like Nicki Minaj and Rap City going at each other I don't want to hear that [ __ ] like Nikki stop I get that you're great you can rap but substance over popularity stop it we're you're not in the same you're not L it's apples and oranges and it's just sad to me and this is this is a call no no no this is I know that people were saying this is a funeral but it really is this is Kendrick did Drake the biggest favor he ever could Kendrick said get your [ __ ] repent get on your knees get your soul right a tone a shame this this this is Kendrick going with the Bell shame shame to the being in different Lanes like apple and oranges I think that's what makes what Kendrick did throughout this whole battle and not like us in particular so impressive because it actually shows that Kendrick Kendrick to me demonstrated that he's the best in every lane he dropped a song he said it wasn't good enough to me for him to show us that okay we all know he's the better the better lyrical rapper the better substantive rapper right but like what Drake whole thing is going to be is that I make hits I make the better song I make Fier song and that's what he thought Family Matters was going to be and it would have been in a different time you're also proving his point then he drops not like us and not like Kendrick in this I make I mean Drake in this I make hit [ __ ] is proving Kendrick's Point go make your hits I like you when you make us dance other [ __ ] stop bro you're dangerous we haven't heard yet we haven't heard yet and he seems deep in thought goad this is a hard time for a lot of us to be honest I love hip-hop yes I'm here for hipop I'm a drake fan that don't mean I wanted Drake to necessar I thought like I'mma Be unobjective when I'm looking at what's going on for one this was never a Drake versus Kendrick battle that's the first thing and that would have been his first mistake thinking that this was just Kendrick because Kendrick didn't go at his bars Kendrick went at his person his character his history whence once Drake entered into that ring there was nowhere for him to go now Antoinette I thought that you were had very poignant points right but if Kendrick being this whole on this whole spiritual cleanse spiritual this and that would be the most have would I would expect him to have some humility about the way that he behaved he's like we we multiple times want you to come here they want you to come join us we're all recognizing each other's powers and and our influence whatever you go no it's just me [ __ ] it's just me I got I'm G let Z in back me for that one listen listen listen listen listen listen what we talking about if it's hip hop there's something about the sport of hip-hop both Drake and Kendrick have said multiple times there's a sport in Hip Hop the these three people Kendrick jcole and Drake have said over a decade about how much they appreciate the sport and Hip-Hop they all have experienced with rap battles and if you know how a rap battle works it is a media War you have to be able to shake that [ __ ] off first off I completely understand the idea like I I somewhat disagree with Anin about the spiritual cleanse thing I understand where you're coming from but as somebody who appreciates the sport of rap and the sport of people throwing punches at each other I appreciated Family Matters I appreciated everything Kendrick dropped by the way no I never said you did I'm not saying you you don't right but I'm saying like I appreciate like I don't I didn't think it was over before it started because I felt like okay they're coming at each other with punches and I was here for it this is my favorite rap battle that I've gotten to experience since Jay-Z and NS right and I've experien and because all of them have been blowouts all of them have been blowouts and we were having people go back and back back and forth right like but I do think I do think it is very hard to follow like it's about disrespect meet the grams was pure disrespect which you need to have and the Heart part six was not disrespectful enough not like us it's pure disrespect like like it you got to disrespect that's what that's what you're not getting it's not just about disrespect it's he's peeling back the curtain of of the entire industry the his his favorite he's peeling back the curtain of how we listen listen to music he is holding a mirror to all of us it's not just Kendrick was making disc records for Drake but also for what Drake embodies Kendrick is protecting the [ __ ] culture right now I'm not aru I'm arguing amen I'm talking about the sport of it I'm not arguing with you so there's two levels to this there is the sport of it and there is the the greater context of what Kendrick um did and like I I feel like we are it's hard to not underplay just how Wild Kendrick just did Dr God like it's anime villain level [ __ ] this is movie level [ __ ] I can't imagine I don't know what y'all were doing I was in bed I had just heard Family Matters I was already starting to hate on that [ __ ] and and cuz I had heard the slave bar immediately and the other tragic M nonsense wait wait wait yeah and I'm already starting to hate on it and so my wife who's like she just don't like to see people lose really badly so she's like trying right and then like I get a call it's what is it 11:45 for everybody on the East Coast at least I get a call from a frat brother he's like yo Kendrick just dropped again and I'm gonna I'm gonna dramatize this in my video because I know everybody else had this moment of realizing that Kendrick dropped within 15 30 minutes of this and then you turn that on and the first words are deonis and you see the picture zoomed out and I'm like this dude playing this we were talking about drop drop drop he was like I'm I'm doing Batman level prep time right now and I got [ __ ] and it's a [ __ ] Menace and then to two days later oh I'm sorry then to the next uh evening drop the summer Banger The Banger for the summer so unite the entire West Coast Victory left knew was like you can't come back from it imagine being Drake and seeing that glove on the on the on Euphoria first and knowing that's my [ __ ] my that's my that's my shirt underneath that about it too I like that it's like this West Coast banger but he's also going up for the history of like Atlanta on it like really I think that is is very the history lesson is what really tied it all together and made it seem like yo you are bad for people like it's not even just like you're bad for rap you're bad for people you represent something that is parasitic yes and remember what we talked about on the last episode what we the first episode that you dropped about this whole thing and we everything in that song we literally laid out in that episode about how he'll come to these different countries or these different states and cities and take on and we the culture for a second and he um he talked about historically of course because historically Atlanta black and you know the culture here is really black and so the rappers here he would just you know get with and try to make money and try to just be all about like he's from Atlanta and all that he listed what the the the he he made sure to let y'all know listen hip hop is black right and this man acts in whiteness he moves and shifts whenever he wants to and that's how he gets away with so much and we need to protect hip hop I think that's what Kendrick was more so going to we need to protect this and a lot of the rappers really don't [ __ ] with this guy and that's the truth of the matter um so I think what he did on and he did it on a beat as well that was something that usually Drake would go for and what Drake did on the the heart or whatever was to go with the Mr morale kind of vibe and it he a range for it you don't didn't sound morale that sounded like a time record that he was trying to appropriate was him trying to get out of this oh so Mr morale was him I when I'm looking at not like us first of all when I looked at meet the grams I knew it was over I knew I knew he had been out planned like the scheme that Kendrick laid out beat Drake amongst anything else it it it didn't even come down to what Drake said you guys are saying is what Kendrick said I think it's all about the planning the strategy the creativity of Meet the grams Drake being too cocky because why don't you have more if you were waiting all this time and you spent all of that time baiting this man knowing how good he is at what he does why haven't you been in the studio Kendrick was in the studio the whole time could have responded with a whole Dis Track from the point of view of Whitney but he don't have the range to even think about that he don't even have the Artic he just he I off his don't think he doesn't AR Taylor Made happen also also I think the whole I have a lot of doubts about the whole thing about him planting it mainly because like dude like so your goal was to plant this story and let it marinate for two days nobody plants a story that they're a pedophile exactly that's like you're going to plant the story and let it let it let it marinate you're going let everybody call you a ped for 3 Days the [ __ ] stupid like that that theory doesn't make any [ __ ] sense okay like are we supposed to believe we're supposed to believe that Drake fed his opponent the information that would nuke him in a rap battle that he would then not be prepared for to respond to know about meet the GS he thought that he thought that Kendrick used it in 616 he went and did a uh he did a whole video to to talk about 616 he didn't plant the didn't pay wait a minute Zade I'm pardon me brother z z it's all good it's all good it's all good he thought that he was battling 616 he had no idea meet the grams was waiting yeah he had no idea so he does this whole video doing this this scene talking to a conspirator in the backyard like yo I'm giving him this information but that only answers 616 not the bigger problem yeah which was Meet the grams when meet the grams hit it crumbled honest I really want to believe more in Drake that there's no reason why he would feel like six he should feel like 66 and La was going to be Kendrick's like last move like that's going to be weird then why didn't he have more R I think it's I think it's the name stupid idea I really Kenny Kenny you talk I just really I'm sitting here like we're talking about the anime level like you know mcavan moves of of Kendrick and you know he even said in Euphoria like you're very you think you're more calculated than you actually are you're not very smart essentially is what he's trying to say and so if he is so predictable and he is so run-ofthe-mill and like his or not run-of the mill but like he's very predictable in how he goes about things it is easier to prepare for something like that but I think I'm more insulted as a person in the audience where you think I'm a stupid as to believe that you sat there and was like I fed him information about me being a pedophile he never said for I don't believe that I defin believe he said his I just want Tahoe to clarify just so I can make sure I know what I'm about to hate on go ahead Taho I don't believe he fed I believe that Drake was too cocky the whole time so no I don't believe that he knew the PO the thing was going to go that far but he didn't the stuff at all that's not one of the things that he said he planted I don't think cover the album covered the he said he planted the daughter and theover yeah the daughter and the album covers both thing was like people keep running with he pant planted a pedal story that never Happ also why are you going to plant the daughter thing when you when you got called out of that compelling like none of that's compelling like Dr to the fact that like anybody defending Drake at this point is not able to do it on the M even on the most shallow levels like [ __ ] that they can't do it on a substantive level of what the critiques Kendrick Al Lan against Drake but they can't even do it on the music level like we're outside now it comes this oh we're conspira oh did Dr tell him no one gives a [ __ ] [ __ ] he got washed on like can I ask something even if you take even if he fed that stuff let's let's say he did let's all play dumb right because this yeah this is okay he did a scene about feeding okay let's say that he fed it let's say that so let's take if you take out all of the lines that Kendrick said about the kid and the the [ __ ] still is BR is hardly the most menacing thing that Kendrick said he came from your entire way of being how you live your life dog like what are we talking about I don't give a it's not like this isn't like this is one of those times where you could even argue that Drake is like making the catchy are better music and that we are just trying to argue Kendrick ju on a substantive level Drake's getting washed on the music too like I think even on even on his fan shallow list version of like what hip-hop should be about Family Matters gets watched and not like us so what's getting boo out of clubs he's getting Bo somebody Taho very quickly I just want to let y'all know I agree with y'all there are certain things that these things can both be true I think oh yeah I'm sorry I'm not coming you sorry I'm passionate apologies no yeah I think Drake was planning for what happened in the meek beef so now I'm not in the me beef Pusher beef so he's like okay I know that this is a play that hurt me last time let me get ahead of it I know what they're going to say I know what my weaknesses are let me get ahead of it I also don't think that he was writing enough I also don't think that he was creative enough I also don't think that he really applied strategy and if we're going to say that this is a moment that will go down as one of the greatest in history based off of what Kendrick did that means to every other artist that's ever done that has never thought this way Kendrick was that genius with the way he played this we can't just say Drake is just dumb he's just not it's so easy to say that in hindsight can I say one thing can I can I can I can no o speaking go ahead bye bye by y'all's version which yall want me to believe like Drake would have to be dumb because this isn't like to say Drake oh he's thinking he's getting ahead of it or this was the line of attack Kendrick is not like hiding what the [ __ ] critique is we're like having everyone is having major [ __ ] discussions about what the critique is with Drake the main actual critique ha has really been that Drake is a [ __ ] culture vulture and then like secondly it's these other things about his character that are Insidious serious like pedophilia and this is and next thing but the main accusation is the culture vulture thing so there's no [ __ ] way Drake could think he could come out with whatever have you and think that that stuff is just whatever by side it's going to be about what the push battle I think he thought it was going to distract uh people from what's actually been happening throughout the battle and that it would neutralize at least one song one round it was almost like a desperation attempt you're down you need to do something you want people to think you're as calculated and as thought out as Kendrick embarrassing so you're going to do you're trying to get ahead of it and think that you you might be able to neutralize at least one night one night I'll get him you know what I mean and that might turn the tides on on the whole thing but it was like you said it was way bigger than that already it wasn't like about those little fine details it was about his history and all that other stuff can can I really quick before you jump in Z I just want to read the Tweet when he tweeted out heart prop six which is like it sounds like something my 10-year-old would say yeah um the Heart part SS out now and we know you're dropping it 6 minutes after so instead of posting my address you have a lot to address the whack bar that's whacker than the B Bar CU that's what it sounds like bro like what what I think what I think is so weird to me is like like first off even if he like I think even even if you're looking from both angles even if you're looking from a mellian scheme like the idea that you would plant that to try to get ahead of it like the daughter thing that you would plant all that that is stupid because it's so believable you know you know it's going to damage your reputation yeah why the [ __ ] would you plant that like that's a dumb thing to admit so you're just bad at this secondly secondly meet the grams the entire last minute is like that's something he still hasn't addressed you lied about you like you lied about your accent you lied about this you lied about that like that's something he has not addressed at all and even the thing oh sorry no and even though I'm so I'm I'm trying not to interrupt you guys I'm sorry I'm so sorry if I'm being annoying no go ahead go ahead but everything about everything like to the point that Antonette made earlier like that whole last verse on not like us talking about every single artist whose style he has stolen from Atlanta Atlanta's entire cultural build he has stolen you know what's funny there was a meme I saw a while back you know like an anime meme where it was like uh Hey Drake what style are you going to use and then he has the sharing gun he's like your style and he's done that constantly he pulled off Little Durk he pulled off 21 Savage he'll artists will pop up he'll put them on a track collaborating with them and that's his style for the next year Drake is like a [ __ ] Madden game he just slightly changes every [ __ ] year without adding any substance and and it's caught up with isn't he doing it on the songs with the artist though yes soive do that we we cut off Kenny ear Kenny earlier yeah gonna jump me um I was just gonna say going back to him not addressing any of those things but even the things that he did address didn't make him look better so like the things that you address are vaguely in relation to uh performative Blackness and you do so by bringing up that weird slave line oh yeah it was very [ __ ] weird I don't know what he was going for with that very weird he was trying to say want I just hold on I just want to set for the record y'all getting ready to defend the slave bar like explicitly for chap I'm adding content from a rap sport perspective Tahoe that's a bad it's a bad move it's like it's like a horrible move very tone death what he did I'm sorry o I apologize I'll sit out no no and then well just one more thing and then the thing that he did defend kind of is preemptively the the pedophilia allegations by bringing up Millie Bobby Brown and Epstein unprompted um it was very prompted well it was prompted but like to bring out like speciic that no he was talking to the internet he wasn't talking to Kendrick at that point he was talking to the internet a lot of people have brought it up non he battle Twitter has been bringing it up for days Twitter has been bringing it up for days both of them have responded to Twitter I think that's worse too the fact that no but that really speaks to what like Kendrick is always saying actually speaking you're not responding to what the culture is really indicting you on the conversation black people are having or whatever is about the culture of but you're responding to which your community these people everybody in no I can't agree with that everybody was bringing that up no but also again you're in a rap battle Kendrick is just dropping his [ __ ] tracks and that's it we're hearing everything through the through the music Drake is online Drake is responding to online narratives even a lot of what and I think this has a lot to do with why people weren't believing a lot of the [ __ ] that Drake was saying is because a lot of what Drake was saying was what we were watching his fans say all over the timelines and getting debunked and [ __ ] on ratioed and all this [ __ ] was already so it it just felt like that's who he's having this conversation with let's be that's who the battle is somewhat with it's not just with Kendrick if Kendrick is saying we're what the I'm what the culture is feeling that means he has to respond to the culture and if the culture is online trashing him bringing up Bob Brown Jud let me ask you guys this what has Kendrick responded to can I respond to get in that ass he respond not good enough he's been called he's been called wife beer he son actually want to get into that actually want to get into that real quick talk and then zad because I seen zad on that so so and I I I'm very open to critique on this take there's the the the believe believe victims conversation right and when when men get accused of DV or things along those lines it it should always be taken seriously especially when it's like for putting get plausible from a victim right like when a person comes forward with the courage to say this person did harm to me I'm with that when Drake does it in a rap battle and we have like no discernable like nothing before this moment in time has ever led us to engage with this thought about Kendrick Lamar I'm not saying that I don't wish Kendrick would address it cuz I do I want to hear him address it I want to hear it from his wife I want to hear somebody come forward and be like nah that's [ __ ] whatever that's other than you know another Kendrick fan but I think this this uh argument that well why why you all believe Kendrick and not Drake is silly because we have a document everything that Kendrick has said we have documentation of for literal years at this point independent of this rap battle versus aside from me just never putting nothing past no [ __ ] especially hold uper Jason [ __ ] I don't have any reason to think that Kendrick beat his wife you know what I'm saying I'll say this the for example the Pusha thing right when Pusa exposed the child or whatever there was no reason before that to believe that Drake had a child inclined to there still everybody still believed it right away because we wanted to believe it van lean had a good point about this I saw van lean tweet something about this today and he was like it's a reflection of how the culture feels about Drake that the culture doesn't trust Drake what Drake is is showing and that is still an indictment on Drake and I say that to to to to what FD was saying it's not that I and I want to be clear I'm somebody I don't identif I'm not a drake hater I'm a drake fan in real life I would I I believe I listen to more Drake music than I listen to Kendrick I am a drake fan but objectively he's getting his ass whooped and a lot of the criticisms and the indictments that are being made for him are true and the thing the thing the thing why people are inclined to believe everything is even with the let's say the the daughter thing if before if in your last rap battle the the the Checkmate was you were hiding a child and you were the second time [ __ ] probably hid in the I could see that I could see that because it's happened if you tell me oh he likes uh underage girls and there have been numerous times like I can think of more five more than five times off the top of the Dome that Drake has been linked to an underage girl then then yeah that's why people are inclined to believe that if you're talking about how people have been saying for years that he's stealing the styles of all these different rappers it's been talked about like this is a been known thing that he's uh switching genres that he does all this [ __ ] these are all things that in fact it's the reason I think it's embodied in what Kendrick had to say in Euphoria is that he's speaking for the culture this isn't just me and so that's why the reason why we believe what Kendrick is saying it's because we believed it first it was the culture and people who believed it about him and Kendrick is just speaking for people versus what Drake saying what he's saying about Kendrick Kendrick's wife ain't saying that nobody's saying that is not substantiated anyway or whatever so was like also I have I have a note on that I have a note on that DV thing so I looked it up and I and I I did a [ __ ] Deep dive it doesn't take a lot of research to find out Drake is referencing the crisis management team from 2015 in 2015 Kendrick had 14 or 15 he had an alra there was a security guard at the Hard Rock Casino who claimed that a woman came up to them uh blooded and bruised and had blamed Kendrick Lamar for it right this was reported to Media Takeout Media Takeout did an investigation because they believed that the victim was credible however they found absolutely no evidence that Kendrick had anything to do with that and then Kendrick went on The Breakfast Club very shortly after to address all of the allegations with multiple people coming up as character Witnesses now whether that I know that we have a a long history after that of scrutinizing more people from dismissing victims after that that's that's a different conversation but this had nothing to do with Whitney Alfred the way that Drake put that in the in the from a rap battle perspective great you're mischaracterizing but the way he put that in there that's not that's not with his with his wife currently he there's no he's taking that allegation and saying that allegation was with Drake's wife that's what he's trying to mix up and the other thing is Taylor Alfred who's Whitney's brother is tweeting out the Dr they hav't confirmed that's her brother they haven't confirmed Taylor's her brother no oh okay well when I ask a question I would love for it to be true go ahead go ahead how many artists that are out right now does the culture trust how many that you guys in this room trust these artists that are out right now and I'm talking about all across the board and I mean even somebody who's scissor don't have no beef with nobody y'all trust her she's been a liar for a i trusty I trust yeah I trust Sav this is is like I think we're not referring to trust in the sense of like oh I trust them I know these people or what they would do anything we're talking about like a c certain level of cultural confidency like a certain level of cultural trust like what what what do I know what do I what I I know you to be right it's the reason it's like if somebody told you if somebody told you that isay was actually antiblack and working for white supremacy beside the scenes you heard that right now you'd be like nah I'm not inclined to kind of heard that two weeks ago actually I was going to say that it was a girl kind of heard that two weeks ago actually to imply that but you know we wouldn't believe y'all I rcky they are y messy we don't know these people but that's what I said that Drake lost this battle before this battle started in the eye of in the court of public opinion anything that he said would have been used against him especially with somebody like FD who never messed with him never would would then these allegations these allegations right can I finish jumped if Drake dropped not like us if Drake dropped not like us I promise you a whole like I've seen a bunch of different [ __ ] that were like were were like I'm just here for the music switching sides every different track that came out or whatever A lot of people are like a lot of people are like that and if he dropped the better music I would have said it I'm not somebody I'm not pretending like Family Matters didn't go in its own right or wouldn't have been a b I'm again I'm not somebody here to like spit on Drake's grave or whatever he really just is getting washed like be on yes like whether or not the cult what is against him the the the the indictments that Kendrick had for him would have substantively stood regardless but he is factually getting yeah but when you have when you have the I'm sorry Rebecca go ahead no you know I just want to tap in right so we're gonna go with okay this is a um this is a battle right we can say that this is a rap battle but this is it seems to be more personal I don't think from what we can see from what we can gather Kendrick doesn't give a damn about how he's received from you know the world and to me Drake gives a he gives a damn but Kendrick's like I'm coming for you specif you care about being famous I'm gonna drop on Instagram if I feel like it I'll drop in somebody's DM I'll drop on Spotify I'll drop on he doesn't care right he's like he said he want that [ __ ] dead yes yes he said it three times he said I want you to die we got to really look at that it's like from a personal perspective he's naming his wife you know naming the and when you go over to his wife's page it's people underneath the page you know like coming at his wife talking about his kids so it's it's Blood for Blood but I think there's something personal that isn't being said something happened because we haven't seen or heard from Kendrick like that's just how he is he'll come out when he feels like it but him popping out like this consistently that means there's something personal and he's not going to stop mentioned it in the bar I that's actually the one thing I was wrong about I in the beginning of all of this I really thought this was just like competitive like they just being like when Kendrick first jumped on it like that I was like not interested like okay control whatever just competitive you know rapper [ __ ] you know blah blah BL I didn't think there was a personal issue with Drake and I have been very surprised to learn let me jump in real quick z i i because there two things I want to touch on something that Tahoe said I really disagree with if then kind of respond to you um Drake did not lose the public opinion before this it's a split public opinion and then one group one because Drake has literally three of the biggest streamers in Hip Hop media and culture on his side Aiden Ross academics and kaiset um along with their clones who I don't even know or won't name right academics in particular is extremely in his Camp which is another reason why the whole narrative we we fed you information don't work because you have a literal mouthpiece in the media that you didn't bring in on this that you bring on everything else you think those guys are positive to Drake No No me personally no but in but a lot of people to a lot of people those are bad Associates those are netive vult are widely known as the biggest Glazer in Hip Hop media there yes for the culture that's inditing Drake for what FD is saying is there are two camps yes for the culture that is indicting Drake those people are seen as a negative but there a massive amount of people that listened to and received their [ __ ] from those [ __ ] people and children their children but children run the industry they're way more the most powerful voice in hipop is not Charlamagne the god it's Kai s the industry but they don't run the internet and the opinions they're not even smart enough to have nuanced opinions like that at at the age but but say forgot about Vlad hold on and Adam 22 but but but the but I put Adam 22 there anymore I think Adam 22's like fallen off significantly since then you know um but like I think I forgot my point well I didn't forget let me get to that the second thing I wanted to say really quick poor Tahoe which actually I think I forgot [ __ ] it's your moment shine before I want to say is for one Drake did get out strategized here he obviously he lost the battle over inly I said it was a landslide it was definitely a bunch of toned deaf missing moments um that he just kept stepping in it more and I don't think that he realized when I say that Drake always lost this is because as Rebecca said Drake cares about how he's perceived he cares about how he's perceived and at some point he was not only fighting five six seven ex-friends MH at the same time he never really just went to focus on Kendrick because he cared about all of this that he was getting from everywhere once he turns online and did these tonee moments and all of these things that he's done in within his history is being shown on the screen like yeah what about this girl or what about this move and why would you bring up slaves and he's he's like wait I was just bringing up slaves because he beat his wife with and they're like we don't care we want you we want you once that happened he really he literally he was on the defense from Family Matters and those two from Taylor between family from Taylor M you're right Tor I think Taylor Maid was actually like from Euphoria you want to be like think Taylor mid was the nail in the coffin for him because now you created uh a war that wasn't just like even just rap it was coasts like you you attack the entire West Coast and where resides and where he runs the actual culture not Delila not van eyes not those no noo he runs those little places where culture actually comes from in those States and for him to go and then let's not even because I know this is why ol brought me here it a lot of it cuz he's Canadian yeah if that [ __ ] was from Brooklyn we're not having a lot of this discussion because J Cole's m is white too he doesn't get any he's not told he's a white boy he's not told any of that [ __ ] and it's because he's Canadian why a lot of this perception is happening because of the whole oh he grew up in Forest Hill and blah blah let me tell you something where he grew up is three minutes from a town we called Lil Jamaica three minutes there's it's not out of the realm of possibility that Drake grew up in a Black Culture it's just not the same Black Culture that is dominating this conversation and for him to act like he has a chance that for him to act like he has a chance in that to me is the tonee part because you got to realize where you are like regardless of you being black in your mind it's not the same type of black and people are showing that it's not the same type of black by easily calling him a white boy so I I want go ahead answer that I I have a white mom so I would just love to to jump in on this real real fast I I I posted something saying just to be clear it's it's important and Madison um mcfur posted it Bobby mcf's daughter and and it was saying basically listen I'm to be clear I'm a jcole by racial not a Drake by racial and the difference is and people were pissed off with me but I'm like the difference is one is authentic to who they are the other is not I think it was masterful when Kendrick came back on Meet the grams and addressed Adonis as a black boy to say this has nothing to do with race this has to do with how you move Adonis I re he's not saying Drake is not black he's saying that you're not a real one and you don't belong here and and people and and people are reading into that and calling it racist and all this other [ __ ] and it's like that's not it it it's like having Tim Scott talk about rap He black as [ __ ] don't nobody want to hear from [ __ ] Scott okay you need to be for the people period and and and and Drake has never I'm sorry Drake has never mentioned a [ __ ] thing about black folks he's silent when it comes to struggle he's silent all he does is put on the mask make his money talk about [ __ ] talk about this and that and that's it and I think it's though I think it's resentment though why doesn't speak on it because like from a Canadian perspective okay like we never had anybody that's done what Drake did before he did it right there have been tons of people who we consider talented enough far talented enough cardinell official the list goes on and them being authentically Toronto never worked all right so now you have a guy who for all his Summers has spent it with his black family down south he's he knows what American culture is like he sounds American in his songs he's like trying to like throw you guys off or whatever the case may be and he tried to fit in like I think that with Drake's story it's constantly trying to fit in if you look at everything that he's done is constantly trying to fit in and find his place and in with Toronto and we had like this whole stigma when uh I don't know if you guys have heard caribana up here it's a parade that happens every year it's huge the running joke used to be Toronto guys pretending to be American to get girls right because girls did not respect the Toronto guys and then so when you have that trans that transitioned into our music culture now and then he goes over to America he pretends to be American he's speaking in this this twang that we over here are like why is he talking like that but to y'all y'all were eating it up you guys were so we're like Hey we're not going to you do your thing bro whatever it takes for us to get over that hump and then by the time guess if you're reading this it's too late that's when he starts being Toronto mandm told you that when he put everybody's like oh when did this guy turn Jamaican when he's always he's always been Toronto he just couldn't show it because it wouldn't be receive the same way I'm not saying I don't Havey for him but to be but to be this front that is going to already that's already starting the inauthenticity that will be called back later in the future but he had to do that in order to get in he did he had to that listen listen you you never have to do anything he made a decision to go make his money and to go do to go put on his mask and tap dance and do his thing he could have been his self he could but because because real fast because he needs this validation so deeply he is his value is so deeply rooted in other people feel about him in his he hides behind his money he hides behind his memes he hides he hides he hides this is a love letter to him come forward reveal yourself I bet you you would still kind of be enough dog this is why we say this cuz the man is telling you about I'm telling you guys it's just how we it was it was survival for him in a sense and it's not it's not to say that he's fake I think it's to tap into a side of him is not his the side that he would normally tap in with because when he's here and he's come back from uh where is it Memphis is that where was where's his dad Memphis there's Memphis we can't relate to anything he's going to talk about I I so he doesn't there's no opportunity for him to really dive into that and then when he's over there he can't talk to ronto there's nobody that's going to receive that so it's constantly just a mix and match and then he's the black kid at a white school and in a white neighborhood it's just he's constantly out of place here's what always makes this [ __ ] white and I'm going to tell you why whenever we talk about Drake right all black people all black people especially like I understand I'm a black immigrant I I am regularly other there are people who watch this show and other me don't like that I am not a black American on my own [ __ ] show right like so I understand like I do I do get that but here's the difference black people are highly aware of what it means to have to like adapt or code switch to the room you're in or to have to deal with these kind of biases or whatever what black people are not used to is you do that to be at the very top and then expect Underdog treatment like that's what makes what Drake does white like it's not just adapting doing what he needs to do to get by in a room Drake goes and he transforms so that he can get everything that he can out of every situation and then he's at top at the top you're at the top and you want the [ __ ] that you have now gone above you've climbed up above you know what I mean to empathize with you no it don't work like that n NE goo can I tell can I tell the story real quick like actually I I remember what I was going to say earlier it's related to what Marlin's getting at Tahoe said it like this sounds like hate yes I hate that [ __ ] that's what it is Kendrick hates that [ __ ] that's what it is and and like I I I want it to be understood this is a righteous burning passionate hatred that comes Loving Hip Hop I'm glad you said and and it's so funny cuz I always cuz I I like Kendrick so much I was like I really like this motherfucker's music he sound like he hate like the way he the way he rap I bet you he hate Drake and he was start and then he would start saying little [ __ ] like yeah that sound like Drake that [ __ ] hate Drake just like me I love this [ __ ] and then Euphoria hits and like to me Euphoria is still the most significant moment in this battle s because it's the best overall song and in that song is the the most complete thesis of critiquing Drake specifically from the standpoint of a lover of Hip Hop because as o just pointed out and and to piy back and like agree somewhat with Marlin I do think Drake's Canadian plays into it because Drake's Canadian will have him apart from the the like the originating primary elements of hip-hop yeah in a way that he may fumble and stumble over them and maybe he could have learned them over time but he wasn't interested in that and we we're not going to we got to get into Drake's antiblackness that's been unveiled through this this beef some of these clips coming out where he sounds out he sound Candace Owens A J you know what I'm saying and so like imagine being a lover of Hip Hop a person who grew up on a Public Enemy Rock Kim um uh krs1 like like uh Wu like people that that not just love hip hop but love the culture and did for black people and I'm not saying hip-hop culture perfect it's a lot of problems some of which are unveiled both on Kendrick and Drake side through this battle but imagine Loving Hip-Hop the way a lot of [ __ ] my age do and older and then watching Drake W rise to the top and then over time not being able to say anything can I can I just having to hold that L may may have very quickly I'm listen what Maron said is very very important because us here in America black americ we do control this culture it is ours I do not have to even contribute it to it to be able to claim it at any point and say that I'm not a a going against it because it's like yo I'm here you can't tell me how to be black I'm I'm living in this skin this man might have to let left his culture alone and say yo you know what I have to hide that to fit in and never did never fit in in any room that he went to he never fit in he was always the one that was on the on the outside of things and he felt rejected because of that yet and still Y is saying he didn't add to the culture when most of the people that are he's going against he's taking on tour I he's giv him number ones he he's he's contributed we all are gonna still listen to this man's music just because of what he does contribute to the culture you know let me tell you I think Drake is really cutting cutting both ways for me here in this conversation right because I really don't like and um the way that some people instead of leaving their critique at Drake they they is just starting to like diminish diminish the the Blackness of the rest of the black Globe right like black like even how the way the the cultural the culture vulture conversation is devolved to only be like black Americans like no no no he's he's stealing other black cultures too he's all like it's not just your other black Nations and black cultures are having the same conversation and they other and who have roles in hip-hop and they're so I I I don't like that but I don't want to let that make me defend Drake too much because the problem that Drake is running into to and I think he he's working against black Canadians in this regard is Drake is an individual like Drake I like I said I said this in the last episode I've always followed I followed I knew Drake long before he was Drake and when he was Aubrey Graham Drake himself was always on some white people [ __ ] it's it's Drake himself that's always like doing things and fumbling in this way that makes you feel like his Blackness always has to be up for litigation right but that's not the truth of the rest of the black little like that's not the black Canadian experience right that's why like that's not the so that's really really not the ha but I don't think it's this Drake doesn't fit in thing I'm tired of that because Drake I know what it is to be othered in America right and like to be othered as oh you're not a black American that's what the [ __ ] is happening to Drake you don't get to dominate the [ __ ] culture you you don't get to dominate it and then also be like I don't fit in in fact people have let you fit in so much that's actually what you're being indicted about is that you've been allowed to wear it as a costume whichever one and jump in and do as you want you cannot like you can't simultaneously have the benefit of being able to enter every room wear every culture wear every costume participate in every genre music and then also be like but I don't fit in because like there's some critique about that but I think this this this battle is revealing that he never fit in because the same guys that he thought he was cool with are the ones that are turning on him those are the same I think can I say one theyed for his they used it for his platform and then now they're saying you were never one of us but that but but they're not doing it because they're not saying because of and as I think it's important to go back to what Anon I said from the beginning they're not saying that because of what you inherently are they're saying that because of what you do how you move through the world like what you're doing so it's not a they don't just accept Drake it's no no no I have a problem with the [ __ ] that you do the way you move is crazy you come act priv but it's highlighted because he is Drake but I really hope though that we discuss how he moves with women cuz there's women in almost every one of these beefs that he has with these dudes this whole thing you you talking about like Drake's relationship with women is [ __ ] weird okay it is the esparanza Spalding Serena you come in for Rihanna you've come for Meg and then on top of that your [ __ ] little Wayne's girl you flying Rick Ross's girl out you move funny so whether we were on a track or not dog I gave you the street credit and now you over here doing weird [ __ ] this is that this is another indication that you do not understand this culture and this is why we don't trust you or [ __ ] with you you don't understand a code you don't have a code because you don't have you're not grounded in anything but your [ __ ] your mask exactly that was that is the thing that has landed him here Z you could definitely just I got two seconds I just believe that a lot of this has to do with him getting so much bread and finally not having to care about faking it for other people he's [ __ ] everybody's woman he's he's out he's taking people like I say he's taking people's Styles he's using it against them he's not putting them on and this [ __ ] is now crashing down on him I totally believe everything that y'all saying about that go ahead Z okay I think I think the other thing that people aren't bringing up is that the biggest critique Kendrick has about the Canadian uh experience to the Americans is that Drake is specifically wearing the experience of a lot of people who have been from neighborhoods in Atlanta like like the trap in Atlanta from neighborhoods like even in La like he he took he wore that as a mask too people are forgetting there dude he he had a song with game where he's like he's hanging out with Bloods and like he's in like that that has to piss people off from that region and the thing is he's done that with every single like it's one thing to come in and be like yo I'm from Toronto and I'm showing you love and like we're all we're all like like we're relating each other from different like it's one thing to to mix it's another thing for you to be like oh no I'm from La now too it's like it's like those dudes who have like like uh who who love one basketball team and once they lose they just hop on you know like hop on the Bulls from the 90s or something like that like you got to you got to stick with your team man like and and I feel like I feel like it's frustrating to and the other thing about the mask is like I think the other critique Kendrick is bringing up is that like that mask is used to self-benefit like support like like Kendrick's music is meant to like liberate it's a it's contributive to hip-hop you're taking pie it's contributive this feels self it feels like it's it's it's a little selfish for him to take like he'll take other styles he'll build it into himself right but he won't contri like his contributions are for self gain as opposed to the cultural gain of the entire genre how many I can't with that but I I'll I'll ask you this about the whole Bloods thing right yeah is there an aspect of hip hop where you have to check in what do you mean is that is that real checking in when you go to certain States yeah absolutely and if you want to move a certain way don't you have to check in with those people yeah but you don't do a whole music video with the game why not that's not you don't need to check in that's not the checkin like how is that not the checkin the check the how is I'm putting them in a video and making sure that I'm good plenty of artists there's plenty of there's plenty of big artists who have come to La who have who have not checked in and gotten hurt and who have checked in and not shot music videos like I I feel like I feel like it's one thing and even if different when you're Canadian I mean I don't know about that man I different when you're the Canadian Jewish light you I feel like I feel like also it's not only just shooting the video it's the way he operates around that video it's the way he the way it was promoted like like there's just and and it's not the only time he's done it like look we were that whole scheme on not like us about Atlanta like so much of Drake's like American cultural standard of like what he's brought there is is from Atlanta is like people know him5 minutes you know him let me right here right here let me just get in let me get in okay so the thing is right cuz what's the thing what you're all saying is that okay this man wears coats and you know here go Tahoe if you you know with the whole you know he wasn't oh you know you too Marlon I know you're from Canada and I get it I we can't speak from that we can't speak from that you understand that culture and you you know you get it Lil Jamaica I believe all of the things but the Drake that appears everywhere who can mold shape shift be a chameleon all of those things uh he seems to to me move in whiteness because whatever like it benefits him those black artists you know that like even jcole he's true to himself he hasn't moved in and out of that who who he's become is grown and that he's just that Drake operates to me in White Privilege he goes here he goes there if he doesn't feel like talking about something he doesn't have to um he can get his audience to go be his trolls and you know not say anything not address it um top dog and the underdog at the same time and that's it and I and I don't that's what I don't like about that I can't really sit here and be like you know he's never found out who he was you know on one side of it he couldn't be they didn't choose him as black and on one side of it they didn't choose him as white and he didn't ask to be mixed and all of those things and no we've accepted him in the that's I'm saying he's been accepted in the black community he's been he's been accepted the reason why we did like the music and those tracks was going up when he was Jamaican or or Caribbean or whatever it's because we kind of just let it be and then you know and he was partnering with like you somebody mentioned he did partner with these artists you know but even though I don't like R&B take care is an R&B classic to a lot of people before he ever had a white fan base not that he literally operates to me in whiteness and he can get away with stuff because of that and that's my problem like when he was promoting like when he was reporting I think it was is either controler one dance I think it's controller like originally is like supposed to he he running all around the place with popcorn like he GNA have popcorn in the video song No popcorn like you see what I'm saying like [ __ ] like that [ __ ] like that like so I devil advocate per se also I'm not I was labing you by the way like like I was trying to draw a distinction between like I was saying like your experience is valid and everything that I wasn't trying to invalidate how you no no no I never took it that way so I I want to uh piggy back though off of what I last heard sorry I have to kids here now so I'm running in and out um uh Marlin pointed out something I actually think is really profound and it kind of elevates or shifts the convers ation away from Drake a little bit to like how did we end up with a drake in the first place because there is something uh Insidious about the fact that so many of Drake's collabor collaborators are turning on him now the main reason for that is Drake is a snake like I think that's you know clear um but I don't think it was fully unknown that Drake was a snake beforehand um Drake got co-signs because Drake brought money because as Drake said y'all got hits when I came and Drake brought those hits because of his ability to move in whiteness some light-skinned privilege and some bars and some melodies come on say that bars and Melodies I give his bars and Melodies but it speaks to a compromised element within hip hop that has been there before Drake and as I take off my um my funeral close for Drake's eulogy I recognize that another one is on the way or something similar is going to happen if hip hop does not course correct the the cap essentially the capitalist thirst for clout and money over protecting this singular art form that we have that's not like anything else not going to happen and I don't think it's going to happen either I just hi hop has too many layers FD and the thing is is that the one that we're speaking about the one you guys are speaking about which is the one that protects Blackness or I believe that's what that's really what's being said I get that but them people in Atlanta Love Drake them people in Houston they love Drake these are other people saying hey you're taking their style they never was complaining about that because guess what they wanted to jump on them tracks with him mustard just in in the club give me one second to finish this statement mustard was in the club after doing Not Like Us by the way fire ass song I was in here CRI walking or be walking or do whatever the hell old man walking into this [ __ ] the other day thought it was amazing but mustard a day after releasing that was in a club in Vegas and played Drake songs all night and didn't play not like us until the end of the night and guess what nobody booed as we've seen on on Twitter said that was a lie just so you know he said that was a lie and well I got a video girl say video footage say that's a lie okay been but but again that's just capitalism like that's just a conversation about capitalism and again all those kinds of conversations really just make it worse for Drake because again the whole indictment here is that Drake is like like the white em like the the the physical embodiment of like what is like white people's influence and Hip Hop and white people's control and capitalist interest right so like that's all it is it's like we all know we all have jobs I'm sure as content creators I'm sure you've collaborated or appeared on the show with somebody you don't really [ __ ] like like that I'm sure it's happened like like you know what I mean like there's it's a reality of reach right especially you know what that is if they if you're a musical artist reach has a lot to do with something you could be great but if someone never click on your song they never hear it they never hear about you then tough titty Right Drake is a huge artist so people are going to collaborate and take those opportunities and I think we're just really seeing now just how many people really were doing what they needed to do for you know their careers but they really don't [ __ ] with him you know and they just didn't have the they can't say it as much like I saw someone showed you know like Smo responding like people talking like maybe it was Metro boom or someone tweeted something at toino like oh we doing this for YouTube cuz he jack your whole [ __ ] and like there are lots of artists and people who I'm sure they they're not big enough Sino wouldn't have been big enough to start bitching and moaning like on on on on the internet when Drake Started just like taking his whole [ __ ] style so he couldn't say anything but now when there's uh Kendrick and there's everybody and there's a larger conversation I'm sure you're finding that a lot of artists who tolerated it are that shit's weak n listen to twoo songs this weekend listen but that's but Marlon that's it's not just that it's the Drakes the the collaborators really quickly the collaborators I I don't I really believe that they collaborated because they knew it would be a good look and and just like Olay said you do that but then the other reports that are coming out is that after the collaborations happened Drake is blocking things for them to do better within the industry he's sending CE and assist he's doing snake [ __ ] he's getting paid off of their [ __ ] in some kind of weird way and some [ __ ] that he has but that's said we don't have any understand what I'm saying that those splits I'm so sorry I'm not done but what he's saying is that is what is being reported so there is something to be said about somebody who's also make Rick Ross is saying he's blocking [ __ ] that people like he started that [ __ ] Rick Ross also said that Roy Woods wrote sio mode he's not the credible Source heck Ross is the best okay but but at the same time I do think that there is like there is something to be said about like you know like people people do make deal like I don't I think a lot of the fallouts that Drake has had he had like a pretty precipitous amount of fallouts post 2020 to now right he lost a lot of collaborators within this specific time and there was a time it felt like after the meek disc after a few records where his image like around the industry was coming up and even Kendrick wasn't throwing shots at him right but I think that especially over the last few years and especially I mean again Kendrick says it in these songs that there that it was a friendly fade until he crossed a line and so I don't know what necessarily necessary line he crossed maybe it was him trying to get trying to what existing was EX like I'm telling you as a as a as a drake hater it was never F this was this was a crusade I was speaking I was speaking to DJ head I was speaking to DJ head today after I did my live and DJ head said we had this stuff waiting we weren't going to use it unless he crossed certain lines and the minute he opened his mouth he crossed those lines the minute Drake opened his mouth he crossed those lines and that's a cultural that's him not understanding certain things so you I feel like you guys are okay I don't think that we're we're okay Drake literally Can Do Wrong Drake has been friends with these people right and it's not like we we can be friends with people and they can turn into Ops they do You Wrong Drake is one of those people Metro was somebody who was friends with Drake correct future as well there was beef that happened and here in this city Atlanta they going to play Drake but the conversations around the music scene are like if future said because this is his city right right if future said we don't f with Drake then we don't f with Drake and even in the song um you know Kendrick said and Compton this going to be your last show because that's his City so there is beef that he has with these people Metro even tweeted out that you know I'm not I don't mess with you and I would love to tell the truth about what happened but you know if I do that you would actually be canceled this is straight for tweet from Metro Atlanta Atlanta also mov the music scene also moves like a lot like a lot different like they're not all as somebody who's been like involved like the tree sounds and Patchwork and everything like that like a lot of those people are nice to Drake is like hey dude like don't don't [ __ ] up a good thing like that is a conversation that does happen around that City but Drake isn't Drake hasn't been good to these people right relationships he he's the one that messed these relationships up with these people as you as you were saying Antoinette sometimes he'll partner with these people and then will start to be Shady block their opportunities or whatever the case may be and this is what we should be focusing on Drake yes wo is mean to when he was younger he ain't know where to fit in right he didn't know how to be he didn't know who to be but and when he got these relationships and Partnerships with people like friendships and going into these cities and yes it would be a good look to work with Drake Drake was hot at the time and shoot Drake a little bit of bail like I I feel like I got to shoot Drake and bail especially as a as a drake fan and just like as a person who is very like well stop [ __ ] liking a person who says anything about me like I feel like the Drake stimulus package is real and Drake has been giving [ __ ] the Drake stimulus package for quite some time and I could imagine me personally if a bunch of [ __ ] that I've given some of their biggest tracks and collaborated with and did this and the next thing all of a sudden this one [ __ ] want to kick my [ __ ] back in and everybody with it and two like like at most I might have [ __ ] the occasional ho or two like y'all I would be I would be insens and to speak to that let's say for example just for sake argument they were using him for hits right there's going to be moments of uh disingenuine disingenuine that come out when they're trying to I don't know pretend to like him or pretend to be his friend and we're we're saying a lot of things right now that are behind the scenes information that has not been proven we don't know about the cease and desist we don't know that he's blocking opportunities I would say the opposite from what I've seen and if he was like we're saying a culture vulture where he's using these artists for whatever cloud or street cred wouldn't he be discarding them instead of building and maintaining relationships years he discarded though he disc that's the main I think that's the main beef between him and him and him and future right now are are in like like they've had like words like exchanged with each other it's not just because of you know like problems with women like there's there's some industry side [ __ ] which is like Drake field I think that's future feels abandoned or future feels like you know like you you [ __ ] kind of just switch grown you know like now the more that we talk about this I wish Drake had like Drake to me his the last track uh the whatever no whatever the hard [ __ ] is a concession you know what I mean and I wish Drake maybe I wish Drake did decide to like have some counternarratives because I do think I did I do too I wish he I wish he had come harder on that and and the argument if Drake had made the argument like you know what [ __ ] all these [ __ ] actually like I've actually done like I've done you know what I mean I've done a lot I've done a lot I feel like this is [ __ ] up these [ __ ] is fake too because you don't have a problem when you're getting something out of it right and I do think there's a argu he could have had argument to be made that like for for as much as y'all think I you know I culture vulture and that's true and whatever it is that you I'm taking from the culture you're not also acknowledging what I'm doing for a lot of these artists too it's not like it's a one-sided benefit future gains in his relationship with Drake right if Mill right the reason everybody was irritated at Meek at first was that Drake jumped on every Meek at that point Drake had given Meek his biggest single on every album you know what I mean and then you come out including that one and you come out talking [ __ ] right so like Drake does there it there could have been an argument to be made that Drake is also mistreated by like if we're talking about authenticity nobody is bringing up the fact that these guys are fraudulent and that they culture vultured him F nobody's bringing that up know about used fory they used him they used him for do you feel Vindicated you know you know fut was AA baby who's he NEPA uh the the one of like the main presidents of the dungeon family I did not he was Rico in the basement like you could see him in videos in the basement where Rico Wade and all those guys he was he was ushered in he not well I don't think it's to say he was ushered in I had I had a friend I had a friend who worked at the studio with Thug and like he was doing an internship and he came in one day and he was like yo can you clean that up and there was just like blood on the [ __ ] like wooden floor of patch yeah it's slime slime work for real I I want so I want to I want to throw something out there one of the accusations that I didn't know a lot about shout out to I I went live with uh Hassan and fantano um the night that not like us Dr and H put me on game for the whole gambling debt thing yeah um and I did not know this know this about Drake so Drake is like on Kick regularly gambling money for like n money for steak but it's still yeah so is it is it fake money you have to pay for it's fake so the the once you he works he has a ownership stake in stake and once you work with those companies they're able to allocate you money to make it look like you're gambling in order to promote the product so they did the same thing I don't know if you guys remember the Super Bowl when Ruby Rose and drewy a bunch of different influencers were showing how they used like $10 and made like a 100,000 that's all fake it's all just promotion for the app and to get more people to use it oh sorry I'm gonna have to pop off because my computer's about to die and my dog is going crazy but everyone can I have a question with can I have a question real quick because I brought that up just really quickly a kind of since we're kind of making the effort to like empathize with Drake this is also going to be a great you guys this is great research for my video I was I'm about to write another 5,000 words tonight um what like the the part about the end of Meet the grams is I which I think is the most even though if that's the the best song that verse and that end part about Drake being lost within himself and like I'm I'm reading Reddit and I'm hearing his own fans say he's too peled up to respond quickly and I'm like so I'm just trying to understand so those who are more in tune with Drake has Drake been spiraling quietly is that is that how he gets to where he is now he doesn't sleep much he he takes a lot of pills and he's talked about his drug use on multiple songs now he um and he even said the after the last album that he had to take time off because of his stomach his gut health he needed to take and get his health back up and so he's not from what I've been told he's not a guy that sleeps very much he's almost always in the studio and uh as a result he's he's facing the consequences of that healthwise I have I I also want to throw some empathy towards Drake like I think I think to I think to Discount that's when that's ready they ready I feel so bad uh uh uh much love and like I I think I think that I think that Drake has done a lot of a lot of like incredible like dude like when when I was at Berkeley like I was a certified Drake hater for like a minute and then somebody who's like a like a jazz musician came like okay well you can [ __ ] hate him but you have to understand what he's doing and there are stuff there's stuff he's done musically as an artist that is really strong that that that that's great and I do think that as you go along in your career when you have moments where you are at the top of something and doing something at a level nobody else is doing you start to you start to make compromises not even not let's not even talk about cultural compromises but mental health compromises and things that can hurt your judgment when you're moving in spaces like when a beef with Kendrick Lamar comes up you may make a misstep like the hard part six or something like that so I think that I think that there is something to be said about you know operating in a space where success actually becomes a danger for you because you have to have such an he has such an insane output like that guy that guy's Madden every year every year new Drake album of like 40 50 songs to his detriment his detri yeah I will say I like here's the thing right I do like if we were just talking as a person I like that's why I feel the need to emphasize that I am a drake fan all like all things considered right like I'm not a drake hater even though I think this is not going his way right um so it's not that I don't feel any kind of feel bad for him but I think precisely what happened there is people's problem with Drake right is that like no one black people at the culture or hip-hop are not mad at Drake because or or or not arguing that Drake is not a good a good musician or that he's not a talented musician or that he doesn't lots of M musical contributions it's actually precisely what just happen what upsets people I think is when every time there's Drake is so big and Drake is so received by non-black people that when black people want to have a conversation like that substantive conversation about what their gripe is with Drake there are always his non-black fans willing to be like like jump in like but his music and he's good and blah blah blah that sounds racist why are you gay keeping hip-hop and that's exactly what people don't like that's exact saw we just L saw that had a point though that she wanted to make I'm sorry I seam her a little bit I really don't I I just I when you tell when you sit here and talk about somebody can't sleep they got bad gut health that is they're struggling that is all a reflection of of something deeper y'all this is you said spiritual warfare at the beginning of this spiritual warfare this is Lucy M Manifest this is it we're seeing it and like I I think that what's most compelling I'm tired of Drake Drake is a SE 70 Drake is a 37 year old man who I get this this MTO [ __ ] is hard been there done that but you 37 years old and it's time it it not your fault but it's your it is on you his responsibility to root through your mess yeah I think what's more interesting to me I'm so sorry what's more interesting to me we don't have to talk about it is not Drake per se but what I think Rebecca is getting at when she brings up DJ Vlad this is the same type [ __ ] you have put these people on pedestals because for me van wrote this and I was searching for it and I found it he said since the culture remains our B biggest export we sell it y so my thing is how much are we willing to sell where what is the line and that is to me what is been illuminated here and that's what I when I say this is bigger than Drake with Kendrick I think Kendrick is posing this question to everyone like where the [ __ ] do we draw the line because yeah we got to make money we got to do this but there's still some [ __ ] that has to be ours that has to be gate kept and protected and people need to understand that when they're in our space that they need to respect said space and understand that you are a visitor act accordingly there's a a talking vad there's a big difference between Drake and Vlad I'm difference between Drake and Vlad any of those people those type people is that Drake has contributed to the culture in his unique way nobody say I'm not saying that you're denying that but you are you are we we when we combine him with other people who are not who cult why not there a reason why is a reason why the [ __ ] like Vlad and Adam 22s and those people are the ones that you see up there you know caping for Drake and saying what they're saying and making the kind of critiques and having a problem with people specifically I think Vlad is a good example because Vlad really demonstrated really showed his ass this weekend and really showed exactly the problem people have is that not only like you have okay you have no choice that hip-hop has become this thing that other people take part in they like they whatever have you but they have no respect for the idea that black people should be centered in that conversation or that the black experience or what are the tenants of the rules they they and they have a problem with that right because when Vlad went to say whatever he said in that woman quote tweeted and just said you are not black this man is out here trying to get her fired add in Princeton doing this this and the next thing and I think that's a lot of what people have a problem with like Drake's Bas or who are the like this L like who's Drake really trying to speak to which is this his his also academics though like I think academics academics should also catch some of that heat academics entire career is built on the deaths of people in Chicago like I I like I I cannot tell you like if if if if FD hates Drake man I hate academics that man's suffering is my Roman Empire do you understand like I [ __ ] hate that guy when I see a million door Dash orders on his email ooh I know he's suffering like I can't tell you like that guy has done so much damage to Hip Hop as a whole and I got problems with button too and like everything like that with button being all like pissy every single year of his rap career and then acting like I did the best and then having the most mid rap career period after that like like I have problems there but at least button has experience as an MC academics has no experience he's built an entire like industry he's built an entire following off of rumor Mills and like on poisoning people the toxic parts of hipop the following is yeah he's black and then it's proba problematic coming from black people right it's already problematic but I feel like that Vlad is worse I'll give you V Vlad is worse it's not only that Vlad is worse he's white and that audience um that particular audience that this is the audience that I'm talking about with Drake and this is what I think Kendrick was really outlining in his last track that's the correlation I was trying to make thank you and so and so you know so talking about like letting this person in and opening doors for everybody into hip hop is why we have to like you were saying inter that gatekeep not that we they can't when we're having a conversation like this and somebody like Vlad who we know sits down with rappers like booy and brings up problematic things about black people okay as a white man this is about hip hop right and this is very problematic for him to open his mouth and he showed exactly how people move in whiteness um it's almost like oh I can't say the hard ER now I'm going to the manager just a woman a hip-hop professor at Princeton who went to prin Princeton graduated from Princeton um and she made a comment to him saying hey this would be just between black folks you Vlad we know you're problematic and you just saying something stupid as oh he should have went harder on the beat like it went whatever he said and she said you you shouldn't be part of this conversation he was like oh you from you're you're a um a professor at Princeton speaking to white kids is this how you talk to those white kids at Princeton that's where the problem because audience those are people that are talking just like Vlad coming into this conversation and this is where it's very and that's not all of his audience but he does have that side he doesn't speak up he doesn't stop them he does not we don't see Drake in that side where he's like listen no I'm black and we don't they're right this is we never I got to say though I got to say wait wait Z wait Z let me let me jump real quick I gotta say though I I can't fully um I I'm not saying you're doing this Rebecca and Anette but we can't undermine the harm that academics does because he's armed with black think I think she has good I think her is but what I'm saying is um theic is black and it's very problematic we know the black on black we know that he probably the mole we don't know right but um but what I'm saying is these white people joining into this conversation and when they can't or when they say something or when they feel like whatever like oh I can't speak I can't whatever what did he say he's going to go and speak to Princeton to do what because all she said as a hip hop as somebody who can speak on this as a as like just because she said he can't speak on it he said he's going to go to Princeton to do what now to basically get her fired yeah he went stra rebecc Rebeca I'm sorry my camera turned off but I wanted to ask I want to I I totally hear what you're saying and I want to ask no I know it's like my my camera's overheating I didn't want to ask one question Rebecca real quickly did you feel do you feel like that cuz I I hear you 100% on that the only thing I would say in that in that regard is like uh cuz I agree with you just out of curiosity do you guys feel the same way about Adam 22 cuz I feel he would qualify in that regard too not to not to not to take this conversation away from would he be spared of course do mean they all can get it I just I guess I just really hate academics like like ad because here's the thing I just have a I have a deep frustration academics should know better yeah academics should know better frustrated with academics but I don't I have I have really complicated Nuance feelings on academics right because like there there's again as a as a black immigrant I like I always I understand there's I find it very frustrating the way people act like the way there's an American exceptionalism to conversations about Blackness that acts like everybody [ __ ] else ain't black like the way like and so I don't like and I don't like that whenever people get one non-american black person whose black Consciousness ain't up to par they act like they're representative of everybody else and they will completely dismiss all the black people America black Caribbean people or black foreigners that Americans love to embrace cuz they never question Nicki Minaj's americanness they have no problem question they don't question biggy smalls's americanness you know what I mean but when they don't like somebody that becomes the leading narrative right so like there is a part of no I know I have issues but I have no no no I have M come on you know come on give me credit you know I'm getting look it so like so there's that right but like and I and I as somebody I guess if you create a platform and content creating and stuff I want to give credit to what his academics having built you know a platform from his college College uh uh dorm room and a certain amount of work ethic work ethic for evil and not doing things work ethic for evil I think academics has a has a particularly and he's he's going more into it I was actually happy to hear him explicitly say it the other day I think he's going to to make like a right-wing pivot shift from you this Rumble and all of all of the things that he's doing and misogynistic and what happens to is he gets the most attention when he's being the [ __ ] worst like there are other times and content throughout academics this time when he's purely just talking hip-hop or's just talking numbers or where he has moments where you think oh I see why this [ __ ] has a platform or he could be valuable like I'm not that he's never made great cont but Jesus Christ can he be just but I think we we as consumers need to take accountability as well like there's a reason why his most salacious moments are the ones that go viral M that's what I'm saying thank you Mom and is a problem the problem with the culture is not even just with the artists it's with the consumers themselves if if what we value is the [ __ ] the bullshit's going to rise to the top and the people who are authentic and the people that do care are always gonna get the short end of the stick so it's like I with him I it's whatever you choose to pay attention to there's you can easily mute or block academics majority of people have not done so right and what I want to ask you guys is can you be black and a culture vulture oh hell yeah absolutely absolutely that's what I'm saying I want people to just to give people their culture vulture uh uh indictments and and indict people's Consciousness and what they're doing without trying to act as though they aren't black without trying to like create this exclusionary idea of because that's what's happening with this conversation is every time it goes to culture vulture it goes straight to white boy Jew these these little call Drake I I'm like I am not started calling him a white boy I haven't said that I feel like he shifts from like black to I feel like Drake is always black he's a particular kind of black person to his Advantage doing whatever the [ __ ] he want to do right like I said that in the last episode that no matter how Drake a relationship to Blackness the world receives Drake as a black person wh is not associated just with being white though we have to be really clear whiteness is own thing it's a way of being it's are you harmful are are are you rooted in exploitation that is whiteness do you wield your powers for evil that is white I wouldn't I wouldn't classify that although although white people are the major not white people white completely l hey guys guys actually I got to I got to go right now I just wanted to say I really really appreciate the conversation and thank you for letting me be in this space uh is the only Indian person right here uh and and I'm sorry if I interrupted too much but I I really appr apprciate you being here this is a one time thing no one tell me in the comments what non black person you'd like to see on here is not going to happen this was a one I came in here with a h pass and that's all I appreciate you guys thank you guys so much he's great um but no I was going to say but that's what I say when I say you know it's not that he's half white but he does benefit from he literally operates in whiteness he can he can get up and be like yeah I don't feel like this is this is my thing this is not my This Is Not My Vibe Kendrick can't do the same his audience knows that but he knows and I'm talking about Kendrick's audience versus Drake's Drake's um audience can literally he has that spe specific audience that operates in whiteness if they feel like they aren't included in something they will that reminds me oh y'all were supposed to Marlin cuz that made me of the point like I think Drake actually made it worse for himself in this battle with certain things he said like like the slave line like kind of these so you don't want to that's a matter of um a lack of self-awareness yeah I think it's a lack of selfawareness and I think but also I think once you are as polarizing and as large of a figure as he is you there's no way for you to to be uh for everyone in a sense and he's trying his best to be for everyone and in that he's it's a detriment to him I I think it's cuz he has a lot of deep rooted anti-blackness I think Drake's biggest problem is that the the clip I had never seen before of him on a date uh with some white woman and he's imitating Toronto SL that was a he was on a he was on a a show that was those are other actors there's three other actors on the thing with him at this oh so is that genuine what what do you mean or was like a reality show or no it was it was genuine it was genuine but I but what I will say is especially when in regards to and I am in no way defending this the blackface moment right the forgot about I don't know how yeah me neither everywhere right now with that he he talks about his struggles of getting into the acting world and um not being accepted a large in a large part because he was right and he's saying that that whole picture although poorly [ __ ] executed was to protest and bring awareness to Black actors and there's a few things so with especially with that blackface picture there's a shirt that he's wearing that a lot of people were pointing out oh my God is that a Jim Crow bird on his sweater and it was like it made it 10 times worse but there's a a brand in Toronto I don't know if you guys have heard it it made some waves in America called two black guys right and what they would do is they'd parody the old civil rights uh imagery and Negro League stuff and make merch out of it and that was a part of that now when you can when you join that with that moment that you saw where he's like oh Toronto slang is it's getting worse Toronto slang is Toronto slang is um ignorant or whatever that was him trying to fit in once again and just stepping on himself in order to fit into a crowd that clearly doesn't [ __ ] with them but I want I want to elaborate though like when we talking about antiblackness it's important to recognize that all of us operate in that or and and are or at best are in persistent resistance of it because the world is anti and we are a part of the world and you can't grow up in America or Canada in most places I assume and not see what how Blackness is depicted and develop negative sentiment and reflexive attitudes towards but if you never unpack that and then you become a rapper that's a that's a that's a recipe for stomach issues right and and and not sleeping well because somebody said that Drake isn't a somebody said this one of my comments they said Drake isn't a rapper Drake is a voice actor and I think that is a incredibly profound read on him because it speaks to the fact that the reason why Drake clout jumps so much is because he's playing different characters y for different people exactly exactly definition of whiteness for me has a lot to do a whiteness and application the way I see whiteness function in my real life is in terms of expectation like even with like white people I work with or white organizers or white activists or white whatever whenever they're talking about their feelings or what it is that they want to do it has a lot to do what where I see their whiteness shine is what they expect you know how affronted they are by what they expect and what they also think that they can ask for right and it's like black people have a very black people are trying to survive black people deal with a world that is anti-black a world that is unkind to black people and black people basically try to get in where we fit in that is a very black experience it's a very white experience to like when white people have their one their their one plight whatever issue whatever have you their metric for expect what they expected to receive from The World Is So High by by virtue of being in a white world that they are [ __ ] outraged by like the smallest thing to me to even hear a drake feel like this was him protesting feeling like he was having a hard time breaking into the acting world because he was black as actor I'm like [ __ ] how many child stars you know cuz Drake was a child I'm like Drake I I was watching the grassy you were a theg grassy star I was watching in the bombas as when I was a kid and when you were a kid so even his metric of you know what I mean like what is it his sense of expectation it's like whenever Drake is telling us what his plight is it's like we're supposed to ignore the part where he already has so much more than the average person pursuing what ever the [ __ ] it is that he's pursuing it's like I hear you I understand I believe that you do walk through a world in which you have to deal with problems and pight and and navigate and stuff too but it's like ultimately Drake be out here eating high off the hog to us like oh you see they didn't give me the whole hog that where I have oh so go ahead sorry apologies no go ahead please um does anybody realize how bad he lost before this any this even started the this whole conversation has been an indictment of Drake it is it has less been about this battle the music the strategy any of it it's more about character it's more about relationship it's more about culture and to me that's disheartening because the boy just thought he was going against somebody that had some rat beef with him and turned looked at a community that he desperately wanted to be a part of it's such a good story I'm about to get 3 million views off this [ __ ] oh I'm about to tell the [ __ ] out this story cuz that's beautiful like you're right I'm I'm not interrupting you to like to disagree you are so correct imagine being at the top of your game failing internally and then realizing oh I'm this [ __ ] Caesar nobody likes me but Tahoe that's where I'm like I I don't dis I I agree with you I also think that is we have to give Kendrick some credit to the strategy because Kendrick knew exactly what to use to make it about this that as soon as Euphoria dropped everybody was like oh [ __ ] these are the things that I've been feeling and I'm and there's and I gotta be honest there's a lot of people still rocking with Drake and they getting on my [ __ ] nerves but it's a lot of people like he won he this I get it I want for the child star thing I think is really important that that is where I have sympathy and empathy for Drake that is where I'm like I don't know if you really had a chance to be as self-aware and reflective cuz we all know that world is weird and it does not surprise me that he's having inappropriate seemingly allegedly having inappropriate relationships with young women I would say I I've the relationship with Millie Bob Bobby Brown who nobody brought up but he brought up wasn't appropriate it felt strange so whether you're having sex with her or not it felt strange it feels to me like there's some [ __ ] that he really needs to heal from again I don't wish him demise I don't wish him hurt I wish him healing I wish for him to take a beat and to think about what his relationship with his father actually is who these people why you have so many questionable people around you who have different cases that's weird why you have animosity towards men making the stallion like what is this weird [ __ ] that you have going on take a beat and then come and unack he needs to unpack a lot there's a there's a lot of deeply rooted issues that come out in his music and it's like I think it's a lot uh easier for us to see because it like for example I when I was depressed in 2017 I didn't know I was depressed until I came out of it and went oh look I that wasn't me you know what I mean and so sometimes when you're in it and you surrounded by Yes Men it's very hard for you to gain that self-awareness and especially when saying yes is the Crux of you getting more things from him more opportunities you how many people are really going to go up against him and tell them no you know what I mean like we're seeing what it takes what happens when you don't have a true Circle that cares about your well-being more than their gain so Kendrick said you D the only guy that could have helped you could helped you dog is the moral story authenticity right because I think I first of all I think I want to say I think I've come around to like feeling like a sympathy towards Drake um like as a as a person right like not in terms of what the cultural indictment is but just as a person because two things I guess like like when you say like oh I have a lot of sympathy for him like when you think about as a child star and never get an opportunity and and normally normally or entertainers that have been child stars we do have that conversation around them and sympathy towards them but in the case of Drake Drake has gone out of his way to give us personas you know what I mean like Drake has wanted to divorce himself so much from his having ever been an actor or Jimmy or these things that he doesn't feel like isn't line with the hip-hop image so we never really get to see him in that lens to give him that sympathy but to his but to be fair that's not an indictment of him because like you say I guess you know growing up in that if I don't know what it is to be you know Drake or to be like I'm mix kid or whatever have you or whatever he's dealing whatever World he's navigating in to be a star to be in an inter in in in an entertainment industry where you have to like navigate what is like white people a white world this is guy on the grass he and how all of these things could compound how you feel the need to perform and like by the time you never make any true trip he just had to be Persona after Persona and navigate his entertainment industry so I can understand how that would be a lot and sympathize for him so I guess the larger message here is like I don't I don't hate Drake I'm not ruding or Drake to die or anything like that I'm like I guess this is the importance of being authentic which is I guess Kendrick's ultimate indictment in general he said like I like it when you make your little pop [ __ ] stop trying to be 21 Savage you know what I mean like and also for all of us though sorry for all of us to look at ourselves all of us and who we support and why yeah definitely and I think also for me from uh just a Canadian perspective I had sympathy for his early years of into the rap game knowing how he had to navigate knowing he wasn't the street guy but he had to act like he was or surround himself with people that were because otherwise he wouldn't be taken seriously and then there's the stories about t uh who is it TI's friend peeing on his foot like there's so many different moments that create a villain origin story for this guy very early on in his career that when that turn happens I don't think we should be surprised I don't think we should be surprised there are too many instances where he was I'm not even going to say bullied but there were moments where he was bulled he was othered you know what I mean and he was othered into turning into the guy that you see him now and that's from a woman and relationship perspective that's from a black perspective that's from a man perspective that's from a thug perspective all these different way aspects were questioned when he first came in the game to the point where when he got the money and gave the hits it's like who can talk to me but but you know what makes him not but you know what makes him not the rightful King and right and what makes him really white and let me make this argument I see a lot of artists have to do a lot of [ __ ] or navigate a bunch of things that they don't feel like it's true to their character and integrity early on and when they get to a place in their career where they're truly at the top that's where you see them Define themselves as what they want to be Raheem if you go on top of that me and you'll have a problem like you see them like Define themselves by what they're what they want to be right like think about that the in j.cole's image when he first came out think about workout or even how J.Cole himself told you how he felt about that and Let Nas Down and how j.cole's image and self change when jcole had the freedom to be J.Cole think about how Kendrick U evolved even think about a Jay-Z right so it's like why is Drake at the top for as long as he has and has so much power so much flexibility and at what point is he ever going to decide to be Drake himself rather than a different Persona he's decided to like wear for the moment yeah so I feel like um I I understand like that it's all great and dandy and they do have issues and even the issues that Drake named about Kendrick what what do we have the empathy for Kendrick about like with those things like his whole um him being molested U all of these things he was molested that was a Mis misom but his has his childhood tra here what I'm saying yes um but even with Kendrick you know with with his Artistry and how he is people judge um judge that I mean they put him in the hotep like you said what was he like one from one black hat from being whatever one colorful hat from being whole tap I don't know but that's you know with Kendrick Lamar and um so the same story can go for Kendrick Lamar his issues him coming up in the game and having the struggles I feel like you know could I say one may have been easier than the others you know yeah um could I say that because one um had a little bit of white privilege in it yeah but that's not you know we can all day talk about those things anet me mentioned that he's 37 now and yes they have their villain origins there's there's things that do happen but I feel like at this stage of the game when you have made it when what is the excuse for you to be this way anymore like now you've severed your relationships with people it can't just be one per it's like mad people that are after you or wanting wanting blood but Kendrick is really going in but your relationships with multiple artists that you've worked with and have given hits to um they're they don't they don't they don't [ __ ] with you they trust you there has to be a reason why and so um you know if you're just going to go with that Persona then stick with that but I feel feel like at this point it can't be the wo is me thing I don't want to do that about wo is me and I feel I feel bad you know Tahoe I didn't say your name I didn't I'm just saying I'm just saying generally but I do feel bad that um you know I do my my per the person in me feels bad like dang I know he's just sitting there like dang I just lost this thing I just man I I feel like I feel that but then again it's like you are going to have to answer for some of your actions right for every action there's a reaction um you know and I think that will see I don't think this will be the end of Drake again I'm somebody who listens to Drake often like like you Olay I know more Drake tracks and I do Kendrick but I respect Kendrick's Artistry I can say that for sure Kendrick's Artistry is is better when it comes to rap or hip-hop but you know I don't think this will be the end of Drake but I do think he does need to take a step back and kind of really but find himself and come out as himself I think Drake's going to [ __ ] around give us a dark fantasy in like two years which would be dope it'd be interesting see him like go deep and be an artist again but I wanted to switch gears a little bit and and what did the kids say g g Kendrick glaz glaze um what is the the fundamentals of that term glaz is it like donut is it like Dicker okay that's whatever so as the as the as the probably the biggest Kendrick fan I I want to take a moment the thing I appreciate the most about Kendrick is how he pay so much tribute to black Aesthetics uh sonically and thematically in his stuff and for him to start this whole thing out after like that of course with a Teddy Pendergrass track and then start the next joint out with a um uh Al Green joint and then you see the and then you see the CD case that people have and it's called back to back back to back um and it's like the just the the voices he does people make fun of the voices and they can be a little goofy but the voices he does are the voices he heard growing up I know [ __ ] that talk like that right I think a lot of us do especially in it's probably a California version of course I know a Chicago version of those V vocal inflections um uh just like and then finally the masterful straight out of some like corny 48 Laws of Power [ __ ] straight out of a movie with a plot twist at the end way that he has constructed this Victory to to because we don't know when them pictures that picture was taken right we don't know when he got that [ __ ] Drake said it was four days I doubt it Drake was too busy filming a [ __ ] music video but the fact that Drake spent millions of of dollars to do a treatment to film a music video got jewelry made Millions it's crazy you don't think you how how much do you think it cost him to film that video in four days I'm from Toronto it cost him Dirt Cheap well half part of was filmed in La though no no it was all filmed in Toronto well hundreds of thousands of dollars which is still a whole lot of [ __ ] money that's still a lot hundreds of thousands to do that he he spent hundreds of thousands to film a video in a 4-day window to have it get all of 15 minutes to shine yeah sucked that was horrible that was horrible took the wind out of sales immediately I was in Taho tax immediately like bro I'm sitting here doing an episode and my cousin said the boy dropped I'm like yeah is it good he's like yes it's lit it's lit I'm like bet bet so I'm sitting here I'm trying to get through the episode I'm I'm I'm I'm the host or I'm like all right so what's your name you know where you from how can people find you and before I could get that out my cousin hit me again nah Kendrick Kendrick dropped again so I'm sitting there looking at them and then I look at my phone and I'm looking like and I type what you mean he dropped again I said nah I yo I and I and I kid you not I love Drake's music period I don't even think I listen to Drake's song more than once that night because I was trying to break down meet the grham so much so I was literally like yo what is this and then the idea of what just happened like came over my body it was a very dark feeling like nobody else in hip-hop that's why I said before last week when I was like Kendrick is the best songwriter in hip-hop history not necessarily L Lyricist but songwriter nobody else in hip-hop can do that n it's not even song it's the moment it's the moment like that's still part of the song it's actually let me tell you what I think what I like appreciate is incredible and I'm sure anybody who creates any kind of content will appreciate you know when you make a hit like you make a hit video or something or you make something you just and you know like it almost feels like ah any whatever you post after that it's going to be a drop off like it can't be like the same kind of you can't do you're not going to have your three hit videos watch it in like Euphoria like if I were me like when I have a big appearance like when I did my Eric Adams interview I really don't want to do [ __ ] else after that I'm like what are the odds like you know what I mean like everything else after that is just like a setup to fail right to watch him do Euphoria and create the amount of energy that we felt around Euphoria like this is crazy then to how we felt when meet the grams just took the [ __ ] wind out of out of Family Matter s and then to again not like us and that that's incredible you know like that create days that's incredible like to have that many like heaters like set up for oh my God this the best battle in Rapid in four days and it just s like he went in the booth and just he didn't it was like don't clean this up Let it Be it's going we going to do one take like that's just what it was like C can can we have the argument that Family Matters isn't that good yet no I'm not having that AR absolutely song is good I don't no f okay my song is it's a great song I mean as a discs as a listen to me mar what theep on Family Matters sorry um no you can talk an I just want us to appreciate I don't know like how crazy not like us goes like I I don't I don't think you in the name of hate is crazy that s so [ __ ] like step in the name of hate my boyfriend up he was sleep like you don't understand how locked in we've been to this this Dragon Kendrick [ __ ] all weekend he had just fallen asleep for a nap and I was like hit to the chest Kendrick dropped he was like yo uh when we play that he's like thank you thank you for waking me up I was like all listen when I said I was in the house like in Tahoe text like yeah [ __ ] get your mic oh I knew it was over I knew it was over and I told my cousin I said listen there's nothing left Drake can't come back from this over oh my God it's a I left I left a party that I was in cuz I see my Twitter going crazy like wake up wake up and I'm like what's going on so I I see he dropped another track so I I tweeted I'm like is this worth leaving the party to listen to like do I got to find a quiet place right now everyone's like Tell The DJ to put it on [ __ ] [ __ ] doing all that Tell The DJ to play it I'm like I immediately was like oh no it's a Club Banger oh God Banger oh God he did it and once you know it's a Club Banger line dance it's it's what he did to Meek where it's like you are going to have to hear this and see people appreciate it in person for a year the amount of times today I said freaky ass [ __ ] you a 69 everybody say oh IET was going to say something that's what's crazy is like it's kind of weird that it's like a pedophile Club Bank it's like wait a minute it's an anti pedophile I know but it's just like for too long in my life to clutch my pearls now CU yeah it was like we really gonna be screaming out a [Music] miners [ __ ] word I will rap dead wrong so I can't I think I was what I was gonna say though was for Family Matters I ain't gonna say Drake was wasn't rapping on it but his misstep was that he included everybody else like that [ __ ] but K doesn't have that problem that's the thing Drake has didn't have to have he didn't have to have that he started Rick Ross has been going crazy online rck heavyweight fight that's what you focus on what doing because these are his friends former friend everybody saying Drake is two Taps into the computer that's his [ __ ] problem he he tapped into everybody being like Oh it's almost seven minutes of hate so he felt like he needed to make a longer track and he didn't have that much content on Kendrick Rock Rocky got it worse than Kendrick did on that track in my opinion he Rocky more than Kendrick I think it's easier because of the perception of Rocky and his career right now in terms of when it comes to rap I disagree when it comes to rap if you're lazy talk about Kendrick being a Hebrew Israelite talk about his talk about his limited actual analysis on black issues talk about all the [ __ ] he talked about he brought he brought up his his support of R Kelly everybody later after would have brought it up when Drake himself had to yeah and Drake himself had to pay for forri who supported R Kelly but see how we attribute teams when it's Kendrick but we don't attribute teams when it's Drake you think Drake set do you think Drake set the season assist or do you think Drake's team set the season assist oh I'm so I might be te but I absolutely believe that Drake had a part in that cease and assist and and can make that call don't believe that Kendrick had a had a role in trying to get R Kelly to stay on the platform and that he's going to take his music or Tupac's voice I didn't say the Tupac thing wasn't that's a possibility but I don't think right I don't think Kendrick's aligning with R Kelly Kendrick wins Kendrick wins in the also because he's four the f [ __ ] people y'all he he stuck up for Serena and then he took his [ __ ] copyright off the [ __ ] so people can make money while Kendrick is flagging people's videos while Drake is flagging people's videos while Drake's people are flagging people's videos kendri having no ads on his YouTube video for like not like us like you could just run it like I'm so like I was like you know I I really appreciate cuz I know what that's like like oh he a [ __ ] up on my content with run like you know what I mean [ __ ] into the ground is that y'all not realizing that this really [ __ ] with him he even spoke on his emotional issues with future like yo I didn't even want that happen Metro Woman made that happen like yo he's it's actually like a yo future call mebl this is actually you talking about Drake or or kendri I'm talking about Drake would y'all not realizing this is a human this guy is really going through the Kendrick has one feeling hat that's not true you listen to Kendrick that's not true if Drake weren't so guilty of the things that he was being accused of would have an entire black World willing to sympathize with him like on what it is to feel othered especially like within like black people who are in America right like I'm imigrant I'd be all for I feel you I really do have some sympathy for being othered except like you again you can have it both ways Dre can't want to be the king and want to be the top dog and also want us to always give him this like Underdog sympathy I just can't I I think the underground I think the underground thing comes from and he's spoken on this a couple times namely in that Rap Radar uh podcast that he did uh where he speaks on you know people always bring up black Excellence but he's never in that conversation cuz you other yourself too Drake what are you talking about black what are you talking about himself if I heard like Excellence I would never other myself I would never think that but it's because I don't embody that other [ __ ] it's because I am firmly clear about who I am and how I move and my lineage and and the culture that I associate with Drake is not rooted in anything so of gonna feeled when does he do white white is wh white we're we're talking what we're talking about strictly with music right like he's talking in regards to music at what at what point was Drake white in music we're not saying that this is his argument this is his argument his argument is just about the music let me push that out there Drake you mentioned spent every summer in Memphis Drake went and got swagged from Houston swag from Atlanta and did all these things to take on the black Aesthetics it's that classic line they want our Rhythm but not our Blues so when [ __ ] is popping off for black people in America the top rapper in the game even a goo goofball MAA hat wearing dude like Wayne now when Katrina happened was opened his MTH and has something to say about black people's Issues Drake on the other hand has does not see color has never has never put his money where his mouth is literally ain't but four bars in the history of his entire catalog one of the most prolific cataloges of the last 15 years where he said yo what about black people about struggle about anything none of that because that would alienate that maximized white audience he has and that's what for for me specifically that is what has always bothered me about Drake because Drake being Drake is Flow Rider Drake and florado have the same content apparatus the same overall thematic uh forces behind their music and Flow Rider is not mentioned in hip-hop and Drake was the king of it for a decade that is a problem and do you think that okay so for example what you in speaking on how he doesn't ever bring in up like black issues was that indictment ever put against Michael Jordan yeah he was white he was white to people AB no no not white not white he was an up negro he was a [ __ ] that wasn't speaking up he was an up negro but he wasn't Opera whiteness but we've said that but the difference is Michael Jordan don't have a white mom so it's too easy dog Michael Jord Michael Jordan couldn't switch lanes when he felt like he had had a to the argument is about speaking on the issues the argument isn't it's not just that it's more nuanced than that as somebody who can pass if I wanted to walk around and wield my whiteness I would hope that people would snatch my ass up in the same [ __ ] way I'm telling you I've been I have family members that like want to require that [ __ ] of me and it's beef that and I and I'm T toes down in who I am this is not something that I feel that we can Drake to be based off of Old footage based off of [ __ ] that he said just based off of how he moves it feels weird it feels like he's wielding some [ __ ] and at the same time not using his power to further help and assist the community that he wants to be included in so bad that he really should be a part of but it's to me it's the white mom thing is so secondary to all this is how you move and Mel has absolutely caught [ __ ] Tim Scott has absolutely caught [ __ ] Candice Owens has absolutely caught [ __ ] I can we can go down the list of [ __ ] that we like academic we can go down a list of people who have two black ass parents who are still like you embody whiteness and you are a problem in our community and until you get that straight you're not [ __ ] welcomed here yeah yeah cuse C kind of sorry Brea real quickly so did we call Michael Jordan White no we call him a [ __ ] right right and like that is a distinction you can only get when you're black but it gives it's giving the same uh relative purpose within like um critiquing a black person's Behavior toward black issues when you are operating a whiteness or cooning or being antiblack or just trying to get greater proximity to whiteness because you got money because you got clout because you got fame or you want or you just want it or you just hate that skin on your your body so much that you refuse to be in it as much as you can you it's the same thing it's just different you know different gr different Pokemon do we think that Drake is equipped to speak on the issues yeah if he if he wants to be he's not stupid he can make it happen he's got the people around him and he's got more he has more um if from what I ascertain he has more connection to it than the average Canadian because he grew up in he he spent summers in Memphis we not going to act like [ __ ] don't go down in Canada either I would love for him to speak about issues in Canada what's going on I personally don't want him to because I I don't think he's equipped and I don't think I don't care to hear something happens like if I don't care to personally hear that from Drake I go to Drake for a certain thing and he fits that mold for me and that's the thing artist is where I go to yeah exactly it goes right back to stay there I don't think Drake needs to because again I'm always clients I don't like when celebrities uh speak up and [ __ ] right like and more importantly I do think if it weren't Drake if it weren't if if there had been a if it had been someone who didn't have these kinds of indictments or if Drake himself had like a kind of like racial analysis there are ways that you could indict Kendrick right because Kendrick is somebody who had I've talked to FD about this before Kendrick is somebody who's had a bunch of he had a bunch of black on black crime ass views that black the same black people criticizing Drake would criticize him for and then when he got criticism for it he came with the pimple butterfly and that [ __ ] just got everybody just never talked about it again so there are like areas of attack for Kendrick Drake is just not the person who's capable of making them right um and I don't think Drake needs to be I don't think that Drake needs to suddenly act like he he is woke or he knows anything or he's the one to speak on anything black or anything like that I don't I don't think that's the issue lots of black people decide to go do their [ __ ] or go do their entertainment or their Artistry and just it' be whatever right like it has a a more neutral pallet right than it is black it's that it's the costume wearing it's it's that it's not that he's making his neutral like I think that's the issue is like he's not attacking like take care or anything even necessarily like it's not like you were talking about him making his bubble buum pop it's the fact that he's wearing like he's with 21 Savage and them acting like he run with them like he's uh making music with whomever artist he gets and he starts to act as though like he starts literally giving you a different Persona and telling you a bunch of [ __ ] and involving himself in in turn and in turn involving himself in [ __ ] that he doesn't need to be in I think Dr would be fine people would have would wouldn't have these particular critiques for Drake if Drake just went and chilled out [ __ ] let the we can't be Canadian in peace all the time a know I mean but the whole perception of Drake not being Street uh I think is a little skewed because like I think at first when he first came in the game absolutely like he's not that guy he's definitely not that guy now agree like I'm from Toronto I know what it is he's definitely that guy and it's hard for people to believe and I get it because of how he came in but you got to also realize when we talk about those villag villain origin stories he's been he's turned into this guy he wasn't always this guy which is the same reason why women have completely done a 180 on Drake because before he spoke to the women like in a in a way different light than he speaks to them now and it's it's a part of that personality change it's a part of that jadedness is what Anon said he needs to go away unpack heal and have a healed perspective because what he's everything he's rooted in right now is coming from a hurt place you hear it in every single song he don't trust nobody around him he hates women like it's just a number of things that have and also we cannot act like his position is not unique to The Human Experience period where he is is not normal and it should never be looked at as normal and I don't I don't know how to navigate that I couldn't tell him how to navigate that but what the position that he's in no one should be that famous and to and also understand that what you're asking him to unpack from has become his shield from all of the things that's happened to him before this is the safest he's ever felt and who's to say who's to say that what he's done hasn't how he is isn't why he's where he's at in his mind this has really become his bag where he was lost for all of that time he was lost for all that time and now he's suffering from a place where he used to Envy others they envy him he's feeling like yo oh y'all don't like me now now y'all know how it [ __ ] feels when y'all wanted to be where I'm at so and and the women remember early in the game how much he would talk about how the women didn't like him yep remember how that was his thing he was crying on every song now I'm him now I'm him you want him to go heal into what and his question hey I got I gotta still crying let me let me get this last joint off I gotta get going too okay so I wanted to I'm here so the thing going going back to something I said earlier the thing with Drake and him speaking on issues isn't like if Drake wanted to just do take care over and over again you know what I'm saying never was the same over and over again he would had a great hip-hop career he would have been he had fans that that was their goat that was their favorite rapper from from whatever window of time it's that Drake wanted to run he wanted the throne he wanted to be all things to all people and he got it and that's the real big thing for for people like me for hardcore haters like me it's that great it's that Drake got the throne it was like in Game of Thrones when people realiz Joffrey was not a barathan it's like what the [ __ ] you mean this bastard is on the throne you know what I'm saying and so like and that is that is the big thing specifically with the speaking on black issues stuff is or representing black people and black interests within hip-hop culture because for all the critiques I got I got critiques for Kendrick I got critiques for Jay-Z anybody that's been in that spot for a minute a Kan [ __ ] got critiques for him not a perfect structure culture around how that works but for Drake it was so blatant it was so blatantly obvious that he was not on that throne in our interest he was on that throne and his interest which meant the interest of the very white very uninterested in Black issues fan base it might as well been mamore it would have been better if it was mamore up there mamore out here doing uh anti- Palestine [ __ ] just Dro like I just saw that on Twitter you know anti-israel [ __ ] I'm sorry fix that out I'm get me um but yeah so like it the thing here for me has always been about the best interest of hip-hop as flawed and troubled as hip-hop is and I I actually think this has the chance to either be a like a a healthy reset or the beginning of the end it may not go that well after this point will not well not for Drake but like Drake was kind of too big to fit yeah you know what I'm saying he was like Fanny May Freddy Mack um of Hip Hop at this point as a as as the major as a major like hip-hop might end up like rock and roll where it's only people that are really into it and old heads that are making making like big waves about it and everything else is afro beat and I don't know dream pop or some [ __ ] that I don't know nothing about all right y' I love y'all peace and blessing and you know what I'm I'm going wrap it up on that note we [Music]
