They get away with it because many people, wrongfully, assume blacks are naturally progressive due to civil rights. The truth is, they can act just like bigoted/racists white supremacists, neoliberals and fascists. There are also many religious fundamentalist among us.\n\nWe see it with corrupt legislators in the CBC like Hakeem Jefferies and Clyburn. We see the backing of corporate and neoliberal ideologies with Obama and Oprah. We see the authoritarian side in policing with the Terry Nichols murder.\n\nIt would be criminal if West didn't point this out.

It's all just establishment lies that many of you keep falling for.\n\nThese propagandist normalize horrible Republican ideas that Corporate Dems sell you, like endless wars and tax cuts for the rich. They also sell the idea that Dems have no power, whether they have a 58-60 seat majority in the Senate or 50-52 seats.\n\nThese Corporate Dems help privatize public schools and cut housing funding like BLACK mayor Adams. It's a black Corporate Dem in Atlanta who is trying to build Cop City and destroy the forest.\n\nA lot of you who can't stop supporting Corporate Dems are just as cultish as MAGA. Even when Corporate Dems show you who they are; you still can't stop.\n\nBiden just appointed one of the biggest war criminals in history, Elliot Abrams but even this information won't sway many. He has kept many of Trump's immigration policies, kept DeJoy at the post office and continues endless wars all over the globe.\n\nWest's and Bernie's politics are almost the same as MLK's and The Black Panther Party. I say almost because MLK and the Panther's were further to the left. West and Bernie are centrists.\n\nI'm not here to sway you because there is a certain segment of us in the black community who refuse to see Corporate Dems for what they are. I think Corporate Dems are more insidious; they come with smiles while normalizing policies that hurt us the most.\n\nI can run off a list of at least 20 horrible Republican policies they've brought over the finish line.\n\nTo each his own.",

But there are ALSO neoliberals of all colors from Chuck Todd to Joy Ann Reid who cynically weaponized the Bernie Bro narrative to protect the billionaire class that controls both parties and is crushing workers and the poor. Let's have an honest conversation about racism and sexism on the left, but let's also talk about capitalism and imperialism among elite liberals who dismiss the left with class reductionism charges, erasing leftists of color and shutting down critiques of an evil exploitative system.

The ones glorified can still partner with war criminals like Elliot Abrams, Kissinger and liars like Larry Summers. Even MLK had a 63% unfavorable rating. 70% of Americans thought Saddam Hussein was responsible for 9/11.\n\nThe white liberals are much easier to dupe. All you have to do is put a black face on the most horrible, right wing idea and sell it as progressive. We saw Clyburn do it, we saw Obama do it by trying to cut Social Security, making the Bush Tax Cuts permanent and pushing the TPP (NAFTA on steroids, signed by a Corporate Dem).\n\nWhen a strong voice comes along and talks about the horrors of American Empire abroad and within, there is always a panel of pundits who swear to be progressive there to stop them. It's this same black bourgeoisie thinking that helped make MLK unpopular, as well as white liberals. \n\nIt's so infuriating and disappointing to watch people who could be allies side with legislators and policies that undermine our interests. MAGAs aren't the only cult. For instance, as a leftist I tried for years to tell my liberal friends how horrible Cuomo was but to no avail. He had to hit rock bottom and cause serious damage for them to see. this same group supports Whitmer; who is undermining justice for Flint. \n\nI really can't understand why smart people are easily swayed into supporting the wrong people.",

All of you are using  talking points of conservative Democrats (i.e.: Republicans). This is exactly why nothing can get done. No one running for president can come out and say I'm only going to be doing things that benefit black people. The fact that you're letting Olay, an immigrant, lead you right off the cliff, when she's not even an American, tells you how ignorant and young you still are.  dr Cornell West running as Cornell West for president 2024 is the perfect person to break up the Republican and Democrat Monopoly of our election process. No more will we be voting democrat or Republican only. \n\nAs for your comments that Dr Cornell West is supporting somebody who sexually assaulted someone, have you heard of Donald Trump? Have you heard of Joe Biden? Both have sexual allegations against them' and Trump's been convicted civilly for his part in sexual harassment. So what is your issue with voting for Cornell West for president? Because somebody is being \"accused\", not convicted of sexual harassment that has nothing to do with him?  Any party that he would join the head of that party has sexual allegations against them. We're supposed to not vote for him because of that? \n\nPlease grow up. Please do your research. How can he run for president. Below tells you how a write-in candidate or a third-party candidate registers if they run for president. I will be writing-in Dr. Cornel's West on my ballot along with hundreds of thousands of other Americans. Because Cornel West is not just for black people; he is for all people poor, poverty stricken  and the middle class. If you don't understand that then you understand nothing about the man.  We're not looking for perfection. We're looking for somebody who is decent who understands our issues and who will represent all of us, all races.\n\nState by state shows how Cornell West will run, and hopefully wins, the presidency listed below along with the source so you can go and check it out for yourself. Stop sitting up here talking nonsense with Olay, a Republican immigrant--and if she didn't migrate to this country her elder relatives did--who does not qualify for reparations.\n\nSource:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write-in_candidate#:~:text=of%20draft%20campaign.-,Write%2Din%20candidates%20may%20have%20to%20register%20as%20candidates,official%20candidates%20before%20the%20election.    Accessed on: 06/11/23\n\nUNITED STATES - The requirements to appear on the general election ballot as an independent candidate or to have write-in votes counted vary by state and by political office sought.\n\nForty-one states and the District of Columbia allow write-in votes on their ballots, including for president; Arkansas, New Mexico and South Carolina allow write-in candidates for some offices but not for president; Mississippi allows write-in votes only to substitute a candidate listed on the ballot who was removed, withdrew or died; Hawaii, Louisiana, Nevada, Oklahoma and South Dakota do not allow any write-in votes. Most of the jurisdictions allowing write-in votes require that the write-in candidates register by a certain date for their votes to be counted. Typically this registration consists only of a declaration of candidacy, but some states also require signatures of a certain number of voters, additional paperwork or fees. The deadline to register as a write-in candidate is usually later than to petition to be listed on the ballot.\n\nInstead of listening to Olay, an immigrant who does not qualify for reparations, lead you all off the cliff do your homework do your research. All of you sitting up there know that Dr Cornell West cannot run a campaign for the presidency saying, \"I'm only for black people in America to hell with everybody else.\". Black people aren't enough to vote him in. So why would he only be just for black people?  and the majority of you young people don't even bother to vote. All y'all do is sit up there and run y'all mouth. But when it comes time to actually vote, \"Oh I forgot.\" Oh, I'm not voting for him, he's not black enough...\" Every excuse in the world. Dr. Cornell West needs people of other races to put him in; Black ain't where it's at. Y'all always want something but you don't want to do the work. You 4 sound so ignorant, but you think that you know everything. The link is a sample of the requirements for 2020 General Election. Dr. West has a very good chance of becoming the nominee or a write-in candidate even if he is not the party nominee. Grow up!",

Meaning that there was never a time that my professors presented him or his work to us without some grain of salt. For me he should not feel content to rest on his laurels and legacy and run for president without addressing our concerns because there is actually active skepticism of his current work in the Black community.",

All of you are using  talking points of conservative Democrats (i.e.: Republicans). This is exactly why nothing can get done. No one running for president can come out and say I'm only going to be doing things that benefit black people. The fact that you're letting Olay, an immigrant, lead you right off the cliff, when she's not even an American, tells you how ignorant and young you still are.  dr Cornell West running as Cornell West for president 2024 is the perfect person to break up the Republican and Democrat Monopoly of our election process. No more will we be voting democrat or Republican only. \n\nAs for your comments that Dr Cornell West is supporting somebody who sexually assaulted someone, have you heard of Donald Trump? Have you heard of Joe Biden? Both have sexual allegations against them' and Trump's been convicted civilly for his part in sexual harassment. So what is your issue with voting for Cornell West for president? Because somebody is being \"accused\", not convicted of sexual harassment that has nothing to do with him?

        "text": "@David Mendoza None of you bothered to do your research on Dr. Cornel West. None of you bothered to look up the campaign laws. All of you are using  talking points of conservative Democrats (i.e.: Republicans). This is exactly why nothing can get done. No one running for president can come out and say I'm only going to be doing things that benefit black people. The fact that you're letting Olay, an immigrant, lead you right off the cliff, when she's not even an American, tells you how ignorant and young you still are.  dr Cornell West running as Cornell West for president 2024 is the perfect person to break up the Republican and Democrat Monopoly of our election process. No more will we be voting democrat or Republican only. \n\nAs for your comments that Dr Cornell West is supporting somebody who sexually assaulted someone, have you heard of Donald Trump? Have you heard of Joe Biden? Both have sexual allegations against them' and Trump's been convicted civilly for his part in sexual harassment. So what is your issue with voting for Cornell West for president? Because somebody is being \"accused\", not convicted of sexual harassment that has nothing to do with him?  Any party that he would join the head of that party has sexual allegations against them. We're supposed to not vote for him because of that? \n\nPlease grow up. Please do your research. How can he run for president. Below tells you how a write-in candidate or a third-party candidate registers if they run for president. I will be writing-in Dr. Cornel's West on my ballot along with hundreds of thousands of other Americans. Because Cornel West is not just for black people; he is for all people poor, poverty stricken  and the middle class. If you don't understand that then you understand nothing about the man.  We're not looking for perfection. We're looking for somebody who is decent who understands our issues and who will represent all of us, all races.\n\nState by state shows how Cornell West will run, and hopefully wins, the presidency listed below along with the source so you can go and check it out for yourself. Stop sitting up here talking nonsense with Olay, a Republican immigrant--and if she didn't migrate to this country her elder relatives did--who does not qualify for reparations.\n\nSource:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write-in_candidate#:~:text=of%20draft%20campaign.-,Write%2Din%20candidates%20may%20have%20to%20register%20as%20candidates,official%20candidates%20before%20the%20election.    Accessed on: 06/11/23\n\nUNITED STATES - The requirements to appear on the general election ballot as an independent candidate or to have write-in votes counted vary by state and by political office sought.\n\nForty-one states and the District of Columbia allow write-in votes on their ballots, including for president; Arkansas, New Mexico and South Carolina allow write-in candidates for some offices but not for president; Mississippi allows write-in votes only to substitute a candidate listed on the ballot who was removed, withdrew or died; Hawaii, Louisiana, Nevada, Oklahoma and South Dakota do not allow any write-in votes. Most of the jurisdictions allowing write-in votes require that the write-in candidates register by a certain date for their votes to be counted. Typically this registration consists only of a declaration of candidacy, but some states also require signatures of a certain number of voters, additional paperwork or fees. The deadline to register as a write-in candidate is usually later than to petition to be listed on the ballot.\n\nInstead of listening to Olay, an immigrant who does not qualify for reparations, lead you all off the cliff do your homework do your research. All of you sitting up there know that Dr Cornell West cannot run a campaign for the presidency saying, \"I'm only for black people in America to hell with everybody else.\". Black people aren't enough to vote him in. So why would he only be just for black people?  and the majority of you young people don't even bother to vote. All y'all do is sit up there and run y'all mouth. But when it comes time to actually vote, \"Oh I forgot.\" Oh, I'm not voting for him, he's not black enough...\" Every excuse in the world. Dr. Cornell West needs people of other races to put him in; Black ain't where it's at. Y'all always want something but you don't want to do the work. You 4 sound so ignorant, but you think that you know everything. The link is a sample of the requirements for 2020 General Election. Dr. West has a very good chance of becoming the nominee or a write-in candidate even if he is not the party nominee. Grow up!",

Later, he becomes the Vice President of the Baltimore NAACP. \n\nAlso, another \"green party\" candidate in Baltimore ran for city council in Franca Muller Paz and in her district, she managed about 35% of the vote. \n\n Start from the ground up and keep it moving.",

        "text": "@Kay There None of you bothered to do your research on Dr. Cornel West. None of you bothered to look up the campaign laws. All of you are using  talking points of conservative Democrats (i.e.: Republicans). This is exactly why nothing can get done. No one running for president can come out and say I'm only going to be doing things that benefit black people. The fact that you're letting Olay, an immigrant, lead you right off the cliff, when she's not even an American, tells you how ignorant and young you still are.  dr Cornell West running as Cornell West for president 2024 is the perfect person to break up the Republican and Democrat Monopoly of our election process. No more will we be voting democrat or Republican only. \n\nAs for your comments that Dr Cornell West is supporting somebody who sexually assaulted someone, have you heard of Donald Trump? Have you heard of Joe Biden? Both have sexual allegations against them' and Trump's been convicted civilly for his part in sexual harassment. So what is your issue with voting for Cornell West for president? Because somebody is being \"accused\", not convicted of sexual harassment that has nothing to do with him?  Any party that he would join the head of that party has sexual allegations against them. We're supposed to not vote for him because of that? \n\nPlease grow up. Please do your research. How can he run for president. Below tells you how a write-in candidate or a third-party candidate registers if they run for president. I will be writing-in Dr. Cornel's West on my ballot along with hundreds of thousands of other Americans. Because Cornel West is not just for black people; he is for all people poor, poverty stricken  and the middle class. If you don't understand that then you understand nothing about the man.  We're not looking for perfection. We're looking for somebody who is decent who understands our issues and who will represent all of us, all races.\n\nState by state shows how Cornell West will run, and hopefully wins, the presidency listed below along with the source so you can go and check it out for yourself. Stop sitting up here talking nonsense with Olay, a Republican immigrant--and if she didn't migrate to this country her elder relatives did--who does not qualify for reparations.\n\nSource:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write-in_candidate#:~:text=of%20draft%20campaign.-,Write%2Din%20candidates%20may%20have%20to%20register%20as%20candidates,official%20candidates%20before%20the%20election.    Accessed on: 06/11/23\n\nUNITED STATES - The requirements to appear on the general election ballot as an independent candidate or to have write-in votes counted vary by state and by political office sought.\n\nForty-one states and the District of Columbia allow write-in votes on their ballots, including for president; Arkansas, New Mexico and South Carolina allow write-in candidates for some offices but not for president; Mississippi allows write-in votes only to substitute a candidate listed on the ballot who was removed, withdrew or died; Hawaii, Louisiana, Nevada, Oklahoma and South Dakota do not allow any write-in votes. Most of the jurisdictions allowing write-in votes require that the write-in candidates register by a certain date for their votes to be counted. Typically this registration consists only of a declaration of candidacy, but some states also require signatures of a certain number of voters, additional paperwork or fees. The deadline to register as a write-in candidate is usually later than to petition to be listed on the ballot.\n\nInstead of listening to Olay, an immigrant who does not qualify for reparations, lead you all off the cliff do your homework do your research. All of you sitting up there know that Dr Cornell West cannot run a campaign for the presidency saying, \"I'm only for black people in America to hell with everybody else.\". Black people aren't enough to vote him in. So why would he only be just for black people?  and the majority of you young people don't even bother to vote. All y'all do is sit up there and run y'all mouth. But when it comes time to actually vote, \"Oh I forgot.\" Oh, I'm not voting for him, he's not black enough...\" Every excuse in the world. Dr. Cornell West needs people of other races to put him in; Black ain't where it's at. Y'all always want something but you don't want to do the work. You 4 sound so ignorant, but you think that you know everything. The link is a sample of the requirements for 2020 General Election. Dr. West has a very good chance of becoming the nominee or a write-in candidate even if he is not the party nominee. Grow up!",
