    "text": "That was a very refreshing discussion. I've noticed in about the last 5 years or so, there are many black and Latinos who have adopted a centrist point of view. It is generally along the lines of people are responsible for their own problems, and there is more opportunity now then ever and they can do more, but choose not to. Like anyone would ever choose to not have access to a good job, grow up impoverished, or somehow they were supposed to pull themselves from a mentality that they were supposed to develop where exactly? It's always along the lines of if I can change everyone else who is not me can also do it too, which is how no effective government anywhere in the world succeeds. \n\nIt's clear these people dont understand basic civics, nor do they know anything about governments in other countries who operate effectively, or how elements within the government through compromise or directed bills tried to ensure that black people did not partake in what once was a progressive government. Much of the infrastructure in the US today was built mostly within a small timeframe that was then hindered by conservatives. Conservatives exist at this point to water down legislation, or stop it completely. I don't think Democrats are really that aware at how saboteur conservatives are. They think compromise is a good thing, and dont understand historically how it has hindered America from the start. The 3/5 human clause was a compromise. There has never been a good compromise. The real issue is you keep seeing legislation pass from a comprise that does not live up to what was promised, but you constantly see Democrats pat themselves on the back, and people become demoralized because it was watered down. \n\nYou want to start reaching people then you have to start digging into the past and showing instances of what has been done. America has had a lot of great legislation that has been undone, and specifically made inaccessible to black people, Mexicans, and Native Americans. There's a reason you go to many major cities and there see empty factories. There's a reason where there once was major industrial cities that you see a lot of black people.",

    "text": "This is leftist vs liberals conversation. Every presidential election year, it's easy to tell the difference. I think that we have to stop preaching \"vote, vote, vote\" and draw people in to organizing. Historically, legislation that benefitted us came as a result of protest and local grassroots upheavals. After these actions, THEN, the government moved the needle. The Michigan vote is a reflection of that. Rebellion by the people brings about change not conversations with legislators. America is an imperialist \"nation\"...they understand force and profit. Liberals always intellectualize conflict. They want to converse with politicians and have disdain for ignorance that busy, poor people may have  They believe in incrementalism instead of looking at radical action as an option (as true leftists historically have done). Incrementalism won't free Black people. It only makes us more comfortable within the capitalist system. Capitalism requires that poor people exist. So while some with be more comfortable, more will continue to suffer. Liberals are unwilling to take any risks.  That's a problem because poor people are becoming desperate, young people have lost hope and we're dealing with irrational people on the other side.",

I just wish we had more discussions behind how we get out of this “you can’t have the big changes you need, now vote blue no matter who” situation. We do this every time and there’s no end in sight… when are we tired? \n\nAlso, how can we package the step by step voting strategy where the expectation is to vote for better policies little by little and eventually skewing left in a way that centers the Black lived experience? I hear the need to educate here but that is a double edged sword because many people don’t like being explained to… but how do we make it abundantly clear via our actions and the situations faced by our people? On top of this… idk how far left you will be able to skew. Any attempt at bringing the changes we need gets the McCarthyism treatment and I can’t speak for everyone but if you ask me? You skew left enough and that means a rejection of this entire system which defeats the purpose of hoping for a “left leaning bureaucratic system”… I fear that if we can acknowledge that that imperialist component is part of the fabric of this country, we must also acknowledge that it is intentional and you’ll see blood shed before you see it relinquish the reigns that keep the status quo going.",

Great analogy about church and political viewpoints from Rebecca.

    "text": "Love these forums. So thank you and your contributors. \nI just wanted to state that when you don’t govern; meaning that when Republicans control one part of Congress or the other, and or even the White House, they don’t really govern beyond their tenets of giving money to the rich and monetizing quality of life every which way possible. When you don’t have a record on ANYTHING else, you have the advantage of not having to defend laws and programs that don’t get results right away. With that in mind, it’s easier to use hate and fear to create soundbites and empty stories that spread due to the lack of true journalism in this country. They tap into the systems they’ve created while progressives try to educate and pass legislation that benefits everyone. Therein lies the disadvantage that’s always being faced, and not just every election cycle.",

There are some points I've seen in a few of these panels that estrange folk who aren't as formally educated. Dude was on bars saying this acknowledgement because this whole panel tried to touch on how the lack of that privilege can also come off as lambasting them for their outlets, their mechanisms of news and their norms. This empathy is crucial if we all as black people being as myriad as we are to unify. 🖤👊🏿",

    "text": "41:00 I can relate to what Olay is saying here because, even though I'm not an immigrant, I am a trans person and I've never felt the fear of my own community until Trump. A popular Youtuber recently attacked me because I challenged his \"genocide Joe\" rhetoric by simply stating that Trump would be even worse for Gaza. This Youtuber was very uncharitable and suggested that I didn't care about the Palestinian people, when the reality is I do, I'm just recognizing the broader reality that the winner of this election is going to be Trump or Biden and that there are other issues at stake than just the people of Gaza. I mean, if one believes Trump would do anything to help the Palestinian people, maybe they could try to put together some kind of argument that it's \"worth it\" to sacrifice women's reproductive health, trans people's freedom of expression, and/or the rights of people of color for the Palestinians. However, in this case, we already know Trump would be worse for the Palestinians because he has SAID he would be worse. So, I just don't understand the calculations people are making to help a person become president who has no upside whatsoever. I just picture profoundly privileged people, who won't be affected much regardless of who becomes president, snubbing their noses at shitty presidential options (as though we've ever NOT had shitty presidential options) rather than voting strategically and weighing the real costs to human lives. If you don't think it's worth it to vote for a president who is 1% better than the alternative, consider how many people would still be alive today if we had a president who had handled Covid 1% better (11,000 lives saved) or who might handle Israel/Gaza better (350 lives saved). The thing to remember is that every policy failure leads to tens of thousands of lives immiserated. The lesser of 2 evils is LESS evil. And even 1% less evil MATTERS.",

But we do have an advantage in that the Labour party is currently 20 points ahead in the polls, and the Conservative government can try to gerrymander and use voter suppression, but one thing that isn't happening for them is the polls aren't closing, even with an election coming this year (likely before the US election), so there is now a movement over here to push tactical voting and trying to get more representation from smaller parties who do serve the people more. We can afford to do that without risking the Conservatives regaining power. Its a real shame that in the US if the vote is split it's a huge risk to hand the Republican's the election, but the US really does need more left-wing representation and the Democrats ain't it.",

Add to that is the constant narrative in American capitalism of greed is good and “everyone can succeed by your bootstraps bullshit“, it’s not surprising some black people find it as appealing as white people (and poor white men listen to a narrative that treats them as the enemy still vote for active perpetrators, but often the Dems are just slightly less active in their damage).  As a white person, I try to tell other white people we would all work as one in the working class instead of fighting black and brown people or those in marginalised communities , then and only then will we get any progressive change and even then we have to fight the establishment constantly.  I’m also relatively well off but had to leave the states to make that happen, so unfortunately I have little influence.",

I think it can be pretty privileged to speak like that. In Michigan alone there was a notable uncommitted vote in the primaries due to the US continued support of Israel's government. I don't think that can be overlooked or ignored, not just politically, but more importantly for humanity. Yes I think we should save democracy, protect reproductive rights, and more. But, as a voter, I am tired of two-party political system and when a presidential election rolls around I need to just pick the candidate who is just palatable & then told now is still not the time to have more options politically. Love your videos, Olay!",

Neoliberalism is one thing, but to become a social minded leftist you have to have some sort of experience of inequality.\n\nNo experience of said discrepancy in experience means no trust in the ideology that leftists want:  affordable housing, education, healthcare etc not at tge individual but rather the national expense.\n\nYes christians believe in \"good samaritans\" but only if they recognize you as a neighbor and not a threat to their comfort. This is important because it determines what minority the neolibs are willing to dump in order to appease the conservative centrists (atm muslims, transgender peoples, chinese and mexicans)\n\nThe majority report just released a great interview reaction of by Mehdi Hassan, who got a democratic senator and wanna be future president to admit that saving 6 american lives would be worth 200+ dead palestinians.\n\nGetting the big bucks on your side is not the solution, that money will never rival the military indistrial complex and petro lobbyists. The goal first and foremost should be messaging, people feel the systemic problems of late stage capitalism but have no words to describe it.",
