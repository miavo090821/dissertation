He will do this weird things where he'll call everything imperialist though, even for China so.. it's totally understandable why he cannot be B tier. He's very entertaining sometimes, but having him in large doses might just stress you out.\n\nKyle Kulinski should probably go in D tier. Democrat sheepherders are nothing to duck with. It's a shame because he used to be someone I listened to early on. But his lib stuff automatically disqualifies him even from C tier.\n\nHasan Piker is popular, but completely wastes any potential by being lib-lite. He doesn't have to be rly radical or whatever but his punching left at communists while always trying to appeal to ppl like Ethan Klein and on top of that his unwillingness to be a part of any organization outside the uniparty leaves him as a complete waste of potential. It's a real shame, bc on the one hand he has a massive audience and has created a movement all on his own, but his obsessive adherence to reformist politics inside the unparty cripples any chance of creating a movement that can grow to challenge the existing system.\n\nBtw why is Jamarl Thomas missing from the list? Send him to B tier for some awesome, awesome interviews. The way he thinks especially aligns a lot with my own thinking, so I like how he explains reality. And I see Noah in the list, send him to B tier at least.\n\nAnd is that Destiny in one of the images? Straight to F tier. Do not pass go, do not collect $200.",
