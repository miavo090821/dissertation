Vos to Venezuela we're here in Venezuela we're in one of the communes and uh we've been speaking to the locals and what they tell us is that they have built 45 homes ever since the commune acceleration process started and that it's completely revamped the neighborhood uh and it's uh enhanced the social fabric of the community and I mean these communities seem very class conscious one of the things that that we see all over the place are Palestinian Flags uh items and images that identify with the revolution not just here with the Venezuela but portraits of J and many other revolutionaries from around the world and one of the things that they're saying especially the leaders is that uh you know the basis of bolivarian socialism is here it's in these communes where millions of people live and experience almost uh In the Flesh in in their life's World in their leban world what it is like to to to live a communist existence and it's also it's not just cultural it's also in terms of people's social welfare these communes are the initiatives of local people who are cooperating with the authorities of the Venezuelan state to build up kind of autonomous and Sovereign bases of popular control these communes are home to not just houses which are owned by the Venezuelan people they're not rented out they're owned by the people and in addition to that they have medical assistance food sports and entertainment there's a giant pool that we just visited soccer stadium things that bring the community together um so we can see the results of the bolivarian Revolution have been not just to instill people of class Consciousness at a basic local level but also giving them the concrete results of what a socialist society looks like yeah in America we're lied to we're told that socialism means you know the government coming in taking your toothbrush you're not owning anything but this is the opposite in the US people in our generation have no hope for owning homes of their own but here in Venezuela even with the the Strangling blockade and the hybrid War for the US is waging against it we're seeing we're seeing people own their basic necessities and have a dignified life and that is what the revolution has provided and I think that's one of the most honorable things that is not usually spoken of these people have been dignified by the revolution that they themselves are a part of constructing so despite the blockade despite the economic hardships imposed by imperialism bolivarian socialism lives on and the people here are carrying the legacy of Hugo shavez and the United Socialist Party of Venezuela indeed and we have a lot to learn as Americans yes keep you updated the next
