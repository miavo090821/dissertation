We see capitalism is still the dominant global economic system.. rhe few countries that go against the grain that are considered \"socialist \" are really proto socialist if anything.   Would venezuela fall under this category ?  Curious to see hakim video on venezuela cause I noticed it's not often considered the main 5 that often acknowledged as such (ie.
