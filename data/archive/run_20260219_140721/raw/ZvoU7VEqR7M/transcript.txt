so one of biden's first foreign policy acts as president was to launch missile strikes into syria at iranian-backed militias it just happened yesterday this obviously has major implications with what we've been talking about with iran and trump's imperialist action towards iran and now biden said he was going to get back into the iran nuclear deal before launching missile missiles at iran iranian militias in syria and it's kind of a trend for every president when they take off is to launch missile strikes into an arab nation so biden is just following with that trend so we'll talk about biden in comparison to trump iran and other stuff like that but first let's watch some cnn coverage of this the clear the assumption there is that within iraq this action taken by the united states would be welcome by and large of course it depends who you talk to but certainly the kurds in this part of iraq and those officials who are sympathetic to the united states do welcome this as a signal but not too strong a signal to these iranian-backed militias that they should not do what they did here in irbil they should not fire missiles or mortars at the green zone in baghdad but as i said before we have to keep in mind that there's a much broader context to these attacks and in a sense ira iraq is just sort of the board upon which these chess pieces are moved head to london now cnn's international diplomatic editor nick robinson has been standing by uh so nick just to pick up the conversation where ben left off with regards to the fact that this proportionate airstrike as the pentagon says um was basically intended to reduce tensions in the region and of course the backdrop for that is the ongoing negotiations or potential negotiations between washington and tehran over the nuclear deal how do all these parts fit together president biden is in a position uh in the united states where he needs to show that he can be strong on iran and not weak on iran and iran right now essentially the united states has put an offer on the table that it will come into the talks with iran before iran scales back all the steps that it's taken that have gone over the bounds of that internationally agreed nuclear deal the united states will come back to the table and talk to iran about the way forward so cnn says that these missile strikes were launched to de-escalate tensions in the region because we know that's how you de-escalate tensions is by launching missiles of people and they also say this is in retaliation for an attack on iraq which of course we know the u.s cares so deeply for iraq that's why they killed millions of people there i'm assuming they were worried about iranian militias attacking u.s troops so that was their justification here so the first cnn acre there literally refers to this region as a chessboard right he says this just happens to be the chessboard where these things are playing out areas that were launching missile strikes at you know and it shows you how analysts in the united states in the imperial core i mean in the ruling class look at these regions they are nothing but a chess board to them you know and the moves biden makes are just moving the pieces on a chessboard ignore the people who are hit by these missile strikes ignore the people in syria who have had their their towns turned to rubble from missile strikes from from u.s bacterias from assad's forces and from the u.s missile strikes themselves and this is just a continuation of the trump policy which biden said he wasn't going to continue trump keep in mind this area that we call a chess board for the last four years at least we have kept them under a terrible uh brutal sanction regime not allowing them to trade with the rest of the world amidst a global pandemic so as these countries are trying to keep their hospitals going and treat their populations for the deadly coronavirus pandemic the us has been keeping them under sanctions um studies have proved that these sanctions have killed people in syria and iran and this is the kind of stuff that on the campaign trail joe biden promised us he wasn't gonna do um and now here he is launching missile strikes into syria and you hear the cnn anchors here saying joe biden's in a situation where he needs to be tough on iran right he needs to lay the smackdown on iran why is is the average working-class american really scared that iran's gonna attack you think iran's gonna invade the united states and and what's the reasoning he gives for why joe biden needs to be tough on iran because iran has been going beyond the bounds of the nuclear deal no even though the united states signed into that deal pulled out of the deal put sanctions on iran murdered their top general and labeled iran as the number one state sponsor of terrorism as the us dumps money into israel and saudi arabia accusing iran of promoting terrorism um iran has continued to follow the agreements of the nuclear deal and has allowed the international atomic energy agency to monitor their nuclear program 24 7 and not once not one single time has iran been accused of proliferating nuclear weapons what people will point to is iran's enrichment of uranium iran is your enriching uranium for medical isotopes and you can look into the details of this and i recommend you do it's actually very interesting what iran is doing with uranium it is not to make a nuclear weapon and the ayatollah and the iranian government has been on record saying it's against their religion to create a nuclear weapon it's against the tenants of islam so here the u.s is saying we need to keep launching missile strikes at iranians and keep launching missile strikes into syria because they might proliferate a nuclear weapon well we're the ones who signed into a deal with them that said they wouldn't make a nuclear weapon and then we pulled out and started killing a bunch of them and now that we have a new president and he's like oh yeah we're gonna get back into the deal and now he's still launching missile strikes while cnn is encouraging him to crack down even harder on iran to kill more civilians in iran to kill more people in iran to get more involved in iran um and this is the nature of u.s foreign policy right like i got my bernie sign behind me and i'm sure bernie would have been better on foreign policy than either biden or trump but there's only so much you can do right because the u.s is an imperialist nation and they do justify getting involved in other countries um other countries affairs by by claiming there are human rights abuses going on and people do fall for it still and the u.s has been completely unable to overthrow iran and assad yeah the ayatollah and iran uh cool mini i'm not sure how you pronounce the name in assad in syria and like i said both these places have been kept under sanction campaigns and have faced the full especially syria full effort from the us to destabilize and do regime change the us has been backing the most extremist militias in syria even transporting people from libya the uae um lebanon surrounding areas into syria um the most extremist radical elements to try and destabilize the region jaish al-islam being one of the main groups and this has thrown syria into chaos you know tons of civilian deaths um and then now we've kept them under a sanction campaign as assad has kind of won the war and is attempting to rebuild syria and now we're launching more missiles in as our pundits um talk about syria iran and iraq as if they are a chessboard literally calling them a chessboard um truly disgusting the imperial court and it reminds me of in 2017 when trump launched his missile strikes at syria and cnn's coverage of it freed zakaria i kid you not you can look up the clip says this is the moment that trump just became president he's so amazed and in awe of trump because trump launched missiles into an arab nation he's like now trump is presidential when he was doing all when he was doing all his stuff on the campaign trail all that loudmouth stuff all that talking about bringing people's jobs back combined with racism that was terrible but when he launched missile strikes that killed people that was presidential that is um what the the office of u.s president is supposed to be and freed zakaria and cnn praised him endlessly for launching missile strikes that killed people and and cnn for some reason allowed jeremy scahill who's an amazing reporter and an amazing author and you should check out his book the assassination complex i think he has others too but he said he thought farid zakaria and cnn literally wanted to have sex with the missiles that trump launched because of how much they were glowing over it um and now you see cnn pushing biden to be more hawkish towards towards syria towards iran and i'm sure this is only going to continue so we'll see how this develops i can't imagine iran wants to re-enter the nuclear deal right after after entering this nuclear deal have with the us saying okay we trust you the u.s trump comes to power pulls out of the deal sanctions them assassinates their general um is saying ridiculous hawkish rhetoric about them spreading lies about them never apologizing for murdering their generals saying it was justified because iran is a state sponsor of terrorism and um and and then iran continued to follow the deal and then you have biden get in office saying he's going to re-enter the deal and he launches missile strikes at iranian-backed militias so i can't imagine that many people in iran want to re-enter a deal with the united states after the actions we've taken there and i mean how can you blame them and like just imagine iran or syria did anything um to us that the u.s does to them imagine if they like launched a missile strike at mike pompeo and blew him up and then were like they deserved it the us is an imperialistic nation they're enforcing themselves using their military and the cia all around the world they've been doing so for the last 120 years therefore we needed to step up and kill their general mike pompeo wasn't a general he was the cia director and secretary of state okay back to the video and it was justified um and then reporters in iran were going well you know we had to do this um the us is an interesting chess board and they're as they're launching missile strikes into the us and blowing people up if they if they referred to it as a chess board imagine what would happen the us would launch nukes into iran in a second you know the double standard of the empire is is incredible and it's obvious but the reason i keep making these videos is because um i mean there's a reason they put out this propaganda right because a lot of people do fall for it and a lot of people think that cnn is real news when when in reality it's a little bit of news but mostly it's propaganda and pushing the president to be more hawkish um setting the narrative um for what public opinion is the average american doesn't care about iran you know you don't wake up and go work to work every day and like oh i hope iran doesn't attack me right that's what they have to worry about in the middle east i hope the us doesn't launch drone strikes here today um but but they hear cnn telling workers you need to be scared of iran biden needs to be more hawkish towards iran trust us we're cnn we're a big corporation why would we lie to you all right thanks for watching that everyone um uh quit launching missile strikes at iran and syria let's get back into the iran nuclear deal um and let's implement socialism in the united states and take down imperialism alright peace
