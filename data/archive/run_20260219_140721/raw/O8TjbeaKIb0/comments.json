        "text": "When you're basically accusing all Americans before 1970 of holding racist views and most of them even now, you officially have become a revisionist troublemaker. My father grew up in a 1950s-60s Iowa farming town where the church preacher for a few years was a minority race guy from India. The state actually had laws requiring businesses to serve blacks and other minorities in public accommodations and had integrated public schools since like 1868. They were NOT like Mississippi or Virginia. I am appalled at what some of his videos (and other people's) have included. You're not helping anyone who was genuinely oppressed, and instead engaging in a vicious defamation or slander campaign.",

        "text": "I have challenged him twice. The first time was about how the parties switched. He responded to me which surprised me. \n\nFirst off, I am a True Liberal. I am not like the Orwellian Borg Collective that the modern Left has morphed into. \n\nHe claimed that the parties switched during the Civil Rights Movement. That is not true. It didn't even happen after those bills were signed. He mentioned the Southern Strategy that was enacted Richard Nixon. I had to remind him that Nixon didn't become president until 1969 and didn't start the Southern Strategy until near the next election of 1972.\n\nThe Southern Strategy was designed to recruit Christians because the Democrats were starting to become more secular. It was not about appealing to racists. How could Republicans appeal to racists when 92% of Republicans voted for both of those Civil rights bills. They didn't court the racists.\n\nThe shift began in 1981 when Jerry Falwell brought his group The Moral Majority into the party. That still didn't shift the power then. Klang leader, David Duke, ran for president in the 1988 presidential election as a Democrat. He lost in their primaries.\n\nWhat did make the south Republican was the failed 1988 presidential campaign of Pat Robertson. After he dropped out, he used his left over funds to form a group called The Christian Coalition which was and still is lead by Ralph Reed. The South became a Republican stronghold after Clinton became president in 1992.\n\nHe told me I was wrong. After I told him to look it up, he told me that I was right about the Christians taking over the party. I told him that they took control in the 90's as I stated in my original response to his video.\n\nHe never got back to me after I pointed that out.",

        "text": "Robert Dunn Alright. It's one thing to be wrong, it's the other thing to be an arrogant prick and be ignorant on top.\n\nI will now proceed to step by step show you, why literally everything you said is wrong or at least flawed.\n\n\" yeah that's why USA has highest gun ownership in world and also highest gun related offences and mass shootings, but no relation\"\n\nOne, and please check the sources, don't be arrogant, actually look at it, you can follow all of this date simply on wikipedia with their list of homicides per capita and gun ownership per capita per country.\nThere is no relation between gun ownership and homicide rates:\n\nhttp://www.gunfacts.info/gun-policy-info/guns-in-other-countries/\n\nYou want to create a correlation by one country, the US, being the outlier in terms of gun ownership, development and homicides. I don't have to explain to you, why that is moronic.\n\nIn case of Australia, their decline in gun deaths, homicide, suicide and accidents started in 1980. That is 17 years before gun control. Afterwards gun deaths declined further.\n\nhttps://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/productsbyCatalogue/9C85BD1298C075EACA2568A900139342?OpenDocument\n\nAustralia is your best case and in that case the policy was apparently so good, it caused a drop in gun death 17 years before it was implemented. Even mass shootings declined before gun control was passed. Did they stop afterwards? No, but they decreased in frequency, other forms of mass murder picked up in frequency, in Australias case that was Arson.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_massacres_in_Australia\n\nBecause \"but muh mass murder with a knoife\" is a strawman, always was a strawman, and is now a ridicolous strawman in the aftermath of the 2016 Nice attack in which 86 people were killed with a truck. That is the largest non-bomb massacre by an individual ever.\n\nThe UK:\n\nAfter gun control in the 90s both Homicide rates and gun homicide rates increased:\n\nhttps://crimeresearch.org/2016/04/murder-and-homicide-rates-before-and-after-gun-bans/\n\nBut that goes even further: The UK has been messing around with gun control since the 1930, and from the start when they messed around with gun control their homicide rates were on the increase.\n\nhttps://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/articles/homicideinenglandandwales/yearendingmarch2017#:~:text=Historically%2C%20the%20number%20of%20homicides,growth%20over%20the%20same%20period.\n\nSo several Decades of gun control had no noticeable effect, homicides only started happening less frequently when the UK joined the international trend.\n\nAnd please note: BEFORE they passed gun control they had homicide rates below the 1 per 100.000 Marker. So they had a homicide rate that was LOWER than what you say could or should be possible. Same for my country, Germany before our gun laws were federalized and tightened in 1972 we had homicide rates as low as today.\nAccording to you, that should not be possible.\n\nAs for Mass Murder, the per-capita count does not confirm what you are saying:\n\nhttps://crimeresearch.org/2015/06/comparing-death-rates-from-mass-public-shootings-in-the-us-and-europe/\n\nThat the US is the country with most firearm offenses on the planet is by the way ridicolous:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate\n\nAnd studies on this topic are not as one sided as you say:\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S004723521400107X?via%3Dihub\n\nBut as long as people like Bloomberg put millions into phony gun research by say, the Harvard Injury Control Center and their hacks there will be \"research\" showing your desired results.\n\nLet's get to matters of law:\nYou make following statement:\n\n \"US is the only nation that has such flimsy gun laws and allows it's citizens to have such firepower\"\n\nIt is not, this is the condensed gun regulation of Switzerland:\n\nhttps://www.ch.ch/en/acquiring-firearm/\n\nThis is the gun regulation for the Czech Republic:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_law_in_the_Czech_Republic\n\nIn both countries Citizens can acquire the same firepower as in the US, in Switzerland even nearly as easily as in the US. If you want to now tell me that they may not buy ammo, I will call you a moron and ask you for specific laws regarding that.\n\nNow, my last point: Why does the US have higher amounts of crime than europe? \nLet me point you to this: The US has 330 Million people. For this amount of people, the FBI estimates that the US has 33.000 criminal gangs\n\nhttps://www.fbi.gov/investigate/violent-crime/gangs\n\nWhat does, say, the EU have, with roughly 400 Million people, by estimate of Europol? 5000.\n\nhttps://archive.vn/PCb9e\n\nSo the US has at least 6 times the organized crime that the EU has.\n\nMaybe the amount of crime committed is related to the amount and density of people that are in violent criminal groups that have to defend the goods they sell and the territory they sell it on with sheer violence?\n\nThere is one flat earther in this conversation, and it is you. You do not care about the reality of this situation, you want a quick and easy solution, that at best removes a tool from the hands of people that you do not like and you do not care about the consequenses. Consequenses like people being unable to defend themselves, which in the US would be millions. Millions more successfully robbed, injured, probably thousands at least hundreds more killed. That would be the result of the policy you desire. Based on nothing but your preconceived notions. Get fucked with a cactus.",

The reason I unsubbed and stop watching him because out of no where he started doing anti-Trump and pro-SJW content. \nIt just felt so odd, unnecessary , and forced.\n\nWhy because he was never that type of content creator/channel. He was like a VSauce educational type channel. I liked his videos, I saw many of them in a short span. But that jamming of his personal anti-Trump views was a huge turn off. Its been like 2 years, so Idk what the guy has been up to (At the time I unsubbed he only had like two videos about political and social issues/justice stuff), but it seems like he went all in into political matters.",

The only major difference I've seen was how other nations were involved in the occupation of Germany. Other than there was no difference in the occupations. His logic for behind his claim was we were nicer to Japan because the U.S. wanted to use Japan as a buffer to the communists....which really doesn't make sense considering West Germany was literally on the border with the communists\n\nbeen told myself to watch 13, but really don't believe in watching propaganda trying to disguise itself as a documentary.",

    "text": "Hello there! In the interest of keeping a good debate going, and as a left wing guy myself, I'm going to list my criticisms of the main points in this response video. \n\n1. You are correct that TV shows are not required to be 100% accurate and you are correct that shows that distort police effectiveness are usually not done with the intent of being propaganda BUT despite this, these shows do still influence many people views on the police. Even if it's not the intention, it still has that effect and that is what KB was talking about. \n\n2. Even if there isn't a 1 to 1 parallel between drug sentences and the racial demographics, that doesn't mean that the drug war was not racially motivated, because the fact is that it was. There are former staffers from the Nixon administration that explicitly stated that the motivation behind the drug war was to crack down on protests by the counter-culture movement and the civil rights movement because those two groups both tended to use drugs alot. The criminalisation of marijuana in the 30s was explicitly motivated by racism and this was made very clear at the time. And the crack epidemic during the 80s (aka. the Reagan years) was an epidemic mostly concentrated in black communities and there was thus those very harsh sentencing laws. But now America has this opioids epidemic that is affecting white people more and now mysteriously not as much is being done to crack down on opioid users. \n\n3. Oh boy where do I start with this. First of all I feel like you misrepresented his argument. He said that minority communities tend to be poor due to racist policies of the past. What he didn't mention that is very important is that poverty is closely tied to crime. The poorer and more desperate you are, the more crimes you commit. Also implicit bias means that black people are by default seen as more suspicious than white people, both by laypeople and police,  and so get reported more often. You can report whatever you want to the police, that doesn't necessarily mean it's reliable information. So tracking crime rates by reports means that poorer minority communities end up labelled as high crime, which then gets flooded by police, which leads to more reports and arrests, which leads to even higher crime rates which leads to more police.  That's the point that was being made. Like KB said, white people and black people tend to commit crime at similar rates, but these practices disproportionately affect minorities and result in over enforcement. \n\n3.5 You zeroed in on stop and frisk even though that was just a casual mention of an example and then just moved on without addressing the larger point. But anyway stop and frisk disproportionately affected minorities yes partly because there was more police concentrated in minority communities but again also because implicit bias among police leads to them viewing minorities as inherently more suspicious and thus were more likely to target them. \n\n4. I don't have as much of a counter to this except to say that a big factor in the violent crime rate rise was due to the war on drugs. By criminalising drugs, anyone who produced, sold, or used drugs suddenly lost access to the legal system to resolve drug related disputes because if they tried, they would just be arrested for drug related crimes. So many of them ended up turning up gang violence to resolve disputes instead. \n\n5. He's right though. I find it a little weird that you just laughed at this point at the end instead of addressing it fully like the other parts. What you said was a strawman. He was using exaggeration for comedic effect and you took it literally. Yes obviously we didn't catch \"all the criminals\" but what he's saying is that for someone to think that the increase in prison population caused the drop in crime is if we somehow arrest criminals faster than they are produced which is simply absurd.",

Maybe Ill address the rest later if I actually get a decent response. Youre the one making all types of assumptions based on what you want to be true. Ffs, we don't even need former staffers to know what Nixon allegedly said, he said it himself. He hated the hippies. Who he atleast thought of as hhhwhite. It was all about counter ideals, not necessarily race. Yooou're applying your own modern racism to that and solely focusing only on the people of color he hated, when he hated anyone who he thought had bad ideas or mentalities. No, to the original crack down on weed, and theres excellent videos about that from Sean and others right next to the ones where you got that idea. And finally and most importantly, its about harm. Cocaine in general was rampant in the 80s. Everywhere. Yuppies doing lines in the bathroom didn't get cracked down on the same way because theyd just go back to stock trading or whatever else after it. While the crack was leading to tons and tons of robberies and murders. And like Sean mentioned in the video it was leaders from the blk community itself that called for action first and foremost because they saw frist hand the damage it was doing to their community. Annnnnd the 80s AREN'T CURRENT YEAR. Theres a 40 yr difference there, and whhhhhy would the government do the same exact thing they just saw didn't work or help with the crack? Not to mention, very different drugs all together anyway. Theres whole lot different about those two things than just majority skin color. Thats just you being racist af, and only looking for and at skin again...",

    "text": "Another point about police procedurals: Law & Order is a show that sold itself on being \"ripped straight from the headlines,\" the lawyers don't always win their cases...and that should be gripping on its own, but it's not.  It's the most boring, by-the-numbers show I've ever tried to watch with my mom (who loves these shows for some reason), and I'd much rather watch Blue Bloods or one of the NCIS shows because I actually like the characters they've built even when I'm bored to tears with the show itself.  If I wanted to watch a documentary, I'd watch a documentary.  L&O us pure \"my mind ceases to operate as long as this is on the screen in front of me\" fare, and I'm not even joking...unless I make a concerted effort to focus on what's happening, I zone out completely.  Real policing doesn't lend itself to entertaining television.  Investigations are long and boring, police rarely discharge their weapons, the perp is usually the guy the evidence points to, and natural speech isn't anything like snappy dialogue.  Both my best friend and my oldest friend are cops.  Aside from the fact my best friend recently got promoted to sergeant, his job is largely doldrum to the point I'd rather bore out of my own frontal lobe with a power drill than have to deal with it on a daily basis, and that's coming from someone who used to do data entry for his dad's CPA firm.",

        "text": "@clydemarshall8095 Alright, I'm a bit confused but I'll go in order.\n1. The Constitution doesn't mention God, Christian, Christianity, Ten Commandments, *insert here*. Neither the Declaration of Independence. Tell me where it says it, or you can search in the source I gave you for the Amendments. You won't find \"God\" or \"Christian\" anywhere.  The time period the founding fathers were in was one where people distanced themself from Religion AND state, where they believed people should be allowed to do as they wish without being punished. Back then you could be punished for being an atheist, speaking against the Church, or refusing to be taxed without representation. These are rights that NO ONE PERSON HAS GIVEN YOU. These are rights that every man has, regardless of their religion, beliefs, or opinions. Here's the definition of inalienable : \"unable to be taken away from or given away by the possessor.\r\" That's right, you cannot have your rights taken away by a \"possessor\". Guess what's an inalienable right? Religion. You can say God gave you your right to argue about religion, but I can also say that God didn't give you the right. Why? Because free speech is also an inalienable right.  \n2. This is the second amendment. Verbatim : \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\r\" \nAgain, it's for the state to have a militia that is there to defend the state, which back in the day, was something that they were afraid of being invaded by Native Americans or attacked by the British. But now? We don't need a militia. \n3. I wasn't straw-manning. A straw man definition : \"an intentionally misrepresented proposition that is set up because it is easier to defeat than an opponent's real argument.\r\"\nHow is stating that \"Because the First Amendment says that Congress cannot endorse a religion, therefore schools, courtrooms, etc cannot have religious icons because it shows that the Federal Government is endorsing a religion.\" \nThat's not a strawman, that's just logic. In fact, there have been instances where these religious symbols were taken down from Federal buildings because it violated the first amendment. \n4. My argument didn't come from the gun thing, it came because you stated that our founding fathers created this nation after God, even though almost everything in the Founding documents doesn't have anything to do with religion.\nFinally, the Declaration of Independence has no legal or federal bearing. It was us telling Great Britain that we're tired of their shit and will become an independent nation.",

        "text": "@Vladimir_4757 You brought up religious endorsement in the context of rights. They are separate matters. Hence the straw man. I was not arguing about symbols and endorsements, I was arguing about rights and their divine origin. You introduced non-relevant information. \n\nThe Declaration, while not having the force of law, does exemplify the philosophy the Founder's held and it does say the following: \n\n\"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are *endowed by their creator with certain inalienable Rights,* that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.\"\n\nClearly Thomas Jefferson and his peers believed that our rights are granted us by the Law of Nature and Nature's God. That is what makes them above reproach. No mortal entity can rightfully deprive you of these rights because God made you and gave you these rights under his Natural Law. I don't know the origin of the definition you presented, but clearly it isn't the same one that the Founders and myself ascribe to. \n\nAs for the 2nd, the citizens are the militia and the private ownership of arms is still just as necessary today as it was in 1787. To argue otherwise is to ignore the historical fact, that all the greatest acts of tyranny were preceded by ensuring the target populace was unarmed. \n\nFurthermore, you forget that the last clause in the 2nd reads, \"*the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.*\" The militia part is just the explanation for the above clause, not the point in of itself. \n\nOne need only read the Founder's themselves and the philosophy they ascribed to (including but not limited to John Locke, Charles Montesquieu, and William Blackstone) in order to understand the Christian underpinning and design to this Republic. \n\nGeorge Washington repeatedly referred to providence throughout his life and correspondence. \"The adoption of the Constitution will demonstrate as visibly the finger of Providence as any possible event in the course of human affairs can ever designate it.\"\n\nBenjamin Franklin, who famously didn't belong to a specific denomination said, \"I have so much faith in the general government of the world by Providence that I can hardly conceive a transaction of such momentous importance [as the framing of the Constitution] ...should be suffered to pass without being in some degree influenced, guided, and governed by that... beneficent Ruler in whom all inferior spirits live and move have their being.\"\n\nJohn Adams once said, \"Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.\" \n\nHe said that because he, as all the rest of them knew, that in order to be free a people must be moral and virtuous and that morality and virtuousness necessarily comes from God and religiosity. \n\nThat is not to say that one cannot be both irreligious and virtuous, but if the trend of irreligiosity in the western world has taught us anything it is that it predicates decadence, degeneracy, and decline. \n\nThe Constitution is derived from Locke's theory of Natural Law. That Natural Law requires God to exist to be the moral arbiter because without him there is no Natural Law and all law can only ever be subjective. \n\nThe 1st Amendment was not written to keep the Ten Commandments out of courthouses. It was written to prevent the establishment of a federal state religion like England had. The clause forbidding religious tests to hold office exists for a similar reason. Again, it was not written to keep God out of government, but to keep the government out of church. \n\nIf our current state of the union is anything to go by, I think we could do with a few more religious symbols here and there. \n\nI will leave you with a quote from Benjamin Franklin, \"Only a virtuous people are capable of freedom. As nations become corrupt and vicious, they have more need of masters.\"",
