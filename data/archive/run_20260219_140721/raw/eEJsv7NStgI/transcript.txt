it's cool when they do it it's a problem 
when I do it Angel knows a ring is coming but man did that he would be called 
classless and nobody would be saying anything all year I was critiqued about who 
I was I'm too Hood I'm too ghetto   y'all told me that all year other 
people do it y'all don't say nothing Its not often   that we get an event that so clearly illustrates 
the way racism sexism and misogynoir function   in Tangent to infantilize white women and vilify 
black women to the disservice of both groups but   we see exactly that when we take a look at both 
the Public's perception and treatment of Angel   Reese Caitlin Clark and their respective teams 
just like they did when Angela Bassett commit   the heinous crime of fighting back tears instead 
of clapping when Jamie Lee Curtis won the Oscar   she spent decades being passed up for because 
black people always expected to perform to Humble   ourselves to prioritize the feelings of white 
people why America showed their ass when hold   on let me let me let me check my notes because 
I just liked 99% of the white men talking do not   watch women's basketball mind you I don't watch 
any sports of any gender anyway White America   collectively lost their ever loving mind when 
the LSU Tigers beat the Iowa Hawkeyes in the NCAA   Women's tournament championship game and Angel 
Reese did the exact same gesture that Caitlyn   Clark had done to her in an earlier game and not 
only did they have nothing to say negative about   Caitlyn Clark when she did it they celebrated it 
they thought it was badass just like they thought   it was badass when John Cena did it for decades 
after pummeling people just like they had no   problem jumping out the window and calling Angela 
Basset every kind of synonym for uppity negro they   are finding the same way to talk about Angel Reese 
even worse and my first reaction to that was them   I tweeted please don't waste your time arguing 
with racists they're always going to move the goal   post and figure out some distinguishing factor to 
justify why they're cool with a white person doing   something they say is unacceptable when a black 
person does let's just celebrate and uplift Angel   Reese I tweeted that because and that racists will 
always find a justification for their racism and   misogynoir they'll always twist themselves into 
pretzels trying to articulate some explanation   for why they have a legitimate non-racist problem 
for a black person who they are hyper focusing on   and Hyper critiquing it does not matter what you 
do as a black person let alone a black woman not   playing to the respectability politics or shying 
away from the things they stereotype and demean   a racist will always have a problem with you 
what you're doing or how you're doing it period   which is luckily something Angel Reese herself 
understood all year I was critiqued about who I   was nobody I don't yeah the narrative I don't 
fit the narrative I don't fit in the box that   y'all want me to be in I'm too Hood I'm too 
ghetto y'all told me that all year but when   other people do it y'all don't say nothing so 
this was for the girls that look like me that   one that's going to speak up on what they they 
believe in it's unapologetically you and that's   what I did it for tonight this was for the more 
it was bigger than me tonight so I was not about   to stress myself out explaining why the sky is 
blue or grass is green or two plus two equals   four I was just gonna let these racists cry about 
it and laugh at them but then Dave Portnoy of all   people decided to chime in because if white men 
don't have nothing else they have the audacity! and I just could not allow that to stand if you 
do not know who Dave Portnoy is yet you've clearly   avoided The Depths with white bro misogyny culture 
has to offer and good on you Dave Portnoy is the   founder and CEO of Barstool an astonishingly 
classless Haven for in cells men who hate women   and women who hate themselves what do I mean by 
a Haven for men who hate women women who hate   themselves what do I mean by a haven for men who 
hate women, women who hate themselves, incels,   and misogynists I mean in 2007 Barstool featured 
early columns like smoke show of the day in which   employees scoured Facebook for photos of 
attractive local women and guess that ass   which invited readers to guess which female 
celebrity was pictured in each meticulously   cropped image a 2013 profile and Entrepreneur 
magazine described barstool's original offices   as the Unholy Union of a fraternity house in 
a crime scene bear advertisements featuring   half-naked women Adorn the walls towers of junk 
wobble in every corner and the carpet is soiled   with a penolopy of dark dribbles and stains the 
environment reflected their company's irreverent   attitude Portnoy didn't just Court controversy he 
relished in it the online community of stoolies   barstools fans have waged harassment campaigns 
against detractors these have included death   threats doxing online harassment and targeting 
of people's families friends and workplaces   that man quote tweeted a video of Angel Reese 
doing the you can't see me and said she is a   classless piece of fit after being pointed out 
as the bigot and hypocrite that he is and being   rightly dragged for Filth for being silent when 
Caitlin Clark did the exact same thing unlike   his co-defendant in misogynoir Keith Olberman 
who had decided to still miss the point and   instead argue that both ladies were wrong when 
neither were Portnoy instead doubled down on his   comments and leaned into good old-fashioned 
right-wing gaslighting I fundamentally deny   and I think you're basically lying if you're 
saying what Caitlin Clark did and Angel Reese   did are the same thing they're not I like trash 
talking if you hit a big shot in the moment or   you're talking in the moment back and forth and 
you do this or whatever you talk I don't care that   is not what Angel Reese did Angel Reese they're up 
15 points we have a side by side she followed her   after the game was over doing this to her doing 
this find me one example in any sport of anybody   after somebody wins a championship confetti 
coming down not in a close game and find me a   player stalking the best player on the other team 
it does not exist it does not happen if a man did   that he would be called classless and nobody would 
be saying anything Portnoy is doing the exact kind   of nimble gymnastics and goal post shifting that 
bigots like himself always do when they're caught   he knows that he's criticizing a black woman for 
doing the exact same thing he was silent about a   white woman doing so instead of owning that 
instead of walking it back he decides to try   to convince us there's some nuanced difference 
between both women's actions which there's not   by re-characterizing Angel as stalking Caitlin 
around the court and he knows he's a too you   know how he knows it that's why he tries to say oh 
I love trash talking I love it I love it I swear   just knowing this even menacing stuck in black 
does it he tries to convince us it's not trash   talking but instead some never before seen Beyond 
The Pale occurrence that's a big move meanwhile   Caitlin Clark herself says it's trash talking that 
they all do and will continue to do and that Angel   Reese should not be being criticized for it yeah 
you know I don't think Angels should be criticized   at all um you know no matter which way it goes um 
you know she should never be criticized for what   she did um you know I'm just one that competes 
and she competed so um I think everybody knew   there was going to be a little Trash Talk in the 
entire tournament it's not just me and Angel so   um you know I don't think she should be 
criticized like I said Portnoy really tries   to make the argument that it's a man did it if a 
man did it we wouldn't say anything when people   called it classless first of all if a man did it 
we wouldn't say anything at all, run the tape! furthermore he's not just policing women here 
he's specifically policing black women because   if a white woman did it we also wouldn't say 
anything at all just like neither he or White   America said a damn thing when Caitlin Clark 
did it and it's important to note that neither   Caitlin Clark or Iowa have asked to be coddled 
defended or protected this is just what White   America defaults to when they perceive even the 
potential of hurt white woman feelings which   is precisely why first lady Jill Biden fixed her 
mouth to say she wants both teams to come to the   White House together only the winning team goes 
to the White House that's how it is that's how   it's always been but let a team of black women 
beat a team of white women fair and square and   suddenly the first lady of the United States of 
America takes it upon herself to suggest the team   the losing team take part in the reward of the 
winning team because she could just not bare the   thought of these white girls missing out let me 
play a sad song for young the world's smallest   mind you Caitlin Clark herself objected to this 
coddling she never asked for just like she's   objected to people criticizing Angel she said I 
don't know I don't think runner-ups usually go   to the White House I think LSU should you know 
enjoy that moment for them and congratulations   obviously they deserve to go there uh maybe 
I could go to the White House on different   terms so but it doesn't matter what she says or 
wants just like it never mattered to the people   attacking Angela Bassett pretending to defend 
Jamie Lee Curtis's honor that Curtis never once   expressed any issue with Basset's response because 
again this is just society's default reaction to   protecting white women who they perceive both as 
valuable and delicate and in this case of women's   sports it's especially harmful to all women who 
are not being afforded the respect to aggressively   compete and trash talk freely as men are allowed 
to and instead of having a normal game interaction   they're being treated as Pawns in a cultural 
war that only exists in the minds of bigots   like Dave Portnoy which brings me back to the true 
subject of this video pulling Dave Portnoy's file   because when I saw this of all people call Angel 
Reese Classless the first thing I thought was I said to myself and Twitter that I just know 
there ain't no way this Bob's Burger looking   ass who's facing multiple serious violent sexual 
assault allegations from multiple women could be   calling anybody classless Ain't No Way ain't no 
way but yes yes way because white men's audacity   knows no bounds apart from running the Cesspool 
that is bar stool this has been accused of violent   sexual assault multiple times he's facing several 
allegations and when the very damning allegations   that I sure am going to read to you in a moment 
first drop he jumped out the window talking about   oh he's gonna Sue Insider for for releasing 
this story and then he had to drop that suit now the story first dropped on November 
4th 2021 by Julia Black it says the the   headline quotas I was literally screaming 
in pain young women say they met bar stool   Sports founder Dave Portnoy for sex 
and it turned violent and humiliating   in the summer of 2020 Madison sent Barstool Sports 
founder Dave Portnoy a direct message on Instagram   complimenting his famous One Bite Pizza reviews 
sick Pizza reviews she wrote thanks fly Portnoy   responded she was a 20 year old college student at 
the time Portnoy a 43 year old multi-millionaire   43 year old multi-millionaire beginning 
conversations with 20 year old women   talking about fly I know you're flying anyway the 
conversation soon moved to Snapchat and text where   it quickly turned to the topic of sex he sent 
her graphic videos of other women he'd slept with   according to Madison and in messages reviewed 
by Insider he pressed her to tell him about her   sexual fantasies I mean actually this one's 
kind of common she wrote like fantasy where   I don't have any control of what's going on you 
and I are going to get along so well he responded   this is a sick but I will say in order to do 
that one I have to be pretty comfortable with   you Madison said of course Portnoy said and he 
bought her a first class plane ticket to visit him   at his 2.2 million dollar Nantucket home the trip 
was a traumatic experience Madison told Insider   she arrived the Portnoy's four bedroom home at 
about 3 pm tired enough from her travels that   she didn't mind when Portnoy told her that they 
would order in Pizza instead of going out still   she was surprised to find him nothing like his 
charismatic online Persona girl he's a dick online   anyway she said he was very rude he wasn't funny 
at all he just reminded me of a boring grumpy   old man Madison said they started kissing Madison 
said she first became uncomfortable and important   I pulled out his phone and started filming her 
without asking her permission as she performed   oral sex on him I never said anything I 
was scared he was just so mean she said   and here's a screenshot of the text messages where 
she texted her friend after um and she said we had   sex one time someone said was it good she said 
it was so rough I felt like I was he videotaped   me and spit in my mouth and choked me so hard I 
couldn't breathe and it hurt and I was literally   screaming in pain from there things escalated 
until as Madison put it I felt like I was just   a human sex doll two days later Madison texted 
a close friend it was so rough I felt like I was   but I just read to you she recalled crying and 
shouting too much too much and it hurts it was   so painful Madison said I kept trying to get away 
and he was like stop running away from me stop   running away from me but Portnoy she said just 
went harder Madison's flight home wasn't until two   days later so she slept on Portnoy's couch both 
nights they did not have sex again Dave Portnoy   makes no secret of the fact that he likes to have 
sex with young women and to push the boundaries   of what is considered socially acceptable in 
many ways that image is the core brand that has   made one of the made in one of the wealthiest 
and most powerful figures in digital media so then after those allegations drop in November 
2021 few months later three more women come out   and accuse him of violent sexual assault he 
files a lawsuit against Insider and then 14   months later he's forced to drop that law suit 
against Insider do you find it hard to believe   that Portnoy could have done these things I mean 
I don't know he's the man who said this instead   The Following on your site I never condone but if 
you are a size six and you're wearing skinny jeans   you kind of deserve to beat correct I stand 
by that I think it's a funny joke you think   it's funny no I didn't say that I think it's 
a funny joke do you understand how offensive   that is no I obviously don't I bring this all up 
because the audacity of this man the audacity of   white men the audacity of a society that allows 
a man with these kinds of allegations about him   in the public domain to comfortably Levy the 
allegations of classless against a young woman   for which he does in a basketball game anyway 
child in conclusion Dave Portnoy is possibly a   sexual predator but he's definitely a 
bigot and the conch shell of the week hi this is my son Raheem he's a Manecoon AKA a 
big ass cat did you know the average Manecoon   is around 20 pounds and long and big as hell like 
this and very sweet and very docile get you one   get you one
