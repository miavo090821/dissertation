    "text": "I have always hated when people do that stuff personally.\n\nAlso there’s a lot of racism around Angel Reese’s response to Jill Biden’s comments about inviting both teams which is honestly insulting. I’m disappointed she caved in and decided not to stay home.\n\nI was rooting for Iowa for the sole reason that Caitlin Clark was ridiculous. She literally carried the team - if she didn’t score the basket she probably assisted on it or made a defensive play to set it up. I’d never seen anyone so dominant in men’s or women’s basketball before. But one player can’t win em all I guess.",
