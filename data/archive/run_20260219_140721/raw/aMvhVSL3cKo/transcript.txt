israel's u.s funded airstrikes killed 60 children this week 11 of those children were in their homes receiving trauma care from the norwegian refugee council so you had children in their own homes trying to cope with the trauma from the last israeli massacre and now these kids are gone for no reason then biden's out here talking about israel has a right to defend themselves from these kids from these kids who were seeking trauma care in their homes joe this is who israel has the right to protect themselves from and if americans knew palestinian history they would know this argument is ridiculous the palestinians have been massacred and pushed off their land for almost a hundred years read about the nakba which to the palestinians means the catastrophe as the british were losing control in the area they started funding right-wing zionist paramilitaries and guess what they massacred palestinians and pushed them off their land before becoming the state of israel so joe it's palestine not israel who have the right to defend themselves the state you're defending was founded on ethnic cleansing with the support of corrupt western leaders like yourself obviously i'm not the biggest aoc person i think her socialism is based off morality whereas i would argue at least as a political leader you need theory or a scientific understanding of politics and her lack of theory or principles has caused her to do some weird things in washington moving closer to the center but what she's doing right now in response to the violence in palestine is amazing calling out biden by name in public asking how he can claim to stand for human rights while he supports an apartheid state this is why people voted for you aoc so you can call out your fellow democrats when they try and spend 3 billion of our tax dollars funding apartheid states enough opposition within the party may force biden's hand so call your representatives tell them you don't want your tax dollars going to kill palestinian children and rashida talib ilhan omar aoc please keep calling out these right-wing imperialist democrats on their heinous crimes don't let them shut you up with smears like last time opposing apartheid is not bigotry but more of our only means to survival the second i give up and the second i lose hope so this week i've been reading a lot of stuff written by palestinians and talking with a lot of them to make sure my videos about their struggle are accurate and one thing that's been very striking and i found this to be the case when talking with socialists outside the us a lot is how well educated they are on their own struggle and how other countries view their struggle and they're so aware of all the economic sociological and political factors that contribute to their situation so this reminded me of our boy che guevara's theories about guerrilla warfare his theory was that engaging in the struggle fighting against colonialism and capitalism actually forces you to adopt the socialist or communal ethic because you're giving your life for what you believe in we believe that the struggle itself was very important and as shatha says in her video palestinian people don't have a choice they either have to fight or die and that's why there are so many palestinian activists who are some of the most well-read inspiring people you'll ever meet in your life they've been formed in the struggle my family were kicked out of there and they're writing books about me accusing me of terrorism i mean this same false narrative about the people of palestine being described in that video was being pushed by mike pompeo on fox news this morning the palestinian people are violent they're terrorists and israel's acting in self-defense no mention of the billions in weapons funding from the us no mention that 75 percent of palestinian people are refugees and no mention of the children who have been killed by u.s rockets this week they just brush these crimes aside with the racist justification that palestinian people are terrorists is it not obvious to everyone at this point that the real terrorists are people like mike pompeo getting paid millions of dollars to sit there in a nice suit and justify the murder of children free palestine and end the racist war on terror an alliance of latin american countries have condemned israel's military actions against the palestinians venezuela cuba bolivia nicaragua and six others so all these countries the u.s has accused of being dictatorships or human rights abusers the country standing in solidarity against apartheid human rights abusers the country funding apartheid they support freedom and democracy and here's how the u.s treats these countries for not bowing to their interests threatening nicaragua on twitter killing venezuelan civilians with sanctions designating cuba as a terrorist state and of course they overthrew bolivia's government replacing them with right-wing christian fundamentalists who had 13 support because that's what democracy is all about shout out to these countries for showing solidarity with the palestinians and if you live in the u.s can we do something about our government please obviously bolivia is not the human rights abusers okay it's us you know it's funny every single time bernie sanders brought up a proposal like free college or free health care he got berated by corporate media how are you gonna pay for it how are we going to be able to afford education and doctors but see when the us gives a billion dollars a year to colombia to militarize their police or 3 billion to israel to enforce apartheid suddenly nobody's asking that question how do we pay for it because capitalists own the government and the media and that's why you should be a socialist just watch this interview with andrew yang where he's defending his support for israel and one of the main reasons he gives is that there are a lot of economic ties between new york and israel and he thinks putting pressure on israel will hurt new york's economy which honestly makes sense but this is such a good example of how our system works andrew yang was a political newcomer and now he's being forced into supporting an apartheid state to appease the interests of the capitalists in his district the american political system molds politicians into supporting imperialism and that's why resistance to it can only come from the ground up cnn's reporters had to take cover from missile fire while reporting in gaza and anthony blink and biden's secretary of state said both sides need to de-escalate but israel has the right to defend themselves oh yeah anthony is israel leveling homes with missiles they got from the u.s government what you call self-defense here's a recent video of a security guard evacuating a building before the idf blew it up is that what you call self-defense this isn't a two-sided conflict this is an ethnic cleansing that's both funded and supported by the us government they're acting like these souped-up fireworks from the palestinian resistance are the same as the israeli rockets purchased from the military-industrial complex but this is how corporate media works they'll show you the bad things happening around the world they'll show you the violence that's happening in israel they just won't tell you that the u.s has spent three billion dollars a year to fund and support that violence or that this has been happening for over 50 years like cnn says in this segment they need to de-escalate before it's too late what is too late 75 of palestinian people are refugees over 20 people were killed this week including multiple children it's already too late free palestine how can people still argue the us supports freedom and democracy look at the governments the us are supporting right now billions to israel so they can enforce apartheid and have dance parties after evicting palestinians from their homes and the us gives millions of dollars to colombia for peace implementation oh yeah is that what you call shooting protesters or how about saudi arabia's genocide that we're funding in yemen the one biden promised to stop funding and then just didn't not only does the us not support freedom and democracy but we actively prop up the most despotic governments around the world but at least we have a democratic president dropping the bombs now i could stand trump's bombs but not his mean tweets this is why i don't support andrew yang he's saying right now he stands with israel as they're enforcing apartheid evicting palestinians from their homes dropping airstrikes on them in gaza and we all know this has been carried out for years with the help of 3.8 billion dollars a year in funding from the u.s so andrew yang's idea is to give every american a thousand dollars and then continue funding an apartheid state he just wants to continue dropping bombs and overthrowing governments all around the globe and give americans a thousand bucks so they shut up about it that's kind of an exaggeration but not really a ubi would be sweet but it doesn't fix most our problems
