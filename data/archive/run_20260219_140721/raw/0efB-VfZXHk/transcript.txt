alrighty man there's nothing like getting started with the international and then Dr King uh I'm joined today by by good comrade shabir rzvy who's a political analyst and Anti-Imperialist organizer specializing in geopolitical developments in US foreign politics he's someone who uh I've been hoping to have on the show for a very long time we've been publishing his work for for quite a while so thank you so much for coming on comrade shabir thank you for having me comrade so uh the first question I wanted to ask you um The Economist Michael Hudson views the current genocidal war on Palestine as the US's opening of a third front against Iran one of the countries our Empire considers to be part of the Triad of evil along with of course Russia and China Iran of course is almost always in the western mainstream media news hanging around like a sort of Boogeyman in the discussion of Palestinian resistance is it correct to say that the war on Palestine is at least in part a component of a larger imperialist push against Iran I would say absolutely I mean let's talk about it from day one day one of the of Iran's Islamic revolution in 1979 day one AI issued a statement that said that we will always back Palestine and that we will never recognize the Israeli State and that one of the main components of the Islamic reevolu solution in Iran is to get rid of this colonial entity known as Israel and all other Colonial entities in the region as well so right from the GetGo you know that you know Iran won't stand for Israel Israel will not stand for not stand for Iran now in the Contex of what Michael Hudson is saying um one Iran has throughout the years experienced horrific sanctions horrific attempts to you know undermine it its processes undermine its economy um overthrow its leaders and within that it's it's been self-sufficient and hasn't really relied on other countries at all for its development this has led to uh Iran kind of cultivating its own economy creating its own economic ties based on um you know its own kind of Demands as we see kind of you know it's strengthening partnership with Russia with China with its entry into bricks with its entry into the Shanghai cooperation organization and so what we see now is that Iran stands as this economic Powerhouse or developing economic Powerhouse but more so it's become what we call a regional power now the United States uh as it tries to grow its uh hamonic Power is definitely looking into obviously throwing hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars into Israel I always call Israel the 51st state Israel is kind of the Gateway for the United States into the region and if you call Prime Minister netanyahu's speech at the United Nations General Assembly just a few months ago he had a map uh of what he called the new Middle East by the way Palestine was completely erased he just had Israel on it and he talked about specifically the Abraham Accords and he talked about specifically trade routes and now what that means is the only way that this that this state this illegitimate state of Israel is planning to sustain itself right now is through basically US economic intervention but in order for it to justify itself it needs to be able to expand and play in harmony with the other states in the region now we have some states uh like for example Saudi Arabia and the UAE that capitulated to Israel right they you know turned their backs on the Palestinian cause and they could pilate to Israel but then you have some states that stand as a literal physical blockade to Israel and so it's not a matter of fact that you know they're going to want war with Iran is the fact that this war is ongoing it's happening right now and the fact of the matter is the war is not between just Israel and Iran or America and Iran it's about the complete Global Imperial uh system versus the global majority what we would call the global self so yes um I would definitely see I would definitely agree with what uh Michael Hudson would have to say there that's such an important component brother because uh you know there's a lot of our our friends who have been extremely critical of the Zionist project um who are critical of the genocide that Israel is is waging with uh us funding and equipping on the people of Gaza uh but who don't have the systematic analysis because they're not uh rooted in the Marxist tradition that can clearly see how the imperialist system is bound to produce uh catastrophes uh as the one we're seeing right now waged on the Palestinian people um I wanted to move to another uh section of the discussion on Iran Cuban president di canel recently visited Iran where he met with President Ibrahim Ry and the Ayatollah Kamai uh what was the purpose of of this visit what agreements were reached between the two countries and how have the relationships between Cuba and Iran developed in the last few years yeah it's definitely an interesting uh thing to analyze especially right now because if you look at the history of both countries one they started off by overthrowing a us back dictator that essentially uh was a comador it was a compor regime and throughout the years of course they enjoyed warm relations but not so much as warm as they enjoy today you know there's numerous pictures you can find of Fidel Castro meeting with Ayah Ki there's numerous pictures of him meeting with various IR Iranian presidents um but right now I think we're going to see an increase in relations particularly between the racy Administration and zaz Canal's Administration but why now why is that so important right well let's actually take a look let's take let's take it a few steps back a lot of people a lot of critics of let's say Anti-Imperialist countries always criticize that these countries um you know invest so much into military invest so much into weapons invest so much into arms and things like that why don't they focus on their people now we both know that that's a liberal take it's you know it's not a very um rooted in science take right so let's actually play this out right let's say Iran and Cuba try to enjoy warm economic relations as they do now let's say 10 years ago let's say Iran sends a fleet of much uh let's say sends like multiple you know shifts of much needed resources to Cuba right it has oil it has you know pharmaceutical stuff it has you know just basic technology that you know Cubans can't take for granted right what happens the moment that they leave the Red Sea boom you're gonna have the United States Navy all over you they're going to be stealing your ship in fact right now as I'm speaking there is a stolen araban goods off the Gulf of Mexico basically the oil baring of the United States are are considering taking it but the one thing that now stands in its way and this is exactly what I'm getting to is Iran now has a Navy that's capable of actually protecting its goods that's able to sail across the world um in May of this year I believe it was the 82nd or the 86th Fleet of the Iranian Navy completed a worldwide flotilla uh went all across the world therefore proving that it has the ability to navigate from one part of the from one part of Earth to the other back unharmed now what does that add to the equation that basically is a huge security guarantee you know Cuba can send Iran millions of dollars to say hey can you send us this but if there's no security guarantee that is a bad investment that is a terrible investment and so what Iran has done is has slowly but surely has beefed up its Navy has beefed up its Air Force as we just saw actually just wrote about this a few days ago the purchase of Russian 235s is a game changer for the region and now what Iran can do is say hey Cuba we're actually going to trade with you we're gonna trade with Nicaragua we're gonna trade with Venezuela and there's nothing United States can do about it unless it wants to get smoked in its own Waters there you go and so what now we're seeing in this new what we call multi-polar world is the ability for these countries that have been so ruthlessly uh sanctioned so ruthlessly strangled by the United States that have been blatantly um you know raided by the United States there millions of dollars worth of stuff stolen now we're seeing that equation beginning to kind of change now we have security guarantees now we have different countries willing to being able to actually trade very openly and let's talk about this too right Cuba is completely isolated um mostly by the West right every year we see the UN vote where the entire world says hey let's unblock Cuba and the United States and Israel say no and and the Ukrainian government because they're ran by a bunch of spineless cowards uh of stain and so what happens then uh the United States basically has complete domination over the West the West is where all the Pharmaceuticals lie the west where all the technology rights lie West is where everything that actually needs a patent lies uh until now because now countries like Iran that have maintained self-sufficiency for so long and Cuba has maintained self defens youry for so long but could not trade because of the Peril at se are now able to trade and so what we're going to see not only just now but even in the months to come actually started this spring when President REI did a three Country tour of Latin America he went to Cuba he went to Venezuela and he went to Nicaragua now we're going to see more established relations between countries within the global South which to the to the you know not well-versed reader would be like well why don't these people just trade together now they can actually trade together and actually have the security guarantees needed in order for both of their economies to thrive that's such an important Point brother because we've seen it uh you know with the shipments to to Venezuela where uh the us just like Pirates you know it's like modern day Pirates they just take it and then give it to uh to their oil barings um yeah and that development the the role of developing the Securities of a country the ability to protect itself militarily um against the forces of imperialism is so important that's why xia and Li when he uh lays out the for modernizations that end up becoming a central focus of the reform and opening up period in China besides the forces of production besides Science and Technology besides agriculture you have the defenses the defenses of of a country um so that these Securities uh can can be put in place uh and and allow for Fruitful trade amongst folks in the Anti-Imperialist Camp um the next question I wanted to ask you is that you know I think it's it becomes clear to anyone who can see two fingers in front of their face that uh we're witnessing the rise of a new post hegemonic uh multi-polar if we're with chave plur poolar uh World um but one that is also quite ideologically heterogeneous um what role do you think these ideologically diverse Nations such as Iran Cuba Russia China Venezuela play in helping to usher in a new world order I think xan ping said this best I'm gonna completely butcher this quote um but he said that true democracy is the ability of people to be able to practice their own form of democracy and what they deem is right and what they deem is culturally valuable and what I think this ushers in is basically the acceptance that um you don't have to practice Western liberalism in order to be considered a democracy democracy is what the majority of people within a state agree to what they want to be governed by agree to the cultural norms that they want to be governed by um it might be unpopular with another state a certain cultural or political practice but if if one state likes it then that's totally fine here here's a great example of that let's actually go back to Iran and let's go back to Cuba right many people uh kind of write off the Iranian Revolution because you know there it was considered anti-marxist in my opinion the Iranian people just had a bad tent with Marxism because the majority of marxists During the Revolution were you know trucks and then of course there was one of the you know mistakes that we have to be critical of the Soviet Union for was arming saddan to bomb Iran um which is what which is ultimately why Iran did not like the communist or did not like Marxist Marxism quote unquote although a lot of you know policies within a specific economies could be attributed to you know socialist policies but that's a whole other thing of its own right so just knowing that kind of background and context and cultural take on Marxism from certain Iranians why would they do business with you know communist Cuba why would they do business with communist Venezuela why would they do business with communist China it doesn't make sense right well that's actually where you have it completely wrong what we're seeing is you know the the global unifier here is the ability to be Sovereign the ability to do what you feel is right for your nation and as long as another Nation isn't infringing on said rights we can totally work together this is completely contrary to you know the Western dominated neoliberalism that we see today where if you know if you don't have this and that in your voting booth and if you don't have such and such delers and if you don't have this and that you know private uh private corporations you know looking at you throughout all hours of the day and this this and that surve veillance State then you're not you know considered a true democracy right and that's the kind of like the Western way it's a really you know childish way that I just really put it but what I'm trying to say is essentially that you know the world doesn't need to abide by you know the the definition of democracy that that the West has made for itself um while you know maintaining this authoritarian rule over its own people and so with this emerging New roal Order we're going to see a lot of different ways that what we will see democracy that what we call democracy be practiced as and I think one thing that you know we as Marist have to keep in mind is that we have to be kind of um open-minded about the way different states practice what they call democracy but because it all relates down to what the people's struggle there is and their kind of relationship to the state their relationship to you know the people's relationship to the mus of production the people's relationship to imperialism and how they go about conveying that how they go about navigating that 100% uh I I couldn't possibly agree with you more um here at the Institute where uh very big critics of what we call the Purity fetish you know this idea that's prevalent in the western left that if something doesn't measure up to the pure idea I have of it in my head I'm going to condemn it and you find that to be the case very much so with not just uh socialist countries existing outside of the sphere of influence of Empire but not explicitly socialist not explicitly communist countries uh that are playing a historically Progressive role in the fight that they're waging against uh a currently us-led uh imperialism um I wanted to switch to our next question which requires me uh to pull up uh quite a few uh different uh things the first one is a a study that here that confirms from UNICEF that Israel has killed nearly 9,000 uh children and I think a lot of these numbers are are quite low you know but when you see the numbers of of deaths being brought into question by mainstream media it's usually because they're doing some BS uh tactic like well it comes from uh the Hamas Health institutions who are telling us you know how many people have died in reality there's tens of thousands of people under the rubble that haven't been found yet and therefore cannot yet be confirmed dead so um whenever you see even these numbers it is likely that that it's a lot less but but um in conjunction with that just to set the the table for the next uh couple of uh comments recently Pentagon Chief Lloyd Austin uh said the following Let's uh play this and and then I have one more uh clip to show before I ask you the question this kind of a fight the center of gravity is the civilian population and if you drive them into the arms of the enemy you replace a tactical Victory with a strategic defeat so I have repeatedly made clear to Israel's leaders that protecting Palestinian civilians in Gaza is both a moral responsibility and a strategic imperative so there's uh the US Empire uh speaking in terms in which it wasn't you know uh almost 60 days ago describing um the potential or or the actuality of a strategic defeat that could be had uh by Israel and then this uh this came out I believe today this is UN National Security um Secretary General Antonio gutieres or gues uh who invoked article 99 of the UN Charter to urge the security Council to force a ceasefire on israeli's genocidal war in Gaza so um comrad shabir what I wanted to ask you is uh basically it's it's extremely clear that the vast majority of the world um those not included when the US and its laeis speak about the International Community which we know it's reduced to the 14% of the world that colonize the rest of the planet but the vast majority of the global South and the vast majority of the citizens within the global North itself within the the heart of the empire in our country the vast majority of people are in favor of a ceasefire and uh the vast majority of the world of the world is is in favor of even more than a ceasefire um is in favor of an end to the occupation in the apartheid uh state of Israel it currently exists so how do you see this playing out how long can the genocidal war against the Palestinians last in the face of such Global condemnation and such clear defeat in the information War yeah I it's a question that a lot of people are asking let me actually start off by talking about the UN Charter or whatever resolution they they passed you can invoke the charter and you can pass the resolution um Israel has broken over 65 resolutions since its Inception so you know if you can pass a resolution that's great but are they going to abide by that probably not um let's talk about a ceasefire sure we can have a ceasefire um and you know I agree with the ceasefire I agree with um you know this this the stoppage of the Israeli bombs or rather the US made bombs dropped by Israel stop it drop it you know obviously stopping from being bombing uh the go SHP but I think more importantly what it comes down to is those bombs are going to stop dropping again right they're going to continue dropping the occupation doesn't end there the siege of Gaza doesn't end there um you know even before the war started Gaza didn't even have like pure water it it most of its water was contaminated um very few materials are allowed into the strip um they don't get construction materials they they don't even get basic medicine in order to you know get life-saving surgery for even having cancer um it's it's a monthlong process and often times that that end of that monthlong process you're denied from even leaving right so what it comes down to is sure you can have your ceasefire you can have your temporary ceasefire or whatever you want to call it but the fact of the matter is it's an ongoing genocide and the only way you're going to solve that equation is by the complete dissolution of the occupation there's no other way around it there's no other way that this equation can be solved the fact of the matter is that Israel is a very very expensive investment and there's no return on investment let's actually look at it from the aspect of the Bourgeois Z let's put our best capitalist hat on and think about this we are pouring billions of dollars into our 51st state and what what does our 51st state do it's a PR catastrophe there's no products being delivered we have to constantly make excuses for it uh meanwhile they're killing kids they're making up stories so their PR department is trash uh because they can't even make up a good lie a literal State that's built on lies cannot do the one thing that it was built on and that's L it's even failing at that and so what does that mean one there's no other way you you have to eventually the United States is eventually going to have to cut off you know it its military aid or do something it's going to be either publicly pressured or just not going to see a return on investment it's going to hold on until its last breath but rest assured they will have to let go of this two the only way that this really ends the only way like I said this really ends is the victory of the Palestinian people over the Zionist occupation there is no other way that will permanently solve this other than the defeat of Israel and what's going to happen now in at least the short term and that's three there's no other way to look at it Israel is going to lose this why because if the entire world is telling them to have a ceasefire for example right they already laid out their plans they already laid out their strategic objectives they want to wipe out Hamas so what does a ceasefire mean the world is pressuring Israel to lose is the way that they're looking at it and they're going to have no choice but to but to toss the glove because what's what's happening right now as I'm speaking I'm getting notifications of the latest Alum video hitting hitting the internet with these guys just walking up the tanks and blowing the living out of them dude you cannot win against these people that are so committed to the liberation of their Homeland meanwhile you have a diaper Army that runs away at the slightest you know knock on a door you cannot win this you cannot beat the Palestinian people and no Charter is going to say the Palestinian people no outside intervention is going to save the Palestinian people because it's going to be the Palestinian people that heroically tell the world that this is how you deal with occupation this is going to set off a chain reaction of anyone else that is currently under any us or otherwise other imperialist occupation and shit's going to get real and that's what I think we can expect in not only the coming years but the coming days beautifully said brother that's how Algeria liberated itself that's how the Irish liberated them M El that's how um many many of the other great anti-colonial revolutions liberated themselves and uh yeah I think you you couldn't be more right uh Israel is as as we've been talking about it a colonial Outpost for American imperialism in the region and it's been bearing very little fruit besides PR catastrophes and um it it hasn't been able to achieve any of the objectives or or a good number of the objectives that it uh exists for um and all it brings is is more uh a rather radical intensification of the delegitimation of the imperialist system uh that Israel is very evidently one of the key components of um brother uh it's been an absolute pleasure pleasure having you on we're going to have to bring you back on soon um is there anything you'd like to plug before we uh send you on your way yeah I got two things for your audience so whether you prefer for Twitter or Instagram get on that right now I'm going to give you two things so one you're
