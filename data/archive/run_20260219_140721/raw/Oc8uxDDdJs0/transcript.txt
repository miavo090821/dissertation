part of part of the major problem that we're having at the moment is an ongoing information war with the forces of political correctness against the forces of i think we can describe it as just broadly populism and uh and this is manifesting itself in one titanic battle between project veritas uh james o'keefe's activist organization to try and hold the media accountable and the new york times which i believe just passed seven million paid subscribers uh making them i think the largest uh like uh membership uh funded news organization in the world so this is a real sort of david and goliath um battle that's going on and the new york times has been swinging hard against project veritas now they've been condemning project veritas for many many years now um but the most recent one that was significant was when project veritas had video of what they alleged was ballot harvesting in ilhan omar's district this was claimed to be fake or misleading but there was no evidence or real rationale given for why it was fake or misleading the accusation seems to be well this has come from james o'keefe and he is a bad man therefore this is fake and project veritas replied to this uh by simply saying no it's real you can see the video james keeping quite an impassioned video threw down the gauntlet and then declared that he was launching a lawsuit against new york times which is of course currently in progress and so we come to the 2020 elections that happened on the 3rd of november on the 4th of november project veritas released a video from a one richard hopkins a local postal worker in barlow michigan who alleges he was issued a directive to post-date ballots that were dated for the fourth or afterwards the day after the election to be instead having been received on the third so they could be counted this got a million views on youtube alone and caused something of a response and so two days later project veritas released another video of richard hopkins in which he stands by his allegations and makes further allegations that he heard the postmaster actually say that the ballots need to be backdated so it wasn't just a directive he also heard them saying the same thing and on november the 10th uh project veritas released a an art sorry the new york times published an article about this if you can bring image one please john um the the uh the article claims that the postal worker richard uh yeah richard hopkins uh has withdrawn his claim that the ballots were backdated in pennsylvania they say this quote richard hopkins a post office employee in erie completely in quotes recounted his allegations that a supervisor was tampering with mail-in ballots after investigators questioned him the the inspector general's office said according to the democratic leadership of the house oversight and reform committee it's interesting isn't it the fact that it's democratic operatives and agents who are making the claim that he has retracted but they also slightly further down in the article say not long after the democrats announcement project veritas a conservative group that researchers say is engaged in a coordinated disinformation campaign to delegitimize the voting process released the video in which mr hopkins said that he had not actually recounted the state statements this is a 46 second video and it's pretty damn category in which he just says i do not recant i stand by what i said i this is this is not true this is fake news and the new york times have actually included that in their article so they know that it's fake news and yet they're still titling it that he has recanted it they still put the democratic leadership have said he's recounted it and it's just they don't care i mean just fake news it's just open fake news this and they admit that it's fake news in the article itself which is staggering can we go on to image two please because this is not where the end of the leaks come because then uh richard hopkins was uh interrogated by federal agents and it appears in the in the uh this secretly recorded audio that they're trying to gaslight him as you can see here what he's saying is that we like to control our mind and when we do that we convince ourselves of a memory and he goes on to then say things like as you can say there i'm trying to twist you a little bit i'm scaring you here and then he says but i'm not trying to get you know i'm scaring you but i'm not scaring you and stuff like this and it really i'm not trying to twist you i'm trying well i'm trying to just do a little bit yeah that's what i like you know but maybe you just made up this memory and it's very much well very strange isn't it i mean it feels very much like they're trying to gas like this guy and so i'm very glad that he came out and said no this is what i you know i stand by what i've done and uh and so we can go to uh today's headline of the new york times which image three election officials nationwide find no fraud well there we go then it's just that's it that's all you need to hear isn't it that's what millions of people will see on the newsstands and on the internet they'll see the headline and that's it the narrative has been set there is no fraud how dare you um in fact those um those three uh of sorry six uh statements that they've got in the center they're actually fantastic um because what they've done is asked two republicans and four democrats uh the two republicans are in republican safe states which are ohio and uh kansas you can see trump plus 15 ohio trump plus eight these are not contested at all but the the washington biden plus 20 fine we can take that one out obviously but uh but it's interesting michigan minnesota and pennsylvania are the three of the states that are most in question as to whether there are concerns of voter fraud there and they asked as you can see the democratic the office of the general uh attorney general for the state in pennsylvania democrat minnesota a democrat michigan a democrat and they're asking them effectively have the democrats been cheating in the election mr democrat and all of them have come back and said no actually we're not well that's reassuring exactly i mean another one from kansas as well where the quote is actually just kansas did not experience any widespread systematic voter fraud and that's not the question is it that's not what we're interested in well that's that's the point but the but that's the thing i mean i'm sure that in kansas that's not the case but uh as the bbc recently well detailed in 2016 an article on how to support voter fraud uh you look for a small selection of heavily contested states that have long voting delays strange number of ballots bizarre occurrences poll watchers not being able to see the polls etc etc which all occurred in these states but the new york times article headline no no nationwide fraud the people that are being accused of fraud have told us so and that's it um they say this murderer says he did not commit the murder well they might yeah that's it guys we've done our investigation the new york times contacted the officers of the top election officials in every state on monday and tuesday to ask whether they suspected or have evidence of illegal voting officials in 45 states responded directly to the times four of the remaining states time spoke to other statewide officials or found public comments from secretaries of the state none reported any major voting issues well then i just guess that's it that question's over um and so the all that remains really is for the new york times again to dig the knife in this is from the article that's listed just below trump marshall's federal this is just a quick quote from it to overturn his election fee president trump facing the prospect of leaving the white house in defeat in just 70 days is harnessing the power of the federal government to resist the results of an election that he has lost something that no sitting president has ever done in american history uh that's pretty assumption assumptive isn't it like he hasn't lost it yeah the there's still a bunch of uh states that are of contestation there are a bunch of states that are doing recounts all attorney a general attorney general barr came out and said no we're free to continue investigating any of these suspicious activities and this has not been called and for some reason they're just stating it categorically as if biden has won this is it this is the impression that people are supposed to get um well so the idea that a sitting president has not tried to use the federal government to defend whether or not he's won yeah in living memory we have this for george bush surely yes george bush against al gore in 2004. i mean it's not the new york times like most of their audience is is of the elder description anyway so they'll know they'll know this is just nonsense i i i i guess it doesn't matter again just like he recounts it but he doesn't but i mean yeah exactly it just doesn't matter it just there's no consistency um gofundme i think it was today or yesterday uh for image four removed hopkins fundraiser as he was placed uh on off-duty status without pay at his postal job which apparently they can do um this is as you can see with the what i mean surely you have to like do something wrong in the job to get off duty without pay yeah the the the uh thing they charged him under was like the the examples that were used in the um the legalese were people who had committed some sort of crime you know postal fraud or had been turning up to work drunk or something like this so i mean i don't even know what this guy's been accused of doing wrong he's a whistleblower and he made a swan affidavit about having seen or heard these things so this is something that should be investigated further so do you reckon it's because i saw james o'keefe's video and they were bringing up stuff that he had already adjudicated yeah do you reckon it's one of them where they're like oh five months ago you had a complaint against you therefore it could be who knows um you know who knows what it is um but he's been placed on off duty states so it seems that not only has he been smeared by the press he has been intimidated and gaslit by the federal investigators and he's having his ability to make money withdrawn from him all over making claims that he has seen corruption going on um not good i think there probably should be some kind of protection for people like this he does have another crowdfunder up so if people are interested in helping him out they can go and donate to that um can we can we then pull up video two democrats and republicans alike should have a president that everyone supports and believes fairly elected as of right now there are massive allegations of voter fraud and you need to they're not there are not massive allegations of voter fraud there are claims of massive allegations there are not massive allegations there are a few individual cases but there are not massive i mean her smile in response to that is exactly how i feel about this and he seems to be losing it there are hang on there are not there are massive allegations there are claims there are claims of massive allegations okay i mean i mean that's the level we're at now where there are allegations of allegations about this thing yeah but well no there are there are out there are not ali but you can see how upset he's getting he's he's visibly uh perturbed by what's happening here um because she is right there there are lots of serious questions that have been raised here she's not rattled at all no she's not sure she's i know there are claims i'm going to say there are claims and uh in fact if we can and the he seems to be trying to maintain the new york times narrative which i think is going to be the sort of left-wing globalist pro-biden narrative which is of course there were no claims of allegations of fraud even even this guy that project verit has found who claims to have first hand seen the thing has recounted his story on it even though he didn't and we admit that he didn't and everyone can see the video that he didn't um but if we can go to image five quickly please john do we want to play the rest of this actually oh yeah and again it is wrong to tell the world that that is the case and what is more you know perfectly well that when the states do certify the results which they're probably going to do in the next couple of weeks that's game over you can't overturn certified state results can you no one is arguing who the winner should be the american people deserve you are you are you've just said you've just said joe bart you've just told me you've just told me joe biden is not the winner so you are arguing it don't say you're not arguing it you are he is darling i told you that he is not the president-elect of the united states which he is not he has not been certified by each state secretary of state and electoral college has not met yet so if you want to be a proper brit and be technical those are the technicalities you know everyone okay right she's just playing with him now yeah i i i mean he she's absolutely right joe biden can be called by the media all day every day and it was the new york times who said it's the media that gets the call no it's not the media the guest call and they've called it wrong many times in the past this reminds me a lot of the bbc um every video they put out they've always put a disclaimer um donald trump has presented no evidence of voter fraud at the end of every video and it reminds me of that like it's it's like when you're debating someone and they know they've done goofed yeah but they can't admit it so they just instantly get rattled every time you call them now they're angry now because every time you call it out they know they're losing more ground yeah that's exactly it and uh yeah so when adam bolton claims there are no claims uh there are claims of allegations there are no allegations themselves uh well uh kaylee mcnamee the the press secretary has um apparently demolished this claim of adam bolton's she says she has 234 pages of sworn affidavits regarding real allegations of voter fraud so i mean adam bolton must be putting a shotgun in his mouth about now or something like that he must must be quite having quite a bad day in the newsroom um so it's therefore it's it's the whole well if i don't see any claims there are no claims because i hope she you know i wish she'd actually just pointed out there but what about the the project veritas video footage that's a singular claims now now will you retract your statement and say there is evidence it's under investigation instead of there is no evidence and see where his response would be because his response would be well no no no there is no evidence and he just carry on the lie and he would even more expose that he's just uh jumping to a narrative rather than interested in yeah figuring out but it's it's genuinely shocking just how open the lies are and how open they are just with how they they understand you know we they're showing us that look we can just we can print whatever headline we want and set a public narrative like this because i saw a poll uh earlier that suggests that 80 of people in america think joe biden won and it's because the news headlines are all saying joe biden is the president like joe biden's present like we've covered it multiple times already but he's not this is just not true and it's not finished you know there are going to be a load of investigations a bunch of recounts and there are apparently 234 pages of uh allegations uh so like it'll be different things so like i wasn't allowed to see these ballots that came in someone else's postal thing yeah and you know and there's all sorts of videos from people who poll watchers are saying i'm not allowed to go and do this all these things are illegal you know the poll watchers have to be able to see these things and this is just general miasma of corruption around these sort of four democrats run sort of uh heart like you know cities the the major cities in these four contested states that had a huge amount of postal votes but yeah and and then you get so um we're still we're still counting votes apparently but trump is now beyond 71 million so he's he's nearly at 72 million so he's nearly 3 million above barack obama at this point but joe biden's 75 million he's got up by another million himself and it's like this is wild i don't know i mean with the population growth does that not account for it i don't know just if you're looking at raw numbers it's it's only it's only been four years and you know the population probably hasn't changed that much in four years and it's really significantly higher so there are definitely definitely reasons to suspect [Music]
