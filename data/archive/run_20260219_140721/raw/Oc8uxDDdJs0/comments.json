They will elevate and jump on any opportunity to virtue signal about how they've rooted out racism against a minority, a woman, or a gay person, but when they discriminate openly by saying they will hire/promote in favor of those groups, (which is, in effect, discrimination against white men), then that's called being anti-racist and anti-sexist. Look at Trudeau - decided arbitrarily to have a 50-50 male/female split in his cabinet, effectively discriminating based on gender, rather than purely on merit. It would be like if the NBA arbitrarily decided that it would only have 13% black players, 63% white, 18% hispanic, 3% asian, because that's the broader population composition - nevermind that it in no way reflects the composition of talented ball players.",
