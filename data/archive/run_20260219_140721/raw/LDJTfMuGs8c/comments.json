The mass majority of Americans don’t behave like the degenerates on social media do(this goes for both sides btw) maybe that’s because they’re in person and can’t hide behind a screen…but I honestly think it’s more that most people just genuinely aren’t THAT invested in politics. The mass majority of Americans aren’t super left or right wing…and they’re a lot more willing to hear different perspectives than people online. So yeah, these actors seen all the screaming and yelling coming from the left online for sooooo long that they genuinely believed this is just how 80% of the country feels. The reality was…that’s just the loudest and most obnoxious of the population😂😂 and since democrats are usually far more popular among the youth, who are obviously the most loud and obnoxious of all, they’re the ones that you would see more than anyone else whenever you’re scrolling on your phone. Now it’s a bit different since the democrats just seem like the old guy trying to act cool😂😂it’s now an insult among people in their teens/early twenties if you voted for Biden or Harris. They’ll say some s*** like “yeah, you look like a Biden voter”😂😂so now a lot of the youth lean to the right. I’d say it’s probably still left leaning but it’s really close now…whereas it use to be like 90/10 left leaning. And with Gen alpha apparently being the most conservative generation in American history, it might just swing totally to the right for the youth. Ig that could depend on how well, or horribly, the trump administration does these next 3 years. Anyway, the point is…now these celebrities are SEEING the blowback from being soooooo far left. It use to be nothing but praise for them online…and that’s not the case anymore. Which is the ONLY reason they’re toning it down more and more. Sadly for them(not for us😂😂)if they say ANYTHING that even HINTS at not being 100% subservient to the far left, they’ll get completely dawg’d out…because that’s what the far left does when you don’t agree 100% with them. Which is why celebrities are tiptoeing around the fact that they’re not so progressive anymore now that it’s not the “cool” thing to be.",

It is simple, self-interested greed's survival. \n\nShe might as well be saying \"I don't care about causes as much as I care about my pocket book\". Hollywood as a whole has realized that they will lose to new competitors if they keep appealing to only one audience. It's why budgets and big-name actors are going to traditionally conservative friendly subject matter like ranching and living in middle America. It's why Nate Bargatze has hosted SNL twice in just a few years despite the entire staff hating conservatives. This is the \"revelation\" the studios have made after the 50th woke flop. So it took a LOT to get them there. \n\nJennifer Lawrence is simply an opportunist like Emma Watson. She just sells the same idea better than Emma Watson. Secretly they still feel everything they always felt, which is superior and condescending. They simply now realize they can't win this superiority/enlightenment game (in their own heads anyway) and also stay rich. Simple as that.",
