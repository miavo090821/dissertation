    "text": "As someone that's trying to learn more about socialism...this video missed the mark so damn bad. I was excited to learn about hpn but you guys spent more time shitting on the blm movement instead. Claiming that black americans don't have \"leaders\" and don't engage in theory is so ignorant and disrespectful,  esp when you guys are literally mentioning multiple black leaders/theorists in the same breathe. You guys rely on theory because for whatever reason the experiences of marginalized people aren't enough...you get radicalized by theory because you don't have the life experiences that cause people to mobilize. Theory isn't what the black community needs, we use that to teach you guys because you don't empathize with our struggles alone, you just use our experiences to add to the academia to support your causes. so no, black americans don't need theory, we need you guys to explain why this is beneficial to us and american society. claiming we don't have enough leaders but ignoring how racism plays a role in this is obtuse. you guys are romanticizing the bp movement as exciting and liberating, for a lot of black americans it was deeply traumitizing...our leaders were assasinated, and our communties had the cia plant drugs in our neighborhoods to then create the war on drugs to imprison us. i'm not sure how you guys are not accounting for why this may play a role in current black liberation movements. socialism in pro black spaces had a lot of negative consequences. this is also why the bay area/cali has strict gun control laws, it was a direct response to the black panthers. so please don't skip over the context and spend so much time shitting on black liberation movements without talking about all of this. if you want more support, tell us why! don't sit here being critical if youre not going to engage in the historical context. \n\nyou guys spent so much time shitting on america and saying we're hypocrites for demonzing other countries. i already know this...I'm trying to figure out why communism is better. so instead of hyper fixating on defending your cause, tell me why its better! comparing how the u.s is just as shitty as china does nothing...talk more about how china has alleviated poverty (like explain, don't just say it has). also, you guys said cuba doesn't have systemic racism, but aren't there a ton of issues with haiti and black dominicans there? like lets not romanticize everything....or atleast spend more time showing real world material change instead of whatever all of this was...\n\nI've been trying to find engaging leftist content but so much of it is wedded in philosophy and theory. I\"m not sure if this podcast was supposed me convince me or if its for people already engaged in the movement? if its the latter, you guys are going to just spend the next decade talking to yourselves lol. I learned nothing new from this, I just left feeling frustrated and alone :( its just more shitting on black people but ignoring history, all while using black leaders for clicks...",
