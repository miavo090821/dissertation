hello everyone my name is eddie smith uh from midwestern marks here with carlos carrito as always um but also a very special guest we're very pumped to have chandler on today the communard on tick tock um how you doing today chandler i'm doing good i'm excited to be on here i've been looking forward to this and yeah uh gonna be a great conversation for sure you've been probably my favorite person on tick tock for since i joined the app um always spreading the the love through the comments and i can tell uh no we've had limited face-to-face interaction we think uh very similarly about socialism so very happy to have you on to have a little bit of a more long-form discussion here yeah no absolutely i feel the same about you you're one of the first accounts that i came across um on tick-tock that had to do with uh socialism i before i had just like seen like random videos pop up on my um on my feed and then i saw some of your videos and i started getting more into it i decided to start making my own here we are so yeah for sure for sure so we wanted to talk a little bit um about healy p newton and and also his book revolutionary suicide um huey p i mean i i'll let you guys mostly talk about him because you know more than me but you said he was one of the one of the figures who inspired you to get into maybe not leftism but marxism specifically so if you just want to talk about that yeah i think it'd be great yeah um so at the time uh i hadn't read much um i hadn't read much theory or really read much at all uh i i'd consider myself to be a communist um but i fell more along the lines of uh anarchism and one of my friends recommended that i read revolutionary suicide for those of you don't know it's uh huey p newton's autobiography who uh along with bobby seal founded the black panther party and it's just about his life um and it's it's really interesting because he goes into not just his life story but he ties it all in with theory and how his life story led him to uh you know approaching the world with the framework of analysis that he used so reading it was really interesting because it introduced me to a lot of uh concepts within marxism that i hadn't really paid much attention to before i'd really just looked into anarchism and that's what really opened me up to looking into uh marxist forms of communism and you know reading lenin and now here i am um but huey p newton is still to this day my favorite marxist theorist of all time um it was just a brilliant mind and had a crazy life for sure um carlos you said you read some of the philosophy of huey p newton too um maybe not the whole book uh do you have anything you want to ask chandler um well i just wanted to comment that i do agree he's probably one of the in terms of praxis revolutionary practices one of the most active ones that we've had in our history um and you you look at the stuff that he's engaging with he says specifically on the chapter where he's talking about the founding of the black panthers um who is he engaging or he's engaging with phanom the restaurant of the earth he's engaging with che guevara's works his engagement with mao um and and the funny thing is that we have an organization that's founded on on these principles of marxist socialism um on anti-calling a struggle and and we have today certain figures from from this organization or just the aesthetic um that just gets whitewashed so i think like like many of the other figures in the black radical tradition that that um parts of their message are kept other parts are are removed um it's important work that we have to do uh with with huey p newton and the panthers to reaffirm with what they actually stood for which was revolutionary socialism they looked at the black community as not just oppressed in the us but they looked at them as living in a colonial situation they looked at black communities um like they looked at palestine right um and and the the framework that we have to use when we engage with these revolutionary thinkers isn't honest we can't just dilute the messages and part of our task is to reaffirm the beliefs that they had and as socialists in the u.s um we have to come to to to face the fact that at least in the 20th century um the history of the socialist and communist movement is it you can't separate it from the history of black liberation um you can't no you can't the vanguard has been uh primarily black and the communities that have been the most receptive to have been primarily black so it's really uh a special struggle and and i mean these are these are leaders that i that i definitely look up to yeah that plays uh that plays a lot into i like to you mentioned how he used uh fanon for developing his uh framework of analysis because fanon is one of my favorite marxist thinkers of all time as well even though many people don't classify him as that he used dialectical material throughout his approach non-stop constantly and i actually um was in a a class on i'm a history political science student right now and i had a history course on the history of the black panther party and the black power movement at the end of the semester we got to write an essay on anything we wanted as long as it had to do with the black panther party and i i did this um essay basically analyzing huey's framework of analysis through the lens of the wretched of the earth um just pointing out like how i i believe no one influenced kiwi more than fenan because you look at what huey says and fanan's uh analysis of you know classes within the colonial context and how the lump and proletariat is the truly revolutionary class huey translated that over to the united states and um talked about how that's why the vanguard party needs to be a party for black liberation as well because just because of the specific material conditions in the united states and that's why you've always seen the black panther party was the closest we've gotten to achieving socialism in the u.s you look at communist party usa most of most of their history they've been a joke huey talks about that um and to die for the people um because they actually they treated the black panther party horribly they you know treated them as fake marxists as fake communists and here we tore them apart because he's like when have y'all where's there ever been a period in history where the government has come for y'all where they've killed you in your homes where they've arrested you where they've tried shutting you down from the inside from the outside never there's been a couple of instances of people getting arrested but with the black panther party they're getting i mean you look at fred hampton killed in his home while sleeping next to his pregnant girlfriend you look at huey p newton in and out of prison for things that he didn't even do you look at i mean all of them all of them went through this and it really goes to show that that's the closest we've gotten and that's why it's so important to study their history because this is the closest that we've gotten to achieving um a you know truly successful socialist movement in the united states well yeah i would sorry there you go it's in relation to this comment so one of the things that i would push back on is is is is that um the communist party has played a really big influence especially in the 30s and the 40s before when when we go into world war ii that's when their influence begins to diminish afterwards but they did play a really good role in popularizing communism at one point they had close to a million members and the founding of the communist party was the beginning of integrating radical socialist politics into a racial agenda it was the beginning of bringing into the socialist movement um uh black folks and black liberation up to that point the socialist party and the socialist labor party that were predominant at the end of the 19th century they weren't that successful even at the beginning of the founding of the communist party um the socialist party was still segregated right you had the when they had their meetings the people that were in the first floor were the whites the people on the second floor were the blacks i think i believe it's um what's this guy's name the black they call him the the black well i can't i can't remember his name but one of the famous communist party members he mentions that the reason that he went into the communist party was because he passed through a socialist party meeting and he heard all these good ideas that he liked but then he looked upstairs and saw the black folks were upstairs and the dancers were were the white folks um and he didn't like that so from the inception of the communist party in 1919 we do have the inclusion of black liberation and even those was one black marxist leninist movement i think it's the international brotherhood i don't remember the name i have it in one of my last articles but um they were basically they fall into the communist party so um the thing is that uh there was big splits going on in geopolitics at the time uh the senior soviets split and then there was some tension there so uh that not only brings a break in the communist party but given that the panthers were more so down the line of china and mao um that could have also influenced how they saw the the communist party because the communist party was a lot closer to the communist party and in the soviet union but i mean those are those splits that we look back at now and it's like come on and if if cp usa would have been able to work more with the panthers it would have been fantastic or even the i mean the socialist party or something yeah but they just they treated them as uh outsiders they treated them as you know as if they weren't true communists which is just a ridiculous assertion to make because the amount of the amount of things that they were accomplishing um it was just insane um i mean all across the united states you see a black panther party chapters popping up and they're all accomplishing their own things in their own ways uh in each city which is just crazy because um they they were very con but then it also was a little more decentralized um which is you know a lot different than you know the typical uh marxist communist experiment and i'm the when i'm hearing about this you know my kind of just the way my brain works i'm always trying to bring things to contemporary analysis right like how can we take what we learned from the past and use it today today and if you look at our situation today you have uh three parties you have dsa psl and cpusa three tiny parties who are divided over seemingly minor issues it's like why are they not coming together as radical socialist communist parties and then you have blm which is kind of this liberal petty bourgeois movement asking the cops like please be a little bit nicer towards people of color and you know i've gone to blm rallies of course of course i support it um but they've in a way lost touch with the radical roots of fred hampton huey p newton and the you know real radical socialist people who really saw the intersectionality between um the exploitation and oppression of people of color and capitalism right we've had a system that's been built um on taking black people um uh over here on boats and making them slaves and then after they got rid of slavery you know we had to have the whole civil rights movement and struggle just for basic human rights and now we have the prison industrial complex throwing these people um throwing poor people and partic especially people of color in jail but what's the motive behind all of it is profit right and every blm rally i went to you know they weren't explaining the prison industrial complex and how they profit off of essentially slave labor paying these people less than a dollar an hour and then you have telecom giants who are making tons of money charging them 10 bucks an hour for a phone call or 10 bucks every 10 minutes for a freaking phone call ads are getting paid a dollar an hour i mean it's slavery it's just it gives us a way to justify it say these guys committed a crime they deserve it but you don't have any unity um and now i see people on twitter calling like there are people saying we need a completely abandoned critical race theory if we want to get to the masses um and i think and you have like this paleoleftism of like oh we failed to get to the masses we just needed to be more racist it's like no we need to stop dividing ourselves over like the scene of soviet split um when we're here in the u.s you know and we've we have i feel like our own tradition of socialism um to meet u.s conditions but it's kind of been buried and ignored like you said reading healey p newton was a revelation for you to read what what these civil rights leaders were saying um and that's buried in american history but i wanted to also have specifically what was it about reading huey p newton's book that caused you to change certain views that you had so when it was when i was reading revolutionary suicide one just his life story was it it was just painful to read at times um the things that he went through um seeing how he got to you know where he was uh for instance he didn't learn how to read until he was in his early 20s how did he learn how to read he pulled out a copy of plato's the republic and he sat and read it over and over again word by word looking up each word in the dictionary months on end hours a day every day until he learned how to read he read that book so many times that he knew it inside out um and like he taught himself to read and then he taught him and he you know he struggled with it a lot but you know because it's it's that's something that's really hard to do once you're already in your 20s you know um and he figured it out because he was just such an incredibly intelligent person but even though my life story and his life story are you know vastly different um the way that he thinks the way that his mind works um i connected with that a lot um i saw a lot of similarities within like the way that he saw the world and the way that i see the world um and i don't know it just made sense to me his analysis just made sense to me like nothing else i had ever read before um it just it just spoke to me on a level that no book i had ever read has done yes and i want to ask too you and i and carlos too get accused of being tankies all the time right as if we're these uncritical supporters of all existing socialism um so you talked about what huey p said after visiting um these existing socialist countries so um you want to talk about that a little bit and and how that maybe made you change some of your theoretical positions yeah yeah um so with revolutionary suicide um at the end of the book he talks about visiting the dprk and he talks about visiting china um but specifically with china he talked about when he first got there he said for the first time in his life he felt like the police were there to protect him they weren't there you know as an enemy they were truly there for the people it was you know they were there to serve the people not there to you know uh bring about fear and destruction and chaos they were there for the sole purpose of protecting and he felt safe for the first time but also he talks about this with china and with cuba because he lived in cuba for a while because he had to escape the united states because you know he was wanted um and uh especially with cuba though he talked about how he actually enjoyed labor for the first time in his life he actually enjoyed working even jobs he thought he never would have liked you know working as a mechanic never something he thought he would have wanted to do but he enjoyed it because his labor wasn't being exploited he was able to you know reap the full benefits of his labor he was able to just enjoy it and not have to worry about you know not being able to put food on the table if you don't work or if you don't work hard enough or if you can't keep a job that's not something he had to worry about but the same with china with their culture um he just felt so incredibly connected to their culture and how everyone acted as a community um and it wasn't this you know heavily individualistic society where you know people work together and people cared about the collective uh more so than the individual but um just very interesting stuff yeah i think there's recurring themes with uh with black revolutionaries when they visit um what's called the real existing socialisms uh you have a sadder security when she visits cuba she says similar things that you know it might not be fully non-racist but it's getting there it's working towards it you have um and cuba doesn't have systemic racism you know they have like problems with racism but it's not a systemic it's not at a systemic level they've eliminated that of course they're individuals who are racist but um the fact that they've done that is insane well especially when when these folks are going it's at a time when cuba has just finished developing the first post-revolution generation which means that generations from before the revolutions are still around with um with their specific biases and stuff so yeah like like you said there's no institutional racism but you might still find you know certain issues here there but um i mean you find it with paul robeson uh he goes to the ussr he says you know i feel like a man for the first time ever um so yeah it's it's it's interesting um how i've i've continuously encountered as someone in in academia um the modern radical black tradition which questions socialism as a tradition as a as an escape as a form of liberation um for the black community and it's like i mean the experience that the leaders that we all look up to proves otherwise it proves that whenever they go to these places they love it you know they feel free from the first time ever um so yeah it's it's it it's it proves that it's inherently contradictory to even think of a socialist project that includes the prejudices that you have in in in the us and in other capitalist countries right um to even achieve socialism you need a level of unity and a level of of of dealing with those contradictions of presidents that might be within the working class in order to be successful you have to deal with it so once you are successful that means you already dealt with it right it's not that only after socialism can worry about issues that raise sex and all of that but in order to even get to it in the first place you have to be engaging with those things right um there's an interesting uh there's this one theory is dominico losordo who has this uh what he calls a pluralist reading of the famous dictum from from the manifesto the history of all hetero exists in societies is the history of class struggles and that struggles that pluralistic uh way of interpreting it that includes you know not just specifically economic plant struggle but sex and race and all these other forms of struggle within it so it means that if we're striving for a classless society already within that structure is the elimination of things like racism and sexism and stuff but yeah um i think one of the uh adolf reed jr he has this one uh texas it's a collection of essays uh class notes and one of the things he starts with i think it's it's a very important point which is that there hasn't been a black radical movement in like 50 years and he's writing this in the early 2000s i believe um since the panthers right what we've had with with black movements have been they've been movements not organizations you can't yeah i think that's a big problem with the black lives matter protest when comparing uh which the black panther party and the black lives matter movement as a whole are two very different things but i think the reason why the black panther party was able to do what they were able to do is because there were there was leadership their role was to educate um that was a huge part of what they were doing they would have the uh children's breakfast programs and they would make the kids read they would make them read you know mao and che guevara you know um they would open up health clinics and whenever they would have people volunteers doctors they would make the doctors sit down and read you know these marxist theorists um they were centered around education and organizing um and of course arming um you know workers so that they can unite and actually fight back against you know not just capitalism but the imperial core itself there were people in the community because of all of that there were people the community could look up to um that's one of the things that's completely missing not just like in in the black radical tradition we have now which is it doesn't even seem like it came out of what we've had in the last 100 years but just over on the left um you have to really in order to play a vanguard role you need people to buy into what you're doing and in order for people to buy into what you're doing you have to know what you try to embody what you're trying what you're aiming for you have to be a virtuous person you have to develop yourself um and these are things that the black panther party was doing like you said they had programs where they would teach theory have political formation physical formation just yeah our modernity with their uniforms yep our modern left is um in in my opinion and um this is somewhat related somewhat devoid of of any idea of like we're gonna work hard right because they say they say hard work is a product of capitalism carlos and i always say this you see this capitalist means like you got to wake up and grind every day and invest in the stock market so you can pull yourself up by your bootstraps it's like uh socialists look at that and they say oh that's stupid it's telling you to work hard for capital it's like well the ethic is right you know the there's nothing wrong with hard work um it's the it's capitalism distorting it to tell you you have to work hard for money and if you look at our history if you look at che and if you look at the black panthers as carlos was saying they wanted to be these virtuous people who exemplified you know the kind of new man as chase said that they wanted to want it to create and and they did have like you said they had structure organization and leadership these things that kind of anarchist and decentralized seem to be against and don't even get me started on the post leftists you know all they seem to want to do is look at every little tiny aspect of capitalism and how it affects our culture and complain about it it's like okay well we can complain about it all day we can analyze all the horrible things that capitalism does but what are we gonna do about it and what the black panther said was exactly what you said we're gonna educate people and then we're gonna meet their material needs um so we're going to put it on why they're in poverty yes yeah yeah we need to do it's it's they had a a big thing that they realized um which um i'm gonna read like a little short passage for him to die for the people but uh huey was talking about how there were these underground organizations and he was talking about why they why that was problematic and so he said i responded to them by pointing out that you must establish your organization above ground so that people can relate to you in a way that will be positive and progressive for them when you go underground without doing this you bury yourself so deeply that the people can neither relate to you nor contact you the original version of the party was to develop a lifeline to the people by serving their needs and defending them against their oppressors who come to the community in many forms from armed police to capitalist exploiters we knew that this strategy would raise their conscience raise the consciousness of the people and also give us their support then if we were driven underground by the oppressors that people would support us and defend us they would know that in spite of the interpretations of our only desire was to serve that they're to serve their true interests and they would defend us because of this you have to meet people's material needs like their first thing was setting up the survival programs because how are you going to get people to fight for you and defend you if you haven't shown them that your primary interest is serving their true interests showing them that you are there to serve them you are there to support them you can't just be this underground movement that's decentralized the problem i've seen with the black lives matter movement is that because it's decentralized you have some cities where they're saying where they're abolishing their police departments literally abolishing their police departments and you see in my city you know it's more you know calling for body cameras um and so there is no uh cohesive um there yeah it's like it's it's not very cohesive at all um there is there is no there is no centralized message that they're trying to get across because it is so decentralized which is why i admire the black panther parties so much because they were able to organize and unite all these different parts of the country under one umbrella in order to fight for you know their movement i think it's important to note too obviously we don't want to be the condescending guys who tell everyone to read theory but blm isn't based on theory so i think they miss things where you know the the prison industrial complex is kind of what stems all these horrendous things you see with the justice system right where the where 24 of the world's prison population um is in the u.s because the cops sole function is to is the um keep these prisons full so they keep making money so um but it's hard to understand that if you don't have the theoretical backing and if you look at the black panther party every single thing they did had theoretical backing so they were teaching theory they understood that a revolution needs to come from the masses as as lenin said over and over again you need to reach the masses um and and like you said they were doing exactly that meeting their material needs being an above-ground organization um speaking uh talking with their communities educating their communities um in order to spread class consciousness because they had this theoretical understanding within the group of what exactly they were trying to do um and that made it a cohesive cohesive movement and that's i agree that's what we're lacking and um and i mean blm just basically what i'm saying is they're not a socialist movement and they need to be because as we we keep coming back to um socialism is is what really will liberate people of all all colors that's the thing about uh trying to juxtapose them and compare like they're completely different you know yeah um be a blm is like not it's not searching for the liberation of humanity in the same way that the black panthers were because you know as as michael prenzie would say that there is if there is any theory it is abc theorists anything but clause theories so there is no uh marx has his famous quote from capital where he's like the white skin cannot liberate itself as long as it's black uh as long as the black one is branded right there could be no ultimate freedom for white folks if black folks are enslaved but with the black radical tradition realized was that it was also the other way around that there could be no freedom for uh black folks there could be no black liberation as long as you have uh the white proletariat enslaved and then a wage slave so um it's it's about an emancipatory movement that includes all working folks that includes lumpin elements that includes poor people um and that's that's not what blm's goal was and that was what the black panthers goal was they were able to make that connection um chandra i think you made some great points in terms of organization and i think this goes back to an angel debate between luxembourg and lennon uh spontaneity versus uh organization and party and the thing is that it's it's not that um just with with with party and organization that's enough like life offers spontaneous opportunities that arise in different moments and you don't know when it's going to arise and yeah it is in those moments when [ __ ] can happen but [ __ ] can only happen if those in those moments if you're already organized if you're prepared to take advantage of those opportunities and and we we've had such a year that if we had a strong socialist party or communist party or a strong organized centrally organized movement we would have been able to take advantage of this year like no longer before and the fact that nothing has really arisen from this year just demonstrates the lack the complete lack of organization that we have yeah no it's it's a a big problem that i see is that typically it's two camps arguing with one another and those two camps are usually you know uh class reductionist communists which class reductionism is i mean it's honestly for fools it it completely leaves race out of the analysis and you cannot analyze the conditions in the united states right now without including race in your analysis because in the united states like race isn't just like racism isn't just a tool that capitalism uses it's it's something that is a core aspect of the united states of the imperial core these are two problems that are side by side that need to be you know attacked out both at the same time and that's what the black panther party did so well because they realized that capitalism was what was enabling all of these things but that these things also exist outside of capitalism and so they both need to be taken down at the same time you can't just focus on one so you see with the other camp it's you know uh people who typically when it comes to like neo the neoliberal co-optation of identity politics because identity politics is actually really radical and it's a really cool idea but it was co-opted by neoliberalism and you know when it was co-opted by neoliberalism it basically just took that analysis and like took race out uh took class out of the equation and so you have you know a camp that thinks everything is only class and you have a camp that thinks everything is only race when reality is more nuanced than that we have to approach it you know that's that's why i loved udp newton so much because he was such a dialect like he was such such a such a strict dialectical materialist every decision he made he made after contemplating on it for a long period of time after thinking about every single aspect of the situation in hand and he used dialectical materials and thoroughly throughout his approach and i think that's what enabled them to accomplish so much because they were able to realize that they're more than there's more than just one problem that we have to take on there are all of these problems and everything is interconnected and that's dialectics in general um but if you you know reduce everything to we have one problem we have to take out and that's it then you're viewing one thing in isolation you're viewing you know this one issue in a vacuum which is dogmatism you have to view everything in its uh and its connection to one another but yeah yeah carlos and i see such a failure right now among the left of um you know they like the aesthetic of marxism but they struggle so hard to actually apply dialectical materialism and i would suggest everyone check out luna oy has a video on how how to use dialectical materialism in your own thinking which is something that i feel like almost no one is doing which is how you end up with all these goof if he takes like either the the liberal people calling themselves socialists who are hyper obsessed with identity politics and then these paleo class reductionists who are saying let's ignore all racial elements that exist in the u.s a country founded on systemic racism and it's like well that's not materialist you're not then analyzing the conditions that exist in the u.s correctly um which you know which include which would be intersectionality which would be as i'm saying for the hundredth time now the intersection between race and class and understanding that to liberate one of these things we also need to include the other thing um and yeah it's there's a lot of idealism and people struggle to interpret the material conditions i think yeah this is this is also an amazing book if you want to get more into dialectical materialism it's called the principle contradiction uh and it talks about it talks about dialectical materialism a lot and how to analyze and identify the principle contradiction in the world um and it's an amazing read it's really short if any of y'all ever want to check it out but yeah for sure i'll point out we also have uh since we're recommending stuff we have quite a few videos on materialism and dialectics now done by carlos who's getting his master's in philosophy there so you can check those out as well if you don't know what we're talking about when we say dialectical materialism yeah absolutely um do we want to touch on i think uh perhaps one of the one of the most unique uh unique things that comes out of the book and that's what the book title is revolutionary suicide um and the distinction between revolutionary and reactionary suicide um do you want to explain what uh what he means by that chandler i have the the passion yeah yeah that's where he talks about it i don't know if it'd be helpful to read the the last two two paragraphs where he talks about that yeah no go ahead if you want to read it yeah all right so um he says there's another illuminating story of the wise man and the fool found in mao's little red book a foolish old man went to the north mountain and began to dig a wise old man passed by and said why do you date a foolish old man do you not know that you cannot move the mountain with a little shovel but the foolish old man answered resultantly while the mountain cannot get any higher it will get lower with each shovel when i pass on my sons and his sons and his sons will go on making the mountain lower why can't we move the mountain uh the foolish old man kept digging and the generations that followed him after and the wise old man looked on in disgust but the resoluteness and the spirit of the generations that followed the foolish old man touched god's heart and god sent two angels who put the mountains on their backs and moved the mountain this is the story mom told when he spoke of god he meant 600 million who helped move the mountain of imperialism and bourgeois thinking the two great mountains the reactionary suicide is wise and the revolutionary suicide is a fool a fool for the revolution in a fool for the revolution in the way that paul meant when he spoke of beginning fool for christ that foolishness can move the mountain of oppression it is our great leap and our commitment to the dead and to the unborn we will touch god's heart when we will touch when we will when we will touch the people's hearts and together we will move the mountain i mean it's it's it's presented beautifully in the pros of mao's poetics um but i i think that's that's a fantastic analysis because the reactionary suicide is presents it as as the wise you know it's the person that's always calculating and i think if we we compare it to this recent event that happened with the force the vote situation how many wise folks were like starting to calculate all sorts of stuff in order to prove that it was a bad move to to try to do the force the vote or whatever right the revolutionary suicide looks foolish right it looks like oh no that's not the smart thing you can't move a mountain right but you still do it you participate in it because it's something that transcends you right and what i'm scared of is that we we have a left that's so uh that has the individualism of capitals and so inscribed into their ethos right into their being that they can't think of anything that's outside themselves they really they seem to struggle in the process of thinking of some form of transcendence transcendence of of the ego um and if it's not something that that seems like it's immediately uh acquirable there is no goal in in in in in just that constant move forward right um i don't know what do you guys think um yeah no um and just to touch on the concept of revolutionary suicide more i think um it's best exemplified too by i mean the title of this book which is a you know a collection of kiwi speeches and essays and it's just to die for people you know um you look at revolutionary suicide and it is dying for the revolution dying like not letting you know your life be taken from you uh from reactionary reasons you know uh not dying reactionary death which is anything except dying for a revolutionary cause um you know uh he talked he uses examples a lot in revolutionary suicide uh using eldritch cleaver is an example of reactionary suicide um and um if if y'all don't know much about uh eldritch cleaver yeah there was a rift in the party and eldridge cleaver essentially started attacking a lot of the panthers saying that they were too focused on the survival programs they were too focused on educating people that they just need to pick up the gun and start the revolution and huey tried to explain and say no like we need to get the people on our side first we just pick up the gun and just start attacking we're going to get gunned down and we're going to die immediately that's what happened for the first you know a couple years in in the initial phases of the black panther party and so they started focusing more on the survival programs and eldridge cleaver um had reactionary reasons and later on eldritch cleaver went on to become a republican um and you know you really do see that he does uh this isn't even something that he ever got to see but elders cleaver really did completely fall into reactionary uh beliefs while huey did ultimately die a revolutionary suicide diet death of revolutionary suicide and that's what we need to do we need to realize that our sole purpose of being here our soul pro our sole purpose in life should be improving the conditions of the people around us of the people that we love and of building a better world and not sitting back and just allowing you know the exploiting class to exploit everyone to oppress everyone yes that that uh passage you read carlos it made me think of um and your analysis there chandler made me think of che um who obviously took took those same writings to heart you know and had the same idea of like dedicating yourself to move a mountain that seems immovable and that was all of che's life you know being one of the most successful revolutionaries we've had obviously different situation than the black panthers who were facing the u.s death machine and che was clear that that job is much harder and much more important our job in the imperial court to take out take down the empire but it was they did the revolution in cuba with 22 people right he went in willing to die and after that you know everyone was like well hold on jay let's let's not do any more revolution he's like no we need to continue moving the mountain of imperialism and i'm going to the congo because cuba wasn't doing what he wanted they were trying to build socialism sell their sugar and tobacco to the soviet union and establish socialism which who can blame them for that right i mean they were under u.s embargo the cia was trying to kill him every day and shay's like well we need to move this mountain of imperialism off of latin america and off of africa so he goes to the congo and it's the disaster it completely fails and he goes back to cuba and he's like all right now i'm going to bolivia which is eventually where same you know he's killed like we said he gives his life for the revolution he continues giving all his everything towards fighting um fighting imperialism and fighting private capital to the death um and he talks about his concept of a new man um of releasing individualism and giving yourself fully as you were explaining chandler to the people around you to bettering the lives of the people around you and i think you know this is a little bit of a side note but people talk about finding happiness under capitalism for me that's where i've derived a lot of my joy in life is fighting with in community with you know people like you two who two people i really enjoyed speaking with and respect to move this mountain of imperialism to create a better society for those who will live after us even if we never get to see it um yeah yeah that's interesting that amazing path that's uh interesting you bring that up um with che going on to fight in other revolutions because that actually ties into um basically he hadn't developed this theoretical framework um at the time revolutionary suicide was released this is something he worked on later but his theory of global intercommunalism and how uh he he basically just postulated that we need to work with the global south we need to work with the nations that are most exploited by the united states and if we can work with them to allow their revolutionary movements to reach a point to where they're successful we can cut the united states off from their resources and only then can the final blow be dealt to the imperial court from the inner workings of it you know from the inside uh from a party at the time like the black panther party but today that can be any movement that takes off and that's why it's so important that we be international but how huey framed it was that the the us is no longer a nation and no nate no nation exists because no one is sovereign under the u.s empire anyone steps out of line in the u.s steps in and you know does what they want to do if anyone does something the us doesn't like they have the power to stop them and how we really aren't uh a community of nations anymore we are just interconnected communities and as communities we have unite together against the imperial core and especially especially inside the imperial core um which is you know us uh american citizens and that's so yeah to think of some momentum can i say one thing quick girls because it's gonna be like one second then you can go the an analogy i was using in my imperialism guide by lenin is like a vice so you have the labor and the communist movement in america and then you have the peripheries of all these you know countries in the global south who are also looking to crush private capital and the goal is to crush it like a vice in between the the people's proletarian movements internationally and here at home um crush that imperialist private capital um so internationalism is important yeah but go ahead carlos yeah i was just going to say that that's a another thing that you know it's no longer a run in the left an end time fearless sentiment um we have and i think it was either the 2019 or 2018 um i don't even remember now but uh 2020 doesn't even feel like a year it just feels like we skipped skipped a year but um one of the socialist conferences in chicago you had uh you had people basically pushing regime change in in venezuela and in cuba and and these were people that were funded by the humanitarian organizations that that the state department funds right um and that that wasn't really that wasn't really the case in in the black panther party you know everyone was clearly anti-imperialist um we can't say that's the same for the biggest leftist organization now you know dsa usa is not a party but um they are the biggest organization we have like 90 000 people and i think probably at least half of them uh if you ask them hey what are your thoughts on cuba they're going to say an answer that's quite similar to what the state department would say um yeah and that's that's pretty sad it's very sad because it it it's it's just odd that um you know a lot of leftist movements in the u.s now are not rooted in anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism because there does exist a labor aristocracy where the workers in the global south are exploited to a much higher degree than workers within the imperial court you know there there there is a relative amount of privilege that um you know the proletarian movements in the united states have in comparison to that of the worker movements in the global south um and if we don't work with them then we're not going to be able to overthrow capitalism because they don't they've proven time again you look at these social democracies they don't need the workers from within side they're with inside their borders uh to you know keep making profit they can just export that exploitation to another country so if we don't work with countries in the global south if we don't make this a movement that's founded and anti-anti-colonialism and anti-imperialism then we're never going to be successful if we just look at it uh from an isolated isolationist point of view yeah we'll never succeed we'll constantly fail i mean imagine if a member of the chinese communist party which is 90 billion members saw the conversation we got in on twitter recently with people who call themselves communists who are who are what 90 billion yeah i always do that that's a bit much sorry it's all the same just kidding but um that was 90 million members of the chinese communist party i'm pretty sure that we would have had socialism with communism yeah yeah no but i mean imagine we're talking about building internationalism so you have 90 million members of the communist party um you know and obviously everyone has their critiques of china but you have people in the us who call themselves communists in the u.s the imperial corps who's destroying every proletarian movement around the world saying china's garbage and we need to sanction them you know as carlos said we have communists repeating the state department lines like how are you expecting to build internationalism if every time the hegemonic u.s media says oh we need to sanction china you know their leaders the new hitler believe us this time we're serious um and then we have communists eating it up you know like i'd say most communists are anti-china and it's like okay i don't care if you're anti-xi jinping i don't care if you're mad about what's going on in xinjiang but there are 90 million members of the chinese communist party who have done a hell of a lot more for for advancing proletariat you know the international proletariat then [ __ ] what america is doing right now obviously we're the most disgusting grotesque bourgeois imperialist state in the world so um there's really a lack of anti-imperialism um there's really a lack of media literacy two people just fall into these narratives when they're largely propagated um and yeah we need to root that like okay be critical of china but when you take it to the point of supporting sanctions from the u.s state department you're not even on the left anymore you know you're being a neil it's okay to support the democratic party here these are the same ones that are like yeah you gotta buy it and you know you gotta do this you gotta participate so you can participate in the party or one of the two parties that's leaving leading the pillage of the world and bombing brown people all over the world but if you are taking a critically supportive position of china oh boy that's where you messed up it's it's it's crazy because i don't think you can call yourself a communist if you support the us over any country any country regardless of whether they're socialists or not if there's a country that's working towards tearing down u.s gemini then i will critically support them to what degree i do that depends but i will support any country over the united states any day um that's not a question and if you support the united over these st that are saying we are fighting for socialism whether or not you believe them that's up to you but how are you going to go on and support the united states who just relishes in capitalism and and flaunts it and goes around and you know tears down uh different governments every time they step out of line every time they disagree with anything that the united states wants they want to nationalize industries the united states comes in and overthrows their government and puts in especially one of the worst examples and i know you have talked about this a lot with chile with pinochet they put they took it out allende and put pinochet in power one of the worst dictators of the 20th century and they act like it's about democracy and it's not you can't you can't support the united states and call yourself a communist it's a contradiction it doesn't make any sense yeah and and to specifically the person i was arguing with on twitter mj and i love mj and he's young he's just becoming a communist and it is easy to buy into these narratives that the us puts out but he's talking about xinjiang and he's saying i support sanctions um and i i pulled up an article of iran they got a lot of traction on twitter and it says iranians say sanctions hurt people not government of course they do because because you need to understand the us state department is not sitting around all day thinking how do we combat human rights abuses in xinjiang they're thinking how can we overthrow the chinese communist party and let it become a capitalist hellscape like most the rest of the world um and and like carlos and i have repeated over and over and over again we don't support the fact that xinjiang is a surveillance state we don't support the fact that there's re-education camps going on we just realized that if you dig into it one it's not genocide and calling it genocide is honestly offensive to real victims of genocide and two sanctions aren't going to magically make the surveillance stage disappear it's going to make um uyghurs poorer it's going to make the region they live in more poor because they're not going to be blocked off from the rest of the world so as a socialist why are you supporting an act that's going to make the inter pro you know the international proletariat more poor or make their job and their lives harder um and and it's just i think it's a little bit of naivety and there's um it's difficult because of how hegemonic our media is and how bad our education system is but i just want to encourage you if you're watching this just think um think about these things really hard before you share your opinion on other countries and recognize how bad our media is like for me it was doing my venezuela paper i was wow like we have no idea what's going on over there our media is straight up falsifying information just pure lies or they'll take the smallest little thing and blow it up like it's the biggest deal and ignore all the major factors that are actually influencing things in the country um so just recognize how bad our media is i guess and recognize the us state department is a tool of private capital they do nothing because they care about human rights no and it's it's honestly ridiculous to assert that the us cares anything about human rights uh in china right now because there have been us government officials who have come out openly admitting that the us has been like they've been responsible for a lot of the thing they've been funding a lot of the things that are going on in china right now to create divisions so why would they want to come in and do anything to protect people's human rights when they're the ones behind a lot of a lot of the things that are going on right now a lot of these issues that we talk about the us is puppeteering a lot of this that you know they're controlling a lot of these situations why would they of all countries care about human rights they they don't they don't at all it's it's just ridiculous to even assert something like that because they truly do not care about human rights to criticize china is one thing and it needs to be done we as communists we have to criticize socialist experiments that are existing and previously existing but if you are going to come in and then act like the united states is the good guy and they're going to come in and fix the problem i would just like you to point out a singular point in history where the u.s has intervened in the affairs of another nation and made things better because they haven't they never have we're right that's not better after our intervention there with the literal [ __ ] slave market but yeah i mean this gets back to the text um uh one of the things you just mentioned is criticism um the necessity to criticize uh social estates um because with criticism there's growth and the one of the last chapters of the text um huey when huey goes to china he's talking about how fantastic that is and they're basically begging him like please give us a criticism please and he's like i i don't know what to say and eventually ends up telling him well you know there's a pollution issue with the way you guys are are producing um and they're like oh yeah yeah we're basically dealing with it we have plans to deal with that in the future but that effort of criticism that's what that's what people don't understand you know you tune into uh and cuba's called la mesanda where they analyze the situation that's going on and they're extremely critical about themselves and they're always engaging with the criticisms that you know even gusano from miami are saying like every time you listen to a speech from uh he's always saying well now they're saying this because of our policy about the dollar this is how it's they they're always engaging with criticism and the media makes it seem like these countries are just like these totalitarian states that get any sort of criticism and if you criticize them in any way you're you know you're you're thrown in a dungeon or something or killed and it's that's not the case they're the most critical against themselves because they realize that in order to grow in order to fix your own contradictions they have to be critical yeah oh wait wait bible reason i was gonna say this book the governance of china xi jinping's book and like obviously we have our critiques of xi jinping but if you read the book you realize like 200 pages of the 500 are him critiquing china and saying this is what we need to do better it's like they're the countries themselves recognize these things but then you have western leftists like no you're all bad over there i'm going to encourage the u.s to put sanctions on you so you'll be better it's like that's so chauvinistic you know they're critical of themselves yeah and and one thing people don't usually talk about is when they say oh well in the united states you can critique the government like right now we are critiquing the government the reason is they the us does have hegemony right now complete like they don't need to worry about a couple of people speaking out against the government they aren't constantly being attacked from every single angle they are the ones doing all of the attacking but then when you look at people who leak like you look at edward snowden you look at people who leak information that's truly critiquing what the united states is doing and they do attack them for it viciously they treat them worse than the bankers on wall street who scam the entire country no yeah they don't do anything to them but then you look at people like edward snowden and look what look what's going on with him right now you know he can't even come back to his to this country he can't because he all he did was leak information that was just proving that the us was doing highly illegal things and and it's just what and what information did edward snowden leak he leaked that the nsa can go on your phone and start and do anything it wants without you even noticing that they're doing it they could be taking a video they could be harvesting all your data and what are what is everyone in the us freaking out about china you know oh china spies on their people oh they're authoritarian what the hell do you call the nsa and then when someone reveals what the nsa is doing the us persecutes them and tries to put them in jail for life or like assange he's literally losing his mind because they've done so much psychological warfare he's been holed up in solitary confinement um so it's like even the things that we criticize other countries for we're guilty of and you know of course you have the the gulag criticisms and the prison camp criticisms no socialist of course we don't support prison camps but look at the us 24.4 or whatever percent of the world's prison population is here and it's a profit-driven industry and they do slave labor where they pay their their workers less than a dollar an hour i mean we we in the gulags they literally paid them a min a living wage um which of course we don't want to bring back gulags no we don't support gulags but you have westerners looking you know looking down their nose at these other countries who have attempted to establish socialism when everything you know it's all projection of just stuff that also goes on here yeah oh the belt initiative that uh that china's doing basically around the world but specifically uh in africa um they look at that and like you just said i think you mentioned it perfectly it's a projection of what we do and the criticisms that the us gives to china and with the sort of trade that china's doing in africa is basically what the u.s through the imf and the world bank has been doing the last 70 years so it's so hypocritical but like you said chandra they have such a hegemony that they allow this sort of discourse and they even benefit from this sort of disorders and they can be like look no we let people criticize i don't care because we have no power as soon as we get the slightest bit of power eddie's gone they're so good at disappearing people they do it all the time i'll turn to a door no and i'll become an armchair marxist so yeah yeah no they don't they don't do anything about you know um just an average person critiquing the government's actions because yeah we don't have any power whatsoever but as soon as you see someone like no new has some kind of power and then uses that to critique the united states they treat them like you know the worst criminal on the face of the earth um you know the the way that you know um the the way that these people have been treated is just ridiculous and then for people especially when you're talking about the gulags and the prison industrial complex it is important to critique uh countries like the soviet union um for their use of prison camps this isn't something that we want to support this isn't something that we want to see continue but the thing is if you are critiquing countries like the soviet union yeah from a point of view of the united states if you are comparing the two and acting like the united states is good then that's ridiculous that is completely and utterly ridiculous because the united states is worse by nearly every metric and if you're going to critique if you're going to critique these gulags you know just from the point of view that yes the united states is worse but this is also bad and we need to critique this that's not a problem that's encouraged we need to do that but if you're going to contrast that with the united states and our prison industrial complex it's way worse it's way worse here every time there's ever a critique of a socialist experiment i can name a time the united states has done that same thing but to a much much worse degree than any of these socialist experiments have it's ridiculous it's true it's like hakeem says it's all projection you know what people claim is wrong with socialist countries this is what is going on also in capitalist countries even you know when they critique the soviet bureaucracy another thing me and carlos and che guevara were highly critical of you know capitalism has huge bureaucracy especially with things like health insurance where it's a freaking hassle and a half to make sure that that you have health insurance you got to fill out pounds of paperwork and there's all these bureaucrats who are are designed to make the system run um it's all just projection where are you gonna say something the breadlines too they bring up the bread lines all the times they look at the bread lines in the soviet union that's literally happening today that's happening today here and they're not even working people are starving yeah and that's that's uh that's one of the things that i think that uh perensi brings up in in black shirts and reds the people that would be critical of like the bureaucracy in the soviet union when they came to the us they're like holy [ __ ] it's worse so it's it's like you're saying chandra it's um when you're looking at this say the soviet union just because it's you know perhaps the biggest experiment um or the biggest fall experiment um when when you're looking at it from the perspective of the u.s there's two things first of all everything that we point there we are doing as well but worse which is the element of projection but second of all why are we looking at another country in another side of the world with our values that's not materialist you have to look at the soviet union and interpret it with their battles with how it was before became the soviet union and if you think about how repression functioning in zarya's russia and our repression function in the soviet union it was a lot less and when you think about there's the sphere of freedom in zarya's russia than the sphere of freedom in the soviet union it was a lot more oh yeah no it's it's it's crazy because you look at the soviet union and within less than a century they went from being a feudal society to being the first nation to send someone to space to developing the first satellite they developed the first mobile telephone they developed all these things but then they also use the argument that socialism is no is and no innovation there's no innovation under socialism but then there's all of these examples of innovation some of the highest points of innovation that we have reached in the history of humanity developed by socialist experiments but no no socialism is no innovation eighty percent eighty percent of books i think during the the the after world war ii to the seventies where were published in in uh the soviet union eighty percent of books in the world yeah it's there's a lack of an ability to compare these countries and part of it too is like how we're trained to think in the u.s that's the other thing if we're really highly critical of western leftists but you're brought up to think a certain way since birth and it's let's compare cuba this tiny island that's been under an embargo for 60 years to the united states and be like oh they don't have as many consumer goods and the paint's peeling off the walls so um therefore socialism doesn't work it's like well what did they have before they had a military dictatorship and western plantations owned everything and they had slave peasants and i love the book che that i just finished but john lee anderson the author is a westerner you're not a marxist great biographer but he says in havana after the revolution there's less freedom because the brothels are gone the prostitutes are gone and the nightclubs are gone and it's replaced with the cuban army training for when the cia comes to invade and you go he said makes a comment like now there was less freedom post revolutions like well freedom for who there's less freedom for you the western tourists but i'm pretty sure the peasants who before the revolution were [ __ ] slaves have more freedom now that they're not slaves um so there's an inability to compare these countries to what they had before same with hugo chavez in venezuela you know teaching everyone to read building all these free health clinics you know compared to what they had before it's miles ahead you know the the idea that socialism hasn't worked is laughable central planning and nationalization of industry has has taught millions to read and you know built hundreds of thousands of hospitals trained hundreds of thousands of doctors specifically with cuba um it's it's just crazy because people act like oh they were super repressive and they just murdered everyone who was a part of the bourgeoisie the reason that we have these opinions uh that we you know have about cuba and the united states is because the initial wave of people who fled cuba were members of the bourgeoisie were high ranking military officials and castro literally said i don't want to kill all of you this is over i will literally fly you to the united states personally where they're offering you citizenship and then you can go live there if you don't like socialism go do that and they did and so everyone who left in the in the beginning and the initial phases of the you know uh establishment of the socialist society in cuba the people who were leaving were the people who benefited the most from the batista regime so of course a lot of the not only that that first positive opinions of batista and negative opinions of socialism that first wave yeah uh yeah go go oh sorry i'll be uh mine's quick i just want to add on che invited because it makes chandler's point che invited the wealthiest plantation owner in all of cuba before they went ahead with the land reforms and took his land he said chase said um we're not gonna let you keep your land we're not gonna let you keep your money but we'll give you a workman's wage and you can stay here in cuba and you can you can be one of the socialist workers you know even the wealthiest plantation owner they didn't just kill him they said hey join socialism become a good guy and the guy said no and he went to miami yeah well that generation that went to miami um this is something that very few people know but um they stole the gold reserves that cuba had so the whole basis of the monetary system of the country which was gold they stole it um so they did pretty won the land of opportunities right um if you come with a shitload of gold you're probably gonna do pretty good i know i think there's the people that that were killed because there were people that were killed but um people don't know that there was literal terrorism going on um the first one of the first things revolution would do was send squadrons of people my grandpa was amongst one of them but squadrons of people to the campesinos to to the country to create hospitals small little clinics and and little schools and what the opposition would do which was funded by the u.s and then specifically the cia they would basically intercept these groups of 17 18 19 year olds and massacre them there was this one literal walkway that last time i went to cuba i had to pass by that was it's it's a tree walkway and they told you don't look up because if you get cursed right why because they used to literally hang people there that would go with the squadrons to go help people because the terrorists were going and these were the people that were killed and what country wouldn't kill people who do that or at least throw them in prison for at least 20 years you know there was also a revolution it's a war like what do you expect to happen it's not this peaceful thing people like they killed people well yeah people will say like oh che kill people i think there's like one or two accounts of che like personally executing someone people be like he's a horrible person it's like okay well what about george washington do you view him as a horrible person because if you look at the seven years war he executed personally like around i think there's around a dozen french like french ambassadors he personally executed them so are you gonna go on to say that he's evil no they're gonna defend him even though george washington literally owns slaves was this a brutal slave owner who was this horrible person they'll defend him but then they'll act like che was evil for killing slave owners people are have an inability to put the shoe on the other foot with like you said one they were overthrowing slave owners and then carlos said too there were terrorists running around in the escombrae heavily fund in the sierra maestra heavily funded by the cia massacring people so the military the cuban military and volunteer soldiers went out there and fought them to make sure that cuba could build hospitals in the rural areas where there were no hospitals before um and like imagine that happens in the u.s a mat you know i always use this with iran like imagine if iran did the stuff that we do to them but imagine if there's terrorists guerrilla groups sponsored by a different country running around in our country massacring people trying to build hospitals you think people in the us would be like ah we should let them go for human rights like get the hell out of here but nobody has the ability to do that and chomsky has something on that where it's like it's literally impossible for really chauvinist americans to even think like the stuff we do to other countries they can't even imagine it on the other foot and there's a good medi-hasan interview where he's asking a guy over and over again i think they're talking about iran or iraq or something i don't know but he's like imagine if iran massacred our general murdered our general how would we react like we did the soledamani and the guy's like oh that would never happen the u.s is too powerful and man he's like yeah but what if it did the guy's like it wouldn't the u.s is too powerful he physically can't in his own head put the shoe on the other foot and imagine what the us does all the time another country would dare to do to us you know because he's got it in his head that we are the world police we are just better and it's a racist attitude and it's uh a bourgeois attitude um one of the things that wab du bois does and i think fannin does it pretty nicely too is look at the first world war and at the time that it happened i mean the west was so shocked they were like how is this happening you know and the way they they saw it was that well this is just the west doing to each other what they've done to the third world this whole time right so it really it sort of materially forced them to put the shoe on the other foot and they're like oh my god like you know how could this be um the same way you can interpret the same uh world war ii in in a similar way but yeah it's just that inability to even conceive of like if there's a epistemic impossibility to even think of what would happen if it was the other way around um and and again this is not just the state department media this is a lot most of the left um the way most of the things so um not to bring up [ __ ] jordan peterson i hate him and i don't think i've ever watched one of his videos um but i've i've heard him in in the speech where she had mentioned you know cleaning up your own house and in our case we really do have to clean the barn house we do have to have a complete character shift of the spirit of what is the left in the u.s before we can even have the conditions for the possibility of anything and that sounds very conscient of me but we do have to completely change the way we are in order to even think about having something you know uh lenin famously and then in uh uh left-wing communism and fans how disorder has this famous phrase of going where the mass is right going where the masses are i mean if we go in the shape we're in where the masses are we're doing [ __ ] either way you know you think any of the working-class people in this country are gonna follow what the average person in the left uh is you know uh we do have to change ourselves be the sorts of people that other people can follow and that other people can look up to right so in that sense we do have to clean our house first in order for us to go outside and then change the world yeah we have to be people that the masses can connect with um and huey talks about that a lot too we can't be these like underground like vague abstract figures who you know champion these ideas that are also abstract no we need to show them hey we are we directly want to help you we we want to improve your conditions we want to make sure that you are fed that you have a place to sleep that you have education that your children have education that you don't have to worry about survival because you can do that that's when you show that one we care about you and that's how you earn people's trust and respect and two that is how you get to the point where they'll listen to you about education and educating people is so important because if we don't educate people then they're never going to support these ideas it needs to the revolutionary movement needs to be based in educating the masses because if the people aren't educated then they're not going to know what they're fighting for and it'll be easy for people to slip back into reactionary ways of thinking about the world and the like it can be as simple as being nice like i see so many people on tick tock who are stunned by me and chandler so like wow you guys are just so nice i'm like wow that's really surprising to you that we don't treat people like [ __ ] it's like that's what the baseline what you should be doing is a revolutionary right and you have this big as you said these people these abstract underground thinkers these people who are egoists you know who who are obsessed with their own their the machinations of their own mind rather than just being kind to people in order to build up the kind of connection and class consciousness we need um to eventually have a revolution and yeah i mean that that seems like the simplest advice it's what you learn in grade school but yeah and there's people who say you know social norms are a product of capitalism and like maybe but but humans just want to be connected right that's that's true of any mode of production right we have this ability to be collective um and be and humans need social interaction to survive um so i think that's one of the main things i see with the left and i mean we saw an example of that when when you were getting attacked for having uh freaking posters in your room is people just being ruthless and mean and that was the whole point of my response was like why like what are you talk like what like why are you so mean basically um so it seems like when it comes to people who see it as like we don't need to that's what that's my big problem with um post-leftist and egoist in particular is that they see it as we will never escape capital um so i'm just gonna you know scrutinize anyone who you know oh they aestheticize something they commodified something it's like the world we live in it's impossible not to commodify things not to aestheticize things like what do you want people to go like retreat into their own little mental world where they exist outside of capitalism because that's not possible like what's important people will be like oh we'll never escape capital so what what if we let's say we never escape it if you've looked at these socialist experiments that have existed in the past it one thing that is for certain is that they improved people's material conditions they made their lives better and if that's something we can do then that's all that matters we're just trying to build a better world for people it doesn't need to be so deeply philosophical it's about it's really that simple it's about being kind to people connecting as communities and working towards the betterment of those communities by overthrowing oppressive um you know oppressive groups and exploitative groups like the bourgeoisie and just the connection to theory that we're talking about being nice um there's an article that eleanor marx does once once marx dies and um there's a few good ones i recommend reading hers fargs and kovalevsky's um their notes on marx after he dies but um in the one that eleanor does she says that well if you think that marx's theories have been manipulated right um and and if you think that his his goals have been uh manipulated right so in the sense of you know communism is a big state or whatever you know right um what has been manipulated the most is who marx the man was and we have this conception even among the left that marx was like this [ __ ] um this arrogant person and the way she describes marx is is as one of the nicest people ever as as someone who um it doesn't matter how ignorant you were if you went to go ask him a question he would spend three hours talking to you um and and he was someone who genuinely respected people who had a great sense of humor um and who was the embodiment of the humanist ethic that is at the core of marxism and we have to be able to to to bring that back or at least build ourselves towards that right um we'll fail right but we have to build ourselves towards that yeah and he was disgusted with the post hegelians who were kind of the example of these abstract philosophers he's like you're not doing anything to actually liberate the masses you sit in your ivory tower and write new theories but um his focus was the liberation of humanity and the betterment of like you said chandler the material conditions of humanity in any in any way he could so i think that's a great place to end it actually i got to work at 5 00 a.m tomorrow so i should probably go to sleep but did you have anything else you want to say chandler um no yeah that's about it i'm great conversation i'm glad y'all had me on um if y'all ever want to have me on again just hit me up i would love to talk with y'all more absolutely i think we have a lot more we can talk about and discuss and i think you really fit well we have you know with our thought and we have great conversation there so yeah yeah absolutely anything else carlos um i'm glad you weren't butt hurt about the poster things because you got some great [ __ ] posters back there thank you some of them that are overlapping with the ones i have in my room too so it's pretty sweet well thank you yeah i know i i i love i love having these posters on my wall because um i don't know uh this is like a big part of my life this is what i do and yeah it's it's especially when it comes to like the figures i have up on my wall like fenan i
