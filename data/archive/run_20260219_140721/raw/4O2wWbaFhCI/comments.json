As someone who read the book it perfectly encapsulates what rhaenyra went through while she was in the red keep with alicent looming over her. I think why older rhaenyra fell flat for people is because of the time skips, i wish we had gotten a full season of their younger versions, showing how vindictive alicent got towards rhaenyra, showing how she went from victim to abuser and how rhaenyra had to make the decision to have heirs with someone other than her husband and how that ultimately gives the greens ammunition in the long run.",

His desire for a son pushed past all her very valid fears until it killed her, and his determination to make it right contributed to his desire to keep Rhaenyra as heir. Even when he was fading, it was Aemma's name on his lips. The actor, Paddy Considine, also said that he played his part as if the king had died the day Aemma and his firstborn son did.",

        "text": "Also note that Viserys and Daemon's parents were full brother and sister, while Rhaenys is a little less inbred as her mom was only her dad's half-aunt. \n\nJaehaerys's mother Alyssa Velaryon (the sister of Coryls Velaryon's grandfather) married Robar Baratheon after her first husband King Aenys died. The Lord Baratheon we meet in the first episode (hailing his niece as the Queen Who Never Was) was their first child, a younger half-brother of the Old King. (The Lord Baratheon at the end of the season is his idiot son.) Alyssa died from blood loss during a c-section to give birth to his sister Jocelyn Baratheon, who would go on to marry Jaehaery's oldest son Aemon and give birth to Rhaenys. In the book, Rhaenys inherited black hair from the Baratheon side of the family, although she was going grey by the events of this series. (Also note that House Baratheon was founded by Aegon the Conqueror's bastard half brother.)\n\n\nJaehaerys actually had one more living son, but Prince Vaegon Targaryen had no interest in ruling or in producing heirs. He was an archmaester of mathematics in the Citadel in Old Town, a position which required he take a vow of celibacy and give up any inheritance. It is also noted that he was always an asexual/aromantic. His parents tried to make him marry his sister Daella, but he wanted nothing to do with her. She was noted as being very sweet but rather stupid. She ended up marrying Lord Arryn, at too young an age, and died giving birth to their only child, Aemma, Rhaneyra's mom. \n\nAegon the Conqueror also had a Velaryon mother. Daemon got 3/4 of his genes from Velaryon ancestors. It really doesn't make sense for the Targaryens and Velaryons to be different races, unless we assume that Coryls's mother and/or grandmother were black. \n\n(My headcanon is that his mother was a Princess of Koj, in the Summer Isles, who are renowned for having the best shipwrights and navigators in the world. I like to imagine that his grandmother came from the ruling class of Braavos, which is a Maroon colony founded by slaves who escaped Valyria and went on to become the greatest mercantile power in the world, with an army and navy strong enough to force several other major city-states to abolish slavery. The Braavosi we saw in GoT were all white, but in the books it is a very diverse city whose rulers proudly boast of their descent from the original runaway slaves. If we ever see a Sea Lord of Braavos on screen, I really hope he is played by a Haitian.)",

Or, the son of a second son? \n\nThis makes Viserys and Daemon's dynamic even more interesting because Viserys was essentially the second son's wet dream.",

I can already say that I would have been so upset at that last scene where Rayina sends her poor son on that dragon— I was glad that my attachment to that character was only superficial. I’m sure if I had been watching the whole thing, I would have been all crying. Loved Olay’s reaction clip tho. This way I can watch the series (w Olay’s fun synopsis) without tormenting my empathy or attachment to the plot/characters. Olay can have all my views HBO would have had, had they not ffd up that GOT finale (lol I’m still mad).",

Despite how she thought it would be as a child, she ended up trying to make herself the queen she thought she should be, which ended up meaning \"more like Viserys.\" Almost managing to actually reconcile with Alicent at the feast also lulled her into a false sense of security.\n\nI think Lucerys getting killed finally snaps her out of it, and the Rhaenyra we'll see in Season 2 will be very different. She's done trying to emulate her father. \n\nNote that Alicent also changes over the course of the season, but in the opposite direction. She starts out anxious, people-pleasing, and kind, but jealousy and the pressure of her position turn her into a conniving, venomous snake... just like her dad.",

    "text": "Thank you for calling out the psycho-ness of Daemon.  I think many of us love Danaerys so much because she was a Targaryen by herself, no family members to marry and get busy with, until Jon Snow, her half nephew was discovered.  And we know throughout history royalty used incest to keep bloodlines pure, but later discovered it caused deformity and madness.  The fact that so many of us are cheering for this Targaryen family is kind of weird, but its entertaining like a soap opera.  I am glad we get to see this Targaryen soap opera finally called the Dance of Dragons like a train wreck you can't look away from.   I actually would love to see a sequel series of Game of Thrones with Danaerys brought back to life as a villain by the Red Priestesses.  Hoping Drogon took her to a place where that could happen, and she comes back after the Stark family/ Jon Snow, the only seemingly respectable family in GoT universe.  And I have felt bad for Alicent also. She was pimped out by her Dad, and I can't wait until Otto gets what's coming to him.  I also feel for Alicent having to bang a corpse at the end of their marriage.  Daemon and Aemond the 2nd Sons, even though everyone fears their craziness as Kings, but they still are able to imprint their craziness into their brothers' reigns through the violent acts they do.  So many levels of gray in all of these character, except maybe Helaena.",
