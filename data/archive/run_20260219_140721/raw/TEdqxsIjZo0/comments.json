    "text": "To co-sign what Olay said about Bahamians having a culture vulture conversation about Drake, many Jamaicans have the same conversations about him. There are quite a few artists who love to come to our island and love to use our patois and accent in their music… but they typically give something in return. They big up the island, they feature our artists, they boost tourism and put money into the country. They also come back multiple times and just enjoy the culture regardless of if they keep using our style in their new projects. Drake is not one of those artists. As much as I don’t necessarily like DJ Khalid… that mf has repeatedly praised our island and shows the beauty of it in every post and every interview when he’s here. He spends time and money on the island and promotes our artists. Drake is just a vulture who does nothing but a cheap Jafakean accent. Appropriation vs appreciation.",

Without typing out an essay about it, I'll just say this: Drake, me, all of us multicultural people who grew up in unique circumstances (isolated in majority-white, deeply segregated, racist colonial Canada), had access to choices that other Black people do not. Simple as that. \n\nOne obvious example that's not too deep: I have dual citizenship & was able to choose which country to live in as an adult. \nOne less obvious example that is super deep: I chose to seek out Black culture and, in that process, found that I empathise & ally myself with al  oppressed people & our cultures rather than with the dominant White culture (such as it is). To wit: set aside the questions about how Black Drake is - has Drake expressed support, or any opinion at all, for First Nations & Metis people in Canada?",

        "text": "Kendrick's general issue that he had with Drake was basically during the height of Drake's career,he never used his voice in or out of the Booth to recognize the struggles his black fan base has had in this country, never any social issues, racial injustices or police brutality etc.. Not saying that he had to become a revolutionary rapper full time like Dead Prez etc.. He was the most popular Hip Hop star  during the Travon Martin, George Floyd, and Brianna Taylor tragedies and he either swallowed his tongue or didn't give two fucks about those issues, rather opting to use his Fame and fortune to become one the biggest Playboy's the world has ever seen!!! Slaying 50 plus Instagram models a year was more of his priority,Smh.. He actually turned into the World's richest Pikkaninny,(the depiction white people painted of little black kids eating watermelon 🍉) Racist Art at it's core), Drake with the colorful girls berrets and painted nails 💯 That infamous crown was once held by Kodak black, with his Lisa Simpson style hairdo he had..",

They can only relate to hip hop in as much as they're skin colors are similar. \n\nIm only asking this to make the point that for every person claiming to be part of rap culture there's someone saying they're not black enough to be welcome. \n\nIs drake corny? Hell yes. Is he outta pocket for frontin like he gang? Yes. \n\nBut if drake is a CV its a whole LOT of CVs... and i wont even get into how toxic rap culture is",

I would say both of them “broke waves” for their contemporaries and made room for young dro, shawty lo, rocko after T.I. blew up and the migos, future (preceded young thug kind of, but his kind of modern trap blew up post barter 6, even though it was an unrelated project bc similar veins) had room to blow up after young thug. Now, regardless of era, if you understand hip hop, you know the ATL sound when you hear it. Drake could have done that FOR TORONTO, for his specific style and accent, for his social conditioning. Instead, Drake runs to any region where there are black people and steals the culture for a single or two, rinse and repeat. He’s been atl, he’s been west coast, he’s been carrib, he’s gone afrobeats, he’s tried to be afrolatino, and he’s flown across the Atlantic to do the UK hip hop style. He will do anything besides use his own personality. Why? I don’t know. It rubs me the wrong way.",

Honestly you thought about this way deeper than me and there’s a lot of good content in your reply. \n\nI think Drake does this out of a combination of two factors: \n\n1. Simple trend chasing business movies. \n\n2. Insecurity. Despite what some racist mfers will say about biracial folk, Drake is ten times blacker than someone like Vanilla Ice, but has that same kind of culture envy of wanting to be seen as hard and gangsta and be accepted by the culture that exists instead of creating a new facet of the hip hop culture that could lift up people like him who’ve had experiences like his.",

Non black people in hip hop have a history of using the black people around to boost their reputation, when they don’t have one. Post Malone, 6ix9ine, MGK, etc have all done this. Which is exactly why the hip hop community is very weary of non black people wanting to get involved in the music, because we don’t really know if they respect the culture ir just trying to take advantage of it. This is why Eminem is so beloved in the hip hop community because he loves hip hop and is knowledgeable about the culture and history",

    "text": "As an African who is considered black racially, drake has BEEEEEN a problem this side the moment he started using Afrobeats and African artists in his music without actually the cultures they came from or the peers and African artists who’ve been doing this for so long. With the example of one dance. That song is like diluted juice that you drink because you’re thirsty not because it’s actually good. Drake is very smart predicting trends and he will never have that credibility taken away when all we hear on the radio is him. However one dance could have been an artful masterpiece considering who he collaborated with Wizkid has been an incredibly unique voice in the Afrobeats with such a distinct sound and very cool incorporations of his Yoruba culture and his youthful style and Lagos city life. Like if we put drakes one dance and compare it to wizkid’s solo’s you would see the missed artistry that could have been so unique and even revolutionary in terms of dictating the afrobeats wave that followed. I’m a young adult of the 2000’s and I say this knowing they are many drake songs in my older playlists that I played so much. I mean some of my favourite songs of all time have drake in it: jungle, Hold on,blem….. \nThese didn’t just peak my interest because it was drake but because they felt like they were made in a way that wasn’t stereotypical to the times of music where tyga and ty dolla sign were making music that felt so disconnected to my young self. But now I’m almost 25 and drake is still doing the same thing….. and to me that does not prove that someone should be a goat or king of rap",

The history of Black people being alienated from their own cultural production, is a long one that we have seen repeated with rock ‘n’ roll, jazz, and blues. Drake’s hip hop career overall has demonstrated this type of alienation. However, in fairness, it has not only been Drake who is done so as I can look to many others. I think what’s different is that unfortunately, Drake has become the poster child for this process because of the fact that he’s the most successful monetarily.  With regard to what’s happening right now, I’m on team Kendrick.",

        "text": "Yes, and it's 100% a capitalist *entertainment* thing, well beyond music. A lot of storytelling focuses around adolescence and it's not just for hooking young consumers; by idealizing teenage years, older fans remain attached like they're reliving their glory years.\nWhat truly sets the nail in Drake's coffin for the manosphere boy motif is how he keeps flying that flag despite showing capability in adapting/reinventing himself. It's like if Will Smith spent his whole acting career playing roles like Independence Day or Men In Black: sooner or later, you're too old to play the rookie.",

That and \"but that Takeover beat!\" and \"Jay-Z has $100 million! He's bigger than rap!\" just solidified Nas's criticism and victory. For me, at least.",

She always includes notable figures in these projects to bring light to their contributions.\n\nPast that, she grew up in Texas, so has a foundational link to country. Her uncle Jonny, a gay man, helped raise her and expose her to house music. As a black American she has a birthright to R&B. When she did “The Gift” it was because she was on the cast of a film set in Africa and she was tasked with doing an OST representing the film (which again, she sourced artists of the culture to take part in).\n\nI don’t feel like the comparison is the same because it feels like there is always a connection or legitimate reason other than “I just like the way this sounds and I feel like I can make some money off of popularising this sound.” \n\nBut I’m not the most familiar with Drake’s discography or history within different genres so I’m happy to be proven wrong.",

Followed by breakdancing and graffiti art work, it’s basically the cultural expression of street arts which became voice of a generation of the urban black American experience. From Rapper’s Delight and The Message you get that Hip Hop culture is both fun partying and real messaging about a social experience which evolved into that 90s aesthetics of pushing the boundaries into gangsta rap following the success and popularity of gangster films in Hollywood",

The looks from the late 70s, 80s, 90s are shaped by the lived experience of those apart of the culture. Some were partying in all eras, some were in them streets and some were doing both. In 86 the first gangsta rap song was PSK by Schoolly D who is from Philly around the same time that DJ Jazzy Jeff and The Fresh Prince came out with Girls of the world ain’t nothing but trouble. The artistry with MCing or Microphone Command was being able to grab the attention of the audience and get them to follow your commands and then rapping was the artistry of being a wordsmith and keeping the crowds attention and being able to battle and defend yourself against any challengers. Hip hop lost its artistry when the business end allowed ghostwriters to pump fake for the artists……Kendrick putting these diss tracks out as fast as he is and being consistently clear on theme of what his diss is about is highlighting the art of rapping. I imagine Drake in a room full of ghostwriters trying to get his comeback right which may account for his sh*t sounding like it’s all over the place.",

I think this exchange in the genre's current iteration has attracted a lot of people into discourse about what is 'real' and comparing it to past eras moreso than usual. All I'm saying is in this competition of people in MC roles, this is core hip-hop and I'm glad to see that aspect alive in 2024. I think it's larger role in this day socially, culturally is really fascinating. I can see the influence of hip-hop's competitive and truth telling history in it.
