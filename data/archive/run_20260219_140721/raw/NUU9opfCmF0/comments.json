We're an abstraction, an idea...something to work through in some over-processed, indulgent thought experiment. Just say you THINK you're one, and voila, you are. And you can change your mind at any time. Meanwhile the furniture that an entire society has rearranged to suit the latest whims of these people remains in situ with the rest of us remaining in the armchair that catches the afternoon glare and risks blinding us entirely. Are we expected to trot along behind these poorly integrated personalities, these fashion-focused emotionally incontinent nitwits, and cater to their ever changing temperaments and whims?! The hubris and self-obsessio! To call people either 'neurotypical' or 'neurodivergent' is a disgusting, arrogant, self-satisfied binary (how ironic, from the same group who hate 'binaries' and think everything is on a spectrum and always subjective). It's hideously decadent and solipsistic. Easy to ring fence yourself from criticism if you play the Identity Politics board game and can keep up with the changing rules.\n\nThe damage done by these spoilt, indulged humans toiling away in the fetid citadels of academia (and worse, absorbed by academic-activism) is far reaching, permanent and profound. A woman is not a 'concept'. I agree with your comment. How dare they. And worse, why have they been allowed to colonise every cultural, media and academic institution in the West and turn them into hives for the ideologically possessed? That this horse manure has been philosophically validated, socially enabled and allowed to gain very real political traction is the saddest indictment of the 'Silent Majority' I can think of. Not enough people stepped in to push back. We can't stop this mutation in our culture and society, but we can certainly hope that when the toxic dust settles, things don't seem so out of control and utterly insane. I hope some good clear thinking in our cultural architects starts as a murmur and then builds to something more quotidian where the 'every day citizen' doesn't have to worry about The Borg mind virus and feel empowered to speak more freely and honestly in general; a point where absurdities and radical propositions get the kibosh put on them and every day acceptance of the sensible ideas remain and the rest are stealthily put to pasture. Back into the verdant fields of academia, as thought experiments-- and not ones that we're all forced to LIVE through in our daily lives. I'd like the scaffolding to start falling apart with this crap.",

It's what Jordan Peterson pointed out so early on in all this 'culture war' cobblers-- trying to point out where politeness and amenable, emotionally considerate social accommodation actually leads a society (and individuals). I think it's why they showed him their collective 'war face' and tried to bring the hammer of Thor down on his noggin. Thankfully he wears a bingle bucket at all times and had the strength of character to push through this appalling ideological, professional and political skirmish.",

        "text": "@tomaszwota1465 I kind of see his point, though. One of the key tactics of the wokeist religion is to redefine a word out of existence so they can use it as a weapon but nobody else can call them out for it. A few examples:\n\nRacist/Racism\nSex\nGender\nPaedophilia\nTrans\nTransphobe\nWoman\nMisogyny\nInsurrection\nRiot\nPeaceful Protest\nPregnancy\nBreastfeeding\nEquality\n\nThese are just off the top of my head and all from the last couple years. They're also now trying to redefine the term grooming because too many of them have been called out for grooming children. So once a word has been twisted and abused so it no longer holds any weight or meaning, can it really be considered still a word? That's the point I think he was making.\n\n\nOn a side note, I think a particular quote perfectly sums up wokeism and its pursuit of \"rights\" for groups/demographics that once had equal rights in the name of \"necessity\": \"Necessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom. It is the argument of tyrants; it is the creed of slaves.\" - William Pitt, 1783, in a speech made in the British House of Commons",

Yes, it's still a word. An abused, mistreated, manipulated, loaded, but still very much a word. Heck, how do you even make a word not be a word? Erase it from everywhere it was used and make everyone forget it? I don't know.'\n\nIt definitely doesn't stop being a word when you don't like it or when it's used against you.\n\nYou can say I'm hung up on a technicality, but, man, I'm not in his head.

Just stay off my toes and I'll stay off yours. I have no idea about hanging out with trans people anymore than they think about hanging out with me. But I treat everyone with the respect due me until I see I need to respond otherwise. Would I sit next to a trans anything in a movie theater or restaurant? Well sure. Will I talk with them? Sure. Will I go home with them. Doubtful. That has NOTHING to do with a phobia. It has to do with the hundreds of people I meet, talk to, sit next to and don't go home with.  All the time.

If someone is afraid of something it automatically leaps to a psychopathic level by being called hate. there are so many groups that even have stated aims of defeating us and conquering its.. if we say \"that makes me wary, we should do something about this so we can be assured nothing bad will happen in the future.\" Somehow we all accept that means the same thing as hatred. All these terms. We even call leftists liberals. So many people do. they hate free speech and want to force vacciv=nations. they aren't liberals. We lose right away because liberal kind of means 'freedom lover.' We call the left freedom lovers. \"those liberals\"...  with their liberal ways of freedom? Like antidfa's name. The name wins the arguments to most people. \"what do you mean? Liberals stand for freedom by definition. that means censorship is liberal? Forced vaccinations are? Antifa fights fascism? \nthe right doesn't have the left's language intelligence so they lose the argument before it happens.

        "text": "@dixiehurley3599 sounds like your ability to trust was destroyed early in life.  Yet your need to be loved forced you to seek relationships regardless of the damage already done.  It is unfortunate and also not uncommon.  Both men and women need love, but men need respect more than they need love.  The damage of your youth and the lack of a hero in your young life suggests that it may be impossible for your heart to ever truly respect and trust in a male or maybe in any human.  That will slowly destroy any man.  The unavailable trust and withheld respect is unconsciously felt as being punished for someone else's crime.  Being held in contempt for the actions of another.  The frustrated love turns to anger and the anger becomes bitter in the heart of a man.  It is a slow poison that your story has described, but one that is not new.  I am saddened by your history.  The impossible road is before you.  Forgive the man that stole your youth, forgive your parents for their lack of protection.  Forgiveness frees you.  Keeping the record of debt owed to you by offences, keeps the offense alive and the wounds will never heal.  Yes you have been wronged, yes you have been hurt, that is not a good reason to continue to hurt yourself.  It was bad when the world was disrespectful and unsafe to you, how horrible when you participate in your own victimization.  Ouch!",

        "text": "Hate to be the one to say it, but it's primarily women that created and continue to enforce this disrespect and lack of safety. Just look at who supports this madness, it is and has always been almost exclusively women. Ultimately, most men have fought against these attacks on women and femininity, while most women have deliberately dismantled mens ability to protect them, and made men not see women as being worth protecting, by pushing for laws that disarm good men, take mens children from them, financially ruin them, and more.\nI'm sure this will get some sort of \"you're a misogynist!\" response from someone, because some people would rather throw an insult than reflect, but it's factual. Women have stripped men of their ability to be protectors, and in recent years, begun stripping them of their desire to be protectors. My point is, ultimately, women have created a situation where the ones that would protect them are rendered powerless. This insanity continues because it's overwhelmingly women that support it, and women hold most of the power now. The only real way to make the world a place where femininity is respected and secured is for women to collectively say \"we don't want this, this is insane, get it out of here,\" and either learn to make your own safety instead of saying you feel unsafe while expecting others to handle it, or collectively give people back the desire to keep you safe, and the protections that allowed them to do it.\nHold each other accountable. Hold yourselves accountable (whether it be for actively supporting it, or passively allowing it). Push back. Some women are pushing back now, but it's several years late, and still few and far between. Get involved in person. When there's any public event of this stuff, show up and heckle. When they try to \"educate\" (because YT doesn't like the word that rhymes with blooming) your children, take your kids out of that school and yell at the school board.\nIt's a problem that primarily women have created, and at this point, women have also made it so they're the only ones that can solve it. Whether anyone likes it or not, look at the numbers when it comes to these issues to see where the support comes from. Look at the courts to see who actually holds any sway. Look at the laws to see who and doesn't have any power. If these issues we're facing make women feel disrespected and unsafe, push back, and HARD. That includes against other women, so long as said other women support this ideology.",

To have that taken away by a MAN,  not right. Womens' sport ~ is Dead. (Imagine being a woman athlete, who rose above suffering an abusive stepfather, spouse etc. It's just cruel. )",

Everyone else, or most other people, hasn't got the balls to say something about it. It's because any high profile person or anyone with any influence DOES speak out, they're cancelled, career over. Look what happened to JK Rowling! Your example. She wasn't invited to the Harry Potter reunion, she was publicly slated by people who are multi millionaire A list actors now BECAUSE of her books. None of them had the gumption to stand up for her. It's MADDENING, but what can we normal, working class, women do? We're outnumbered by cowards. Strength in numbers and all that. Plus people can't afford to lose their career over this so it goes unchecked and it's gotten out of control. I have no problem with real trans people but I absolutely believe that the vast majority are just faking it for attention and/or are mentally ill, have no friends so this is a way to \"belong\" or worst of all, sex offenders exploiting the fact nobody is challenging men going into women's spaces. You don't even have to look like a woman now, you can have a full on beard and huge muscles and say you're a woman and that's it, you're a woman and have all the access to women's spaces you like. Some bloke just got two women pregnant in a women's jail recently, or I only heard of it recently, somewhere in America. He was \"trans\" but used his very male penis on very female inmates. I assume it was consensual but it just proves women arw at risk of rape being in cells with men with working penises.",

Of course LGBT people refuse to use separate rooms. refused that because… what the actual fuck. LGBT people do not want to be singled out and assigned a private space away from everyone else because of the implications or the “danger”. \r\n\r\nDanger to who btw? Because it’s more likely that one of them will get attacked and beat up than one of the cis people who preach fear and hate. Btw question: if the 30 girls didn’t want to change around a lesbian, would that make it ok for the school to move said lesbian somewhere else? Clearly it shouldn’t be. \r\n\r\nBut that’s where stuff like this will get you in a heartbeat.",

And frankly, with so much money on the line maybe it's a trans woman who wasn't good enough to cut it as a man but can beat the pants off of women.\n\nThe logical thing to me would be a Trans category in sports whenever a gender division is desired.

Not every trans person has had the bottom surgery that would make it OK to have a blanket policy about equal access.\n\nThis could be solved a lot more easily if people dealt with their gender dysphoria. It is literally a cognitive break with reality to think you were born in the wrong body. And it's really annoying that there's a huge agenda to confuse children. There's a teacher in our area that keeps asking the class questions like \"OK, so who still thinks they're a boy?\" Really? WTF?  These teachers are going in to class with a specific agenda to groom children for sexual confusion and to normalize sexuality at a young age. Never mind that they can't read or write and they don't know the history of the country etc. They need to be indoctrinated and told what to think about sexuality. Every freaking day.  They keep extra sets of clothes of the opposite genders so that they can promote cross dressing for the kids.  It's as if children don't have enough to worry about without wondering what their gender is every day. That's pretty cruel. \nAnd I would think twice about these corporations and their intentions for you. You think it's primarily about them supporting your rights, but it's a lot more than that.\n\n\nThose corporations are going to profit off of Transgender people in the most barbaric ways, and it's shocking and disgusting that they are praying upon children now, Shoving them onto this barbaric path, ignoring their future reproductive health, knowing that nearly every single one of them will regret the decision by the time they're 18.\n\nThese for-profit corporations Will dance to your tune because you are a cash cow. Lifetime hormone customers. Super expensive surgery customer. Surgery rate with high failure rate equals repeat customer. There are  huge industries that will profit off of the maintenance of side effects. Hospitals love it, doctors and psychiatrists love it. Social workers love it. Pharmaceutical companies love it. All of the adjunct medical supply companies love it.\n\nI wouldn't be so quick to be proud of those corporations for \"supporting\" you.  You are business.",

        "text": "I agree fully with this fact. I held down a highly abusive job for years due to child support, but in 2020, coworkers were becoming increasingly racist (including towards customers), so I spoke with child support, explained exactly what was going on, reminded them that I had a career to fall back on, and they not only agreed with my stance, they altered my order so I could quit.\n\nI put in my notice with the understanding that it was a formality and I would not be coming back. A few days later, I got a call from the company's ethics department which spent 32 minutes accusing me of one racist thing after another. I told them what was going on in the store and they kept ignoring it. A few days after that, I got a call from my former boss who aid the company had issued a level 4 termination even though I didn't work for them (the termination was meant to make it harder for me to get work elsewhere even though I had quit). Two years later and the company's closed multiple stores and is practically rebranding itself to mimic a major competitor in an attempt to hold onto customers.\n\nMeanwhile, I got to focus on my career and make around five times per hour what I did at that mess of a job. I'm able to be a stay-at-home dad and my work is flexible enough that I can take days off as I need to. And I don't have to answer to anyone but myself.\n\n\nI know not everyone can start a self-employed career because it's really tough getting in the door (in my field, it took me nearly ten years to start raking in the big bucks and have a solid client base). But even if you can't, think about your skills and remember that most employers either value customer service above all else or are on a path of self-destruction. People are refusing to return to the workforce, so right now, you can have just about any job you want. If a company goes woke, move on so you'll be getting steady pay when they go broke and all your former coworkers end up on the dole.\n\nGood people aren't as restricted as the wokeists want us to think. We actually hold all the real power and just have to remember this fact when their incessant bleating makes life tough.",

But nonetheless they would still find her stealing hee brother’s underwear, etc. They took her to doctors and therapists for years.

As others have mentioned, he has that father/son dynamic with Carl which makes them a great combo, but there are only a couple cohosts he meshes well with. And I think that's perfectly okay, btu they should be pairing up hosts based on the chemistry, not just whomever seems to be available today.\n\nThe biggest problems I've had with Callum is that he'll sort of be off in his own little world. Granted, Leo is too abrasive for some cohosts (but bounces perfectly off of others such as John), so I'll exclude him as an example. But how many times has Callum been paired up with another host only to spend the entire episode examining his cuticles or staring off into space? This is mainly true when he's not the presenter, but can also happen when he's presenting an his cohost interrupts with an observation.\n\nThe past week or two, though, I've seen a welcome change in his attitude. He's actively engaged with his cohosts and seems to actually be enjoying himself. He's even cracking more jokes. I don't know if Carl had anything to do with it or Callum just had a lightbulb moment, but I really hope he keeps up this new momentum so one day he can be on par with John and Carl in terms of onscreen presence.\n\nI'm also enjoying the spat of new guest hosts this week and thus far hope all of them come back.",

Speaking of Orwellian, pro abortion people are clearly guilty of using Newspeak, even going so far as framing the entire debate in it. It's not Pro-Choice vs Pro-Life, in reality it's Anti-Consequences vs Pro-Life. The entire discussion around the topic has been warped because middle of the road dunces can't see that they've been propagandized to for decades. As far as I'm concerned, if you even remotely agree with anything that Sargon or others in his sphere have been talking about, then it's crazy to fall for such an obvious Newspeak lie like \"Pro-Choice\". \n\nAlso, can I just say I love how your comment is about Orwell not just being \"left wing\" when the very notion of Left and Right are inherently Orwellian Newspeak concepts? The Left v Right is a false dichotomy perpetrated for the express purpose of limiting vocabulary and is a form of control over the discussion in the political landscape. Political ideologies are extremely complex, and have various aspects that fall all over the political spectrum.

That collection of cells doesn't form into a duck, or a turtle, or whatever, it forms a human being. Once again I must point out that \"collection of cells\" is yet more Newspeak. It's an evil reframing of the argument to imply that something that is obviously so suddenly isn't. \n\n\"It has no feelings\" Right, but it will, because it is a human. This entire point is a justification for ending the life of invalids by the way, good to know you're pro murder on that front.\n\n\"People make mistakes\" Right, and then they have to live with the consequences. If I got drunk and injured myself, and it would take 9 months for me to heal up and get back to work, that's on me. This is exactly the same thing. No one is owed sex, and women are choosing to have it knowing the risks. The ones that lose that dice roll are then murdering other humans to avoid suffering the consequences. \n\n\"I'm pretty sure you wouldn't like it if someone tried to tell you what to do\" I mean, you're right, I don't, but we have a little thing called LAWS, which is exactly that. If we didn't have said laws telling us what to do, I sure as hell know what would happen to a whole lot of current societies' problems, lol.

More babies have been aborted in America than all combat deaths in WW1 and WW2 combined. Abortionists have more blood on their hands than literally Hitler.\n\nOne final note. You know those turtle eggs? It is a crime to destroy turtle eggs, eagle eggs, or *insert thousands of other species' eggs, because the government understood that you are ending the life of a member of said species. We literally give more rights to unborn turtles than we do humans, and that's evil.",

You're making it into an emotive argument calling it murder, as that brings to mind the killing of a person (and you criticise me for using language in a particular way!)\n\nThe turtle/eagle egg thing is different, as animals like that don't have a conscious decision to mate; nature drives it.

Women in monogamous relationships with long term partners sometimes want abortions as it's not the right time in their life. And, let's not forget, some women want abortions after they've been raped (they can hardly be called slatterns in that scenario, as they didn't even ask for sex).\n\nIt's a bit of a moot point anyway, though, as I live in England where abortion has been legal for many years and there are no plans to change that for the reasons I've set out.",

        "text": "​@Paul2377  \"When I say collection of cells, I mean an embryo has no thoughts or feelings.\" \n\nAlready answered, I notice you completely ignored that lol. So I'll just repeat both my answers.\n1. It WILL have feelings, that's not debatable. I know it's difficult for you to understand If>Then states of being, but come on, this is getting silly.\n2. You are literally advocating for euthanasia of the extremely mentally challenged if you think \"no thoughts or feelings\" is a reasonable justification for ending a life.\n\n\"The turtle/eagle egg thing is different, as animals like that don't have a conscious decision to mate; nature drives it.\" \n\nRight, so you're agreeing with me that as humans women are capable of NOT mating and thus not getting pregnant, thanks for showing that you don't even understand your own position.\n\n\"Though if we're going to talk about birds, some of them abandon their nests or chicks for a variety of reasons. And that's often after the chicks hatch from their eggs... So I'm not sure bringing that into the argument helps your position.\"\n\nI can't tell if this is you being deliberately obtuse or you're really just this way. The entire point about the turtle eggs was that they're ANIMALS and we put more legal value on their unborn young than we do on the unborn humans in this world. If you think mindless animals deserve more legal status than humans then you need to re-evaluate your priorities. Again, let me re-iterate, the governments in every Western nation are fully capable of looking at various animal's eggs and going 'this is obviously a member of that species, and we want to protect that species, therefore destroying the eggs is the same as killing a birthed one.' Yet for some reason we can't apply that standard to humans? Baffling.\n\n\"It's also telling that you accuse a woman who wants an abortion of being a \"slattern\". Women in monogamous relationships with long term partners sometimes want abortions as it's not the right time in their life.\" \n\nAgain, if she didn't want to get pregnant, then she could have just not had sex lol, but instead she engaged in slattern behavior. Women aren't owed sex, even if they're in a monogamous relationship. Also, PER YOUR OWN ARGUMENT, women are not mindless animals, they are fully capable of not engaging in destructive mating habits and making conscious decisions.\n\n\"And, let's not forget, some women want abortions after they've been raped (they can hardly be called slatterns in that scenario, as they didn't even ask for sex).\"\n\nWhat a sick and disgusting statement. I can't imagine using rape pregnancies (less than 1% of all abortions by the way) to win an argument about abortion in general. I can't imagine what failure of a man one must be to hide behind the skirts of rape victims because they don't have the intellectual rigour to defend their stupid opinion. You don't make policy based on the extreme outliers, and it's telling that you Lefties always fall back on \"Think of the rape victims!\" whenever your arguments get even moderately challenged. Vile.\n\n\"It's a bit of a moot point anyway, though, as I live in England where abortion has been legal for many years and there are no plans to change that for the reasons I've set out.\" \n\nSo because things are the way they are there's no reason to attempt to course correct back to when it wasn't messed up? No wonder you lot are getting conquered, you just lay down and die. \n\nCome back when you actually have valid arguments. I thought you Brits were supposed to be good at arguing, instead all I find is the pious waffling of an out of his depth Lefty.",

Look at recent events the only interest has been because the men are getting into them.\n\nMen only professional fields: where is all the female tech innovation? Been a few decades now and nothing noteworthy as far as I can tell\n\nVoting was not given as a right to men they earned it by taking responsibility for their society a price a lot paid in blood. Women were GIVEN that right by men\n\nWe say the women are taking our things because that is precisely what has happened there's no state I can think of that women vote in that does not have large transfers of wealth from the men to the women.\n\nNow I would rather not have voting a gendered issue and instead have it a privilege to be earned. But women would lose the most from it so they would never let it happen",

Because as a society we’ve said that is the low bar of acceptability for these deviants.\nIf you are genuinely transgender and present unquestionably as female, by all means. I’m happy to share that space. But there’s a lot of dudes putting on dresses (jonathon Yaniv comes to mind) who don’t even come close to passing as their ‘identified gender’ coming in to womens spaces and getting a kick out of making women and children uncomfortable and scared.

What I consistently see is the absurd argument that if someone “feels” like a woman, then their physical body is female, even if the person possesses a penis.  It drives me crazy because I actually have no problem whatsoever with an adult man or woman transitioning to the opposite gender if that is what they need or want to do.  But I do have a problem with being told I have to deny reality and accept male bodied people into female sports or prisons.",

    "text": "As a farther of two teenage sons who are either at or starting uni,and a 19 month old daughter it's plain to see the difference between males and females/ boys and girls( especially when they are becoming a toddler) my daughters actions ,choices,likes ,the way she plays ,etc etc are quite different to the way my son's were at that age , my daughter chooses girls' toys ( for the most part ) with no prompting from me or her mum , and the programmes she likes are ones with females / girls  as the main focus of the show , the way she likes to fall asleep on me instead of her mum , the boys were the opposite ,their upbringing was identical for the most part ,the sick adults and parents of little babies who their parent/s tell everyone \"my son is really a baby girl in a baby boys body ( or vice versa) are abusing their children and brainwashing them into believing the vile lie that their parents push on them , any rational human being can see how cruel these parents are ,there is plenty of examples of those crazy sjw pro trans and pro M.A.P advocators doing videos asking their little kid stuff ,ie a mum saying to het 3 year old son , you want put a dress on don't you , because you are a girl aren't you? And the kid in no uncertain terms says I don't want to wear a dress , boys don't wear dresses , the look on the parents face was priceless , she repeated it to her son ,and he replied with no more mummy ,I'm a boy I don't want a dress , these sickos hide stuff like that , search for them on YouTube and elsewhere ,vids like that don't stay up long ,it shows that this little kid was tired of having it pushed on him in private , so when his sick mother was on TV doing the interview , the little boy looked to the other adults to back him up essentially , poor kid.",

As I said I understand biology and the impact hormones in the food chain are changing people. They deserve protection and equality but not at the expense of what being a Woman is. I too was idealistic in my youth but age has given me the wisdom to temper my compassion with Logic. I believe this movement will be seen as being more disruptive for the community than it will be helpful. The Trans community should accept that they are not the norm but a class in and of itself, that should be able to accept that they are trans humans neither men nor women. Shoving acceptance down women’s throats while pushing them aside to demand they need to be accepted above and before Women, when they are clearly not, is being done by the men in the trans community, no women trans to man are lining up for trophy’s, nor prisons, nor to use the mens restrooms or dressing rooms. I am sorry that you are choosing to be willfully blind of the rampant misogyny used to shit women like me up.
