so i'm zoobee independent i'm an independent rapper author host of the real talk with zubi podcast public speaker and coach originally for born in the uk grew up in saudi arabia family background originally from nigeria also went to an american slash international school for several years so if my accent is confusing you know as it does with everybody then that is why but yeah lots of people know me for lots of different things although i i'm annoyed you didn't put in the best thing there of course which is being the world record holder of remaining yep british women's record holder in the deadlift and bench press actually as well yeah um set those records just over three years ago now and um we we still live in this continuation of clown world so they still stand and speaking of that continuation of clown worlds that's exactly the topic of today for uh posey parker stomping piers morgan and uh as as a member of the transgender community or at least briefly you uh you'll be very interested i'm sure yeah so to start off of course i have to start with the shell so we'll start with uh the show being the book club abigail schreier's irreversible damage that harry did which uh i'm getting a lot of work out of because it is just obviously relevant so this is the obsession with trying to convert kids and then the irreversible damage these people cause but i suppose you want to move to the adults so i've not been that impressed i'll be honest with the uh piers morgan set up on his show i just not really found it that interesting personally and if we go forward i just wanted to mention some of the like weird stuff i found so if you click on this uh image here the first one you can see i remember this was his opening show and uh it's a lot of piers morgan's there that made me laugh at least if you go to the next one the funniest one is just like he has like a screen showing the thing on this on the roof as well so they just had so if the opening show of course they just had his logo so it was just piers morgan uncensored on the roof as well as everywhere else which was strange to say the lead from my perspective if we go forward we can also see that uh there are some memes that did come out of this or at least some alan patrick's level memes that i found funny i don't know if we could play the first one just in there you heard the man fun police get stuffed but then if we go to the next one as well there are some disappointing news for him which is just that the viewing figures apparently are doing very good so this is uh lawrence fox making fun of it of course because i don't think lawrence is uh very very happy with piers and if he goes to the next one as well it's also just the weird notion that all the advertising is about peers morgan i feel like i've said the word piers already like 20 times but i suppose that's the point but anyway we should get into the debate between posie parker and piers himself so there was an event in manchester i presume you saw it i actually didn't know okay so the posie parker went to go give a speech in which she was going to say that women exist do they yeah i was about it because what is a woman though so a bunch of black bloc petty terrorist oh yes i did see this okay yeah i saw some i saw some videos floating around twitter but i didn't know exactly what the event was and i didn't know it was in manchester but that's the thing it was so surprising that there's literally just posse parker coming up to talk about the fact that women exist they have rights and uh that was enough of course in the clan world in which we exist yeah it's this whole thing is so misogynistic it's amazing i mean you've literally got men clad out in black black outfits physically pushing around and and you know i saw i mean i saw one a couple years ago i don't remember that one where the guy um i think was slimy slightly different but the guy like kicked the guy actually kicked a woman um and you've got this and then of course you have all this like weird online activism and people calling these women really really nasty things and slurs and whatever and it's i can't help but notice it's primarily dudes it's primarily men who are doing this it's probably primarily left-wing men who are reveling in this weird misogyny that's allowing them to essentially defend men um i guess against women's rights against women's rights and demonize and make like really misogynistic attacks and comments on women um under the banner f and the the men doing this of course will be the type of men who call themselves feminists and the whole thing is just so backwards and insane and hypocritical that it's hard to believe that this is the real world it's very odd this is where you get this strange narrative i would say at least from the uh well they're not feminists don't call themselves feminists but the women's rights advocates like for example who see the whole transgender movement as like men's rights accuracy it is and but like the mras of old are like what the whole thing is weird and you know it's deranging because we we live in this weird time where you're meant to believe simultaneously it's like 1984. you're supposed to simultaneously believe multiple conflicting and mutually exclusive views so at the same time you're supposed to believe that men and women are completely the same and absolutely equal in every sense like men and women are just the same they don't have even have different preferences or interests or whatever men and women are the same but you're also supposed to believe that we're very different and of course there's this thing called the patriarchy and women are essentially oppressed the wage gap and so on so you also have to recognize this but also they're completely interchangeable and men and women are actually social constructs which cannot be defined um you're a woman if you say you're a woman you're a man if you say you're a man and so you're supposed to simultaneously believe all three of these things men and women are the same they're completely different and neither really exists and they're just social constructs and you can switch from one to the other and this is why you get end up in these weird situations but it's all obviously mad i mean this is why before and i was asking you a lot about saudi arabia you know you've grown up there because like it's weird enough living here all your life and realizing like something's gone deeply wrong yeah but to come from a society where in this regard sex still exists and works and it's fine uh even though you know it's god's things but whatever and uh then looking back on the uk and and the united states and just thinking what it's really weird man i mean the past 10 years in particular have been very weird because i mean we were having this discussion before i mean none of us are you know we're not we're not we're not old people talking about oh you know back in my day many many decades ago or something literally eight 10 12 15 years ago we need to return to a traditional 2010 society yeah like we we're just normal people from 2010 right like i haven't changed drastically changed my views on any of this stuff like my entire life growing up and now it's always been yes there are there are there are two sexes sex and gender are basically interchangeable terms you have men you have women you have boys you have girls um we're similar in many ways as human beings but we are also different and that that difference is important you feel like you're talking to a baby don't you yeah and and the thing is babies even understand this like a baby who cannot even speak can tell the difference between a man and a woman but speaking of the fact that this conversation is just insane on the face of it we shall get into the interview itself which is also just insane so this is the first one here we have uh one of the ninjas turn up uh named jane yeah yeah it is what do you think it is and we'll play the first clip of jane's version of debate let's play that imagery of the suffragette movement a movement for women's liberation and and rebranding it as this hateful movement against trans people we don't stand for that and the majority of women the majority of feminists don't let me let me put my cards on the table i've always supported trans rights to fairness and equality and i mean that sincerely bro well you can say bro and that's fine you're entitled to it's not on sense and show and you've just proven it but let me just say to you i always your favorite wasn't your profile picture wasn't it identified okay there's that point there's no point swearing i apologize to our viewers for your bad language this is a chance for you to present yourself in a way where we can have a proper debate if you've got no interest in doing that that's fine but i'm just going to say to you that i've always supported trans rise to fairness and equality my issue with the way this trans debate is going is in issues like sport for example i think is what is your problem with my position [Music] i don't really know i'm going to leave the interview now i kind of only came on here because i thought it would be kind of funny but when i say you're and you're a fan so there you are that's that's the level of debate yeah of course i mean i cut it there just because he went on to talk about of course the obvious things which is you know bathrooms sport yeah goes on and uh they had nothing they're just not interested see the the one of the biggest problems in the modern western world is you've allowed people like this weirdo on the right to set the rules yeah right so that's someone who should just be laughed at and mocked like nothing that's that person is saying with their complete level of immaturity and stupidity and foolishness and just being so disingenuous people like that shouldn't be taken seriously like yes they have a right to voice their insane views but they should be laughed at for the insane views that they are but instead people are like oh wait okay let's set policy around that let's set all the rules around what this what these fringe weirdos are saying and they've done this on every single subject instead of laughing these people out the room so that's the thing it's like yeah let's use this it is easy to say those people should be out selling pencils from a cup and yeah i agree but at the same time they they end up as mps i mean like we have you know at least 100 mps who believe in this crap just in the uk nobody believes it you're cowards that's all it is i find that hard to believe it's cowards it's it's pure cowardice this this whole thing is based on cowardice that's all even the activists they're all cowards if you are an absolute coward you know the best thing to do is to actually adopt pretend to adopt the position and accuse other people because then you feel indemnified this whole thing is based on cowardice there's nobody out there who believes that biologically you can actually magically change from one sex to the other that is not a thing a man can't give birth no man has ever menstruated no man has ever given birth it's not a thing not just within the human species within the entire animal kingdom we are sexually dimorphic mammals the every single person listening to this every single person here on this planet was birthed by a woman right i still know because we said earlier you were saying sometimes i tweet things and think why the hell am i i'm getting that yeah yeah dude we literally i mean and it's so misogynistic like i'm not i'm not a fan of feminism but like it's i don't not that i even know what feminism means right now no it doesn't because if you can't even define what a woman is how are you talking about women's rights or male and female equality or whatever life if we can't even determine what these words mean but it's so incredibly misogynistic i mean all because all of this stuff it's it always targets women all of the fallout of all of this trans nonsense can't argue man yeah well it always affects women if you're talking about the sports are there male athletes who are worried that females are going to transition no because they'll start they'll get smashed like there's not there's not even a chance so it all affects women is it are men worried about females entering their prisons or entering their private spaces and their changing rooms no it's not it's women's still stronger i mean that's the fundamental thing yeah exactly if this thing even made any sense then all of these issues would be two ways men would also be concerned about the fact that oh well you know there's going to be an unfair advantage here there but men are not worried it only impacts 50 of the population who are female i mean even even the language right instead of calling people mothers calling them birthing people or birthing birthing bodies per person who gives birth uh vagina owners menstruators all of this they're called women like the most the most traditionally misogynistic dude in the world will still call women women like you always still use the word yeah but anyway i was just going to mention that like you're saying the the person that the you know insane person is really the problem here to be honest i find piers there more of the problem because his response was to say to the person oh look i believe in trans white fairness and equality and i'm always left with a question a trans right to what yeah exactly and he again he's trying to protect himself because these people these people are so vicious that if you just call it like it is you're you get called a tran you know they're going to call you a transfer regardless and that's exactly let's say so yeah so you you can't just be trying to couch this thing and use all these caveats or whatever like it's a given if you are if you support human rights and equality on a basic level that encompasses everything it encompasses everything right so when people even say i support trans rights it's like what does that even mean well that's the thing there are two different rights here and uh they are in conflict yeah and we're gonna see you mentioned just call yourself transphobic anyway uh we'll see posie parker do exactly that because she just does not care he was just like are you transphobic thinking ha ha you know we'll laugh and she goes nah sure why not so let's play okay talk to you about this issue because you were on the receiving end as a group there you were trying to uh speak at emmeline pankar statue i've just had a pretty you know unsavory exchange with one of those protesters who probably thinks that they've had their little moment with me and they'll get their little viral moment i actually think it's indicative of actually how awful uh their behavior has been throughout this episode and the way they've dealt with it afterwards but let me ask you you're very strong about supporting women's rights to the point where many say that you are transphobic do you are you transphobic well i think in 2022 transphobic really just means i don't think women have penises and so yeah i i absolutely am [Laughter] just tell them tell them posies chad yes not gonna waste my time don't take the bait yeah and she's absolutely right it's the definition and the definition there is okay we don't believe men have penises the definition is you acknowledge reality absolutely and uh peter doesn't seem to take that very well okay so let's play the next clip so you're proud of being transphobic yeah i'm proud of standing up for women's rights and and making the word woman completely exclusive to just women uh adult human females 100 well you see but here's my problem with that because whilst i have a problem with the last guest who chose to be abusive and unpleasant and wasn't listening to a word i said i've always supported trans rights to fairness and equality i don't see a need to say i'm transphobic towards them or to alienate them in any way at all and have a problem when you proudly boast of being transphobic i can see why on the other side of this argument that kind of rhetoric would be very unhelpful to people who are trans right well i guess we have a little bit of an issue with definitions but when it comes to words like transphobia it's simply used to silence women like myself who are trying to protect women's spaces language and rights and so if i have to wear that label in order to speak the truth and i'm happy to do it i really there is nothing that that can stop me from speaking about what harms and danger uh there is for women uh when we try and dilute what the word woman means and we allow that language to be used for men that'd be just very simple straight up yeah she's telling the truth that's all but i love how she doesn't waste her time at all like she's very much just like i'm not even gonna no sit there and be like yeah trans right to fairness and equality what's that okay so women's rights in this instance are women's right to what okay well to have a sex-segregated space very simple that's my right and you can have it for men too of course i think i think you know before even getting into the weeds i think the most basic right is to be recognized as what you are right to to write a right to the word woman right like that's before anything else i think that's i don't want to put the put any uh words in uh in in kelly j keane's mouth there but that's like the the fundamental thing right you are like half of the world half of the adult population are women adult human females and you have the right to be recognized by what you literally are and not have men regardless of how they feel or what hormones they want to take or how they want to dress or whatever to make a claim that they are they are what you are i mean that that's that's offensive that's that's like gender blackface basically my feelings don't care about your facts though so yeah i mean that is literally the inverse they're running yeah that's that's what it is and you know i understand um i i do think i i i think piers is trying to kind of dance this line between not getting stuck with the transphobic label um but also somewhat stand up for reality and you can't really do that dance because you cannot appease vipers and these activist types and this is not saying trans people in general because a lot of trans people in general do not like these activist types um who are actually just making things worse for them most people let's be real most people don't actually know a transgender person most people don't know anyone who's trans right like this is not some huge section of the population um and but what people end up seeing is is this they see the activists they see the noisy people who are screaming all this stuff and i think if anything they're doing a massive disservice to people who are trans and who just want to be left alone who don't want to be like treated badly trans are they yeah well i need to call it the activist according to the activists yeah but these are the activists who don't think people like myself are actually black because you know we're not left-wing and we don't play the victim card and we we don't have we don't align to all of their views you know i've had white people white lefties have the audacity to tell me that i'm not really black right or to call me a white supremacist and stuff like that right like what kind of clown world are you living in where you have the freaking audacity to do that but this is why i have a problem with peers here in this regard because there's a reason i brought up as viewing figures not just to be mean or anything but there have been a significant say backlash from let's say right leaning people who watch stuff and engage with things make things against uh him and his show and it's not just because of his covet switch yeah but because of still stuff like this but you can see he's definitely just confused or doesn't really understand that he's got to stop playing the game he's got to stop playing the game because i don't think he's confused man i i just think he lacks the moral courage to because he's still in london to look no one wants to get stuck with a label and this is how the woke side of the of the the left side of the aisle in many countries has gained so much social power it's through labeling being able to call you racist call you misogynistic call you a transphobe call you uh whatever type of bigot flavor of the day um to stick anyone who goes against them with that label it's their only argument the only argument literally the only argument the only argument about why males should be allowed to compete with females in sport is if you don't like it you're transphobic yeah that is the only argument there's no there's no coherent argument it's just oh well you're a transphobe you're a transphobe and no one wants to be called that so then most people start playing defense what i love about what posey does is she doesn't she doesn't play defense she doesn't take that bait she's like all right you can call me that like now let's have the conversation but that's why i'm saying then they have nothing left piers just isn't uh either standing up or isn't getting it he knows the truth man yeah i mean yeah but there's there's the thing like the truth is the fact that what woman's right to what while sex segregated space okay so a trans right to what to violate that space you don't have a right to violate someone else's rights it's very simple so if you believe in the first right you can't believe no the next one so when he says i'm up for trans rights of fairness and equality doesn't mean anything man everything everybody is it's like if i say i'm up for you know i say you know i support uh the rights of any demographic it's like well what does what does that mean like if you surprise right to violate your space yeah if you support human rights in general and you support equality then whether you're going down a so-called gender identity line or a sex line or a race line or an ethnicity line or a religious line or what it doesn't matter you don't need to go into any more detail it's like look i believe all human beings all all adult human beings for sure should have should have this the same right should be treated fairly under the law however should not be discriminated against should not be be physically hurt or threatened or anything like that they should have a right to dignity exactly right so that and i that i just i just live that that's all it is like i don't need to oh it's june let me go throw a rainbow flag in my bio oh something just happened let me put the hashtag blm let me put hashtag i support women it's like dude like i support people if you are a human being then i support your rights period right like it doesn't mean i need to jettison reality it doesn't mean if you're going to support their rights yeah they want you to throw away reality and i'm not i'm not going to throw away reality right like if someone is trying like i know i know way more i know and having interacted with far more trans people than most people or just as a nature of me interacting with so many people right i meet so many people all across the board all across the world um i have people who are trans who follow me on social media and whatever and you know might be even listening to this podcast and so on and it's like look i'll treat anyone with dignity i'll treat anyone with kindness i'll treat anyone with as a human being but i'm not going to see the ground of reality itself like that's very dangerous because if you can see that reality then you're on an ultra slippery slope yeah anything else goes and peers i don't think really gets that point and that's why i'm hoping he will but let's play the next clip in which they continue to argue about well why are you not for fairness and equality you know i i listen i agree with a lot of what you say i've i've talked about this a lot and i think there are serious issues about the infringement on women's rights as people try and progress trans rights to where they want to get to which is fairness and equality you can't create a new unfairness a new inequality but i don't think it's helpful to the debate for you to say i'm transphobic because that means that you are by your own admission hateful towards the trans community that's what it means translate it's not a word it's not even a real word i think that's such an important point is that it's not even a real word no i need to be irrationally afraid of trans people if you're reading it literally it's not a word right so they literally will make up words to go along like it's all just a game man and it's tiring i'm really tired of just people being disingenuous and dishonest and straw manning all the time which is what piers has done there she didn't come out and say i am transphobic he jumped on with the allegation that you are transphobic so now you here you defend yourself but she even made the effort to define what transphobia is which is believing that men don't have penises it's not a word it's not a word but like it's just this annoying disingenuous tactic of you know it it's the it's the oh you know have you stopped beating your wife yeah right it's that one and now someone's like wait what like someone's there defending themselves about not beating their wife when it's like oh you know well when are you going to stop beating your wife and it's like well you know it's it's disingenuous it's this rhetorical tactic that is often used to put people on the back foot and on the and and that to me i think it's number one is disrespectful it's dishonest but also to me it means you don't really you're not really trying to have a real conversation if you're just there throwing these labels out at people i think he's fallen into that problem here we'll go for the next one should try and bust through them let's go to the next one here yeah but it doesn't though does it because that uh person just called you transphobic um and i think you've said numerous times even this evening that you are pro trans rights what whatever that means um and so if you give an inch i feel uh then we really do give everything up and so i'm just look it's just a word it just transphobic what is that i've never assaulted anyone i've never incited violence i don't even know what transphobia means besides uh refusal to submit to this ideology and i just i just won't i think there needs to be a better consensus between the two warring factions on this because i have a lot of sympathy for all of what you say i also have sympathy with the trans community who do feel that increasingly a lot of the rhetoric about them is transphobia i don't think it really helps to debate if you say i'm transphobic because you know that will cause a lot of anger towards them and why play that game if you feel that they are playing a game with you why not be the bigger person in the debate and say all right how do we get to a place of genuine fairness and equality for all i mean it's just again like what are you doing we've it's so frustrating because we've been there like what is the goal okay so so all these activists even pierce himself when he's saying we want to get to fairness and equality what does that mean tell me tell me tell me what you would like it to look like well that's the thing people can't define right you shouldn't be in the bathrooms but also why don't you just give in and do what they say so yeah so so this is this is the thing so if you look back at genuine civil rights movements of the past real ones right you could point out very specifically specifically and explicitly what the goals were look okay this segment of the population does not is not is currently being their right to vote vote is being infringed upon look these people are being enslaved these people are being paid less for the same work these people are not being allowed to use the same services and amenities as other people these people are being right like there was always it's clear-cut they can't do that they can say well these people are not being recognized as women but that's not all right it's not right absolutely being recognized as human beings who already have the same rights and equalities that all these other real activists fought for back in the day um and there you go you've you've got fairness and equality you've you've got it right if there's a situation where um somebody gets attacked based on their identity or something like that then yeah we can we can jump on this specific issue and work to work to sort that out right because you're not you don't have a right to assault anybody right whether you agree you disagree you like the way they look like you don't whatever you can't just see someone on the street and you know physically physically attack them or whatever um so you know and if there is some huge spate of that happening then i'm i'm not i'm not aware of it someone can can make me aware um but we live in such a incredibly as far as human history goes and as far as the world goes we live in such a magnificently incredibly tolerant society like you could put on i could put on lipstick and a dress on high heels and have my freaking beard in my muscles and i could walk down a high street in the uk and probably nobody would say anything to me let alone me be attacked or assaulted i mean i most money on it i i think i could do that any high street in the uk i don't think anyone would say anything no i don't think any i think people would give me some odd looks i think people would think things i don't think anyone would say anything people think people would mind their business and that shows you i mean man try that in most of the world try that you you try that in most the world right like you you can't so people are pushing for this like unicorn land which does not exist and cannot exist where and and you've got this situation where you've got you know like you said you're infringing upon the right the actual right woman's right to have a segregated of the population yeah that's also for men as well like men deserve their own places as well yeah exactly like i don't actually want women in in the men's changing room either right is it a physical threat to me no but it's weird and it's uncomfortable for people um and this has always been fine it's never been a big issue um with these weird things like bathrooms i mean you can have you know a gender neutral bathroom or a disabled bathroom or an everybody who's bad if that's that's such some huge issue it's my university that's what we did like all the disabled bathrooms were also gender neutral sure yeah okay so the three people who this is a big issue for like you can use that one you've got unlimited another bathroom there you go there you go anyway we'll have to skip over the last clip so we don't have time for it but basically posey just says that uh she feels sorry for the clearly confused children i don't know if we can skip over this one but that you know those guys in the black block who were also clearly trans uh they're probably gonna wake up about 15 years and realize yeah i don't really know what i was doing with my uh years there and i think she's probably correct about that assessment but otherwise if i don't look at the the last uh link on there which is the only news in regards to masks on zoom course the only other news on the stream call on the on the show of ps morgan was the fact that the bad man as i have to call him because we can't literally mention his name without getting flagged by bot apparently so the bad man uh actually threatened piers morgan to a debate as well because i don't know if you remember the last interaction these two had i actually don't oh right so um the bad man went on piers morgan show and good morning britain to debate the fact that there's a disproportionate amount of muslim men being arrested for certain crimes and he held up the quran oh yes i did oh this was years back right yeah to say look i can literally quote you the passages i've got to memorize and pierce morgan's response was take that book down your offending religion yeah i remember that so the bad man's point being well look if you're truly uncensored allow me to do the blast for me that you didn't allow last time and let's have the discussion so it'll be interesting to see if that happens at least i doubt it if
