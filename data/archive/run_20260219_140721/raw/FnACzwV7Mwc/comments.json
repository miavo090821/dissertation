I have felt alone in my efforts, like a cat forever in the center of a pack of dogs, fighting the world..just to regard the cold, harsh truth. Exhausting myself and being picked to the bone before I can even get to the point of discussing possible solutions.  We need to talk about \"envy\" too (as we have with \"insecurity\") and how that word should not be thrown around as an assault on someone's character either. Envy (or jealousy for those who use the terms interchangeably) is the inevitable, justified result of gross unfairness and insurmountable injustices, it is the very thing that pushes us toward closing the gaps..it is what fuels us to improve our quality of life, it is what underpins rebellion and pleas for equality. Same thing with \"comparison\", they tell us \"comparison is the thief of joy\" and don't we know it, but everyone compares themselves to others for various reasons (including attractive people who compare themselves to us in order to feel special and superior, at our expense), none of us live in a vacuum, most things are what they are due to how they relate to something or someone else. You cannot go through life without recognizing this and being forced to adhere to it, especially if you're at the bottom of the totem pole...you are not given any other options, beyond deluding yourself into oblivion. And let's be honest..attractive people would not have it any other way. They don't want the status quo to change, they want us to be envious, they NEED us to be..and they need us to exist as something \"less than\" so that they can be seen as \"more than\", in the most superficial, unearned way imaginable- but which still holds so much significance in society and in our sense of identity.",

Many times I am more skilled at something, and a harder worker, than others. But, others will be picked over me, simply because they are automatically viewed as being more competent than I am, because they are male. Other times, prettier woman will be chosen over me, simply because the person doing the picking wants those women to like them. It doesn't matter that I am more qualified.",

I find it hard to fit in with my peers, I often ignore, when I try to make a presence at least, people tend to give me that look as if I'm not human or they're creeped out like it's my fault for existing like this. When people think of ugly, they automatically assume you don't take care of yourself, but I do. I'm skinny , short guy. Born with a big forehead and sadly bald in my young adult years, I feel left alone too often and always the outcast within my peers and family. In my family there is always a black sheep in each generation and I seem to be the one. \n\nOne thing I hate the most is when people gaslight you saying you're beautiful and nobody is ugly, maybe it's your personality, which it's a big lie. People always say this without knowing me and just assume I'm bad because I'm ugly, which goes back to people judging another human being based on their looks.",

You'll have rumors spread about you, guys claiming they did things with you. What really is confusing is when you grow up being made fun of for being \"oogly\"(yt censors) and told everyone hates you to having these rumors about all these guys banging you whom you never even met and how you are pregnant when in reality you are still a virgin. \n Feel as if I've seen the darkside of both. I was assaulted as a child when being made fun of, and also when older after \"turning pretty\". I don't know, it's been kinda bad both ways. I never once felt \"pretty\". I knew some guys wanted me, but I didn't look at myself and think,  \"wow, what a beautiful woman\".\n\n To add to how women treat you, some will automatically resent you. They'll hate you immediately without reason other than they don't like the way they look and you become the amalgamation of everyone who made them feel less than. It's awful because some of these women will try to ruin your entire life, not exaggerating. I got along with almost everyone, so this is not a case of me not noticing what a B I was lol",

They would tease me a lot. They didn't flirt with me when we were adolescents. They always talked about other girls being pretty, and acted like I was chopped liver.\n\nWhen I was older, and I wasn't in the cult anymore, I made friends with many gorgeous young women. Every time we went out, older people and children would tell them how pretty they were, but I never got compliments. Men would come up and flirt with them, ask for their number, ask them out, pay for their meals, etc.. But, they completely ignored me, as though I was completely invisible.\n\nBut, I moved away. I didn't make friends automatically, because my work schedule made it difficult to develop many friendships. So, when I would go shopping, go out to eat, go to festivals, or go to movies, etc., I would go alone. I would often get compliments on my looks, get hit on by men, and even had multiple photographers stop me and ask me to model for them. I was shocked. I did low level modeling. I didn't make tons of money. I wasn't famous, of course. But, I would make $400-$1,500 a month, depending on the month. \n\nThe thing is, I looked exactly the same when I was invisible as I did when I was being perceived as pretty.",

I've heard from other afab folk that they got treated better when performing hyperfemininity, their avoiding eye contact was seen as being 'endearingly shy' when fem but was seen as rude and disrespectful when they looked 'average'. \nMight also have to do with some weird manic pixie dream girl thing, since how often do you see those be portrayed as not conventionally attractive. \n\nOf course there's other factors, but I feel like when you're specifically in that 'not autistic enough to be seen as disabled' but 'not allistic enough to be seen as 'normal' your looks can be a big contributing factor.",

        "text": "Big of you to say, but yeah absolutely. I think it's human nature to recoil and feel negative emotions upon seeing something we find aesthetically unpleasant. We are visual animals, and our empathy is actually connected to our eyes. This is precisely why babies, of all animals whose parents care for them, are \"cute\". It's a strategy to play on the emotions of their parents and trigger their empathy. Empathy comes from first saying \"I like the look of that\". This is why it's actually SO extremely dark and hazardous to have a society dictating what is beautiful, and painting certain people as ugly and less. To some extent ugly is ugly, and those uglies are doomed, and even I am like \"ew! F-- you!\" when I see these people. But to add people to the roster of \"ugly\" based purely on things like race or other trivial things, when they're actually attractive, is messed up.  We should be trying to reduce the window of ugliness, to maximise empathy, not reducing empathy by expanding the window of ugliness. You can think of a case like George Floyd, the diminished empathy for him despite the clear video of him being brutally murdered, the reaching for excuses, it was all because those people were trained by society to find his exaggerated negro features ugly. Scary. People can literally watch you be murdered and like it, because they find you ugly, because society drilled into them that you are.",

        "text": "@aribahossain6234 I'm sure some manage to train themselves to do that already, or are just so overflowing with empathy they can find it for all living things, but I do believe there's a default setting built into people, and maybe primates and mammals even, where the visual aesthetic holds an inordinate amount of weight in determining the empathy that is conjured. Unfortunately. I've experienced it first hand. I was a very attractive teenager, just accidentally, a tanned skateboarder boy with 6 pack abs and the little obliques cutting in at the side of the abs and a cherubic face and girls asking to touch my body, and yeah, I took for granted this strange empathy I seemed to draw from every man woman and child, the elderly, my aunties, just regular straight guys ... everyone. And then I got to experience that wither away so sharply, starting in my 20s and just falling off a cliff since. My disposition actually got much sweeter and more humble and kind in correlation with this physical visual decline, and I retained or improved my wit and sense of humour or whatever might have made me friends in the first place, but increasingly people just became cold and didn't care if I lived or died, and I could so distinctly feel it coming at me from every single angle after having experienced being one of the beautiful people. Combine this with my extensive David Attenborough education, and its just so clear to me the animal behaviours at play. I can also see this phenomenon reflected with the classic \"Karen\". Every Karen was once a beautiful young girl, everyone treating her like gold, and then suddenly they started ... not. And the Karen starts losing her mind as the world stops being nice to her. She needs to speak to the manager because she needs to get the \"justice\" of the pretty privilege she used to receive. I really feel for them, I'm a male karen who is just sad instead of angry. I notice the Karens are often even the same complexion as me... the kind that turns sour in the sun, and balloons out shapeless in the body in all the wrong places. A lineage that doesn't age well, after reaching such dizzying heights in our teenage years... the world turns SO cold. The black karen is rare, for two reasons- were never treated that well in the first place, and also never cracked so badly.",

They have to have the knowledge and emotional skills to unpack their innate negative feelings and instead lead with empathy. \n\nThe same applies to our human peers. We have to unlearn the ways we’ve been led to innately feel toward criminals and homeless, untrain the way we might even instinctually feel toward the disabled and the sickly — and build our empathy skills to care for all of our neighbors",

        "text": "​@Eeokyeah so it is just \"what you find beautiful\", rather than \"what is technically beautiful\". That's why different people have more or less empathy for different things. The cliche \"so ugly it's cute bulldog\" I'm sure generates empathy from tonnes of people. Me included. A lot of people, not me included, often find very elderly people \"cute\" and have elevated empathy for them. I lean more towards finding them gross, and I have diminished empathy for them. I'm also compelled to \"find logic\" for why their lives don't matter as much. I know this is technically immoral, but this is the inclination in me I have no real control over. It's a visceral feeling, and then a tendency I notice in hindsight. But the good thing about having this darkness and recognising it, is I can then easily see it and recognise it in other people. So for example I can see this phenomenon in a lot of racist people. It's literally just firstly a visceral reaction to finding the way they look bad, and from there they kind of don't care if (for example) a police officer shoots them, and then they will rationalise why the shooting is justified and see all angles of excuses for the officer but all stemming from finding the victim visually repellent and therefore having diminished empathy. I'm someone who, for some reason, LIKES the way black people look. The women I find attractive, the men I think \"look cool\", so I'm upset when I see them suffer. This is generally how empathy works and once you understand it you'll see it everywhere and notice how consistent it is.",

This person isn't saying they get treated differently because men don't often have spaces they need to express feelings and experience in a genuine way but rather their experiences and struggles with facing the world being perceived as unattractive. Both are very real struggles and driven from very similar places if not the same place, but this isn't a gendered debate about who has it worst. It's a place for honesty and to be vulnerable in a place where otherwise those who see and feel those differences is hushed because acknowledging \"ugliness \" is taboo.",

I'm tall with a fat ass and big pouty lips. Growing up in the South I watched other white and Latina girls with my color get highlights or go blonde to better fit the beauty standard, not to mention tanning. I saw my hair color as something I was expected to but didn't want to fix (to this day I've never dyed it). It was only when someone asked me if I dyed it when I was 17 that it occurred to me people might not only keep it but choose it on purpose. I'm pretty but have an intense resting bitch face that even adults in my life commented on growing up. Feeling the tide in beauty shift to IG baddies definitely made me understand that whatever was in societally was a trend. It's interesting looking at fashion throughout the 19th and 20th centuries and seeing that cycle in action. I just happened to be on trend. I also did nothing to look like this and understand it's pure luck. I can't give someone a doctor rec or an exercise regimen, I just look like this. No Protestant Work Ethic Here ¯⁠\\⁠_⁠(⁠ツ⁠)⁠_⁠/⁠¯",

Something I would suggest you to think about is that children learn from observation. So if you still hate looking in the mirror I'm worried your daughter may be affected by that. It's nothing wrong in not doing everything perfect. We are all just humans. Maybe consider visiting specialists in that topic, I would do some meditation while watching my mirror reflection and try staring in my own eyes. Eyes are usually the part of the body people like about themselves so it's good start point. Also there is something spiritual in them for me, I know its just my perspective but I think most people get what I'm talking about, even in society and culture somehow, even in the late capitalism, we value it and see it as something personal. \nWhat is more about looking in the mirror directly into your eyes there are studies that shows that if you do it long enough you start to have hallucinations. The shapes of your face start to change. For me it's the realisation point that everything is just an illusion. Helps me to look at everything with much more distance.",

I think I get where you're coming from in that, absolutely, our interactions with strangers are 200% coloured by how attractive they perceive us as. \n\nBut saying that 'most people like them mainly' for their looks makes it sound as though even friendships they might have are largely based on physical attractiveness, and this isn't smth I've found to be true. There certainly are 'friends' who re mainly drawn to someone for their looks or popularity, but there are also social connections that extend beyond that. When I was at my most conventionally unattractive I might not have gotten any attention from the opposite sex but I still had amazing friends, several of whom were also not conventionally attractive. It's possible I misunderstood what you meant though and that you were mostly referring to strangers/general preferential treatment?",

They are also still complex human beings with their own personalities and families and experiences that will shape how they interact with others.\n\nAs I said in my first comment, definitely agree that how stranger treat you or how people interact with you dating wise will depend greatly on your looks, and yes, there is absolutely preferential treatment.

Like when I show up frumpy, people are rude but I also have deep friendships based on personality. And when I've appeared more pretty, I still have deep friendships, but strangers will coddle me and I absolutely despise it because it's disrespectful in a different way. You get more favor as a pretty person, which is safer, but it's a different kind of disrespect because my authority and intelligence wasn't respected. People came to my defense, which is nice, but would also undermine me. I was a Doll to protect instead of an equal person. So I think women face the intersectional challenge of facing misogyny as Ugly vs facing misogyny with Pretty Privilege. I used to struggle with recognizing when people were gendering me, and recognizing when I'm being treated different in a Structural way has absolutely helped me steer clear. this video is definitely reminding me to uplift my opposites if I am currently occupying privilege. Pretty people definitely have more freedom to be weird and perceived as \"quirky.\"",

I actually typed up a response to that one comment you deleted & since I am not indecisive, I will proceed with typing that very response for you regardless... Look, words only have the power of affecting you, if you believe them & if you allow them to. I'm just some stranger on the internet, but in this case I'm being honest with you... Never let anyone know ur weakness's, surround yourself with ppl that are better than you & manifest surpassing them, (And you will)...\n\nThat girl from grade-school, tell urself she was an unhappy little girl who was simply jealous of you...(her words are not \"Divine Scripture\", are they?). Would you ever seek out a 4th grader for abject truth? She may very well have been an inadequate little brat, that was trying to get under ur skin, in order to compensate for her inadequacy... But she cannot get under ur skin, unless you allow her, ( so don't allow her to). In the end, all these yrs later, she probably doesn't even remember the exchange she had with you & yet you've allowed her to live rent free in ur brain for 50-plus yrs, to the point where her words still very much affect you. So yes, my response to ur initial reply which you deleted still stands...\"Yes, it is YOU\".",

I however am fat and have been since grade school. So in order to feed her ego one of the boys at our table literally pointed at me and said “at least you’re not fat like that fat”. And everyone laughed. I will never forget that even though I got a dig in by saying “at least my mama loves me” (he was a foster kid). I got called to the principal’s office because he started crying. Not my best moment I’ll admit but I was literally just sitting there existing and he chose to come for me to feed someone else’s ego. There has not been a day since that day that I haven’t thought about him saying that and I have struggled with disordered eating ever since as well. I really do agree with you. I think people have to start teaching their kids to be kinder to one another. It’s never “just words”.",

I made sure she felt prioritized by me. Inviting me but not my best friend was not a possibility. She was there for me as a good friend, so I was there for her. She knew she was my nr 1 person. I think it gave her a bit of confidence. She knew I had her back in the social situations so she became more relaxed and talkative to new people. I took her with me to meet people, to parties, at first she was kinda out of place but soon she made a lot of friends because she was so very nice, fun and easy to hang out with. She got some boys interested in her and started to have relationships too. \nPeople that doesn’t defend their friends or prioritizes dumb sh^t over them, are not really good friends imo! \nI’m telling y’all talk to that one shy person, the unseen one or the odd one, not all of them keep to themself because they like that, some would love to be friends, so take the first step and see (respect any rejection obviously).

The reason I mention \"doing\" is because in practice “confidence in your looks” usually only comes up in situations where looks are directly tied to outcomes (dating, being teased, social standing, etc.). It’s not like someone randomly says “be confident in your looks” when nothing is at stake. Someone can't \"just be confident\" in their looks, because that confidence is built after positive reinforcement; it's why desirable people are confident in their looks despite not doing much else. The problem for people who are seen as ugly is that society gives them way fewer chances to get that feedback in the first place, which makes the cycle way harsher.",

Time will catch up to all of us and while having had good features will certainly help you be less ugly in age, at some point past a certain age, we kinda all get ugly.

        "text": "its good advice in the sense that its true, its bad advice in the sense that its vague and unhelpful. my own dating life is proof that the sentiment is true.\n\ni'm extremely disabled and use a wheelchair, and therefore, i am extremely ugly in a broader societal context. all through high school, all of my friends were dating and banging each other like crazy, while i just had to sit there and be like \"while y'all are giving each other STIs and scabies, i'm sitting here and nobody will even so much as go on a date with me\" and it was EXTREMELY easy to blame my disability and the way it affects my appearance and the fact that i have to use a wheelchair. i had a lot of ridiculously beautiful friends, but even my less attractive friends were all dating and having sex. i got more and more down on myself, and over the course of years, began to wallow more and more deeply in self-pity and self-loathing and obsession about the ways i was ugly and undateable. i got some variation of \"just be yourself\" or \"just be confident\" for years, including from my femme friends that had previously turned me down, which only made it worse. its a good thing incel forums weren't around in the 00s, or i think i would have definitely fallen victim to incel ideology at that time.\n\nthen, one day, i made a new friend. a new friend that flirted back when i flirted with her. even just that was enough to make me feel so much better about myself, but eventually we slept together. when that happened, it caused this whole chain reaction of epiphanies about myself, the world, beauty and unattractiveness, all sorts of things. most importantly though, i realized that it was completely fucking pointless to even think about my disability at all in the context of dating and romance because its not like i can do fuckin ANYTHING about it at all, so what was the point? how was obsessing over my unattractiveness doing anything for me other than making me feel bad about myself? especially since i now had proof that, even with all the shit making me unattractive, there were STILL people that were interested in me enough to sleep with me. so, i made a VERY conscious decision to stop any and all negative self-talk. in my mind, i decided, \"i'm awesome, and anybody that disagrees is wrong\" and i told myself this all the time. any time i felt wronged or rejected by someone, i told myself, \"that person is wrong, and why would i even want the approval or attention of someone that feels that way about me in the first place?\". when i had some kind of intrusive thought about things i didn't like about my appearance, i would stop the thought in its tracks with a \"eh, who cares, i'm still cool as fuck\".\n\nit was completely life changing. i surprisingly quickly started to genuinely feel good about myself pretty much all the time, and people started to actually want to date me. i had people approaching me to ask ME out, an ugly little broke weirdo in a wheelchair, which is unbelievably rare as a masc person that almost exclusively dates women without even factoring in the ugliness aspect of it all. through a huge chunk of my 20s, i was never single for more than a few months at a time, and on the occasions that i was single for longer than a few months, i was at least going on dates with new people fairly regularly.\n\nbeing comfortable in your own skin and confidence about who you are as a person doesn't completely negate unattractiveness, but it certainly helps a LOT because attractiveness isn't just \"how you look\". i'm not exaggerating at all when i say that learning to have confidence in myself was completely life changing. so, it is TRUE that \"just be confident\" is good advice, it's not HELPFUL. the actually helpful advice is to stop talking negatively about yourself. focus on the aspects of yourself, both physical and non-physical, that you like. make that shit pop, exaggerate that shit. find new things that you like about yourself. literally lie to yourself if you have to, i did at first, and then eventually i wasn't lying to myself anymore. stop giving a shit about the opinions of people that don't like you, because they're completely irrelevant anyway.\n\n\"just be confident\" isn't even remotely as simple as it sounds, but it IS correct. nobody wants to be around someone that hates themselves, romantically or otherwise. the hard part is learning HOW to love yourself, but it is the single best and most powerful thing you can do in your life. its a conscious decision that you have to make and then keep making every day until you die.",

Yes, you aren't subject to the same discrimination are autistic people who are ugly or visibly disabled, but not getting a diagnosis or help because people assume you aren't like the ugly autistic stereotype is awful. Being a pretty autistic teenage girl sucked. Girls think you think you're better than them, when what you are is confused by the social codes. Boys think you're frigid and that you think you're too good for them, when they flirt and it goes over your head. I'm not exaggerating when I say I'm beautiful. People say I look like Audrey Hepburn. I won the genetic lottery on lookism and lost on ableism. I was undiagnosed into my 30s. I have had an objectively bad time because pretty privilege made my blatant autistic behaviour look like vanity. I just wanted friends, but I was deeply lonely. Attractive autistic people do get bullied for their behaviour, but our behaviour isn't recognised as autistic. You're beautiful, so everyone should like you, but nobody does, so you must have something fundamentally unlovable about you. It's a headfuck.",

We are nothing but stances; the problem is that when people mean someone looks ugly, they say they ARE ugly. If you don’t straighten your hair, get fat and don’t wear makeup and put on glasses, people will likely see you as ugly, does that mean your features changed? No. But that’s the way you are perceived. We need to start separating BEING with LOOKING. One means inheritance, another means stance. A girl in my class was bullied for being ugly, she had very short hair and used to shave her eyebrows, let me tell you she grew up and let her hair grow and eyebrows grow, she was the prettiest anywhere we went. That’s also the problem I think we have; and I think this video, although sheds light, it’s  also part of the problem. The reason why we tell people they aren’t ugly is because, they aren’t. They currently LOOK ugly. She will grow her entire life thinking she is less worthy forever no matter what she does. And you are still acknowledging her experience.

I very much was the capital P Pretty ideal as a kid; blonde, blue eyed, skinny. As a kid I was told that I was pretty a lot by adults and peers. It was part of my identity. When I went through puberty I gained weight in the wrong places and my nose got bigger in a way that changed my face symmetry. The change in how I was treated by both adults and peers was huge shock to me and honestly traumatic to deal with as a middle school age kid. I’m still fat and ugly and I’ve never really let go of the idea that I’m actually “supposed” to be pretty, like it’s this right I had taken from me. I hate how much of my time and energy has been put into trying to get closer to the ideal standard and just how much self hatred I still have as a fully grown woman for my looks. \n\nI’ve always known on a gut level that I’ve been discriminated against for being ugly, and I’ve been on the journey of reclaiming fatness and embracing body neutrality/fat liberation for about a decade, I’ve never done this with my ugliness.

        "text": "I like watching older media.  I love seeing the unique beauty in people of all shapes and sizes, and with all sorts of different facial features.  \n\nI actually suffer from crowd/face blindness.  I tend to brush people the wrong way because I can't recognize them from one encounter to another.  So I prefer interesting faces or features because I can recognize the person better and faster than someone who blends into the crowd.\n\nI think as an individual, we can work towards changing our perception of people and then by extension, our social circles.  People tend to think they deserve attention and to be able to date someone they find more attractive than themselves.  Studies have shown this to not be the case.  So the only way to flip the script is to choose a partner lower (gasp) than the level that you think you are.\n\nThere are so many multi-facets to what makes an individual a person.  Lets stop judging people based on their looks, age,  clothing, social caste and just be friendly with everyone we encounter.  But we can't do that because then we might actually have to be friends with someone beneath where we deem ourselves to fit into society.  🤯🙄\n\nSo since, that is an impossibility, let's just stop condemning people for having choice on what they want to date or on what they find attractive and just learn to accept that maybe you weren't right for them.  If all goes well, it really doesn't matter how many people you find or that find you attractive as you really only need one partner in life to love you as you age and be by your side though the myriad of challenges you will face in life.\n\nQuit being mad because you weren't someone's choice and just work at trying to find the one that does like you for you.  That person might be shorter, balder, fatter, than you thought or not.  The point is to move on and keep trying and quit being upset or mad that someone didn't choose you.  \n\nSo what if guys find Sydney attractive.  Guys find a lot of girls attractive.  And if a person wants to date outside of their race or not is their personal choice.  \n\nIf we just could quit judging and blaming and just work at treating eveyone how we would like to be treated, maybe the world would be a better place.   Look at how Jesus dined with tax collectors, and spoke to the women at the well... We all just need to focus on having more compassion and quit brushing people off and painting them all with the same brush.  \n\nI didn't get all the way through your video.  I was listening to over half of it as I was tackling a painting project.  My husband came in and was listening and was asking why I was listening to your video.  He especially didn't like a section where you spoke about all white men thinking a certain way.  He didn't like being cast into such a generalized us vs. them mentality that he can only be one way because he is white and male. \n\n\nI kept listening for awhile longer but the longer I listened, the more I felt there was too much us vs. them and the bias and strawman arguments were just going around in a circle without providing a clear logical framework as to why your video was the length it was.\n\nI appreciate the YouTube platform and I like to explore different points of view but I prefer clarity and consideration of the viewers time when it comes to the content creators that I will return to watch another video by.  I do have to say that I did appreciate that you didn't have background music.  I click off videos right away that talk with music in the background.",

Some of this is because I make (mostly) good choices about who i date (thanks, Mom, for giving me a model of what love actually looks like), and some of this is because I’ve done and continue to do a lot of work on myself to be able to have the skills to nurture and maintain healthy relationships. But the fact that I’ve had the *opportunities* to a) be discerning about who I date and b) do my part to take care of my dating relationships is SO much about the fact that i have desire/beauty capital. It’s pure, unearned, fucking LUCK that the people I’ve loved in my life have felt like I was worth talking to or pursuing in the first place. (As a side note, this has also benefitted me professionally.)",

I recall one of these \"therapists\"..young, same race as me, slender as I was..but she was pretty head-to-toe, and I was decidedly not (I was dehumanized for things above and below the neck). I walked in the room where she sat, took one look at her (as well as the aura of affluence that surrounded her) and walked right back out. She should have known..and I am sure she did in truth. She should have done the same thing I did after taking one look at me..acknowledge the disparity and walk away, but instead she tried to insist herself upon me, until I refused to visit that practice altogether. She was only proving what I already feared the more time she forced me to spend with her. I had to wonder if she got off on it.  \nBut individual therapists are not the only problem, it is the psychiatrization of vulnerable, disenfranchised people and trauma itself that is the overarching issue, the fact that society prefers to pathologize the response of the victim rather than persecute the role of others/society. The mental health system would rather label someone as inherently \"ill\" instead of what they really are..inevitably, irrevocably damaged and mentally distressed from their circumstances.",

I had just gotten out of a rough breakup, and my friends wanted to take me to a dance hall. I thought \"what the hell\" and went, despite not knowing how to dance, nor being confident anyone would want to dance with me. I was told, repeatedly, that my fears were unfounded, and if I asked anyone to dance that they would say yes. Friends, let me tell you how much that backfired. I had spent half an hour nursing a beer by myself, psyching myself up. I got up and went over to someone, and asked to dance with them. I was met with a stare that haunts me to this day. Not even a word. No verbal refusal necessary. That stare said to me, \"how dare you ask me that question.\" How dare I step outside my loneliness. How dare I think I was on some level equal with someone Pretty. Message received. \nMy friends, in horror, watched this happen to me. They never had this problem. they never had seen anyone have this problem, a problem I had faced all my life. They rushed to gather their cohort, and wrangled some dance partners for me for the night, but the damage was done. My soul was destroyed, in public, and not only that, I confronted my pretty friends with the reality that was my burden to bear. They never asked me to go out dancing with them again. I think it was as traumatic for them as it was for me. (thankfully, I was able to fall in love with my current partner, and never have to worry about being alone again, but that pain still aches.)",

However, I also have a baby face, so without glasses I frequently get confused for a high-schooler (I’m in my late twenties). It’s more about finding glasses that fit your face shape, if you can afford them. I really like the way my current pair look on me so much I keep getting the same frames now. Once you find a pair that works for your face and your style, it really helps! Some of my fits just don’t look right without glasses. I still prefer no glasses when wearing dresses and certain styles, but for the most part, glasses just work with everything else. \n\nBut you know these shows would prefer making these women go walking around blind than help them find a pair of frames that fits their face and style and paying for the new frames and lenses.",

It creates a perfect victim narrative where it gives people the ability to say \"I don't hate them because they're ugly but because of this problem they have,\" when really it's a combination of both that flaw AND the urge to punish them more for it because they're ugly, so they should try to be better everywhere else.",

Men live a life full of narrow mindedness because they don’t have to face the same exact obstacles others do when it comes to things like beauty standards. For girls to call themselves “average, ugly,” and other degrading terms feels harmful because they’re basing their appearance off of male centered societal norms and not human nature.

If a woman who doesn't meet that lofty standard approaches them, they take it as a personal insult and act accordingly. I believe this is because men consciously or not still see women as trophies; they want somebody who will make their buddies say, \"You da' man!\" A plain or ugly woman isn't going to help a man achieve that objective. There are men out there who have evolved and actually care more about personality and character, but not nearly enough of them, unfortunately.",

    "text": "Back in 2023, I went to a few anime conventions with a friend where we cosplayed different characters from JJK. We had pretty accurate cosplays and didn't differ much from one another in terms of props used, amount of makeup, skin cutouts, etc., but BOY was the difference in treatment from both men and other women notable. \n\nAt one of the cons, this guy with a group of friends stopped us and gushed over my friend's cosplay, saying he loved JJK, her cosplay was so cool, and that he was really excited for the next arc of the anime and the next manga chapters. His friends noticed my cosplay (a character whose appearance drastically changed/had major character development in the manga and was going to be animated soon) and kept telling him, \"hey, XYZ character is right there too!\" but he didn't want to acknowledge me. Instead, he just handed me his phone silently and made me take their photo. When I mentioned how weird that was to my friend once they'd left, she agreed that it was odd but brushed it off as him just being excited. While this could've been the case, I feel like the guy could've at least said hello to both of us (there was no way he could've only spotted her because we were walking side by side + no way he didn't recognize my cosplay because he said he read past the point where it shows up) and asked me politely for the photo, regardless of whether I'm attractive to him or not. \n\nFor another con, we went to a club after the con ended. There, my friend was surrounded by girls who'd tell her she was beautiful and gorgeous, and when they saw me next to her, they'd quickly say \"oh, you're cute/pretty too, don't worry!\" in this pitying, infantilizing tone that just made me feel bad. There was also another guy who shoved himself between me and her and handed her his phone to get her number. Though that was objectively creepy, the way he thought it was OK to push in between us (and mind you it was crowded so we were close together to begin with) and not even say \"excuse me\" to me so he could talk to my friend made me pretty annoyed and upset. \n\nI want to clarify that I'm not jealous (none of the guys or girls were my type) and have absolutely nothing against my friend here, but as someone who knows they're \"ugly\" by society's standards, I have this nagging feeling that these all wouldn't have happened/had a slimmer chance of occurring if I were considered attractive. I don't think I'm abhorrently ugly, but I know where I stand. I'm fairly confident in my abilities/accomplishments, but as others have commented, that cannot replace the sting I feel when others treat me badly because of how I look. Bullies are one thing to deal with, but I feel like friends who unintentionally downplay their \"ugly\" friends' concerns by telling them \"you just need to get over that insecurity!\" or \"omg nooo you're so beautiful!\" make the situation even worse, IMO. Perhaps this is inevitable, but the attempts to comfort just create a growing disconnect between what I'm being told by loved ones and what I receive from the greater public. I don't have a solution for what to say instead, but I just want to point out the way these things make me feel -- someone else may enjoy being told these things, and that's completely OK (and ngl probably healthier to take in stride lol). \n\nAnd of course, thank you so much for making this video, it made me feel seen.",

We have been taught for decades to value \"inner beauty\" and that it is rude to belittle the shortcomings of others, generally speaking. We are, on some level, socially expected to respond against people in our lives degrading themselves.\n\nThe other problem is that most of us have no experience or training dealing with this issue outside of the deny and affirm strategy. How do you respond when you are conversing with someone and they belittle their looks? The answer is not simple.\n\nThe final aspect of this issue that is going to complicate things further is that social media has given a lot of people a reliable outlet to seek constant positive affirmation. This reinforces the deny and affirm deflection strategy constantly. Not only are we not prepared to respond to self-deprecation with anything but positivity and gas lighting, but we are also equally prepared to massacre people who would respond to self-deprecation with, \"Well, yeah, you are/do...\"",

You also have to realize that a person's appearance and how they are perceived affects one's personal sense of identity and ability to be at peace within themselves, never mind while around others.

But at one point, I was so distraught that I screamed “I’d rather be ugly than to walk like this!”. Soon as I said that she bursts out into laughter and said “okay girl you need to stfu now, you DEFINITELY just talking now. You know damn well you don’t want to be ugly.” She thought it was so funny that she went and told almost every adult she talked to for the next week what I said, like it was a funny story about the silly things kids say.

But what really stood out to me is when not only was I in a wheelchair, but got really really ill, pale, emaciated, dark circles…ugly. When I was first in my chair people used to come up to me and ask what was wrong and pray over me and shit. It was wild, but what I didn’t realize was that was my pretty privilege. \n\nWhen I was at my sickest, people turned the other way. They’d try not to look at me. Once I got stuck in the rain with my wheelchair wheels, and just needed a boost up to the bus stop. I asked a guy for help and he looked at me, smirked, laughed and said ‘nah I’m good’. That had never happened to me in my life. I asked person after person and it was crazy how no one wanted to help me! I was offering all the cash in my purse! And this was just to go up the small incline to the bus top. Finally a young girl helped me, she was in high school, and she stayed with me till the bus came. I went home and cried. I felt so humiliated. And I was struck with the realization that I was now disabled AND ugly, and that my pretty privilege had helped me when I first became disabled and I didn’t even realize it. I felt horrified and disgusted. \n\nI’m still in a wheelchair, but I’m on the right meds (had an undiagnosed autoimmune condition on top of things), eating well, etc….and I’m treated well again. It makes me want to puke. I am now stronger and better able to get around, but people ask me if I need help all the time!!!! People go out of their way to want to help me now. It’s insane. \n\nSo, on the one hand, I’m shocked by what your mom said. On the other hand, I totally get her reaction. \n\nI can now honestly say I would rather not be ugly ever again. And I was ugly cause I was deathly ill. Once I got better and I didn’t look like a crypt keeper (see me saying that about myself?? Honestly I was just really sick!! Not my fault …and ugliness never is anyone’s fault is it) then I was treated better. Still not as well as when I was able-bodied, but leaps and bounds better than when I was ugly. \n\nYour share just reminded me of that. It’s hard to put into words the feeling. Hope it makes sense. Thanks for sharing",

You could be disabled but think you’re not. Stephen Hawking is not the only way disability exists or presents itself. It’s important to learn these things - the disability community is the only community that everyone will inevitably be a part of at some point.",

And I am confused what point you are trying to make, regarding Hawking. I know he's not considered handsome, my whole point was even if you had the option to look beautiful facially, bodily, but be paraplegic like Hawking, OR the option to be ugly but abled bodied, most people would choose the latter. So it's wrong to say being ugly is worse than being disabled, in all cases. In some cases, maybe, but it's absurd to claim, that just being ugly (while being fully abled) is always worse than being disabled.",

Would your parents not love you as much as they do? so it really is a conditional love? \nWhich i'm sure people with disabilities snear at that like...seriously?? lmao why would anyone rather have x disability??

Your nose looks good, especially since it's thin, it's fine that it has a bump and that type of tip, it looks cool and suits your face shape. I love your eyes too, even uf they're probably smaller in real life that is perfectly fine too. And them being hooded is not a bad thing, especially eyes that are mistly fully hooded look gentle and eye-catching on people on my opinion, especially with mascara. You have a naturalness and a feminine look. I know very well what it's like not to feel beautiful and how hard it is to change that, and I know just my comment (though honest) is just a comment on the internet, but genuinely, please don't worry.",

With conventional beauty, you get some privileges, but they are a double edged sword. \nSo basically no one wins in mysoginist systems, be it the pretty or the ugly women.

Another little girl I was friends with was grossed out by her weight and would talk to me about it. Not a single other girl in class had it as bad as she did for any reason. She played baseball, did dual-enrollment, earned a scholarship and went off to a great school her senior year, had a very nice and loving family. She was bullied her whole childhood but high school was better for her because there was more people her size. Then there was a pretty girl I was best friends with or something like that in high school who got all the male attention she wanted. She was dumb (on her second senior year and failing), unathletic, wasn't really too good at anything, cheated on her boyfriends, lied and stole, just liked having fun. Liked flaunting her assets any chance she got. If anything she was mistreated for how she carried herself.",

To have someone openly acknowledge what I was feeling but never allowed to express (because mentioning the way my Ugliness negatively affected me was always met with my thin, pretty friends telling me \"oh no, you're  beautiful!\") Is very healing and helps with some of the very internalized amounts of shame. \n\nI once nearly killed myself because of my Ugliness, and I have never known how to acknowledge that without it sounding stupid and vain, but my failure to meet the beauty standard lead to regular verbal abuse, denial of Healthcare, unequal treatment, and other negative outcomes that still heavily affect me to this day.

So even when I do get positive attention for my looks, I feel myself put up an internal wall because my looks are always changing anyway and the way I look is not WHO I am, and that's not what I want to be valued for. I appreciate FEELING pretty, but even when I feel pretty, I know there are people who would disagree.

There is no place in this society where I'm considered attractive unless you include being considered \"the exotic tattooed lady\". But that comes with not getting asked out on a date. Only hookups. I'm not pretty enough to be taken out in public or introduced to friends or family. One man told me this:\"Heather, I could never have you as my girlfriend because I can't take you around my friends or church friends\". That is a direct quote. Thank you for addressing the gaslighting aspect. In person I'm never told I'm beautiful but online men try to tell me that (when I used to be online) I'm beautiful all the time. In fact the first time I was ever called beautiful was by a gorgeous man online. Long story short he was a romance scammer and I ended up filing for bankruptcy. Before I stopped engaging with the online community if a man gave me a compliment I would stop him & say: Stop. Don't lie to me. I look in the mirror everyday and I know what I look like. At this point being called pretty in any way is a traumatizing red flag and a clear sign of manipulation. Anyway, I really hope this gets picked up (unchanged) by a platform even bigger than YouTube. It is such a well done & honest film. I can't thank you enough for making it. ❤️",

People were just generally rude and dismissive to me. I'm lucky enough that I grew up before that incel nonsense. But the idea of pretty people having advantages over ugly people definitely crossed my mind.\n\nNow I'm 28 & definitely glowed up, (also I learned how to dress and groom myself) I get compliments pretty regularly, and they started around the time 'tall dark and african' started to be appreciated within modelling. People definitely treat me way better nowadays. I literally got invited to an art gallery because 2 artists stopped me on the street and wanted to take pictures of me. (ironically, they ended up not using the pics cause I didn't come out good) If I was ugly that encounter would just be a shower fantasy. I 100% notice the default respect a lot of people give me, compared to before I glowed up and I'm still the same awkward, dweebie and lanky mf I was before.\n\nI could point at the world and be like \"all of you are a bunch of stinky hypocrites\" but I just don't really feel anyway about this. I do think the people who went out of their way to insult me are lame as fuck, but I'm also glad I'm not considered unattractive anymore, so I'm not really any better than them.",

Right now especially people want to pretend that covid and health are fully in their control so there is a painful avoidance. I have some chronically ill friends who are literally models who have had no or almost no visitors too. \n\nThe biggest thing is not letting the way people treat you as 'ugly' make you hate yourself. In therapy i mourned my ugliness - not because i see myself as ugly but because I had to accept how that factors into how i am treated.

I still do often for myself but it comes with being a target now for other types of judgement.",

        "text": "@olurinatti Thanks I did finish it! Fantastic work as always! Thank you so much for making this video. I 'knew' I was ugly since I was a kid but I had gotten in trouble for expressing it and was gas lit so much I assumed that the events that I faced were some other failure of mine. I have wasted so much time ruminating trying to fix things, believing people who lied to me about this... (many of which turned out to not have my best interest in mind at all and this was a first sign that I wish I had realized).  I instead assumed there was some other way I was being wrong being deserving of such treatment.  All the 'how to make friends and influence people' self help books don't account for if you are ugly. This has awakened a new self awareness for me and I appreciate that truly! I used to joke that my dog had pretty privilege but I legit think that she has acted like a shield for my ugly curse when I take her to the farmers market etc. people are so kind. Cosplay as well has been such a lovely escape for me from all the isms including the ugly one. Dressing as a beast gets me treated more human lol. Thanks for spreading this awareness, its greatly needed. I hope we can all be more honest with each other and ourselves.",

This video touches on a lot of things I've experienced when I was overweight - never being picked, never being looked at, never being heard, feeling like I have to apologise for the weight I was carrying and just for existing. Being ugly is definitely a handicap in this society. It's soul crushing. And when I opened up to some people and shared my experiences, all I got was \"no, that's silly, you're attractive\" and we played this little game where all of us pretended we don't HAVE EYES xD as acknowledging my experience would cause a rip in time-space continuum. After losing the weight, I had a hard time figuring out how to respond to the attention and privilege. Also, the same people who looked at me with disgust before, later looked at me like a goddess, and it felt nasty and disingenuous and that messes you up even more especially after BEING ugly and EXPERIENCING the full weight of ugly experience",

It is not uncommon for women to be hired as actresses, it is/ was uncommon for them to have the shows they wrote greenlit, and for them to star in said show, and for them to be 24 at the time. Maybe overall it was a good thing, who knows, but it would have been a slap in the face to every women who hadn’t even been able to get through the door to try and get a show greenlit. (Notoriously difficult to do, you basically HAVE to have connections)\n\nSaying support shows made by poc people when we are talking about 2012 where there were almost none is disingenuous. Streaming was not a thing then, there was limited air time so competition was much higher than it is now. \n\nThis is the equivalent of saying “almost every ceo is man, but don’t talk about that, instead focus on that one lady over there and give her all your support even as you are bypassed for the positions for on your own career for men with less experience.” You are advocating not for making space but rather for being grateful for the limited space provided. This pits woman against each other, which I agree is not helpful, but it is also not helpful when the woman who make it through the door make very little effort to support those who did not.",

Let's not lie to ourselves. \n\nWhat society should rather focus on is taking away the taboo out of ugliness and treating ugly or below average (but not quite ugly) people with kindness and just as worthy. We as humans should be able to just exist as being mid or ugly, etc. without feeling lesser than. Our attractiveness shouldn't be the utmost value that brands us as individuals. To get to that point, we'd have to grow a lot spiritually. However, we're very far away, and are even regressing in that aspect.",

It’s the biggest reason why attractiveness is partly constructed because you are influenced by broader society, what you personally find beautiful, what people of your race/ethic group finds beautiful, etc etc. At one point in time, even women such as Olay were considered “unpleasant” to look at. Especially during the slave trade. Simply because of her Blackness. Another example is people of Asian descent were largely considered unpleasant to look at in Western society until very recently. I’m sure many Asian people can attest to this. Even capital B beauty will change based on where you are location the world.",

I went from being able to date Whoever I wanted to constantly being overlooked. I would get comments like what are you mixed with and shock or horror at my response that I  wasn’t. Because to be black is to be ugly to A LOT of nonblack people. I remember having biracial friends who would always throw in that they were biracial when talking to guys and it always felt so awkward and forced but I learned that they were doing it as a way to differentiate themselves.

Of course I realize by making this comment I'm probably playing into the lookism this video talks about, but I think our definition of \"beauty\" is too narrow, for example, I don't consider Lena Dunham \"ugly\"...just because somebody doesn't look like a cast member of \"Love Island\" doesn't make them ugly. Probably was more of a case of being intimidated to approach you because you're attractive, or maybe being nervous about public/family perception being in an interracial relationship (which seems ludicrous in the 21st century, but it's still a thing).",

When I was cleared to travel  back home I remember seeing the faces of people looking at my face covered in scaring that was still healing. It was what I had been running from as an anorexic bulimic over exercising obsessed with body image, my own and other bodies. I was in the fight “to be attractive or not be unattractive”. For six months as the scarring healed I had to face my own fears around being unattractive, undesirable. It changed how I saw myself BUT it wasn’t a cure all. I continued for many more years being body obsessed “to be attractive”. \nThank you again for a great conversation.",

Not just by centering Lena (I think she’s beautiful but I agree fully with your analysis) but also centering parts of life that are sometimes darker or sadder. Failed relationships. Mental health struggles. Career trajectories where people move one step forward two steps back. The disabled and the elderly. It showed a mirror on parts of life that most people try to hide. It’s probably one of the best shows I’ve ever seen with very few misses, truly amazing that it was written by someone in their mid 20s. I love that you mention Lizzo too, I think she’s such a powerhouse for creating such a positive message even if she’s internalized fat phobia. We’re turning all the way back to the 90s right now with Ozempic and it’s looking pretty scary for those of us who went through it the first time.",

    "text": "As someone who has been called ugly my whole life in part due to being visibly disabled, yes to all of this. I have trauma from people pretending they wanted to date me and then going psych! \n\nAnd it's no coincidence that ugliness is considered a monstrosity. Monstrosity is frequently used to equate how someone looks to their humanity- the more monstrous someone is, the less human or less moral they are considered. \n\nDisability studies goes into detail with how the christian church prior to the crusades told people that to be ugly was to be immoral and bad. Disabled people were kept on the brink of starvation and used as a bridge to help the white, non disabled church members as a path into heaven. Using pity as dehumanization. We have written documentation of this, it's horrific. \n\nSo ugliness epecially includes a structural hatred of visible disabilities, certain ethnic features (distinct and non ambiguous although it varies over trend cycles), \ncolorism and anti -Blackness, fatness, one's ability to fit into the gender binary, and even sex workers (often called ugly after a transaction is done). \n\neven expected measurements like chest, muscles, and butt are a factor. I've been told the only reason i deserve to live are my boobs or that it's a shame such boobs are on such an ugly person. And that's not uncommon, sadly.",

    "text": "Your explanation around epistemic injustice hit close to home for me, I grew up fat (mainly due to a thyroid disorder that left my weight being something outside of my control), when I was 12 my aunt and mom had decided I should go to a fat camp, while there I was singled out by older girls and bullied. \n\nA 15 year old boy who was also at the camp sexually assaulted me (it was a relatively minor incident but it impacted me greatly), that evening I tried to open up to the girls who I was sharing a room with, I told them what happened and rather than comforting me or listening to what I had to say their first response was \"Yeah right! you wish\" and mocked me for something they assumed I must've made up.\nI frequently felt alone around that age and that moment was just another moment that showed me that other people believed I deserved my suffering or that my suffering didn't matter.\n\nThat incident established in my young mind that if something bad happened to me I would not be believed, and I wish I could say that it was a singular incident but these things have happened at different times in my life over and over again. \nI'm not ugly, nor am I pretty, but I've always had to deal with weight struggles and as a teenager had bad acne, when people see you as ugly you are inherently dehumanized, you're not worthy of care, love, trust or consideration.\nBut I'm also white, blonde, blue-eyed, generally symmetrical facial features, fat girl 'pretty face' basically, and depending on what people I'm around they may perceive me as ugly or they may perceive me as pretty.. That was very hard to navigate when I was a teenager and young adult, I'm now 31 and it's finally become less relevant in my life as a marker of my value as a person but my experiences have made me incredibly aware of the privileges I and other people do or do not have.",

Beauty is endless social climbing-rendered particularly arduous by the fact that, in our society, the terms that confer membership in the aristocracy of beauty keep changing. At the top of the hierarchy are \"stars\" who monopolize the right to launch a new insolent idea of beauty— which is then taken up and imitated by large numbers of people.”",

What is really hitting home for me is the distinction between being subjectively \"pretty/ugly\", based on how your looks are precived  by people in the room, versus being \"Pretty/Ugly\" based on the structural forces of society that impact material conditions.\n\nIt's this distinction that is never talked about. People refuse to acknowledge that being Ugly with a capital \"U\", does not mean you do not believe in your own beauty, all it means is that under a structure of beauty rooted in \"white patriarchy capitalism\" you are not the standard, and not being the standard has real material impacts on your life depending on how far away you are removed from the precived standard.\n\nIt's hard for people who are considered (p)retty to sit with the fact that they live in a lookist culture which they benefit from. And it's also a challenge for everyone else to accept that beauty is closely tied to \"morality\" and \"respectabilty politics\" in which people chose who is worthy of human dignity and who isn't.",

I'm white and I think my features are probably...average (?) by the conventional beauty standard, but I'm short and put on weight easily. When I was 18 I lost a lot of weight very suddenly and it genuinely SHOCKED me how people began treating me. I'd been a weird artsy girl who never had many friends or ever had a boyfriend/girlfriend, and suddenly there were dudes wanting to ask me out b/c I...looked pretty? It honestly creeped me out so much and I really didn't like it, but I was so happy to wear smaller sizes and have a body that looked \"chic\" in clothes. After college my lifestyle changed and I slowly gained weight, and the way I steadily became more and more invisible to people again shocked me. And people perceived me differently! While thin, I was \"smart\"; once fat, I was \"intimidating.\" Suddenly I wondered if the (usually) thin attractive white women who befriended me did so b/c they wanted someone to make them look better, or b/c they actually liked me. It's honestly so depressing how it's constantly happening but no one will admit it, or if they do, they act like it's totally normal and appropriate.",

The person we are meant to root for is usually pretty and/or good looking even if they are non-humans. And the villain / antagonist / person we are meant to hate or dislike is usually ugly or undesirable. So what does that say? \n\nAnd in some media it could be a commentary (or highlights the hypocrisy) like Wicked or The Hunchback of Notre Dame but let's be serious those are rare compared to the many.

I was in an online leftist queer group once where we were having this discourse, and at least half of them argued that there's no such thing — pretty privilege to them was just an amalgamation of classism, colorism, patriarchy, and sizeism. But it's easy to imagine that between any two people of the exact same race, class, body type, and gender expression, the more conventionally attractive one is going to be treated better every time. I think that's pretty damning evidence that this issue is systemic.",
