The China Cables leaks proved that things as simple as closing your restaurant during Ramadan or growing a beard can lead to you being imprisoned in the camps without trial. I am in no way supporting what the US is trying to do in Xinjiang, but at the same time we should not be so naive and think that the Chinese government only wants to fight terrorism. They want to destroy Islamic culture and the beliefs of the Muslim population in China. While as an Atheist I am not a big fan of many of the teachings of Islam, everyone should be free to believe whatever they want. The Chinese government is destroying this fundamental human right.",
