hello folks welcome back to our reading guide of vladimir lenin's state and revolution today we will be covering chapter four parts one two and three lenin here is going to be talking about what ingalls has to say about social democracy anarchism in the paris commune chapter three was what marx had to say a lot about a lot of these things and hearing uh lenin's gonna be talking about the specifics of what should be done with the state and the specifics of what makes marx's thought different from uh the thoughts of of anarchist thinkers and of social democrats and how people at the at the time when lenin is writing this are distorting these views because as i try and bring up every time lenin is writing this for the context of the of the russian revolution so some of the things he's going to talk about here are going to be specific but most of it is is still very applicable so uh the first part is called the housing question and this is um taking from a work by ingles called the housing question and and lenin basically finds the most important parts as they relate to the state and what needs to be done with the state so ingles says that housing right now is or at his time was controlled by the market supply and demand same same thing as today but post-revolution um one of the very first steps of the workers will be to seize the housing and distribute it to everybody um so there's more you know today this is fast forwarding to modern day there's more empty houses than there are there's more yeah than there are homeless people right so why can't you move the homeless people into the empty houses it seems like common sense well because housing is determined by supply and demand if you allowed homeless people to live in houses for free or for cheap then landlords wouldn't be able to make a profit off housing and you would have to eliminate landlords completely which is exactly what ingles is saying needs to be done in order to transfer housing from the landlord class to the working class you need the state you need the state to take it uh seize um housing from the landlords and transition it to the proletariat and this is the the job of state power after the workers revolution um and and so right now the state functions as a tool of the landlords right so if you don't pay your rent the landlord will take you to court the court is a bureaucracy or a function of the state and and if you still don't leave your house after the court rules that you have to leave your house the police will come and forcibly force you to leave your house enforcing private property rights so you see how police and the courts and the state serve as a tool of the landlord right to to enforce private property rights if you don't pay your rent to the landlord the state will come and kick you out of your house because that house belongs to the landlord under the laws of capitalism as we move to socialism the state will be needed to take the houses um and nationalize them and take them from the hands of the landlords and move them into the hands of the working class and landlords can get houses too they're just not allowed to profit off of housing um because that makes no sense um so this is a change in the function of the state um so state power is needed i've already talked about that and and then ingles talks about how the state will be needed too to collect like rent during the transitionary phase so ultimately we want to get to communism right this phase where there's no exchange value where there's no commodity form you know where money isn't this ultimate commodity that we all chase after because it can be exchanged for any other commodity but you can't eliminate money on day one of the revolution so there are going to be workers who work on houses not landlords who profit from from housing and who collect 50 of your paycheck at the end of every month for sitting on their butt but the workers who maintain the housing and build the housing you know a small amount of rent will need to be collected um by by the state in order to make sure those workers are well paid it's going to be way way cheaper once you eliminate the profit of landlords but but since exchange value still exists you're going to need the state to serve this administrative function in the transition period from socialism to communism so lenin says a lot of people ignore ingalls quotes in this chapter that lenin's using about um about the transitionary phase um and a lot of people at the time are distorting angles and calling him an anarchist they're saying look ingalls talks about the withering of the state ingalls very clearly says his ultimate goal is the abolition of the state therefore ingalls is an anarchist and he doesn't want us to see state power lenin is saying no ingalls is saying right here you need this is an example of engel saying you need state power to first transition um or to transition the ownership of housing from the bourgeoisie bourgeoisie to the proletariat and landlords are just a really easy example to think about and lenin says that sock dems social democrats are distorting marx and ingles at the time so we can't specifically see where they deferred from anarchists because like i said this is happening in revolutionary russia so they've had the revolution and they're like what do we do now so lennon's laying out exactly this is what mark said ingles said and the social democrats are saying you know marx and ingles are anarchists don't listen to them they just want to abolish the state right we need to keep the state and slowly move the state so it's more um more beneficial for workers you know that's what social democracy is we'll just go vote every year and slowly workers will gain more power through the state and more protections and the state will start to protect labor lenin's saying no that's not what marx and angles are i mean marks and angles are very clear you need to see state power and use it for the transition of the means of production from the bourgeoisie to the proletariat so that's the end of part one and uh now we'll move on to part two so now moving on to part two uh the critique of anarchism and i know a lot of anarchists really dislike this part of the chapter because they think it uh distorts what anarchism actually is so just keep that in mind um but i'm just gonna read what lenin and marx and engle say here um and you can talk to an anarchist about their beefs with this chapter if you want to know what they are um but i am not an anarchist so so in 1973 marx and engels have a polemic against anarchists prudonis or anti-authoritarians right people who are averse to authority um and are nervous about the state having too much power so marx says anarchists are overly critical of political action and seizures of power he says workers commit the terrible crime of outraging principle to satisfy their needs so marx is saying anarchists look at the workers looking to see state power and they say no this is too authoritarian stop it and marx is saying no this is what needs to happen the workers are exploited hungry some of them are homeless they need to seize state power even though it takes authority you know they're seizing power and authority to do so and and use it to satisfy their needs um because they're living in relative misery right now because capitalism is a system which leaves the masses in misery and state power is necessary to change that so lenin says marx and anarchists both have the same goal they both want to abolish the state but marx recognizes that workers must first use the organized force that is the state to abolish class and bourgeois oppression basically what we were talking about in the last chapter the the workers need to seize the state and use it to transfer the means of production marx is very clear that he agrees with anarchists except for when they want workers to lay down arms after the revolution marx says the revolution must first defend itself and dismantle the instruments of bourgeois oppression before the state is withered so you have a lot of marxist leninist states that have come into existence and uh we talk about this a lot they develop these militaries and state bureaucracy but globally you know the bourgeoisie bourgeoisie has continued to oppress these countries right um most recent example i can think of because i was writing about it earlier today is bolivia bolivia controlled state power um but there's still a bourgeoisie existing within the country you know in a far-right fascist dictatorship seize power with the backing of the west right you need to hang on to state power and there are things you're going to need to do after the revolution to defend yourselves to ensure the transfer of um the means of production to workers in the in the movement to socialism and what we've seen is you know socialism in one country hasn't necessarily been able to do this right the state hasn't hasn't started to wither and the protect and to protect themselves from the ruling or from the capitalist class um they've had to do a lot of things they've had to really centralize power you know and in places like the soviet union and and even in china there were a lot of excesses as far as like who was purged and whatnot so um yeah just thought there's me being an anarchist and critiquing this a little bit but i still definitely think workers need to seize state power and i think bolivia is doing the right thing um and even bolivia is not marxist-leninist they do things through voting but but anyways so uh the the the workers after they seize the state need to use the state to defend themselves from from bourgeois counter revolution and dismantle the instruments of bourgeois oppression so ingles said that prudonas have a dogmatic aversion to authority ingles says to imagine a vessel at sea and a vessel at sea needs some kind of authority to function right you need like a captain telling his workers what to do you know organization is needed to make things function you know and some form of authority is going to be needed uh marx and engels there's a misconception that they wanted full equality that they had an aversion to authority that's not what they said they they recognize that some form of authority and management are needed um it's the exploitation and the using of surplus value for the enrichment of a minority that isn't needed and and the allowing of that minority to determine what humans do with uh what is produced by human labor that is wrong you know there's nothing wrong with minor authority and i think of this you know as far as wrestling um in terms of wrestling you know everyone knows i wrestle and in wrestling you need a coach you know i'm coaching now i transition from being a wrestler to a coach and it's um it is a authority in a sense but you need coaches right you need people to make sure that the team keeps functioning and that everything's going going according to plan this doesn't mean the coach should have authority to kill you or throw you in jail for a minor crime right they're there to protect you to help you to help the whole organize organization that is the team flourish um you know and that could be considered a form of authority so this pathological aversion to authority doesn't make any sense according to ingalls and according to me um so ingles says that authority is relative to the existing social system so some forms of authority are inevitable and still will still be needed and socialism or communism he says the anti-authoritarians want to abolish the state before abolishing the social relations which caused the state to come about in the first place right so the state only emerges once society is cleaved into classes and you have one or you know one group of exploiters and one group of exploited and then you need a state in between them to keep the exploited in their place make sure they keep working for the enrichment of the exploiters this is when the state emerges so until you get rid of that relationship of exploited and exploiters you can't fully start to dissolve the state um so let engel says the first goal of revolution shouldn't be to abolish authority right it shouldn't be like we had our revolution let's get rid of all authority on day one right it should be to meet the needs of the workers make sure people have education make sure people are fed make sure people have housing and then you know begin the withering of the state but all this stuff is paid for through nationalization of industry right and people have this idea with the withering of the state like it's supposed to happen like that you know it's supposed to happen overnight i mean 1917 was when we got the first socialist experiment in history in the ussr so countries have been working on this and battling the global bourgeoisie and no country successfully withered their state apparatus yet but that doesn't mean it can't happen and that doesn't mean the countries who who establish socialism like cuba vietnam um china haven't been battling you know the global bourgeoisie the global capitalist class who seeks to destroy everything they're trying to do and privatize everything so that free market or yeah private capitalists can reap the rewards um so yeah the first goal shouldn't be to abolish authority it should be to meet the needs of the workers and defeat the bourgeois bourgeoisie and then revolutions themselves are one class claiming authority over another right right now the ruling class is the capitalist class the the proletariat needs to claim authority over that class and crush it so we only have one class um so it's the revolution itself is authoritari authoritarian right in a way um in that right now all authority is in the hands of the bourgeoisie and after the revolution the authority will be moved into the hand of the proletariat until we can move to a society without those classes existing at all and then wither the state um lenin says social democrats at the time would recognize the state well uh well anarchists don't um oh yeah social democrats at the same time were saying we recognize the state exists while anarchists don't even recognize the state exists at all and that's the difference and uh lenin is saying this is a strong man of anarchist ideas but marks and let angles actually engage with anarchist ideas um and they offer an alternative right social democrats are saying you guys ignore the state we pay attention to the state you need a slow transition to socialism uh anarchists are saying no just abolish the state marxists are saying no see state power and use it to transfer the means of production uh from the hands of the ruling class into the hands of the workers all right so that's the end of part two let's do part three so part three is called letter to bevel i think beeble bevel b-e-b-e-l i don't know i read these things i don't listen to them actually the first time i listened to this it was a book on tape so maybe i should remember this dude's name how it's pronounced but anyways engel's letter here is critiquing the gotha program and that might sound familiar critique of the gotha program because that is one of march's most famous works so if you want more on this idea read critique of the gotha program it's a great book one of the foundational marxist texts um but this is ingles letter to this guy bevel biebel baboo critiquing the gotha program um so the gothic program said there can be a people's free state right you can have a state that works at the behest of the people um and lenin says there can be no people's free state the state is needed to crush reactionaries and must be withered afterwards if people are truly going to be free there can be no power with the monopoly on violence if people are actually free right because then they're subservient to that power with the monopoly on violence so the state needs to be withered our goal shouldn't be a people's free state our goal should be a stateless classless society according to engels the goal always needs to be the abolition of the state and engel says the party shouldn't use the term people's free state as a goal but instead he suggests a different german word meaning community which is basically what i just said um so the state defends a minority and ensures the exploitation of the majority and the end goal of communism is to have no exploiters and no exploited so therefore you don't need a state when you no longer need to hold the exploited in check for the enrichment of the exploiters the apparatus which does so is no longer needed and the debate going on between anarchists and social democrats at the time anarchists are saying we need no state social democrats are saying we need a people state and marx angles and lenin are saying no you're both wrong we need to seize the state and wither and that's basically it for chapter three i mean for part three part three is real short so yeah there's chapter fours part one two and three i hope you guys enjoyed that i hope it gave you a good recap um please leave your comments below i'll try to get to as many questions as i can um and i'm gonna still go start working on parts four five and six just kidding i'm probably gonna take a shower and then go do some other stuff but four five and six will hopefully be coming real soon all right thanks for watching everyone peace [Music] do [Applause] you
