now is the next uh little segment that we got we've got Eddie lier Smith is on the line he's about to pop right in here uh here he comes look out there he is Yo oh [ __ ] what's up HK honk honk honk yo I'm not sure got him yes I made it thanks to Chris's persistence um how do I check I have like the fisheye effect going on here how do I I actually I kind of like it look like you're about to do some you GNA do some Parkour well this is cool I can oh man it's good to see you man I'm glad that you came on you too yeah thanks for having me Eddie liger Smith he's built like a brick [ __ ] house he's one of the only Communists in the midwest doing his thing uh I really like all the stuff you put out and I like a a lot of this organization at the midwestern marks you guys are kicking ass taking names doing a lot in that part of the world to spread what we know is the next logical step in our Evolution as economics in the United States how are we going to get out of the mess we're in the three of us at least agree with that and we're all three dog lovers how about that there you go fair fair I've been thinking about getting one lately I don't know it's a little bit of a a financial and a time commitment but ever since I lost my parents dog I'm like really tempted I saw that well keep in mind Eddie you know that the the shelters are full of sweet little furry little babies [Laughter] how you doing man are you hanging in good yeah doing good been busy as crap lately but um I like it that way that's how I prefer to live my life um in general and it's exciting with all the stuff that's been going on lately um but yeah yeah how about you guys we're hanging in hanging in doing this show trying to not go crazy but you know I don't know if we're organizing like you are you're actually out there doing events now you you guys were at some fancy look like you were at the Hilton ballroom or something giving some kind a talk I was like damn moving on up yeah our buddies have uh it's actually like a music studio they um usually they like rent it out to bands that can come and play but the people who own it are communists and um we've become good friends with them so we'll have another event at the end of August in that same place and then um yeah I I love doing that stuff man that gives me more hope than anything like um for so long I was just doing the Tik Tock and doing Midwestern marks and and doing the online stuff but now that we've started doing these conferences and and really organizing people on the ground like we're getting to see the fruits of our labor we're getting to see all these young people who have uh been pulled out of the capitalist brainwashing and have come to see the truth and now are ready to fight back against the system so like you meet these kids and you talk to him like there's this one kid named Arturo who's 18 um got into Midwestern marks and like infrared and some other communist groups and now he's going into the trades he's um he's going to be uh he's doing his apprenticeship right now um and he's going to be a you know a full-fledged communist going into the trades and trying to organize industrial blue collar workers which is the work that needs to be done so to see people like that and to know that we're having you know any kind of influence on them is has got me like more hopeful than ever right now so we'll get into the spicy bit here in a second but I also wanted to ask you about ACP what's going on you got people picking up garbage everywhere and [ __ ] the [ __ ] looks good man looks good what's going on yeah thank you I mean I know there's there's so much skepticism about ACP and you know there's there's the the stupid smears that you're you always get but there's legitimate um don't we know it right yeah yeah we're all aware of that being in this online space but um there's uh there's also legitimate criticisms there's legitimate worry and like you can't blame people for that like you know for one Jackson and hos have said dumb stuff I agree so there's that angle but then there's also you know there's been no real Communist party in this country for so long you know uh doing the work that so many people think needs to be done so I understand why people are um are skeptical so so the way to win their trust is to prove it prove it through the work right nobody can argue with cleaning brigades going up and cleaning up different places around America nobody can trash that or say that's fascist or whatever so right that's what we're doing right now just trying to build people's trust we've processed over 200 people um over over 200 applicants those are the ones we've accepted we've processed more than that but um accepted over 200 people into the party there are many more applicants that are waiting um right now the focus is those cleaning brigades just having people go up and and clean up their their city or their beaches or areas near them but I'm going to be moving on to bigger and better stuff uh very soon that's cool so we're looking we gota we gotta go up to the working class first right is that the case look I'm not I don't throw the Communist label on myself right away because I'm I like to ride the fence until my balls hurt I told Mike that uh but he's a communist right Mike you're communist yeah I mean as much as you can be in the US I identify as Marxist leninist I'll put it that way well what's the can you guys tell me what's your affiliation I know everybody's either a this or a that what do you guys what's the labels you guys want to anarco kind of what is it marchus leninist with yeah they would not they would not be in Arco any okay I don't know I have no I am just a human being that's all I can really figure out for sure but honestly I'm with you guys obviously I think it's the only logical thing really I I want to see environment environment degradation you know working class get rid of the billionaires what do you got what do you think about China Eddie I know that I talk to Mike all the time we talk about China China's whipping everybody's behind pretty much every metric that you can name I wrote a article this week said socialists are beating socialist countries outpacing the US in everything from GDP to IQ and this is totally [ __ ] true you know yeah um what do you think what do you think about China I'm in full agreement I'm a big supporter of China um I think China is the most the most advanced country on Earth and you know the the Chinese themselves would reject that label a lot of them would because they're very humble but um they're kicking our ass in everything like you said and it's all you know people try to play this game or they're like well everything good about China is because of capitalism it's like no everything good about China is because of central economic planning look at how their system works and yes you know they were trying to develop socialism in one country in a world that was dominated by European and American capitalism so they opened up their borders to foreign investment but it's never been you know like neoliberal just let the corporations do what they want um the market rules all there's always been what they call the visible hand so they allow in the market with this invisible hand you know um of the of the corporate um of corporate interest but that is always under the control of the visible hand which means the Party U which means you know these these corporations were only allowed to invest in special um zones special Geographic areas as determined by the party and the central economic plan and by the the Chinese people ultimately um and they have to play by the the rules they have to you know everything that they they do uh the party is ensuring that it's it's um going towards the the development of the society as a whole which is why we you know our our economy as it develops it gets increasingly parasitic our working class Falls further into debt while the richest people in society um are the ones trapping us all in debt um and and making most of their money through interest payments whereas in China they actually have this massive manufacturing base and that's due to um Central economic planning so there's a lot to learn from them and you know I get why people like Michael parenti were skeptical of China in the 90s which in China they call the wild 90s because that's you know um a decade after they had allowed foreign capital in and and um they knew this would happen when they went ahead with the reform and opening up policy but it increased corruption it increased consumerism it increased Petty Bor ideology among the people so these were things that need to be needed to be combed and with the fall of the Soviet Union in the 90s and and China moving in in that direction going through this wild period trying to get a rain on on the global Capital they had allowed in it did kind of look like you know maybe the era of socialism was over maybe we weren't moving towards this you know Global communism or Global socialism but then in the the 2000s you see China launch their their um an poverty alleviation efforts for one and two you see them launch their anti-corruption efforts which have made Xian ping a hero they've essenti you know public trust in in the Communist party was lower than it had ever been um and they rooted out corporate influence from the party they they you know executed billionaires and and purged all these people from the party who were corrupt and it's really really changed the uh the uh the you know there the the public trust in the party among the Chinese people is now at an alltime high it's like over 90% of Chinese people support their government and even more support um the party and it it's done all this great stuff to lift the the lower class or the working masses in China um out of poverty and they've really taken on the mantle of the Soviet Union um as this leading Global socialist power now they're not as their their foreign policy is based on um cooperation and mutual development so basically they'll trade with anyone whereas the Soviet Union was basically like we're going to trade with socialist countries and and neutral countries but you know we're we're making no no excuses we're backing our allies and and like if there's a Revolution going on in a country the Soviet Union was going to back the Revolutionary forces materially um and ideologically China doesn't do that China says we're not going to get involved in your politics we'll trade with you we'll help you develop um but we're just going to do our own thing and continue developing but still um they they serve as this example um of what socialism can do and as this country um standing against uh NATO and and the US dominated Global Financial system and that change in China's policy and in their constitution has been reflected in NATO policy towards China because um ever since Kissinger opened up relations you know the the US was friendly with China they liked China they they enjoyed China in the '90s during the wild 90s because they were making money there but then once China makes this shift towards you know more traditional um communist policy and and anti-corruption and um all these different you know socialist uh efforts now all of a sudden NATO is saying that um China is our biggest threat going forward China needs to be destroyed we need to encircle China around the South China Sea uh all this so um I'm very very pro-china and I I'm very encouraged by what they are doing and you know they're not getting involved backing I have a package at the door I'm going to go grab that but they're not getting involved backing revolutionary movements around the world but what they are doing is helping all these countries develop they're basically doing what the US did for Europe after World War II with the Marshall Plan helping them develop their industrial base so all these countries who have been prevented uh from developing by the US for years due to imperialism um and IMF and World Bank infiltration they're now developing industry they're now developing their economies which kind of allows them to move forward out of feudalism and into capitalism creating the possibility for socialism so I very encouraged by the the the growth of multipolarity as well as the growth of socialist China longe get your package uh yeah I I really think that uh competition like they always say is competition is so great because then the consumer wins well when it's competition among uh imperialist entities uh the people will win because the people will end up getting a a more balanced world not uh just America vampiric sucking the blood out of every country that's not big enough to defend itself right um yeah uh well let's keep it spicy here you know what uh we got some beef to squash let's get over let's let's do this you're GNA you be hard to uh that's fantastic like that you're not going to find much disagreement with me and any of the um like even the most hardcore like magga communist people who are like I don't know what would you call like Pat Soxs who like proudly identify as patriotic socialists uh when it comes to like Foreign Affairs or like US foreign policy or supporting existing socialist countries like we're I think pretty much in lock step um and I think now even it's harder and harder to find some of the mega cols who are openly homophobic or doing any of the stuff that I disagreed with them about a couple years ago when they first started to come on the scene and my interpretation of that is that I assume that like at some point during the formation of the ACP maybe there was some kind of memo that went out like all the meacoms got together and said look let's just stop doing that publicly because it's a really bad look um keep it to the private discords or whatever you're going to do like the inner circles but like stop doing it in screenshot sharable ways that will get us outed because it's a bad [ __ ] look and I get it and I appreciate it I just hope that that's born out of like a genuine care and it's not just like cynically motivated for like PR reasons y That's um sorry I'm taking notes right now to I can respond to all your points but yeah it's um it's something that like because we used to not work with like I have always been a fan of H Alan's streams I've always just enjoyed watching him even the debates where he's just screaming at leftists um I found to be amusing um but we never worked with infrared publicly and I publicly came out against the magga communism strategy I made videos criticizing it um and that was the the reason and I've explained this to H the reason behind that was because of a lot not because of Lies per se but because of real things that were being tweeted out by people in the community which you know were then obviously associated with hos because they were his people or real things that hos and Jackson said that were maybe clipped out of context and and posted all over Twitter but it was still real things that they said like Jackson saying he's all about the cloud or or whatever so um that that development towards more professionalism is something that happened naturally um as H started to get more of a community and he is dedicated to Marxism leninism and the class struggle he realized he couldn't just be a barbarian you know and and scream at people and and just be you know trigger people because it's funny or or be a troll because it's funny like you really need more professionalism if you're going to be any kind of leader and and when you act that way especially when you act super hostile towards people and mock people and treat them like idiots you create enemies and you know at first H and he's told me this at first H's attitude was I don't give a [ __ ] these people are stupid anyways but he realized that for one people can change people can grow people aren't stuck in their their ways um and and two when you do that you create people like Johnny socialism I don't know if you're aware of him but he's someone who got on the wrong side of infrared and now if you look at his page all he's talked about for the last three years has been Midwestern marks infrared trying to say that we're feds um doxing our members um basically just you know he's he's a full-time hater so when you treat people like [ __ ] you turn people into full-time haters so hops had this sort of natural progression towards professionalism and I don't want to over State the influence that myself and Midwestern marks had on him although there definitely is I will say that like we reached out and started having meetings with ha behind the scenes basically saying dude your theory is great we we're totally in agreement with you on you know the Marxism leninism but um some of the things aesthetically and optically um we not um is are the reason that we haven't associated with you and we've noticed that he was moving away from those things anyways he was already moving away from the divisive rhetoric and and starting [ __ ] that didn't need to be started um so that's why we decided to have a meeting and then we made this point clear to him um and since then the level of professionalism from him and Jackson has just um gone through the roof and I there have been direct directives from H to his community like when certain posts are made that you know are bad optically or offensive um he'll go into the Discord and scold people for posting stuff like that um he's emphasized the need for professionalism and and um and uh sort of naturally you know as someone who's been very close to the infrared Community for a long time the people who were more reactionary um and who you know weren't actually Communists and weren't actually based in Marxist leninist values they kind of turned on H and left like oh you're just like one of these um gay leids now or whatever and left the left the guilty right but then the the the nail in the coffin for that you know the old way that the magga Communist infed Community used to be was the founding of ACP because um we wanted to be clear that the ACP is supposed to be a party for the people that runs on Democratic centralism right just because the me or members of the party have social media accounts or or leaders in the party of social media accounts doesn't mean that has anything to do with the party so magga communism by example has nothing to do with the American Communist party and now when H reflects on the magga communism strategy he says you know it wasn't a theory it wasn't saying we should be magga Communists instead of marxist leninist it was just saying let's reach out to workingclass Trump people um let's he he said it was basically a meme a meme to get working-class Trump people interested in communism which you know a lot of people took it to be these magga Communists are just fascist reactionaries their theory is you know let's go vote for Trump and support because he's communist um and that's not what it was it was let's reach the working class Trump people but but now that theory is not even a part of what the infrared Community talks about and it has nothing to do with the the ACP even though I you know I still think it is an if you're talking to a trump person and you want to tell them you're maggot communist go for it there's all this there's all this problem too like everybody's all worried about what you guys represent stuff but the fact that you come in draped in American flag saying we're going to catch Trump voters while they got while they're scrambling to try to figure out why why they're uh countryes in Decline and we're going to catch them and we're going to teach them I think that's [ __ ] right on and I would never and some people say they're they're trying to appeal to like the FIFA I like yeah they [ __ ] are I told Noah this I think I think it's brilliant thank you was that one why we need what why we need American Marxism that's Carlos's book um and it's interesting because the last book called American Marxism was by Mark Levin who's like a Fox News host and it was you know it's got a hammer in sickle with the American flag on the front but basically the whole book is calling Obama a communist and saying that you know Communists have taken over the country because Democrats are communists like that's what the literature about Marxism that's available to Americans is like that's what that's what they have available to read and it's like why do we not you know why do we seed the American flag to people like Mark Levin and the idea of American Marxism to people like Mark Levin why don't we say no you know this is what American Marxism would look like a government of bay for the people a government and an economy controlled by the workers that's you know it has nothing to do with the Democrats we have to like people have this false consciousness in America they've been beat over the head with McCarthyism and anti-communist propaganda but it's like well those are the conditions we have we can't you know pick another working class our working class is the one we have so what do we do do we shrug our shoulders and you know say Well they're too anti-communists I guess socialism can't happen we better give up or do we go to those people and meet them where they're at and reorient their Consciousness towards socialism which is you know inherently in their material self-interest yeah which it takes a minute to to convince him though go ahead Mike of course I'm curious like what what would you say are the main goals of the American Communist party and would you consider it a reformist movement because my main objections to the whole magga communist movement and if you're reforming out of that that's fine like I'm perfectly willing to admit that the magga communist movement people like hasz and Hinkle did exactly what I was trying to do with my brand of humor and my meme page and everything in my [ __ ] podcast they targeted a bunch of young dudes who have like revolutionary energy or Ambitions at least or whatever who want to see radical change because they're they realize the system is failing and not even just them but everyone around them um and they took the ones who were liable to turn right and then like turned them into Communists and that's what I always wanted to do but I didn't want to be homophobic about it and like they took that angle right away and it it worked really well so now if they've if they've legitimately like garnered that crowd and then are going to turn those people into like decent dudes who are not just a bunch of incels and bigots and like turn them into like standup citizens who actually want to do like an American version of Communism or something that's great and I will be the first one to congratulate them on them if they do that but just understand that I'm also going to be a little skeptical of that whole thing because I have my own thoughts about like how revolutionary situations are going to go down in the US I imagine there being a lot of like localized collapses that are St are like to cities like to areas as like natural disasters happen and I imagine them being a lot of things like Katrina where there was like right-wing dudes who just go around like yada literally pickup trucks just shooting everyone they label as looters who happen to be brown people now how the things are going to break down in situations like that where it's like whether it's along party factions or just along color lines or what no one can [ __ ] ICT um I just have my own thoughts about like what the American Communist party and the mega Communists or whatever they want label they want to go by I have my ideas about what they're setting themselves up to do in further degrading situations and so like my main objections I guess with the magga Communist and all the what I consider like the right deviation in America of marxist leninism is like because I don't even want to call it like a stous movement I don't know enough about history to get into the particulars to compare it like that like objections were that sorry strer is a [ __ ] we hate straser yeah I imagine and I know I had his objections to that same comparison so I just will resort to calling it like what I consider a right deviation and so my main objections were always the bigotry and the homophobia and if you guys are doing a legitimately principled and genuine job at tackling that and Ting those people like literally purging them cool that's great um and I guess the other objection I have is like it being a reformist project one that wants to like make America great again but from a communist angle when it just doesn't seem to me that like that like when you go when you show up to like protest or whatever or kind of any kind of organizing thing with an American flag that Rings Hollow to leftists who have been saying that the American flag is the new fascist symbol and rightfully so for like a few decades now they've been saying that for a long time because of what the US does around the world into its own citizens so it's like it's a weird contradiction and it seems reformist to me which also seems like Doom to failure I just but bro I disagree because when I was homeless I roll I put American flags over everything in my van so I wouldn't get pulled over by the cops and it worked and I because the cops are fashist you're proving my point no but no but see I'm an American too I'm an American I was born in America and you don't necessarily have to be not proud to be an American you could actually use these because here's the thing you can just like shed it if you want to I wish I I don't understand why people don't show up to protest like uh more like nice clothes and [ __ ] to confuse the whole situation out who's who's important and who's not or there's so much there's so much in labels and stuff so if you drape yourself in American flags that you you confuse your enemy right you confuse your enemy who is clearly if I come up to somebody I'm wearing all American flags they're going to think I'm their buddy and they'll be therefore more likely to listen to what I have to say yeah I guess sorry since I went on for long weed thing if I was going to boil it down like what are the plans for the American Communist Party do they consider themselves a reformist project and are they trying to do things like organize workers to then take over companies and make them to co-ops like what is the material kind of organizational plans that they have for this American Communist project yes we are going to release a party program um Haz is has been putting together the rough draft and then we have to put it the whole executive committee will'll bounce it around we'll shoot it by the pollet bureaus which is the uh the second highest body in the party um and we'll all give our input and edit it and then we we'll put that out because a lot of people have obviously been asking for a party program but I will tell you that the um the way that you're thinking about the collapse of the United States is similar to what we're um thinking about um I had one more thing that I wanted to say that I want to put in my notes oh yeah um sorry one sec um I want to make sure I answer um all of your questions and say everything I want to say so we're thinking about that to the point of even creating a physical map of where all the armed right-wing groups are in the country so we can watch out for them um what you were talking about there with the deterioration of of cities and and you know places one by one is exactly what we think is a likely scenario um for the future of the United States and we don't want that to happen um we don't want the you you know a collapse to come because of the violence and the chaos and the human suffering that that will bring but I think we can all recognize as Marxist as people who are watching the development of the US political system the economy and the global system um is that that's a very likely scenario it it could happen um that things collapse and there's lawlessness and um uh yeah in that case it's all the more important to have a group like the ACP because I mean otherwise we'll just be at the mercy of of whatever right-wing militias emerge at that time and yeah I don't know I would you could say more about that too um about the the kind of people who you want to surround yourself with in a scenario like that um but yeah Eddie if I could just interject real quick I'll let you finish your reply but that's like what I was hoping for from groups like the SR uh John Brown Gun Club there were so many it seems like five or six years ago there were these like explicitly socialist firearm oriented groups and many of them had to tow the line of being firearm safety related they just wanted to be instructional groups rather than specifically revolutionary orgs because of the danger that implies and scrutiny it brings upon you um but so many of them have fallen by the wayside and you know now the mega communist or you know the American Communist party has I guess become more and more popular um so I guess like that's the explanation first of all for why people Levy the accusations of like federal agents at you is they just assume that like you guys stick around and then the more revolutionary or threatening seeming ones I guess have fallen by the wayside not because of any evidence we obviously have like in my defense the meme that um they brought you here I found that in the Discord for uh Finnish bolic the Finn bols commune Discord um so somebody else made it and I just reposted it because I thought it was really funny like it's all just just to me like I don't think you guys are literally feds or that you have any funding from the feds I just have always thought that the idea of an American Communist party that wants to make things better and the US especially uh when it was like tying itself to Trump or supporting him in any way um that seemed fed adjacent to me so I was always going to post memes to that effect but I'll let you finish sorry no you're good and I I understand that but when you're doing something like an American Communist party and like because for me like with with Eddie liger Smith and Midwestern marks I don't really give a [ __ ] what people say a little bit more so about Midwestern marks as an Institute but like me say whatever you want make you know uh joke as much as you want but when it comes to the party like we have to protect its reputation and we have to think about what we're doing and how it looks optically so if there's a meme with like 3,000 likes calling us a fascist and I'm and I know the people who posted it you know I'm GNA reach out and be like can you delete this can you not because there are people who don't I mean even talking to you guys like it's clear that there are misconceptions about the the the theory of the party or maybe not misconceptions but people just don't know what it's about yet people are mixing it up with infrared and and magga communism and they're confused about you know what magga communism is and if what kind of role if any it plays in the party but when when people just see Memes that call us fascists they're not even going to take the time to to to look at into it a lot of the time it's like oh those guys are Fascist right opportun Trump supporters and you know that's the damage of you guys you know you you guys both hate Vos and uh and you give him a hard time you guys attack him in the media constantly you guys both and I I actually sat down with him I like him he's a nice guy he's got the wrong takes on NATO and and Ukraine but he's condescending yeah but nice guy not the worst uh takes on everything else I don't really have he could be a nice guy it's like you don't have to attack but you have to attack someone's character who's actually on your side to at least the 50 60% of the time do you need to go out there and assassinate their character in the most classic coel Pro way which is it's such a side topic I don't want to get into it but like vouch is so dangerous because he will funnel millions of young white kids into a white nationalist version of quote unquote leftism that leaves out any imperialist struggle or any kind of principle to it and it just keeps them in that [ __ ] Middle Ground of supporting the Democrats and white nationalism but thinking that they're doing something Progressive it's so so [ __ ] sickening like that's why have you ever seen if you see him analyze Thomas soul for all the kids and broke down each segment of of Milton Freedman we can't get on a vou tangent I want to let Eddie finish his thing he was gonna say before well I'm just trying to illustrate to you guys that all this name calling and everything it's gonna have to go the way of the dinosaur if we're gonna actually do something because leftists infighting is typical I want to say too yeah and if it's like I don't mind leftist infighting if it's ative if we're debating Theory and if V said something I disagreed with sure I might you know make fun of him for looking at weird pictures of horses on the internet but I could engage with whatever he's saying on the substance I could engage with what he's saying a substantive counterargument but the vouch fans can't do that because they are pro imperialist they are pro Democratic party so what none of the fans of any of us are any good like the destiny fans are out of control the fans are out of control the people in Mike's comment sections are [ __ ] up whoring hey my fans are great my people in this chat the people in this chat right now are a bunch of delinquent [ __ ] you know well my point is that all that they have is to call us fascists is to call us evil right-winger Trump supporters and hope that nobody actually looks into what we're saying so that they they you know can realize that vouch is wrong so that's why I am sensitive about people sharing memes about us being fascist because it helps the people like vou who are trying to stop people from actually listening to what the Marxist leninists are saying because that's all they can do they they don't have the truth on their side so they have to conceal the truth but um to what I was saying I you know in the US flag it it does represent at least the NATO Flag represents you know fascism globally um I encourage people in in Puerto Rico and Vietnam and China to hate the American flag and um and what it stands for but uh we have to take seriously the advice of Fidel Castro who told us As Americans that the working class should take up the flag um not seed the flag and not give the flag as a symbol to the fascists and to the corporations and to the government um but say no this is our flag this is our country um we're the ones who built this country with our labor so we're the ones who should run this country and and fix all of its problems right now and then Fidel said post Revolution you can decide what you want to do with the flag if you want to make a new one or whatever and he said you can do the same with the United States as it currently exists um but uh the I mean and and for me the flag whatever it's a flag it's a symbol I get it I always think about it like if you win a gold medal and wrestling in the sport I do you run around with an American flag I would love to do that and I would be proud to do that you know I wouldn't take the flag off and burn it because I'm a communist or whatever but I don't care too much what people think about you know the flag it's itself but the what we need to avoid and what's really really prevalent and damaging on the the American left um which the ACP is trying to remedy is National Historical nihilism which is an undialectical view of the United States and and that's a view that only sees the negative side of the United States and when you do that you're ignoring Martin Luther King and the Civil Rights Movement you're ignoring uh reconstruction and and all the the black slaves who fled the The South The Who fled the Confederate and join the Union Army and fought to end slavery as a mode of production and and move the American system forward to something new or better and and afterwards they established really the first dictatorship of the proletariat in American history but when you only analyze what the Bourgeois class has done throughout American history that's a one-sided undialectical view you also have to understand the history of struggle in this country the history of struggle against imperialism against capitalism against slavery because if you don't understand the country or if you don't understand that part of the country you don't understand it as a whole and as revolutionaries it's it's you know even more important for us to understand the Revolutionary country of our history so we can draw upon um lessons from the past and historical figures from the past and no that doesn't mean these historical figures are perfect that doesn't mean you know some a bunch of the things that they said aren't outdated of course they are but we need to um have a a concrete and dialectical understanding of people like say Abraham Lincoln um the last thing I'll say about the um the deprogramming of right-wing people that that um infrared and H and some of these folks have done it is pretty amazing to see when you talk to people who were Trump supporters or Libertarians or even going down like fascist pipelines and they were pulled um towards communism it's amazing but you also have a lot of people who were on the left the sort of identity politics obsessed left and then they found H's videos and say there's one kid who had a terrible relationship with his parents him and his dad hated each other but then H's video started questioning this anarchic you know like anti-parent anti- discipline attitude that a lot of um leftists have and this kid was able to repair his relationship with his father um and now they're very close and I got to go meet his father the last time I was in the area I got to meet both of his parents and see how close their family is now and that's because of ha's De conditioning someone who was on the left someone who hated their family because that's the kind of culture and ideology that was being pushed on the left um so it's not just deprogramming people on the right the left has gone so far um and I won't you know I I sound like uh Dave ruin or some right-winger when left has gone so crazy but you did I just what I'd be curious to see what this actual deprogramming looks like in practice and that would be something that the H crowd should publicize more rather than his Clips where he's dunking on sus or whatever it is that he's doing on YouTube videos like he should be showing how he's actually converting these right wiers because that's another thing that I wanted to do early on was try to literally turn people leftist it's the whole thing I wanted to do was like convert people from their [ __ ] liberal mindset whether it's full conservative liberals or just the liberal liberals and uh it's tough to do because people are really entrenched in their views um but I'm I'm really interested in how this deprogramming actually works because I want to know if this kid's dad changed his views or if he's still just like a homophobic who thinks that the cabal is transing his kids at school or something like or if like this AC like so how's that work like why did he disconnect from his dad to begin with was his dad always a ma like how's this how's this going on he didn't even know until he started reading or until he found H and started reading marks and then his dad was like oh yeah I'm a ma or I was a maist back in India and he learned that his dad was a Marxist because they didn't have a relationship before that um but it was just he was in the the hashtag abolish the family left he was in this left that said the family's a patriarchal institution that shouldn't exist and socialism is when we get rid of the family and he had resentment that that is as alien to me sorry as like somebody who was forcefully turning kids gay at school like I've never heard of this anti-am abolish the family left like where are these people Verso books they're like a huge leftwing bookstore they publish like abolish the family on Mother's Day on their Instagram page it's it's a common thing why why to why why do we need to abolish the family again I people take Eng Les origins of the family private property in the state and they look at how monogamy and the existing family form um crystallized under capitalism and they say that therefore it will all go away under communism and will all be poly but what Engel says is actually under cap under socialism you can have true monogamy you can have true love between um two partners that is uh not not um affected by like economic coercion so you won't have like wives staying with abusive husbands because they need you know they can't support themselves economically um but but yeah that's where it comes from Eddie you're probably more versed in theory so you may know what the term is but what do you call it when people take an aesthetic part of what they imagine a communist Society to look like like that like mon or polygamy or whatever they imagine is going to be like when you abolish the family Under full communism and they try to apply to conditions under capitalism where you like put the horse cart before the horse so to speak like what is the theory term for that and would you say that that's pretty consistent with the anarchists across the board where they try to like imagine a commune and they start some failed project like the Chaz or they try to imagine different Lifestyles and live them out under capitalism but it fails miserably because you cannot adapt these things individualistically until you change like the underlying material conditions that prevent you from living like you're supposed to be living as a human being right right that's uh called utopianism um so Engles socialism utopian and it's a perfect name if you think about it because that's what they're doing is they're imagining this Utopia and it what Engles says in utopian and scientific is any future Society needs to be built out of the current Society it needs to be built out of out of the existing condition so you're not just going to be able to jump to any kind of society and and the person they analyze um heavily in that book is Robert Owen who was this rich guy at the time who tried to start a commune BAS Bally and it failed but um they were very uh they had great respect for Robert Owen they were like his heart was in the right place he wanted to create this socialist Utopia um but the problem was that he was a utopian right he tried to create this Utopia overnight um with in one place you know within the larger capitalist structure rather than looking to advance the class struggle and change society as a whole and and build a new Society out of the current existence one so um it's a really good book and he talks about how capitalism emerged out of feudalism and how it happened slowly and in spurts and um how socialism will probably arise the same way it's it's good stuff it's very short too I just want to bring up this comment here it says Fidel Castro did Express sentiments about embracing National symbols including Flags particularly in context of resisting Fascism and imperialism he advocated for the people to take pride in their national identity and protect it from uh oppressive forces there you go did indeed that's cool man well that's good enough for me well I gotta say I'll I'll definitely look I've already supported you from the get-go as soon as I saw you doing awesome [ __ ] uh that I'll continue to do so without any question and I yeah I I can definitely refrain from making uh you know accusations without evidence I don't know how about you Mike I mean I will continue to do what I've always learned which is [ __ ] Post online I will continue to be critically aligned with mega Communists which I find myself doing more and more so um it was at first TOA grin like I really like I'm willing to accept the idea that the magot Communists can reform themselves into the American Communist party and be a principled Marxist leninist party that is not bigoted in nature and that they've like slothed off all the you know reactionary people in their groups or whatever I'm still going to withhold my judgment until I see like what happens in some kind of breakdown scenario if they end up sided with the [ __ ] right Wingers and just like shooting down a bunch of blue hairs or like I have no idea what any of the situations are going to look like it's all speculative it's whatever I have my kind of suspicions about like what groups are aligning with whom and for what reasons like cultural or just like psychological well the fascist hate us more than anyone by the way um like Nick Fuentes and them they hate me hanle and ha and everyone but just want to put that there I'd like what you guys are doing hle is leading the parade because he's got so much engagement and he's built this reactionary sort of at the beginning and but now he's drifting he's growing he's moving he's doing new things he's you know I saw I saw some kind of vaguely homophobic post the other day but I was like the rest 95% of what he said was right on and he was somebody needs to stick up for Venezuela right now and he's over there grinning and asking the [ __ ] dude questions and [ __ ] I'm I'm fine with that I think that's [ __ ] awesome and if people until I see some evidence that some of these doing something wrong I'm not going to jump to the conclusion that they're going to kill people in the end of the world or whatever like I don't give a [ __ ] they're doing good work they live in the midwest dude it's hard living there you got people who are dieh hard [ __ ] no man I I totally understand the no off to Eddie but it's small town mentality sometimes you you get some people like that who might be a little homophobic whatever I grew up in the same town I know I get it I mean Eddie Eddie you were always my favorite content creator out of all the people who ended up siding with like this new faction of the American Communist party I didn't really know of um Noah but he was cool when we had him on like he was definitely cool to talk to I was always aware of has and Hinkle and not a fan but if they're legitimately going to reform their ways then I'll continue to extend like critical support I keep reposting a bunch of hle stuff and like propping his name up because he legit has good takes on Twitter and I hate it but like and I guess as long as he's gonna continue no I mean see love it yeah maybe he's the next sh guaro who like said homophobic stuff in his early 20s and then reforms later on like I have no idea but like yeah when it comes down to like [ __ ] going wrong I will always side with the the mega communist over the [ __ ] gers for surely Jesus Christ yeah see that's the problem is we're up you have Elon Musk trying to overthrow Venezuela and we're like sitting here fighting with each other give me a [ __ ] break here guys you know but at the end of day it just also doesn't matter what I say I have a [ __ ] meme page in on YouTube like ites this the thing how you like me we're get a good cop bad cop Eddie here I'm trying to be real nice and he's just like I want to be clear too that magga communism has nothing to do with the ACP other than the fact that it you know was infrared slogan and there are infrared people who joined but like um like 50% of pcusa joined the you know party of communist USA huge factions of cpusa joined all the midwestern marks people had nothing to do I mean there's a lot of overlap between our communities but the midwestern marks people had nothing to do with infrared so like the ACP has nothing to do with magga Communism other than the that the fact that infrared as a group you know has people in the party so it's not like a magga communism party it's not you know there's no questions on the the processing exam about magga communism it's just Marxism leninism just communism straight up so well I gotta beef good to see I gotta beef what I got beef with you Eddie and if you don't if you don't knock it off I'm gonna cauliflower that [ __ ] too no don't don't go after the vegans anymore leave my vegans alone my vegans I have to because Carlos is vegan I have oh really okay yeah I wondered I really did but no I'm glad at least one of your uh comrades are a vegan because this look if you're not vegan in 2024 you're an [ __ ] let's face it I'm an [ __ ] but uh I'm telling you legumes they're the they are the premium protein Source on this Earth's surface they are sustainable they are radical they are revolutionary they fix nitrogen in the soil they stay good forever in a dry form uh they have fiber instead of saturated fat like your typical meats and they have a great environmental footprint beans brother revolutionary [ __ ] and I take revolutionary shits every morning full of beans he's always got that rant loaded up well I like I'm serious uh don't don't uh don't go too hard and I'm telling everybody you Mike you Eddie everybody in the chat give it a shot try it for a weekend don't eat the [ __ ] because that's what the capitalist want you to eat eat beans you know get you some quinoa get you some broccoli [ __ ] like that you'll be all right you be I did try it for a week I I I may have done it wrong though I was not all right tell me what at wrestling practice what what' you eat I know you you got I was just eating tons of spinach really oh that's wrong that's wrong here's the thing that's full of oxalates which if you eat raw spinach that actually limits protein uptake so if you're eating raw spinach this is why Miley Cyrus quit her vegan diet she I was eating spinach smoothies all the time and I didn't feel good um you you got to eat beans and rice massive quantities of beans rice and broccoli and [ __ ] that makes sense beans rice look you're an athlete too I can't tell you the strongest man in the world Patrick baboian Iranian German strong man could flip over a car vegan bodybuilders you know your your boy Jake Shield's a homophobe he's vegetarian he's vegan too he's vegetarian I think I'm going on his podcast this summer actually it'll be interesting I know he's funny he's got some interest SS right yeah I'm like I go the dude goes uh Palestine right I'm like yes I agree and then he goes homos I'm like no and then he goes but I'm vegetarian I go damn it I'm so conflicted right then he's like I think they lied about 1940s Germany godam God damn it why okay see Talk Jesus we're working on it he's getting there he he's honestly a nice guy he just like he's like too nice to people like Nick Fuentes and they just have crawled in his mind but I think that's Mike's major thing is that that Ma masculinity happens to coincide with some form of stupidity at some point or like intolerance you know and it happens bro you're you're a wrestler you would probably hang out with people all the time that are like borderline wrong you know yeah yeah I've heard what goes on in Jiu-Jitsu JY yeah righto or whatever Jiu-Jitsu is bad there's like some big Jiu-Jitsu people in Brazil like the Gracies who went like hardcore businaro and had a bad effect on the community as a whole politically that's why I applaud you you you're not you're not a homophobe you came out of wrestling you're actually wrestling with these sweaty guys and they're the homophobic ones what's with that right that's actually the only reason I do wrestle is so I can touch other men I dude I started working out after I saw guys like you I'm like communist can be strong oh [ __ ] let's go let's do it I I don't want to be left out man I want to kick somebody's ass one day i' been KCK I have my ass kicked my whole life I'm like it's my turn yeah all right well I mean I've I've been not I I wouldn't say I've been converted in any way I'll continue to be I I have like the exact same attitude I've had towards the American Communist party as before um but that was always like critical somewhat support it's like I recognize their good works as Anti-Imperialist I recognize that they're opening up a lot of people's eyes on the left to just the idea that maybe Russian and Chinese people aren't evil subhumans who live in a brainwashed dystopia that all want to kill you it's like they're human beings who actually are doing more to resist your government's tyranny around the world than you are even as you're like American leftist protests or it's like the encampments and stuff um it's cool and all but it's like I don't know what the the American Communist Party position is on like all the student protest that went on during the genocide um if you think they're going to pick back up in September but it's like it just seemed like woefully inadequate and it's like cool like I'm glad people are doing something but it's like at what point can we escalate to do something that actually pushes our government to stop doing a [ __ ] genocide or at least stop supporting it in some material way um so I have all my criticisms for the current American leftist and Progressive Movement as it exists and they probably align a lot with what the American Communist Party says about like uh IDE what do you call identity politic obsessed leftists and all the uh yeah just the the frivolous larpers who are like doing it as an aesthetic and identity rather than actually caring about material significant change in their lifetimes um and I I keep finding myself more aligned with me like Mega Communists and the people that I had previously blocked online like mostly because I lost my page which ironically happened after I went after Charles McBride another leftist it was weird that that happened it's kind of coincidence but like you know him he used to follow me on Tik Tok yeah we were mutuals yeah okay soon as I went after him I lost my page now I on this other one I have nobody blocked that I used to have and the mega Communists are not bothering me anymore they used to like really be up my ass if I posted anything in support of gay people and now they've started to like at least be Anti-Imperialist and quiet about their their bigotry if they're still doing it so hopefully that is a sign of like genuine reform in the in the ACP and that community so I I guess I'll reserve my judgment right not reforming the ACP because the ACP never had anything to do with that but reforming the infrared Community it's a fresh start see ACP is a fresh start man yeah all right we look boys and girls we got seven minutes here Eddie Mike I'm gonna challenge you now you [Music] ready all right Marx's trivia time you guys got to buzz for the last seven minutes we got to get through this quick so quick what was the term used by Marx to describe the process by which
