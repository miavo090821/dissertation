When you covered Eric Adams’s evasion of justice through the legal system, it reminded me a lot of the Wire’s Senator Clay Davis. Like surprisingly a lot. Both men represent diverse cities facing massive crisis. Both men got in trouble for embezzlement of political funds. Both men are known for being flamboyant and outspoken. Both men managed to avoid convictions for  their legal problems by taking advantage of situations that the justice system was not prepared for.",

But by the end of 2020, I was horrified by what Cuomo managed to pull off. His COVID restriction plans were completely disconnected from the reality in which we were living. He mismanaged our crisis in a way that only a nepo baby can.\n\nAnd then the women came forward with their stories. We know, from a book published by one of his staffers, that he believed (and probably still believes) the investigation was politically motivated. He thought Letitia James was coming for his job. She was not. (She should've.) He will never apologize for anything.\n\nWhen he resigned, he managed to convince all the people who were angry at him that they should go after Kathy Hochul instead. Now, I don't like Hochul either, but this is a classic example of \"man ruins thing, gives woman the opportunity to fix it, woman can't fix it, people act misogynistic about it.\"\n\nI do not think Andrew should be anywhere near government. I don't even think he deserves to be in charge of his own household. He's a horrible, incompetent person, and as long as we have horrible, incompetent people in our state and local government, we will never fix anything in this state and it will descend further into far-right radicalism.",

From my foxhole here in the Deep South, I remember being horrified watching NYC getting absolutely wrecked by this killer virus in early 2020 before eventually fanning out to the rest of the country. You mention the Cuomo PR machine... I too, like so many others, fell victim to it. I thought he was a MF rockstar, especially in comparison to my dingaling governor Brian Kemp, who had the unmitigated gall to get on national TV talkin' bout \"I didn't know the virus was airborne,\" when the CDC is literally headquartered IN OUR STATE 😡. Not to mention we had one of the shortest lockdown periods in the entire country (less than a month). Since the bar was in the lowest level of hell for me, I'm looking at Cuomo like he's proactive, he's trying his best to take care of his people, and that he actually gives a damn whether New Yorkers actually LIVE because Kemp really didn't seem to care if half of Georgia died or not. All the while, in reality Cuomo's actually sinister asf. I did not know the extent of all that he'd done during the pandemic. I don't use the words \"evil\" or \"wicked\" lightly but how else do you describe such intentionally abject disregard for life? Your interview with Lindsey Boylan is particularly powerful. Seems like NYC has some good options this time around... the rest of the country is rooting for y'all come May!",
