PLEASE study a little History and Geography and you will see that \"America\" is NOT the name of one single country but that of a huge and diverse continent. Columbus came to America on FOUR occasions and NEVER ever set foot on what is now US territory. Let me reiterate this: Columbus came to America FOUR TIMES and was not ever in what is now USA. Then, the Europeans called this place where he had been \"America\". Now..., what does this tell you about the real meaning of the name \"America\"???!!!! 🙂  Please, guys, it is high time you gave your country a proper name already!!! It is not anyone else´s fault if YOU have decided to call your federation \"The United States of a CONTINENT”, is it? Consider this: if France had decided to call itself \"United Provinces of Europe\", would you then only call France \"Europe\"? How do you think the people in the rest of Europe would react?",

        "text": "Okay. Sorry, that “no” was a joke. \n\nI think we run into a few problems here. That’s all. \n\n1. The country is called the “United states of America” and as such, the word we’ve ALWAYS used is Americans. It in no way says “other people on this continent are not American” and I don’t understand where you get that idea from? It’s simply referring to the specific people of the USA.\n\n2. In Spanish, there’s actually a word for it. And it makes sense and comes naturally when speaking Spanish, so obviously that’s  what we do\n\n3. Liberals and anti-communists have for too long tried to force people to virtue signal, you know? Say the right magic words or you’re in trouble! And it’s always some unnatural way of speaking they demand we all change, when the way we were already speaking worked just fine and the proper notions were already being communicated. \n\n4. Using the correct woke word doesn’t actually change anything. If you believe we’re somehow disrespecting our brothers and sisters in other countries while we’re actively working with them on our shared interests and for material gains, I don’t know what to tell ya, my friend. I would suggest checking out @ACPmain on Twitter/X and you’ll see that you are just sort of… repeating a line that liberals believe is true but does not properly reflect the reality. \n\n5. Focus on language and not content, the real essence of things, is just not the way Communists roll. That’s all. \n\nI hope you take this in the good-hearted way I mean it. Too often, these problems get exacerbated for no good reason, you know? Really, I’m just saying… we need to genuinely think about this kind of thing.",
