a cop is a cop what cops away yeah and he may be he may be a very nice man but I've got the time to figure that out you know all I know is he's got a uniform and a gun you know and I had to relate to him that way because one of us is gonna one of us may have to die one of us probably you know in New York there's a big campaign going on to humanize the policeman and they have post Billboards Upstate and they have a picture of a big cop bending over this little blonde girl and and the signs say and some people call him Pig and I wanted to buy billboard I sold it for the man I want to buy a billboard and show this big cop and this 14 year old kid with 30 bullets in him and saying some people call him Peacemaker thank you and some things if you've followed me for a while you know that I cannot stand Aragon with black ass in fact the very first episode of this show was me breaking down the absurdity of rappers like Ice-T calling Eric Adams the hip-hop mayor of New York City when the man actively criminalizes hip-hop and I told y'all then that I am a certified Eric Adams hater but I'm a hater with lots and lots of reasons so today I'm finally going to give you all the reasons why everybody hates this [ __ ] so I asked my Twitter followers to tell me why they hate Eric Adams and the most common answer was he's a cop and I'm actually glad I didn't see too many detailed reasons for why folks didn't like him because it means that I have so so so so much to tell y'all as someone watching that man like a hawk y'all are gonna need picket signs when I am done but something I've also noticed a lot of whenever I talk about Eric Adams is a lot of people going I can't believe New York has elected a cop what did New Yorkers expect when they elected a cop oh why did y'all vote for a cop so before I give you the million reasons to hate Eric Adams I want to first start by adding some Nuance to how New York City ended up with Eric Adams because it's not as simple as we got what we asked for foreign needs to remember about New York City the most diverse city on earth is that it's home to thousands if not millions of immigrants many of whom like myself cannot vote then you must also consider the amount of New Yorkers battling poverty and literal homelessness who would be unlikely to vote so many of us didn't elect Eric Adams because we can't elect anybody no matter how vocally and politically tapped in a lot of us may be so just always bear that in mind Eric Adams won the Democratic primary for New York City in June 2021. he took office January 2022. there are a few things you need to understand for context about the primary and New York City just to understand how we ended up with Eric Adams this primary was atypical for a few reasons first we were in the middle of a global pandemic and yes yes I know we are still in the middle of that pandemic what I mean by that is that New York City was still acting like it New York City was locked down for longer than most places in the country we transformed the entire city in so many respects the businesses that were even still open in while operating out of makeshift wooden boxes on the streets many of which we still have around because I think we've all gotten accustomed to it hospitals were still full people were still dying in droves protests were happening daily there was a whole lot going on that distracted people from being able to be tapped into the election and all of the individuals that were running in the race which brings me to the second Factor there were a million people running in this race listen the relevant candidates were Eric Adams Andrew Yang Scott Stringer Maya Wiley Catherine Garcia and Diane Morales that does not include these people I never even heard about Sean Donovan Raymond McGuire Aaron foldenauer R Chang Paperboy Prince Jocelyn Taylor and Isaac Wright who are these [ __ ] and there was a circus happening around each and every one of these candidates do you remember how much media attention Andrew Yang in all his cringy Antics took up for a man who only got 12 of the vote [Music] [Music] thank you Mysteries [Music] can you imagine a New York City because I can't imagine let's not have to all right see you soon what side note we actually really need to study the phenomenon that is Andrew Yang being as well known yet wildly unelectable as he has proven to be my God Scott Stringer was a favorite of some people early on and then he was accused of sexual abuse by a woman who worked for him during his 2001 campaign for public Advocate then at the ninth hour to my personal dismay because I was a fan of her campaign Diane morales's campaign blew up on her staff tried to unionize and while all this is happening Eric Adams is out here rolling out ads that would have you thinking this [ __ ] cop is a goddamn civil rights leader which is Central to why he was the strong favorite amongst black voters and listen to me I am not exaggerating when I tell you this man was running civil rights leader look at ads please look at this fans have seen rough times and I've got the calluses to prove it growing up my parents struggled I was beaten by police at 15. so I became a police officer to battle racism from within as Brooklyn ball president I worked around the clock to fight against Kobe I'm Eric Adams I'll be a blue collar mayor I'll rebuild our economy while tackling violent crime and bring New York back paid for by Eric Adams 2021. nothing impresses me about Eric Adams and I do mean nothing but if it was going to be something it would be the ability to simultaneously invoke police brutality to Pander to the black community that has been brutalized and rightfully distrust the police by presenting himself like someone who gets it like someone who's experienced brutality while simultaneously being a [ __ ] cop in the same brat [ __ ] those were the kinds of ads he was running and targeting towards black and brown communities meanwhile the man was vocal about not only his refusal to support reducing nypd's budget or staff he told us he was going to bring back nypd's anti-crime unit that's history of abuse was so rampant and documented they had been forced to dissolve it the year earlier think about that think about that the man was campaigning on ending the exact same kind of police brutality he was planning to enable and that's exactly what the [ __ ] he did because he would go on to restore that unit and bring back stop and frisk finds the NYPD is still using stop and frisk and that too many people are searched unlawfully especially men of color a court appointed monitor finds most of the people the NYPD neighborhood safety team stop and search are men and 97 percent of them are Black and Hispanic the report also finds there was no Reasonable Suspicion for the Stop in more than a quarter of those cases and a third of the searches lacked any legal basis the safety teams were disbanded after George Floyd's murder but mayor Adams has since brought them back but we'll get back to that later and not only will we distracted by the circus of controversies happening around way way way too many candidates we were especially [ __ ] because of what I believe played one of the biggest roles but always seems to get left out of the discussion is that it was the first introduction of A ranked Choice voting system in New York City we had a million candidates and a ranked Choice voting system [ __ ] I'm not sure why people overlook this but here's the breakdown of the primary there are a few things I want to call your attention to in the first round Eric Adams had 30.7 percent of the vote Maya Wiley had 21.4 percent of the vote and Catherine Garcia had 19.6 of the vote by the time the final ranked Choice voting math goes down in the final round Eric Adams beats Catherine Garcia not even Maya Wiley the person who received the second highest amounts of votes in the first round but in the final round Eric Adams beats Catherine Garcia by the tiniest margin 50.4 percent to 49.6 percent then in the actual mayoral election when there's only about 20 voter turnout anyway Eric Adams was against the Republicans raving lunatic courtesiwa the leader of the Guardian Angels a not-ass organization that Eric Adams actually supports of [ __ ] in rad Berets patrolling the subway like vigilante with this kind of energy also refuse our previous invitations to join the neighborhood watch so we could use your support our motto is Neighbors watching neighbors but I actually want to show y'all a clip from the mayoral debate between Eric Adams and courtesiwa because it provides so much to unpack and shows you one just how [ __ ] unserious New York City politics are and two what we're dealing with here what our options are here because I think we need to be reminded because before I really get into my bag and I'm I'm gonna get to the bottom of it I just want to show you what the other choice was take a look at this Mr freewat your opponent has at times we've heard over the last couple of weeks several times called you a clown uh he has called you a trump Mini-Me I wanted to see your reaction to that but I also by your own admission you faked crimes a kidnapping a robbery in the 90s so why should voters in New York trust you well you know it's interesting he calls me a clown I guess I'm Pagliacci right across the street as you know I could be in Lincoln Center that's so beneath you Eric Adams especially after you wrote an op-ed piece praising the guardian angels did I make mistakes early on yes and I've apologized for them but talking about faking you fake where you live Eric Adams we still don't know where you live you live in Jersey most people say and then you blame a homeless person for your accounting problems with the IRS for the second time you've gotten in trouble for wrong filings and you've blamed some homeless man that you had as your accountant I hope you don't appoint him if you get elected mayor the budget director for the City of New York because Bill de Blasio your friend has done enough damage to this city I can't imagine why you wouldn't just take responsibility man up Eric say it's my responsibility and I'd like to know where you actually live because you keep faking that let's break that down shall we the first thing I find incredible about this clip is as the moderator is describing siwa by your own admission you faked crimes a kidnapping a robbery in the 90s so why should voters in New York Trust you quickly realize this [ __ ] is a great a not but here's where it gets really sick that grade a nut response and starts eating in the atoms the [ __ ] up with a bunch of claims that are true let's review see what's claim shall we first see what says it's shame worthy for Eric Adams to Now call siwa a clown when he Eric Adams penned an op-ed supporting the guardian angels foreign let me tell you why that's important because the main issue with siwa is the guardian angels if you were going to call Seawall clown and he is you would think it would start with the guardian angels this is a group that throughout the 70s and 80s was known for being a group of white men who would Patrol the Subways through only their perceived Authority as white men targeting black and brown New Yorkers and yet that is precisely not the issue Eric Adams has he supports the guardian angels second siwa says Eric Adams is a liar and that he doesn't even live in New York City and that most people think he lives in New Jersey fact check listen to me and listen to me good listen to me Eric Adams lives in New Jersey and we all know it this is by no means the most important reason to dislike Eric Adams but it does demonstrate that he is a lion ass [ __ ] it came to life during Eric Adams campaign for mayor that he actually lives in a co-op with his partner in Fort Lee New Jersey but when that came out that was a problem Eric Adams because you know to be mayor of New York City you actually have to I live in New York City and at the time he was the Brooklyn Borough president so he got the ever willing to help police look good as New York Times the Publishers fugazi ass article doing a tour of his Brooklyn home and child that man was scrambling so heavy to make it look like he lived in that apartment they put a bed in the living room at the back of the door and this is the and this is the fridge full of a meat you know mind you Eric Adams is a vegan and according to Eric Adam's own taxes he don't live in Brooklyn third siwa accuses Eric Adams of blaming a homeless person for his accounting problems with the IRS fact check what is he was talking about here well the city in political New York reported that Eric Adams who purchased a bed style apartment from the federal government when he was the NYPD Captain for just 361 thousand dollars did not pay taxes for 2017 2018 or 2019 on any rental income from the tenants and reported that he spent just enough on repairs to write off the entire amount that he collects in rent and he also reported that he does not live in the Brooklyn apartment building he now claims he resides in why did he claim that well property owners are allowed to write off their expenses on rental units so it's either he doesn't live in Brooklyn for real at which point he's lying to us now or he does live in Brooklyn and he was lying to us then when the IRS brought these things to life Eric Adams said and I [ __ ] you not the accountant made mistakes because the accountant suddenly became homeless and ciao you know homeless [ __ ] be tripping I swear he actually did say something to the effect though oh he became homeless and I mean he was making all kind of mistakes but you know what I said it was [ __ ] up if I fired him and he was homeless oh okay and to all the people saying to themselves we could have had Maya Wiley you know what yeah you're right dog you're right we could have at the time it was between Maya Wiley and Diane Morales for me and I vocally leaned Diane Morales because Maya Wiley proposed to take at least one billion dollars from nypd's budget and to reduce their staff by 2250 officers but Morales wanted to cut their funding by at least three billion dollars and reinvested into social programs and alternatives to policing like violence respond to services and just a little side note to how this propaganda just had folk misleading the public look how this article states that Morales wanted to cut nypd's funding by three billion and that that's more than half the Department's budget but that's not an accurate picture in 2020 nypd's operating budget was 5.6 billion dollars yes but the city still spent over 11 billion dollars in policing because it gave them an additional 5.4 billion dollars in Fringe Benefits and pensions and debt services and a bunch of other [ __ ] and that's not including another almost billion dollars in overtime spending anyway Eileen moral is simply because she wanted to take the most from NYPD but if I could go back in time knowing what I know now I would have been full throttlely behind Wiley we should have Consolidated around Maya Wiley but hindsight is 2020 and I definitely didn't and don't possess the ability to determine New York City elections as it is so it is what it is but I'll eat that nonetheless that being said I know it was not all a fluke a lot of people did actually vote for Eric Adams he was the first ranked choice for most of the people who voted in the Democratic primary for mayor part of it is like he didn't win the majority of the vote you know it was a stacked race and he won like a small percentage of of of the vote and it still is is shocking to me that he was even in the running at all given what we saw him doing and saying in the lead-up and he was on record on a show advocating for 400 to 1 student to teacher ratios like that should have been a campaign-ending thing I mean he on camera thought it was going to show a show him that he was a tough guy by dismantling a kid's skateboard ramp to show that he was going to crack down on like public health and safety issues he was advocating for the criminalization of graffiti he was disparaging New Yorkers and service level positions as low-skill people who didn't belong and couldn't ever belong in a corner office he was saying all of the things Democrats and Republicans think about when it comes to you know wanting to lock up more people maybe disdain that they have for the people who they serve or they're supposed to serve but he was saying it all out loud and people still voted for him so I wanted to actually explain why those who voted for him did and why I wasn't surprised that they voted for him and I also wasn't surprised that he was much worse than so many people anticipated psychner is New Year's Day 2020 in New York City when Andy Cohen is drunk as hell celebrating the departure of de Blasio horrible [Music] [Music] I tweeted this would be funny if I did not know that Eric Adams is about to make de Blasio look like Child's Play and I was right listen to me I was highly critical of de Blasio but not for one second did I ever delude myself into thinking Eric Adams would not be much much worse for the same reason that I knew New Yorkers were going to elect him he's a black cop which makes him New York City encapsulated New York City is a place that likes the appearance of being Progressive and diverse which is why New York City brags about being the most diverse city in the world and an always reliable Blue State while maintaining the most racist and regressive institutions policies and practices imaginable so do not believe the hype this is not a progressive Utopia when people are presenting it to you that way they are basing that off the appearance of the thing the appearance of the place the pop culture the fact that it has Democrat administrations across the board but what they're not thinking about is the fact that New York city has the most segregated school systems in the entire country did you know that that in this city of almost 10 million people 42 percent of whom are white Rikers is a pre-trial Detention Center filled with over 90 black or brown people who've not been locked up because they've been convicted of a crime but because they do not have the money to purchase their freedom compare and contrast that to New York City's neighbor New Jersey who abolished the cash bail system in 2014 under Republican Governor Chris Christie then you'll understand that New York City just has a better publicist if you bear in mind that this was New York's stop and frisk City and that even after it was found unconstitutional it is still New York stop in Frisk City that this is New York and this is New York and this is New York well then you'll understand the formula for why we have Eric Adams I would like to introduce to you an academic concept that most black people simply understand through our lived experiences and the countless examples of it but Derek Bell the father of critical race Theory introduced the concept of rules of racial standing in his book faces at the bottom of the well few blacks avoid diminishment of racial standing most of their statements about racial conditions being diluted then the recommendations of other blacks taken with a grain of salt the usual exception to this rule is the black person who publicly disparages or criticizes other blacks who are speaking or acting in ways that upset whites instead such statements are granted enhanced standing even when the speaker has no special expertise or experience in the subject he or she is criticizing when a black person or a group makes a statement or takes an action that the white Community or vocal components thereof deem outrageous the latter will actively recruit blacks willing to refute the statement or condemn and the action blacks who respond to the call for condemnation will receive super standing status and that is where Eric Adams comes in in 2020 we had protests in every single Borough every single day of the summer thousands of people demanding an end to police brutality and calling for the police to be defunded white liberal New Yorkers did not want that [ __ ] they did not want to defund the police they did not want an upheaval to the system they believe in that system but they don't like being associated with the critiques of that system so what offers a better Shield than a black cop they get to maintain the same system worsen it actually but we'll get back to that and to maintain the same system but pretend it's Progressive because the guy is black they get to scratch their heads and play confuse when anyone suggests that maybe this black man is deliberately and systematically going after other black people because he's anti-black but they're going to play confused because America is invested in pretending they aren't aware that or how black people internalize anti-blackness and wield it against other black people America is invested in this Collective gaslighting because how else could it persist if not that is why as the New York Times reported quote Mr Adams who cast himself as a blue-collar candidate LED in every Borough except Manhattan in the tally of First Choice votes and was the strong favorite amongst working class black and Latino voters he also demonstrated strength with white voters who held moderate views especially some data suggests amongst voters who did not have college degrees a coalition that has been likened to the ones that propelled President Biden to the Democratic nomination in 2020 and there's a lot to unpack there because while all those different groups voted for Eric Adams they voted for him for different reasons while moderate white people voted for Eric Adams it can't simply be sad that the black people who voted for him voted for him because black voters are moderate or because that's what appealed to them and it certainly cannot be said that black people have the same commitment to the status forward to policing that white moderates awarded for Adams did it's important to remember that Adams tapped into entirely different narratives to appeal to those different voters and understand that the cop again the police loving rhetoric he used to appeal to the white moderates was not what he did to engage with the black community remember the police brutality condemning civil rights activist type ads he was running I showed you earlier well combine that with piling up the black candidates and rappers he tried out or the rousing endorsement he was getting from people like Hakeem Jeffries Eric Adams there yeah a long time oh yeah you know him oh okay so you have anything positive to say well I guess that yeah that you're a good person to talk to him well one of the best one of the best small group political speeches I ever heard was from him when when Hakeem Jeffries who I used to be pretty close to uh first decided to run for Congress a group of us met for a little fundraiser and Adams gave the kind of opening introduction for Jeffries about you know why we should get excited about him and it was amazing so much better than Jeff any speech that Jeffries has ever given so he's got Charisma you know he knows how to talk to people he was just more active about pandering to old black voters in a particular kind of way and I do mean emphasis on older black voters when folks in Harlem say quit sending the police to solve our problems when folks in East New York say quit sending the police to solve our problems that's maybe when we'll see some change and I think that's the one reason we are seeing some funding for the community violence reduction stuff because that is what people in those neighborhoods increasingly are saying yes there's still the little old church ladies who come to the meetings and say bring back stop and frisk and why can't we put more of our own children in prison but increasingly there are lots of voices in these communities who say you know we need community-led solutions to these problems look I think there's a generational divide here you know my students were not taken in by Eric Adams my uh you know I teach at Brooklyn College my students especially for the courses that I teach are predominantly African-American afro-caribbean uh and they're none of them are fans of Eric Adams but their parents voted for it now that we've covered how Eric Adams became mayor and why people voted for him let's unpack who Eric Adams is at his core a black cop because trust that Eric Adams is a cop through and through my boy the epitome of the black cop as well as a registered Republican for a significant amount of his life it is our city Against The Killers when you ask most people why they hate Eric Adams they're probably going to tell you because he's a cop but they're not just saying to you that they don't like cops therefore they hate Eric Adams what they're trying to communicate to you is that Eric Adams is a black cop in the depths of his soul and I am making an emphasis on black cop because there is something special negative what's special about the block cop and that's something that Eric Adams himself recognizes the funny thing about my beef with Eric Adams is that deep down that [ __ ] agrees with me he knows that we live in a police state because that's precisely why he became a cop it's why he continues to Adorn NYPD jackets at most press conferences despite being there and having retired years earlier it's why he prioritizes the needs of NYPD above all else because he knows that there is nobody more powerful than the police in a police state air Adams cares solely about power or and he will conceal who he truly is when in certain black company but he's always told us who he was that's why before he even took office Eric Adams let it be known that he did not care about the opinions of the council members or anyone who was not a cop this happened after Eric Adams stated his intention to continue the use of solitary confinement despite the tragic deaths of Khalif Browder Langley and Polanco and Brandon Rodriguez and the majority of the New York City Council Members wrote a letter asking him to reverse his decision for people to continue to say Eric supports solitary confinement that is just a lie I support punitive segregation I am not going to be in the city where dangerous people assault innocent people go to jail and assault more people the one thing that's different from everyone that signed a letter and Eric Adams I wore bulletproof vests for 22 years and protected the people of this city and when you do that then you have to write to question me on safety and Public Safety matters I think I know a little something about this don't write a letter call me and speak with me that is how we're going to resolve this there's a body of people that are coming into the city council they have no desire in moving our city forward their desire is to be disruptive what I am going to do I'm going to ignore them I'm going to stay committed undistracted and I'm going to grind if they like it or not I'm the mayor please note that Eric Adams likes to rename practices that have already been declared torture unconstitutional or controversial look out for that a little later on when we talk about stop and frisk but essentially this [ __ ] be rebranding [ __ ] like no it's not solitary confinement it's punitive segregation it's restrictive housing which is also [ __ ] nuts that he thinks punitive segregation sounds better than solitary confinement it's giving very much torture it's giving very much torture I knew and the folks that I work with and that I organize with and uh we knew it was going to be bad if Eric Adams were elected um it felt like and it has felt like sort of a trump situation where like we all were like oh my God given what he was saying um leading up to his election Trump is going to be horrible ground earth-shattering and he was still so much worse than any of us could have imagined that's how it felt when Eric Adams came into office I try to go back to that like day it was like the day after he was elected the very first thing that this man Eric Adams the freedom fighter that he was kind of at the Civil Rights leader he was he was claiming to be during the campaign his first act as mayor do you remember what it was he expanded solitary confinement on Rikers Island after he expanded uh uh solitary confinement on Rikers in his new new city council the majority of them actually voted to reprimand him for doing that he came out and publicly said I'm not going to listen to you city council because you have never been a police officer stating really clearly that the only opinions that actually matter when it comes to whether to lock someone up or not the conditions of confinement the torture of solitary confinement the only pins in that matter are those who made a living arresting people controlling people taking away people's freedom but that's the precedent he set right out the gate he's not a black mayor he is not the hip-hop mayor he's nypd's mayor Eric Adams was a Transit cop and NYPD Captain for 22 years but have you ever wondered how he became a police officer when Eric Adams was just 14 years old he was in a gang believe it or not he and his brother stole a TV set and a money order and were later arrested when Adams tried to cash that money order Adam said that at the station two white cops took the boys downstairs and began to beat them down kicking them in their groin in testicle areas so that the injuries wouldn't show up but that a black cop eventually looked into the room and told the officers that's enough they beat Eric Adams so bad that he said that he had blood in his urine for seven days and they sent him to juvie Adam said that it made his brother develop a deep hatred for the cops but not him he was drawn to the power these white men had beat the brakes off them two teenage boys and Eric Adams said that he thought to himself the cops had a great Hustle but that in particular he said he was enamored by the black cop the power that the black cop had to be able to tell the white cops to stop was the closest thing Eric Adams said that he'd seen to a black man being the equal of white folks and he liked that he said that he decided right then that the black cop was more powerful than the black Petty criminals he had admired that they had more clout more juice as the kids would say and he wanted to become a black policeman so he could get in on the quote free drinks the Swagger the respect the fear and that is a practice that we know mixy mayor Adams has taken full advantage of that is why Eric Adams became a black cop in his eyes it was the closest he could get to being the equal of a white man it was the most powerful he could become it was how he could instill Fair he decided he would not be a criminal when he realized that as a black cop in his neighborhood he could instill more fair get more respect and more perks this realization by Adams was his recognition that we live in a police state and he decided to buy in it did not matter to him that the way that these officers were commanding respect and power was through abusing black men and boys just like himself if he could be the black cop in the room his takeaway was about power not just this not Blackness but Power Eric Adams does not care about police brutality nor does he see being a police officer as a means of protecting black boys and men who are brutalized by the police in March 2022 NYPD officers claimed an 18 year old boy Luis Manuel Monsanto failed to stop for a traffic stop in the Bronx so the officers chased the boy and opened fire on his vehicle shooting him in the head leaving him in critical condition officers are actually prohibited from opening fire on moving Vehicles so Eric Adams basically comes out as both a defense attorney and a judge for the police in the case and tells us that the police decision to open fire on the unarmed 18 year old boy in a traffic stop despite that being expressly against NYPD policy is Justified because the vehicle itself was a weapon and he and his infinite discernment as Eric Adams reviewed all the evidence and determined without a shadow of a doubt that this young boy was going to roll over the officers with his car a claim that has never been substantiated video has never emerged evidencing this no weapons were ever recovered from the boy's car and he was never charged for any criminal activity whatsoever and in the day of days where vehicles are used in terrorist attacks to drive into crowds this we did we're dealing with a different moment in policing and we'll continue to train our police officers to deal with how noun vehicles are used as weapons to harm innocent people as well as police officers so this was not a rolling back this was not a backing up this was a a very clear uh attempt to uh drive at a police officer Eric Adams really manages to position the police officers as under attack and I find that especially ballsy of him to remind them that people are using vehicles in terroristic attacks to drive into crowds because it's always NYPD carrying out those attacks on protesters [Music] Eric Adams likes to dramatize the danger police face while dismissing the danger police pose to everyone else even while he's being confronted with the evidence of their brutality because in reality very few officers die in the line of duty in 2021 there was a record high in officers being killed on the job and that number was a whopping 73. compare that to the 779 people police have already killed just this year or the least 1201 people police killed last year but you wouldn't know that if you let Eric Adams tell it because that wouldn't fit his narrative which is why he simply lies two NYPD officers were killed during Eric Adams first month in office and when I say Eric Adams said baby I'm gonna milk this [ __ ] he milked that [ __ ] like a cow okay Eric Adams came out and told us that the loss of those officers reminded him of his dear dear Fallen officer friend who died in the line of duty in 1987. so dear a friend in fact that Adams has never stopped thinking about Robert so he carries his photo in his wallet with him for decades and he pulled out that picture like the saint he is until his former aides came forward and told the media that Adams had instructed them to print that [ __ ] picture off Google in black and white and to make it look worn in the wallet by spilling some goddamn coffee on it what what this [ __ ] is a menace and a showman despite how Eric Adams loves to invoke his impoverished upbringing to position himself as a working class man and his Petty crime-filled youth as a gang member trying to earn money to change his life circumstances Adams offers little to no sympathy Grace Compassion or even understanding of the boys and men who look like him and come from similar backgrounds and experiences and he demonstrates that repeatedly in his criminalization of young black boys especially those he in any way Associates with hip-hop that is who the black cop is that's what makes them particularly dangerous to the black community because as James Baldwin said black policemen were another matter we used to say if you must call a policeman for we hardly ever did for God's sake try to make sure it was a white one a black policeman could completely demolish you he knew far more about you than a white policeman could and you were without defenses for this black brother in uniform whose entire reason for breathing seemed to be to offer his proof that he was black but he was not black like you which is why it shouldn't surprise anyone that despite using that police brutality story to appeal to Black voters as someone who understood the issues with police brutality in a police state Eric Adams is a big don't talk to me about police brutality or black lives matter when there's black on black crime guy in fact Eric Adams thinks that the problem with white liberals is that they're too scared to talk about the real problem black on black crime quote you can't say black lives matter and have outraged when a police officer shoots someone but ignore shootings in our city the same day when 15 people are shot that's Eric Adams and it's interesting to me that he wants to dismiss the relevance of race and police brutality and act like black people are just making it about race despite the fact that black people are three times more likely than white people to be killed by the police but when that 84 year old white woman acts Eric Adams a question about the rent guidelines born at a town hall meeting Eric Adams told a little girl she was treating him like she was a plantation owner okay first if you're going to ask a question don't point at me and don't be disrespectful to me I'm the mayor of this city and treat me with the respect I which I deserve to be treated I'm speaking to you as an adult don't stand in front like you're treating someone that's on the plantation that you own give me the respect I deserve and engage in the conversation up here in Washington Heights treat me with the same level of respect I treat you so don't be pointing at me don't be disrespectful to me speak with me as an adult because I'm a grown man I walked into this room as a grown man and I'm a walk out of this room as a grown man I answered your question and it's response my team disproportionate to the unknowing air but everything he's seeing is very consistent with why he told us he became a cop Respect power and fear he will not be challenged by that lady or anybody else which is the reason he won't act we ask to a Rikers receivership but more on that later but back to his black on black crime comments think back to the rules of racial standing we discussed earlier a black man willing to Parrot a racist white talking point at the detriment of the black community so that white people can strip the sentiment of its obvious anti-blackness by pretending a black person can't be racist by pretending a black person can't be anti-black they're keeping it real they're abandoning group think mind you the black on black crime myth has been debunked a million times quote a report released by the U.S Department of Justice in 2017 found that of all the violent crime committed between 2012 and 2015 22.7 of the crime was committed by black people and 63 of those were committed against other black people this is in comparison to 44 of all violent crime committed by white people 57 of which were committed to gangs other white people according to the data white people commit crimes against other white people at about the same rate that black people do against other black people but despite these numbers you don't hear about white on white crime when a white person commits a crime against another white person it's just called crime race isn't a factor and that's intentional using language like black on black crime perpetuates the myth that interracial violence is specific to the black community a myth that implies black people are inherently more violent end quote and thus the problem is internal and not systemic and while I'm on the topic of Eric Adams powered him back racist talking points to legitimize them look no further than this attack on drill music and we are going to pull together whether the social media companies and sit down with them and state that you have a Civic and corporate responsibility so politicians tried to cancel rap seems quite familiar we've seen this before we've heard this song before tonight my guests talked the mayor's proposal we start with legendary rapper Willie D of the Ghetto Boys like instead of a lot of these politicians like talking to the youth they like to come after you the youth in hip-hop since its Inception has always been the low-hanging fruit so they like to attack hip-hop because they feel like they can get some easy points you know they don't they don't uh they don't respect the kids opinion they don't respect the youths uh they don't respect their their feelings their pain they don't respect uh their music but they want but then they say the kids are so disrespectful the generation is lost well if they're lost who lost the generation before them and it's people just like him who is a bigger problem instead of like talking after you he's making the same mistake that people like see to Lawrence Tucker made you know when in the 90s with hip-hop reality reality rap it's the same thing it's the same he's he's reading from the same playbook for some of those voters out there that are older when they hear oh yeah it's the youth it's the youngsters it's the music get them instead of going after the cause instead of looking at the cause why are these young kids out here making this type of music and you know and why and why is it that they even have a fan base in the first place it's got to be something bad so why not why not go deeper and try to you know and try to remedy the cause as opposed to the reaction Eric Adams Even managed to make George Floyd about black on black crime he said quote we must be holistic when we are talking about the George Floyd case don't mix it up police reform has nothing to do with the violence in our community but when we are talking about the Floyd case we should also be talking about the violence that we are seeing in Chicago a hundred people shot in Chicago over the July 4th weekend what the ACT actual [ __ ] the shootings in Chicago have to do with police officers kneeling on George Floyd's neck until he died in Minneapolis what the [ __ ] does that have to do with black on black crime he even threw in a little quote if I get killed on the job the odds are it would be a black person pulling the trigger end quote so considering how he feels about black people and black on black crime it shouldn't surprise you that Eric Adams brought back stock and frisk which you know was found unconstitutional so Adams is taken to calling it stop question and frisk authors were that under mayor Adams the NYPD has stopped tens of thousands of pedestrians citing vague reasons like quote fit relevant description and quote other just five percent were white a Starker racial disparity than during the height of stop and frisk under Bloomberg that's what people should be paying attention to it's not just like Eric Adams is bad he's the worst mayor for health and safety truth and Justice in the history of the city it was one of the most controversial things the NYPD ever did the policy known is stop and frisk it was supposed to be essentially ended that's because nearly all the stops at first by cops involved people of color but now the practice has returned and the NYPD and the mayor say crime is down partly because of it the federal monitor writes the results are disappointing too many people are stopped Frist and searched unlawfully at the precinct level commanding officers failed to identify and correct the unconstitutional policing and the Department's oversight is inadequate at all levels so when the monitor writes her report we should also talk about how many of the almost 10 000 illegal guns we removed off our streets backtrack nypd's anti-crime units use of stop and frisk is notoriously racist and violent in 2011 nearly 700 000 New Yorkers were stopped and frisk 90 percent of them were people of color and only two percent of them were actually found in possession of any unlawful items that's why it was ruled unconstitutional in 2013 and the court also created a position for a federal monitor to oversee nypd's anti-crime units that had employed the tactic because of their history of targeting Black and Hispanic people the units were responsible for so much disproportionate police shootings of black and brown people that the units were disbanded in 2020 but you know brought them back [ __ ] ass Eric Adams despite Eric Adams insistence that the anti-crime units would just suddenly not be racist in their use of stopping Frisk under his tenure and that they're finding all these illegal guns and drugs the federal monitor reported that quote almost all of the stocks made by The rebranded Neighborhood safety teams analyzed in the report 97 percent were Black and Hispanic people and 24 of the stocks were unconstitutional of 230 car stops included in the sample only two have appeared to turn up weapons the study found especially troubling numbers and a handful of precincts including the 41st Precinct in the Bronx where only 41 percent of the stops 32 percent of the frisks and 26 percent of the searches were constitutional according to the report and just another word on nypd's anti-crime unit said Eric Adams brought back do you know where those units originated from they originated from nypd's Street crime unit a unit that been disbanded in 2001 after a long history of violence and killings of black and brown New Yorkers the anti-crime units had grown out of nypd's Street crime units that killed Amadou Diallo in 1999 an unarmed black man who they shot 41 times now that you know about stop and frisk you should understand his commitment to invading the privacy and policing black and brown New Yorkers so it shouldn't shock you that he's not only embracing NYPD using drones to generally spy on New Yorkers but he explicitly announced the use of drones in relation to Backyard parties in other words on top of flooding black and brown neighborhoods with police he's now using drones to police and spy on black and brown New Yorkers without probable cause or even Reasonable Suspicion of any crime just that we are black that is happening Eric Adams is nobody's Progressive in fact Eric Adams perceives your average white liberal as a radical extremist so that should really tell you something he spoke at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2022 as a Communications expert at the request of house Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Representative Patrick Maloney where he vocally rebuked progressives activists and anyone supporting the funding the police and quote attacking corporations but this stance is consistent with the Eric Adams who asserted in 2021 that the true threat to America are the Democratic socialists and that in his race for mayor he was running against a movement the Democratic Socialist movement and in May of this year he gave a memorial speech where he goes full-on Republican okay denouncing socialism and communism not fascism mind you just socialism and communism which he blamed for quote the destruction playing out across the globe and then he insisted the problem of Young Americans was that they aren't patriotic enough and should be being forced to say the Pledge of Allegiance now that I think you understand who Eric Adams is let's talk about what he's actually done as mayor so you understand why New Yorkers hate him I wanted to cover Eric Adams worn the homeless his recent attack on migrants and his mishandling of the Rikers crisis separately because he's done enough damage in each individual area to Warrant their own sections but it's all tied together because these populations overlap because he's criminalizing all of them in other words how Eric Adams is treating and policing black and brown New Yorkers and House New Yorkers migrants seeking Asylum and the people incarcerated at Rikers are all intertwined because it's his treatment of each of those groups that's Landing them in Rikers so consider this a big chapter with a bunch of sub-chapters so let's zoom out and start from the top the the decisions that he he makes it's not only the messages the things that he talks about in order to say to do the things the the number of people locked up to pre-trial on Rikers Island has gone through the roof he's reversed a de Blasio era change and transparency and refused to let the media know about folks that have died on Rikers and 27 people have under his watch He's thrown all the money and even more at the world's richest and most costly and wasteful police force in the history of the world and given the back pay at the expense of other things like education libraries uh and and health care but it's also been how he's talked about the issue and and who's been listening and I think that's in some ways or at least at least as bad as the treatment of the people who he's claiming to represent the way that he's lying to New York City folks in New York City to New Yorkers to the rest of the country about health and safety about bail reform about uh policing isn't just I don't know scary people in the present but it's changing policy it's also it's losing Democrats elections to get a thorough overview of Eric Adams Administration and his handling or mishandling of the issues New Yorkers face let's zoom out and start with the budget cuts that were bad last year and worse this year before we address his war on the homeless and his exacerbation of the Rikers crisis individually and in depth because Eric Adams may be staunchly against the funding the police but he's not against the funding absolutely everything else the NYPD is the biggest and most expensive Police Department in the entire country NYPD is given more money and employs more police than any Department in the entire country in the entire country and it gets a third bigger each and every single year since 2010. please remember that when people namely Eric Adams are trying to paint New York City as Gotham and blaming it on the absence of police and talking all that Law and Order [ __ ] no place is a greater representation of the investment and continued failure of Law and Order than New York City New York City spends more money policing [ __ ] and I do mean [ __ ] than anywhere else so if it's Lawless around this [ __ ] perhaps it's time you try some new [ __ ] like giving people the resources they need for housing mental health health care and education maybe but you know who does not believe that [ __ ] [ __ ] ass Eric Adams because he continued to defund all that [ __ ] while continuing to find more and more money for NYPD in 2020 when Eric Adams first began crying that defunding the police was the great great danger we're all facing over 11 billion dollars was being given to the NYPD that amount has not only not decreased it's increased each year since as well as the amount of employed officers despite crime being at an all-time low over 85 percent of all summons Police Issue are to block around New Yorkers and over 90 percent of all people incarcerated at Rikers are black or brown New Yorkers last year Adams proposed a 615 million dollar budget cut to the Department of homeless Services a 215 million dollar cut to education that ended up being a net cut of 469 million dollars and cuts to Parts this included teacher layoffs loss of art programs closures of pools but while laying off teachers he proposed 200 million dollar increase to nypd's massive budget and an additional 90 million dollars for pay raises this year Eric Adams budget cuts were not only steep but if you ever had any doubt the kind of inhumanity they were based in listen to this disgusting xenophobic rant he did indistinguishable from something you would expect to hear from Texas governor Greg Abbott saying migrants are going to destroy New York City and that's why he's decided to gut funding for social services while continuing to line the nypd's pockets the same [ __ ] he was doing last year without this crisis take careful note of the countries he chooses to name when invoking this hysteria that migrants will ruin the city that they're coming to your neighborhood the dog whistles might miss you coming from a black man but if you close your eyes and just listen trust that it's deafening never in my life have I had a problem that I did not see in ending to I don't see an ending to this this issue will will destroy New York City we're getting 10 000 migrants a month one time we were just in Venezuela now we're in Ecuador now we're getting Russian speaking coming through Mexico now we're getting western Africa now we're getting people from all over the globe have made their minds up that they're going to come through the southern part of the border and come into New York City and everyone is saying it's New York City's problem every community in this city is going to be impacted we got a 12 billion dollar deficit that we're going to have to cut every service in this city is going to be impacted all of us and so I say to you as I turn it over to you some some of the most educated some of the most knowledgeable probably more of my Commissioners and Deputy Commissioners and Chiefs live in this community so as you ask me a question about migrants tell me what role you played how many of you organize to stop what they're doing to us how many of you were part of the movement to say we're seeing what this mayor is trying to do and they're destroying New York City it's going to come to your neighborhoods all of us are going to be impacted by this I said it last year when we had fifteen thousand I'm telling you now with a hundred and ten thousand the city we knew we're about to lose the only thing I'm going to add to this it is legal to seek asylum in this country that is a right Asylum Seekers are not doing anything illegal or wrong nor is the Adams Administration supporting them like he purports to be he is using them to further his own agenda in the press and to justify Cuts he was already going to make that he always makes and once we discuss Adam's treatment of homeless New Yorkers you won't believe for a second that he was trying to help the migrants this bus terminal became the first welcome sign for migrants after hours long Journeys from Texas but the mayor says to his frustration they are still arriving by the busload power Malu was there when the first buses of migrants arrived we are on the ground we've outlasted every city agency that has come in to the Port Authority which is a disgrace a year later he says the city's resources have been mismanaged and the responsibility now falling onto organizers like him several months ago we saw the city here with Senators welcome I mean the migrants with open arms providing resources at what point did you see that change so unfortunately the migrants have been used as political pawns since day one which is why you had so many City agencies and politicians popping their head in because it was really popular it was a way for them to show that they actually cared but there was no real follow-through hotels like the historic Roosevelt became intake shelters for migrants the city says they quickly filled up and the issue became a blame game between the mayor and local Aid groups they're not looking at the migrants as human beings they're looking at them as numbers they're looking at them as a way to get more money from the federal government and they're also using them for their own tactic which is to deter more people from coming here to New York City out of the more than 110 000 who have arrived many of them are families first aid Jitters for the nearly twenty thousand newly arrived children and during classrooms all across the city it is the story of New York City we don't treat people as Outsiders we welcome them with open arms Adams is using Asylum Seekers to hide behind the Sleep budget cuts he's just proposed to everything but the police the police Union the police benevolent Association a multi-year 5.5 billion dollar deal and Eric Adams was too proud to announce this historic agreement with the PBA just look at him is it giving the penny pension that he was just giving us when he was talking about the Asylum Seekers oh okay today we are very excited to make an important announcement with our partners at the PBA and to do that I'd now like to introduce mayor Adams today we're making it clear that New York City will support the men and women of the NYPD as they do one of the toughest jobs anywhere we're here to announce a new deal with the police benevolent Association that would do just that this is a historic deal only the third voluntary contract with the PBA in 30 years one that will make sure our officers get the benefits and compensation they deserve allow them to work a more flexible schedule build morale going forward and ensure that New York Remains the safest big city in America and I want you to thank our team Brendan and Renee jock and his team and their teams for the last few months we have been in conversation working throughout the weekends coming to the table repeatedly this [ __ ] was laying off teachers without remorse last year he's looking to make cuts to public libraries that would close many branches and City agencies like fire sanitation parks and homeless services but he wouldn't dream the police don't get bonuses because he's the police listen to him listen to the way he thanks Pat the PBA president for lobbying on behalf of the police because as he tells us Pat is his friend and then I want to thank uh Pat person that I've known for many years and he stood firm and Tall to make sure he could deliver for his members as myself when in your [ __ ] life have you ever seen management or the powers that be thank the union for fighting them for their benefits and what they deserve not [ __ ] never but you're seeing it here because the police Union not fighting Adams they the goddamn police they're not fighting anyone in a police state that's why they get get while teachers get layoffs and education gets so many budget cuts that even the high school students themselves start protesting it students parents and teachers found last year's budget cuts were just too hard to swallow and now some students are taking a proactive approach this morning to change what they say went wrong last year so they can make sure their education resources are available to them moving forward in the next year to come and for years to come they don't want to see any more of these Cuts so they are taking a stand and they want their voices heard a group of students organizing a walk out and rally at City Hall today protesting Year's 469 million dollars in funding Cuts over the summer mayor Eric Adams and the City Department of Education ordered the budget cuts to avoid a shortfall an appeals court ruled the doe could go ahead with the funding Cuts but the ruling also found the city did not follow State procedures when it approved the education budget this could mean changes to how future city budgets are passed and Eric Adams has been confronted directly about the high school students protesting his budget cuts to Education First of all have been high school as a person who has participated in protests throughout my life seeing our young children involved in Civic engagement warms my heart just do it on Saturday and Sunday I would like for them to be in school but having them engage having them analyzing the budget I'm going to go to that school and I'm going to give them an analysis of our budget we want this Civic engagement with our students I think it's commendable that they are getting involved and these important issues and they too I would like for them to do a letter writing campaign to the federal government and say we need to be treated New York City fairly around the money that we're putting into the Asylum Seekers and we should get our fair share of tax dollars back to the city and so I would like for them to stay engaged and I'm really pleased that they were out I heard them from my room of you know talking about this issue we know we're doing the right thing around education Jacques would break that down uh when he do when he does his analysis and we listen to uh councilwoman Rita Joseph came up with some good ideas and we believe we've done some great things around education we'll continue to do so but hooray for those students but just do it on the weekend Adam takes the opportunity to not only blame the Asylum Seekers as though he didn't cut 469 million dollars from education just last year before he was even bemoaning this migrant crisis but to pretend he thoughtfully engaged these students and their questions are that he's proud of their civic engagement Adams makes two more noteworthy horrific budget cuts one pertaining to Rikers that I'll discuss a little later in that section and the other well the other he decided mattered so much he used his very special veto power for the second time ever the first time he uses veto power was in January 2022 who oppose increasing penalties for zoning violations but do you want to know what he opposed so much he had to veto it foreign [Music] s going head-to-head with some members of the city council yeah this comes after he voted vetoed a number of bills that would have expanded eligibility for affordable housing you don't see the tents you don't see the cardboard boxes when they are identified we immediately move to rectify the situation mayor Adams defending his administration's efforts to help homeless people get off New York city streets and Subways our city is not a city where people who are in need of care should be living on the streets where they don't get that care the mayor's remarks coming on the same day he vetoed a number of bills passed by city council that addressed the city's affordable housing crisis the council's package of bills allow more people to qualify for the city's Housing Voucher Program the program subsidizes rent to help homeless New Yorkers move from shelters into permanent housing it would also assist those facing eviction city council member Parina Sanchez represents the Bronx it was legislation that would have increased access to housing vouchers for New Yorkers who were struggling with eviction and that would have moved people who are in shelters into permanent housing faster mayor Adams says what the city council wants would simply be too expensive adding quote it's a structure that could saddle taxpayers with billions of dollars in costs each year this legislation also clearly exceeds the council's legal Authority city council member Sanchez disagrees she says Council has the votes to override the mayor's veto it is much more expensive to keep a family in a shelter than it is to keep them in an apartment this showdown between the mayor and city council comes at a time when the shelter system is stretched to its limits thousands of Asylum Seekers continue to arrive in the city each week straining the city's resources well the timing of this tension not ideal for the ongoing budget talks the mayor and city council must agree on a new spending plan by July 1st the city council on the other issue of housing vouchers has 30 days to come up with the votes to override the mayor's veto this is the same [ __ ] throwing homeless people out the Subways tearing up their encampments on the streets cutting money from the Department of homeless services and now he vetoes the bills that would give people vouchers for housing Eric Adams wants homeless people in Rikers points blank period and that is not hyperbole ask yourself where else could he possibly expect they go bet better yet ask yourself where does it seem like he wants them to go hmm he don't want them in the housing hotels the subways all the streets so where and override it the New York City Council Members did but that was just one of Eric Adams many acts and what can only be described as his war against homeless people there is no truly accurate measurement of the amount of homeless people living in New York City but as of June 2023 according to the Coalition of the homeless there are over 84 526 homeless people including 27 530 homeless children sleeping each night in New York City's main Municipal City shelters a near record 25 061 single adults slept in shelters each night in June of 2023. that's just who's in the shelters not on the streets or in Rikers the vast majority of homeless New Yorkers in the shelter system are black and brown are suffering from mental illness severe health problems or at least one disability the research shows that the primary cause of homelessness for New Yorkers is lack of affordable housing eviction doubled up or severely overcrowded housing domestic sick violence job loss and hazardous housing conditions and yet Eric Adams has chosen to do the exact opposite of addressing the causes of homelessness by instead criminalizing the homeless vetoing their opportunities for housing cutting the budget for the Department of homeless services and is now looking to suspend New York City's right to shelter laws all together under the guise of being overwhelmed by the migrant crisis in this morning mayor Adams is facing push back from advocates for the homeless after taking action to modify the city's long-standing right to shelter policy the court order was put in place in the 80s granting people a safe place to sleep it comes as the mayor says the city's been overwhelmed by more than 70 thousand Asylum Seekers over the last mayor Eric Adam saying he is not looking to end the right to shelter but he does want a judge to suspend it until they get a better grasp on the situation now many are arguing though that this has been a Lifeline for Catalyst New Yorkers seeking shelter and critical services and it should not be touched it's being called a humanitarian crisis New York City dealing with a sizable influx of Asylum Seekers now the mayor alleging it's reaching an uncontrollable level that New York Legacy laws should be altered just yesterday he filed this application requesting the city no longer be required to comply with a four-decade old court order which mandates this city provides shelter to anyone who requests it Adams actually began his term as mayor by invoking the wildest hysteria in propaganda around homeless people causing crime in the Subways and then he added a thousand more cops to the New York City Subways to force homeless people out and back onto the street we start tonight with Subway safety mayor Adams unveiled an aggressive plan to remove all homeless people the problem of the homeless on the Subways sleeping on trains urinating on platforms bringing shopping carts and belongings have bedeviled Mayors for decades but mayor Adams former Transit captain Eric Adams is just not going to put up with it anymore he's sending his cops in teams of Outreach workers to remove them ASAP the subway plan is a comprehensive Civic strategy that will do more than deal with a temporary fix can't put a Band-Aid on a cancerous sore that is not how you solve the problem you must remove the cancer and start the healing process Adam said he will start by requiring the police to strictly enforce Transit rules such as sleeping across multiple seats exhibiting aggressive behavior and creating an unsanitary environment cops will also demand that the homeless leave the train at the end of the line because we got so used to being dysfunctional that it became the normality well I'm not a dysfunctional mayor and I don't pretend that a problem doesn't exist it's troubling that mayor in such a large city would use terms like disgusting or cancer to refer to his homeless constituents um these are people these are human beings who deserve care and respect and dignity and especially sick part to this sick ass plan was Eric Adams plan to hospitalize homeless people for mental illness against their will sleeping on the streets and Subways whether they like it or not CBS 2's Ellie Bellman has reaction Adams says the city has a moral obligation to get them help but some Advocates argue that the plan addresses symptoms of homelessness without treating the root causes Ramel Rich has been living on the streets in Greenwich Village for a few months now I'm not mentally ill I just have big issues we asked him about the mayor's homeless Outreach plan I feel that's bad because a lot of hospitals and agencies are enforced against us people who have mental ill issues you can't stop that hospitals are hard to answer mayor Adams is now directing First Responders and Outreach workers to transport people experiencing a mental health crisis to a hospital if they are a danger to themselves or unable to meet their basic needs Adams insists state law gives him this Authority we believe this is the first time that a Maryland Administration has given this direction on the basic needs standard in official Guidance the city will set up a teleconsult hotline which First Responders can use to show a clinical expert the person they're dealing with in real time from there teams decide whether to bring them in for a full psychoval when that full evaluation happens the psychiatrist May conclude this is not someone with mental illness this is somebody who is on drugs different issue doesn't isn't part of the mental health law the New York civil liberties Union though Likens Adams's plan to the policies of former mayor Rudy Giuliani acting as if you can sweep a problem at a public view right and it'll go away well it doesn't go away it doesn't provide the treatment that's necessary for a long-term solution and it causes great harm to individuals who are themselves hurting quite a bit some Advocates argue City Hall should instead Focus its efforts on permanent housing where will they be discharged to after they're done with the period of hospitalization or evaluation while the Legal Aid Society applauds the mayor for addressing the Mental Health crisis attorney Jeffrey Berman says the land does not address the revolving door of prison the people that the the Adams is speaking about often get arrested are we going to divert them into meaningful robust Community treatment so that they never ever get arrested again and so that they never have to go to a psychiatric emergency room and no the plan was and absolutely is not to keep homeless and mentally ill people from being churned in and out of Rikers but we'll get to Rikers soon one successfully forced back onto the streets Adams began tearing down the encampments homeless people live in all over the city throwing them out with all of their belongings with absolutely no regard to placing them in housing as well as arresting them and Advocates there is pushback this morning against mayor Adam's sweep of homeless encampments across the city some are upset after the city Crews forcibly removed an encampment in the East Village yesterday led to a standoff and several arrests CBS 2's John Diaz joins us live from City Hall with more John Chris Emanuel seven hours that's how long these homeless people and their Advocates stood Resolute but in the end though mayor Eric Adams coming out the Victor he won you know his efforts clearing out another homeless encampment what started off as an hours-long standoff ended with seven people arrested for refusing to leave a homeless encampment in the East Village amid the colds and Rain the unhoused New Yorkers and several Advocates defiantly stood their ground against New York City Police and sanitation workers before they then swiftly removed the tents these people once called home Cynthia V says it's an affordable housing issue if you're living from paycheck to paycheck you're one family problem one's illness one crisis away from being an intent next to mine but what we need to understand is Erica and nothing really demonstrates the true depth to how little Humanity Eric Adams has for black and brown people the unhoused the mentally ill the marginalized that in his treatment of the people at Rikers we are finally to the final major section the personal thorn in my side as it pertains to Eric Adams and that's Rikers I would just like to take a moment to scream [Music] all right I'm going to give you or I'm going to try to give you a comprehensive overview of the Rikers crisis the plans are closed Rikers and everything Eric Adams is doing to exacerbate the crisis and prove to me that he is a demon Straight From Hell Rikers is New York City's Infamous pre-trial Detention Center where black and brown New Yorkers have been terrorized since 1932. a lesser known fact is that over 85 percent of the people there have not been convicted of a crime they many times simply do not have the money to purchase their freedom to fight their case from the outside the jail has been notorious for human rights abuses for decades and is considered a humanitarian crisis despite a widely popular campaign to close Rikers especially after the death of Khalif Browder a 16 year old who was wrongly accused of stealing a backpack and sent to Rikers for two years where he spent the majority of his time in solitary confinement before he was released and eventually took his own life no substantive steps have been made to close the jail in fact as we discussed earlier Eric Adams has continued the use of solitary confinement despite the opposition of the council members and instead taken to calling it restrictive housing and punitive segregation and New York continues to spend 860 million dollars on the jail each year people died Riker's awaiting trial each and every single year as a result Rikers has been overseen by a federal monitor who reports the federal judge T Swain since 2014 as a part of a class action settlement Federal monitor has held Rikers in contempt repeatedly federal monitor's job was to muscle New York City into getting the situation under control but Rikers has demonstrably failed to comply with every new report and mandate from the monitor so the monitor along with Damien Williams the United States Attorney for the southern district of New York have also called for a receivership insisting that Rikers is no better off than it was eight years ago and that the city should be held in contempt for failure to combat the escalating violence in 2021 16 people died in Rikers making it the then highest death toll since 2013. that was until Eric Adams became mayor a record 27 people have died in Riker since he became mayor of the seven deaths to occur this year staff were disciplined in five of the seven for fault which involved things like security lapses like unlocked doors and lack supervision if you're wondering why you hadn't heard about that it's because Eric Adams quite literally made sure you didn't in May the Department of Corrections announced that they were no longer going to notify the media and the public of in-custody deaths Adam's Administration decided that instead of continuing to field negative backlash and public outrage to the mounting deaths at Rikers while still refusing to admit that he cannot handle the problem he would simply stop telling the public about it you can't be outraged about what you don't know about the Department of Corrections didn't even bother to make this announcement until the media discovered that they'd failed to notify the public of at least two deaths including those of rubuzao 52 year old who died after he allegedly jumped from an upper tear of a specialized unit on Rikers for people with mental illness on May 14th end of Joshua Valles 31 years old who died this year after suffering from a fractured skull that officials first internally labeled as a heart attack if it's striking you is suspicious how officials say someone died of a heart attack and it turns out they had a fractured skull it should and we're going to get to the cover-ups of death at Riker shortly when I actually explained this sudden decision to stop notifying the public and the media of in custody deaths the Adams Administration response was simply that it was a practice from the de Blasio Administration that they chose to do not a policy so they just not going to do it no more child this kind of attempt to keep the public in the dark via Rikers is very consistent for Eric Adams Administration which has also blocked the board of Correction which is supposed to oversee the Department of Corrections from having access to real-time video surveillance on Rikers and other city jails Adams has been attempting to conceal Riker's abuse and stop change from the inside from day one of his administration when he hired commissioner Molina who immediately fired the head of internal affairs and staff discipline Serena Townsend when she refused to dismiss 2 000 complaints against Corrections Officers which is why I called her up so she could really break it down to us directly um so my name is Serena Townsend I am a criminal defense attorney and prior to my being a criminal defense attorney I worked as the Deputy Commissioner of the investigation and trials division on Rikers Island um I did that for about five and a half years and what that means is I was the person in charge of all of the investigations into Riker's staff misconduct and then the attempt at holding those people accountable for their misconduct so yes I had not only did I have an Insider's view of Rikers Island by working at the Department of Correction but I had The Insider's Insider's view I had the ability to kind of investigate everything that was going on there from staff sleeping on post to sexual abuse on Rikers Island to everything in between particularly excessive use of force things like that you know I think the overarching uh issue that we're seeing right now is Rikers Island although it's always been a hell hole it's always been problematic the culture of Rikers Island is toxic what you're seeing with mayor Adams is kind of an exponentially bad situation because of the fact that he's sending more people there than previous Mayors have in the past previous police Commissioners Etc he's claiming that because there's so many people on Rikers Island and because crime is so bad he certainly can't close Rikers or improve it and then of course the issue of transparency he is systematically along with obviously the commissioner that he hired commissioner Louis Molina they have been since day one systematically closing all of the doors of transparency making sure that nobody knows what's going on there and fudging you know different statistics and numbers to make it seem like things are improving when they're actually not essentially since day one the commissioner commissioner Molina has wanted to run things the way that he wants to run them and unfortunately the way that he wants to run it is with a lot of yes men around him and a lot of opacity so on day one he fired me um I was yeah so you know maybe I'm a bit biased but um I had been bringing the department into compliance with investigations of misconduct the unions didn't really like that because what that meant was I was working hand in hand with a federal monitor who was overseeing the excessive use of force on Rikers Island and we were partnering to try to make the investigations into those excessive use of force allegations more efficient more fair increase accountability and transparency and I was doing just that which pissed off the unions commissioner Molina alongside mayor Adams wanted to make nice with the police unions make nice with the correction officers benevolent Association also known as Koba and the captain's Union and they served my head up on a silver platter as kind of an offering on day one which made the unions very happy um and so with my firing there really was no accountability over the misconduct that was happening he didn't even have a replacement lined up for me which just goes to show how much he thought of accountability for his Department he didn't even have somebody to run the place once he fired me um but it's not just about me at all that was just the first step in shrouding the entire place so after firing me he has taken a lot of steps to make sure that the public is not aware of what's going on on Rikers Island one of the most um effective oversight agencies that has been there for quite some time is the board of Correction and the board of Correction like my division always had access to all the surveillance cameras on Rikers Island in real time it's honestly the only way you could really know what's going on on Rikers Island in a quick efficient way so that you could fix problems and know what's going on um Molina has cut their access cut the oversight boards access which is really alarming and and frankly it's strange that somebody would be able to cut the access of their own oversight agency like you would think that the power Continuum goes the opposite direction you know that the board would be able to say to Molina what he should or should not be doing not that Molina should be able to kind of take the access away right right it's really strange um but it nobody has done anything really to um to fix that except that the board has recently filed a lawsuit against the city and against Molina himself personally for taking away that access and that litigation is pending so that's something uh that the commissioner has done to keep the public uninformed what else has he done he stopped communicating with the federal monitor which is a big No-No that's enough that's the main oversight um entity that exists right now uh and that is really really bad and that is not how things were before he took the Helm of the department uh he also told the press that he was going to stop reporting deaths in custody to the media which I know is something you knew about what you got very upset about just as I did and you've been trying to publicize that horrific decision just like I have it's just as you said the public already doesn't know that much about what goes on on Rikers Island but the few avenues that have existed in the past to allow the public that knowledge have now been cut off yeah and Eric Adams has gone in particular it was funny because de Blasio was always you know complacent and always felt like scared and like these people run him but Eric Adams goes out of his way to empower them like the amount of like between you know these cover-ups essentially these cover-ups that you might be asking yourself what cover-ups am I referring to well last year video footage emerged of three Corrections Officers standing and watching Michael Neves a man incarcerated in Riker's mental health unit bleed to death for 10 minutes after slitting a stroke with a razor blade he'd been given shortly after a corrections officer placed Kevin Bryan inside of a staff bathroom where he hung himself from a pipe after that Herman Diaz choked to death on an orange while other incarcerated people unsuccessfully begged officers to intervene and they did not three months after that Antonio Bradley hung himself in a holding cell but Adam chose not to inform the U.S Department of Justice of the in custody death preventing the federal government from sending someone down to launch an investigation until much later when questioned about the cover-up Adam's response was I don't see that as a cover-up or a violation of any rule if it is we will definitely correct it but my understanding is that the place of death is a place where they died the time him going to to Rikers to basically you know support the Corrections Officers I um I feel like that has been that has been different what do you what do you think of like Eric Adams response to the deaths at Rikers yeah um it's so interesting you're right um there's been an obvious standing together with the unions in fact when mayor Adams announced that commissioner Molina was his pick right before taking office he stood up there with the correction captains and Correction union uh presidents which I've never seen before um and he even said oh I want my people with me referencing the union presidents which is very different from what we've seen in the past uh we uh we are let me let me see what's going on to the left for me hold on what are we doing what are we doing huh there's a little office that we're out there what are we doing okay I want my units here with me you know that we we we're Partners here one thing you're going to find folks that there's one set of hands on the steering wheel of this city right now they're mine I'm the leader I'm the mayor I'm going to make the determinations and I'm gonna make the audibles um Eric Adams's response to the deaths in custody has been so offensive and so alarming because he even said uh about a year ago when he was criticized for the amount of deaths in custody he said well let's find out why they died why did these people die because they're coming to Rikers Island with pre-existing conditions and he spoke way too soon because we did find out why those people died and most of the time those people died because of Staff misconduct because they're not Staffing posts correctly and they're lying about that because of the fact that officers are not touring appropriately because of the fact that drugs are getting into Rikers Island from God knows where but certainly through staff visitors Etc um and nothing's being done about it you will see over and over and over again if anyone was allowed access to videos anymore that detainees are smoking all of the time they're taking drugs all of the time in front of officers and the officers are not doing anything and when you hear the numbers of deaths from overdoses and suicides then you have to turn to Mayor Adams and say that's why they're dying you're an [ __ ] you cannot get up there ignorant and say let's look at why they're dying because they have a pre uh a precondition uh and then that's actually not what's happening so why is Riker still open in 2019 the campaign to close Rikers emerged and Advocates introduced the plan to shut it down by reducing the Jail's population to 3 300 and closing the additional rundown city jails committing the same abuses against the people within it Adams promised that if elected he would support former mayor Bill De Blasio's plan to close the jail altogether and to create quote quote quote systemic change but Adams now opposes the plan to close Rikers by 2027. his argument is that too many people are incarcerated at Rikers for them to close the jail by then because Wherever Would we put these people who haven't been convicted of a crime while they await their trial I mean I imagine that we could put them in the same place that we put rich people accused of the crimes their [ __ ] house but let's explore his argument Rikers was only Built to hold 3 000 people but it currently contains approximately 5 500 people that is why the cells are packed looking like this New York City's Landmark bail reform addressed this issue by eliminating cash fail for most misdemeanors low-level offenses and non-violent crimes in turn Riker's population was drastically reduced a necessary step to closing the jail according to New York City Comptroller's office there has been essentially no change in the monthly percentage of people rearrested while pending trial after Bill reform and yet and yet and yet unfounded fair mongering by people like Adams has brought about rollbacks that rules the population about seven to eleven percent precisely so we can keep the right good population High then used as his justification for why the jail can't close anytime soon it's evil world we live in yeah let me let me also say it's like bail reform you know has has become this like flash point using heavy air quotes um and it's like this this debate who's for you know decarceration or who's like for you know safety like who you know and and here's the reality of of it's not just you know not just bail before but when we talk about policing and when we talk about um surveillance and we talk about probation and parole we talk about all these things that intersect with the criminal legal system at the end of the day what we're talking about is public health and Public Safety and there's this perception that folks who are like advocating and talking about bail reform you and B don't care about public health and safety and that's outrageous I mean do I have to go out and say like I care about New York City I lived there for 20 years recently moved but like I had a child there do I need to like and my whole family lives there to like prove to you that I actually don't want people getting hurt or my family to be at risk like no I obviously want public health and safety and because of that it's important that like we I all of us follow facts if it turned out that bail reform and bail reform is pre-trial Freedom extra services in New York it's just um uh folks that are charged with the lowest level uh misdemeanor or misdemeanors in the lowest level felonies are released if we just go by the facts it is enormously successful when it comes to health and safety it proves that you can maximize both freedom justice racial Justice and cost savings and and everything it's like it's like the perfect thing and and yet um people think that it that it does the opposite instead knowing what we know now though it's not just like I support it because I care about safety because I care about health because I care about human beings because I care about physical responsibility all those things we should be expanding it not limiting it not pulling into whatever we should be expanding it and yet we're not and we're fighting to just like just hold on to one of the best public policies for health and safety in the history of the country one that Democrats could instant could stand behind and should stand behind and educate their voters and instead we're lying to the people Eric Adams is lying to the people about what the decarceration actually means what this policy actually means and what it's doing is it's causing us to just continue to make the same damn mistakes at enormous cost fiscal and human costs that we continue to make that's why I hate Eric Adams stop it man Adams continues to oppose bail reform and ask lawmakers to pass more restrictive laws that would increase Rikers already Sky High population as well as a point more tough on crime judges that is not the conduct of someone who has any interest in lowering the Jail's population to facilitate its closing despite acknowledging that it's already thousands of people too high and has caused deaths violence suicide and rampant abuse he's also fighting off calls for a receivership so what is a receivership a receivership would allow the court to appoint a non-partisan expert who is given wide latitude to address the crisis and be answerable only to the court and not state and local laws and bureaucratic agencies which would allow them to make progress in ways that the City personnel could not in other words it wouldn't be strapped by all of the kind of red tape in minutia and then once brought up the Constitutional standards the control of Rikers would then automatically revert to the state and locality so here's what pisses me off about Eric Adams Rikers and the receivership this [ __ ] knows that Rikers is out of control he knows it he knows it he knows it and the only [ __ ] reason is [ __ ] doesn't want Rikers to be placed on the receivership is because of the number one thing he cares about power Eric Adams simply cannot seed control of Rikers long enough to save people's lives because he doesn't like the idea of admitting that he cannot handle the problem EGO power that's all it is so a lot of people um including I think yourself and myself support Federal receivership for Rikers Island um it's not uh to say that we don't want Rikers Island to also close but I think our concern is while it's open and while we're getting there uh it needs to be reformed as soon as possible so that people are safe it's a harm reduction strategy and anybody who cares about their constituents and who cares about people in custody I know cares about staff actually who are working on Rikers Island should support receivership uh because it's the only thing at this point that would work and his response has been all about himself and all about his ego the first thing that came out of his mouth when he was interviewed about Federal receivership was well what does that say about me if I can't you know if you're taking away Rikers Island from me you're saying I can't do a good job well it's not about you though it's about getting the job done safely and humanely yes he's a [ __ ] egomaniac yeah to sum up to sum up and it's very sad because again you know he claims to stand with the union and to stand with the union members which is the staff and by the way I'm not anti-staff either necessarily I know that they work hard and that some of them are doing the wrong thing but some of them are doing the right thing and the entire place is problematic for anybody who steps foot in there whether you are a detainee a staff member a visitor a contractor anybody and anybody without you know choosing their ego over doing the right thing would be able to admit that and it's very hard for him to admit it and it's unfortunate um you know and the hope is that with the involvement of the federal Monitor and the you know the plaintiffs in the Nunez consent decree so you know legal aid Etc um that with the push for federal receivership the judge will you know be willing to realize that this is not that this is the better path receiver yeah and that you know the only reason that the city is not going for it is because of an ego trip which is horrific reason right exactly and I think and I think that's the thing that people mistake when I say I'm like I hate Eric Adams for substantive reasons he materially is in the way he's actively preventing us from doing the things and it's for vocally shallow reasons and this need to the the it's not just that we call Eric Adams a cop because he was a cop or to be arbitrary just because I hate cops all that is true but but it's because he goes out of his way to constantly reinforce us that that is his team like that is his number one priority and I see it every time and it's not a staffing shortage either that is a popular misconception constantly floated about Rikers they are big on abusing the sick leave policy and commissioner Molina facilitates it he stops suspending officers for being AWOL and taking illegal sick leaves and he appointed assistant Deputy Warden Wayne price who has been under a two-year investigation for stealing time to oversee the sick leave investigation so as many experts have already said the there is no shortage of staff on Rikers Island it's the most richly staffed jail in the country um it's about a one to one or a little bit more than one-to-one ratio from officer to um detainee and the problem that Rikers has is favoritism and people just not knowing how to manage the staff numbers that they have there are people who take advantage of sick leave there are people who take advantage of um you know just knowing the right people so they get a cushy gig and even though they're a correction officer they don't actually work in the jails um one of my favorite stories is from when I was still working there and Vincent giraldi was our commissioner and we call it the Columbus Day Massacre because it happened on Columbus Day when commissioner sharaldi came and realized that he there were some pretty badly unstaffed posts on Rikers Island um and because it was Columbus Day the courts were closed and therefore the correction officers who worked in the courts were not really needed there obviously the courts closed right um and there were like 10 correction officers assigned there and he um went there and said you know you need to go back you need to be redeployed to Rikers Island because you're not needed here in the courts you are needed on Rikers Island and all of a sudden they all came down with ailments that required them to call an ambulance to take them off of Rikers Island and the most offensive part which I love so much is not only did they all come down with ailments immediately as soon as they were told to read deploy one person actually went to his car that was parked at Rikers Island and pulled out a cane so that when the ambulance arrived he could show just how badly injured he was and therefore he could not work um so you know when when they say that that there's not enough Staffing a lot of it is because people are not coming to work um and what commissioner Molina will do again with the fuzzy math and you know convincing people that he's doing better when he's not is he'll say something along the lines of this he'll say oh well before I came here x number of people were out sick let's say you know 300 people were out sick and now only a hundred people are out sick therefore I have more staff working but the truth is a lot of those people who were out sick who are now not out sick they're not working they've either been fired or they've resigned or whatever so you know it's a it's a nice little omission of the fact that allows the commissioner to say that I've been improving things when really you still have these unstaffed posts I have people talking to me all the time about this whether it's a clients or staff members who reach out to to me there's on staff posts all of the time and it's not because they don't have the staff necessarily it's that they're not hiring correctly and because they're not managing the staff that they do have correct and exploiting that sick leave policy right like yes yes and I want to talk about what you had just said before uh because I think you're gonna love it about Eric Adams being a hypocrite because let's talk about what you just said you said that Eric Adams was out defending these correction officers and police officers who do harm to people like kill them you know shoot them and kill them right then he'll also say out of that same mouth that the people who are on Rikers Island deserve to be there even though they haven't been convicted yet because they've done horrible horrible things well you and I both know because of our work as defense attorneys that most people including that correction officer or police officer who killed or shot that person would otherwise normally be on Rikers Island not getting defended by the mayor to you know not not be charged not have bail set all that stuff so to me and to you and I think to rational people we look at that and we say well who's on Rikers Island then just the people that you don't defend because I know there's a lot of people on Rikers Island who've done way less than shoot somebody with a gun despite the fact that New York City has proved incapable of stopping or even slowing the mounting atrocities at Rikers Eric Adams continues to resist calls for a federal receivership that would give Rikers the necessary overhaul it needs instead he's continually called for increases to Riker's already 860 million dollar yearly budget for the prison and the 2.6 billion dollars given to its staff so he could hire more officers Adams has continued to make the argument that the reason for the crisis at Rikers is a staffing shortage when in reality there are 5 600 people detained at Rikers but there are 7 575 Corrections Officers they have literally thousands more Corrections Officers than they have incarcerated people there is not a staffing shortage and while he wants to increase the money for Corrections Officers just to drive it home to us just so much he doesn't give a [ __ ] about the people suffering at Rikers he recently announced that he will be eliminating classes and re-entry services at Rikers the Gotham is reported the Adams Administration is eliminating programs that help detainees get jobs find housing stay off drugs and reconnect with loved ones once they're released from Rikers Island in order to save 17 million dollars in next year's budget we were blindsided and in shock said Ronald day vice president of programs at the fortune Society one of the five non-profit agencies informed on Monday that their contracts due to expire next year were suddenly mixed the canceled classes covered training and carpentry and plumbing skills financial literacy cognitive behavioral therapy drug relapse prevention and anger management the last day of class will be June 30th dozens of full-time employees who work daily in the jails including the formerly incarcerated will lose their positions some of the programs operated in various forms at Rikers and the floating jail in the East River for decades the agency's contracts together make up just 1.4 percent of the Department of Corrections 1.2 billion dollar budget but the cuts were ordered by Eric Adams who has tasked City agencies with eliminating four percent in spending it is mismanagement it is neglect it is cruelty it is ego but most importantly it is just about power oh listen I may not have gotten to your favorite personal reason for why you hate Eric Adams I am so sorry but believe you me there are a million I had a database of like 5 000 articles of every time this [ __ ] didn't get on my [ __ ] nerves to comb through to pick what to put in here so trust me a lot was left on The Cutting Room floor but I did ask my Twitter followers why they hated Eric Adams so I wanted to at least put some of those answers so here are some honorable mentions before I give you all my final thoughts no if you made it to the end of this video if you made it all the way to the end of this video damn you're really a hater for real son you a hater for real but I like that I like that I like that what you gonna do okay okay sorry just y'all know how much work this was I hope that this has been a very productive look into why everybody with good sense knows that Eric Adams is a conch show I feel like this is a really New York City video so Raheem should make an appearance as a true New York City Cat I adopted Rahim from Bushwick cats he used to be a Kingpin of the streets of Bushwick and we are also big big proponents of Flatbush cats who recently opened a Veterinary Clinic so shout out to them be nice say hi to the camera Lord say hi
