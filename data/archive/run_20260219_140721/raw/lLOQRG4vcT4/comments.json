        "text": "@Wamsuo58uyes immigrants that come over legally not crossing a border illegally. They jumping the line in front of people that legally going through the process. I found it so funny now quick they got raid of all those Haitian people. \n\nThe question that need to be ask of you can’t take care of your own citizens why bring over more you can’t take care of. SSI comes out my check even check it money I pay into the system for retirement etc but it a sad state that the government over spending all of it. People going to be crying and many are now as we starting to see secret tax rates pop up to pay for all this. This country going to become a third world country as we on a fast track to becoming one. What will these immigrants do when we go to war and the economy turns to a third world country as it becoming one. Will they run back home like the cowards they are and not try to fight for there country? Will they try to find the next green spot that will take them , not a lot of countries will openly do that? To make a place livable we have to have good border and people willing to work together. If not the problem is just going to move to the new place they go. It happened time and time again in history it haded to Roman so I not making it up. A place can’t support the big banks ruling class rich and take on huge amount of immigrants at the same time. Roman fall trying to do tat as they saw the war coming and they was trying to get cheap labor and fighters for the war as they thought just giving them Roman citizenship really easy will help. The answer to that it did it just temporary and speed up the fall. \n\nWhen just about the whole country of another place move into your country and don’t leaven try to pick up the custom or langange that place technically becomes that other country it just in a new location. Since they didn’t fix their problems but all run so will those problems follow them. I talking about the huge immigration problem that happened. I see it where I it. What worst is we they do crime because it hard to track them because their not documented and there a lot and I mean a lot of young men. I not mad with those people at all because they been lied too. Where ever there is people living below living wages there will always be very high crime.\nNo country not even in the Bible was the whole world welcomed to live in biblical Israel they had walls and if you came you had to take on the full culture. They feed they own citizens first and made sure the people that came wasn’t criminals running into another land.  Another was they allowed to came in mass trying to escape punishment (judgement) from God Almighty. This place is being judged and so it this place will end up worst than their country I wonder will they let us flee there as they run back home to escape the judgement of the USA. The signs of a huge empire collapse of the USA is all here. If that volcano that the size of yellow stone park don’t go off first, it all can come all at first.",

I've lived in areas filled with homeless people and have experienced it firsthand. Shouting obscenities, shitting on the street, attacking passer-bys, wanking it on the sidewalk, and refusing aid is not behavior reflective of someone who is receptive to help. Even the ones who can't help their situation are often too far gone to help.

It’s not a good reason to vote for a politician but it’s an understandable one. A nigga like Adams is proof enough why that isn’t a good enough reason but a lot of black people don’t pay attention to politics much because for the longest it was a no brainer….one side is racist the other side while at times is just using us aren’t trying to take rights from us…so it isn’t a decision that took a lot of processing power. Now a days many have moved past this thought process…it’s slow going but it’s happening. Koons are more know and many decent black people are more aware that there are way more assholes who have the same skin as them but will still step on their necks to make things better for just them",

In SF the Asian mafia has protected a lot of grandmas from gentrifiers while the historically black and latin neighborhoods are gone, they have been pushed out of the city.  I think that there are a lot of systems of the white, like police and gentrification, that are inherently racist.

I realize now I am way too progressive to have ever worked under his administration. So perhaps God was simply protecting me. 🙏🏽 For I do agree with your views.

Your point about how New Yorkers like to feel progressive by supporting diverse candidates, but only ones that will in reality uphold oppressive systems is very apt, and I think extends to a lot of non-minority liberals throughout the US.",

Village garden concerts that were usually student-run with limited equipment and budget. \nThe second Adams gets into office, boom! We get cops coming five minutes into every concert asking for  permit, harassing concert goers and demanding that we leave, even though the concerts were nowhere near cause for a noise complaint. One of my best friends was the head of the program setting up these concerts, XR Youth. The concerts were usually raising money for a good cause such as getting innocent men off death row.\n The amount of times I've seen her have panic attacks about cops pressuring her to procure a permit is insane! We were alll 15 at the time as well, just trying to set up some community engagement. The XR Youth New York chapter also shut down shortly after this, (for other reasons as well) but because of how difficult it became to organize any kind of public event, it became really difficult to see any real change. Eric Adams completely killed the punk scene in NYC!!",

Just about every other country cops are present in the community, actually protecting and serving, not running around in batmobiles that scream toxic masculinity. In Gangs of NY the cop pays someone to watch a pocket watch he puts on a post, gives rich people a poverty tour and then they circle back to the pocket watch its still there, and the rich white people are amazed at what a good job the cops do training the savages not to steal, that's a very real way US cops grift.",

I’ve grown accustomed to watching your videos and I’ve been learning a lot, but I’m still pretty young, and for most of my life, I’ve never had friends who wanted to talk about what’s going on where we live, so for a long time I just brushed off voting because I felt like it just wouldn’t change anything (plus the first year that I could vote, I was away from home in boot camp, and for some reason they couldn’t find my jurisdiction, so I just gave up and went back to whatever I was doing before. The whole thing was super annoying and I never wanted to do it again)This year I’ve decided I’m going to start voting, but I’ve realized I have no clue what are popular topics in my state, and I’m struggling with research on who these people really are- simply because the information on YouTube and various articles are SO boring and long winded. I’m not going to let it stop me this time because I know I just need to use my brain a little more and have some common sense, but I wish and hope I can find eventually someone like you talking about what’s going on (in a way that I can understand) where I live",

And as someone who has paid attention, I thought I knew about Eric Adams but he is SO much worse then the horrible things I knew about. I think your cursing throughout the video was so perfect, and so cathartic. I'm amazed at your ability to break down such dense and difficult topics, such awful things, in such understandable, human, and powerful ways. \n\nAs an aside, as someone who's still being super cautious about COVID, I really appreciated your caveat that is still an ongoing pandemic. You really are just so amazing. I really hope that you're treating yourself to something super nice, because you really work incredibly hard and you're truly a treasure. \n\nThank you for this video. ❤",

We had talked a few times and he even gave me a number (which I never called, so I don't know who would have answered) so if I needed more information about his book I could call.  \n\nI have ulcerative colitis and I think he had something similar and he was telling me about changing my diet.  \n\nSo, simply because of those things, I was going to vote for him.  But someone called me to tell me that the mayoral debate was airing live, so I watched it.  Needless to say, I did NOT vote for him, I took my chance with the other guy.  I voted for the other guy, if you watched the debate, you have saw exactly who Adams was going to represent if he got into office... and I thought, it was going to be me.",
