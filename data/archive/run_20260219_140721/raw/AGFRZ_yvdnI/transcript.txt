welcome to the ghost of plum run hour i'm tim russo author of the star wars series for leftist ghosts of plum run the audio book only on midwestern marks joining me is co-host jonathan spearsen our cadre from the shop floor master line hey jonathan hey tim how you doing not bad not bad a little nervous but because we got such a heavy hitter here uh plum run is where the ghosts of our story were born a dry creek bed where the first minnesota made their stand at sundown during their suicidal charge on the second day of the battle of gettysburg so far you've gotten a little romance adventure pioneer tales immigrant stories underground railroad history more romance and you've met peter marks michellis maori charles muller henry coates and many others who were present when second corps commander winfield scott hancock ordered the regiment to charge halt and reverse a confederate brigade four times their size just to buy a few minutes time at the most desperately pivotal moment of the american civil war's turning point battle at the cost of 82 casualties only 47 of the 262 men present made it back up cemetery ridge one of the highest casualty rates of any action in the history of human warfare in every sense it is the charge that saved america our youtube comrade the attention films guy andrew rakitch described the first minnesota's 15-minute charge as and i quote shattering slavers skulls with every swing of their stainless steel testicles shouldn't that be better known than even d-day why doesn't the world know about it of course it falls to midwestern marks to begin fixing that our guest is history professor timothy orr of old dominion university an expert on the army of the potomac and a former park ranger at the gettysburg national military park tim has been graciously helping me research the first minnesota's charge for two years now and it's an honor to have him here welcome tim hey thank you guys for having me it is always a pleasure to talk about the battle of gettysburg so uh first off you gotta tell us about that oasis poster behind you yeah yeah the new western marks mass line music minute is oasis this week uh yes it is uh oasis is the um the band that i gravitated to in my youth you know believe it or not i was sort of disconnected from all music when i was a child i just didn't really find anything uh thrilling inspiring or exciting about anything musical and that lasted until the 90s when oasis which is a sort of called brit pop band from manchester hit the airwaves and it's difficult to describe but the the sound and the the music that they produced was something that that spoke to me and then i i got into rock music very hardcore in my teenage years and and and that was it now look at you what a big chat you are yeah yeah i don't know if uh oasis fans count many tenured history professors among their number but uh at least there is me so let's let's let's uh take it take it away tim tell us tell our audience what they need to know about this battle and this charge right on so the battle of gettysburg is the costliest engagement of the civil war it is fought during the third summer of the american civil war on july 1st 2nd and 3rd 1863. it is uh the important battle of the gettysburg campaign it's this invasion of the north by the confederate army the army of northern virginia and after three awful days in adams county pennsylvania lee's army is defeated by its counterpart the union army of the potomac and forced to give up on its invasion plans and so this is one of the very few times that confederates ever invade u.s territory and they're turned back in defeat and on the second day of the battle which is the bloodiest of the three is when this regiment that is attached to the army of the potomac the first minnesota which is recruited back during the war's first year in the southeastern counties of the state they undertake what is essentially a suicide mission to save a imperiled section of the center of the union line by charging against a much larger confederate unit as you said was three or four times its size and they drove back this confederate unit and then helped patch together the the hole into which they were stationed and then uh helped repel that confederate assault so it rolled into a third day of the battle which finally decided the fate of uh that engagement so uh they were a unit that paid a heavy price for their for their bravery that day so tell us what the situation was uh in the battle when they charged right on so the you know the battle of gettysburg each day is different and the second day is when the lines of battle have been established right so the confederate and union armies are facing each other and they're about a mile apart which is typical of most civil war engagements and the union army is on the defensive and robert e lee's confederate army is on the offensive and his plan for july 2nd is very simple he's going to attack the two ends the two flanks of the union army and do so simultaneously and that's how he thinks he can find a weak point in the union position because if you if you attack the two ends of the army the principle is the union general george meade cannot shift troops from one section of his line to another these armies are huge you know they're you know about 70 to 90 000 men a piece they stretch over about two miles distance so shifting troops when you have to do most of it on foot it takes considerable amount of time and so that's lee's hope and the problem is it does not work the way that lee wants it his two flank attacks per not simultaneously the the one occurs at four pm in the afternoon the other occurs at eight pm near dusk but the attack on the union left comes very close to succeeding and the reason for that is because the union left flank is in a much weaker position and this is due to the unwise repositioning of one core which is a body of troops about 10 000 men strong under major general daniel sickles and even today sickle's decision elicits great controversy but around 3 p.m and about sorry 2 p.m in the afternoon he sort of disobeys orders and moves his entire core about a mile in advance where it should be it's stretched very thinly across a very open ground and that makes it easy for the confederates to sweep up that flank and sickle's third core is rolled off of its defensive position after about two hours worth of hard fighting and as a result there is a section of the union line that is unprotected there is just a giant gap where troops that had been sent to sickle's aid to reinforce his front are no longer positioned and there is a brigade of alabama soldiers that is spilling towards that hole and there are only two union units that are occupying it a small battery of artillery and then supporting that battery the first minnesota and that is that is the situation that that little regiment finds itself in as the teeth of the confederate advance are bearing down on it why did lee decide to invade uh the north uh during the gettysburg campaign yeah great question uh it is a difficult question to answer believe it or not because lee himself never wrote it down it's kind of mind-boggling if you think about it the most famous general in american history at his most famous engagement and even today historians have to guess as to what lee's intention was you know most you know in modern times when generals have a big operation they have to write out what their goals are right to explain what is the thing that is to be gained but back in the 19th century generals were not required to do that not required to establish in writing their goals okay and so when i when i give an answer to this question i always have to sort of couch it in those terms that that there is not certainty in what i'm going to say but based on the little bits of evidence that we have based on what lee wrote particularly his letters to the confederate war department and to the confederate president jefferson davis his belief was that if he invaded pennsylvania there would be a political outcome to the war that would be beneficial to the confederacy there's a letter that he writes on june the 10th 1863 where he says that it is best to give all encouragement we can to the rising peace movement of the north and so what he means is that in the north there were two political parties and one of those political parties was making its case that confederate independence might be accepted right that the nation should be split up and exist coexist with two separate entities and this was the democratic party correct correct so this was and of course in those days the democratic party was the conservative party back in those times so it's swapped as it is today but the democrats had a faction in them that were called the peace democrats uh they had a nickname called the copperheads because they're named after a venomous snake that strikes without warning and lee knew about these copperheads knew they were powerful knew they were rising in influence and in fact the commonwealth of pennsylvania was nominating a copperhead for governor that summer and lee hoped that military action in the state would give the copperheads some political clout so lee in many ways was sort of operating under a principle that we call a clause of itsy in principle that war is the extension of politics by other means so his hope was that a decisive military action in pennsylvania the defeat of the union army in its own soil on its own soil would result in political changes that would give the confederacy what it wants which is recognize independence from the united states and that's my belief as to why he was invading because he thought that was his the confederacy's best chance for victory and before gettysburg wasn't there an emissary sent from uh richmond to washington on route with some sort of letter of of of of uh negotiated surrender or something or negotiated settlement or what was the uh no i don't believe so i think that is a myth that was propagated by a movie called gettysburg that is done by the ted turner uh studios back in the 1990s and that was a story that really has no historical foundation now there were several confederate peace commissioners that had operations to try to have a negotiated piece the most famous of these occurs in the summer of 1864 up at niagara falls but it doesn't result in anything because they are they're not recognized by the state department you know one of the things if you study the civil war uh abraham lincoln was very clear that he was never going to recognize the confederate government as a legitimate government he never at once said that secession was legal therefore he always viewed this as a rebellion never a an actual separate entity so he throughout his career refused to talk to confederate peace commissioners with one exception and that is january of 1865 when he meets with the vice president of the confederacy alexander stevens and this is when the war is winding down and is looking as if congress is going to pass the 13th amendment which is going to end slavery for good and lincoln yeah yeah and just wanted to make make it clear that that if the confederacy accepted defeat they would have to accept emancipation so these copperhead democrats uh they were sort of know nothings weren't they they were very nativist very uh uh racist as we would call them today and and anti-german as well which is what we're going to get to in a second here we're going to segue to jonathan um so that brings us to the to the question of who is in the first minnesota who makes up the regiment and what i found in my research is that about a third of the regiment as a whole at their uh enlistment was german-born and during the charge uh that we're going to talk about more in part two um at least half of company a next to the colors was german-born and they those people would have known about this copperhead stuff this peace overture that all this this we're really going to just surrender here if they beat us right yeah so civil war units back in those days were were very political you know they tried their best to actually engage with the political culture of the time and this may be something that modern day viewers have a hard time understanding because you know our modern day army and navy are are sort of recommended not to be political not to have political statements but in the 19th century union soldiers were encouraged to be political and to take an active role in telling the northern voting public about what they thought and there's a an interesting phenomenon that takes place mostly in the spring of 1863 so the months before the gettysburg campaign were union regiments will publish what they call resolutions these are uh statements of their political opinion like who they are supporting in the upcoming election and whole regiments would publish these and then sign off on them and you know in and whenever these resolutions are published they lambaste the copperheads indeed some of them even threaten death they actually say that if if the copyrights win what we want to do is march back to our home state whether it is indiana or illinois or ohio where there was in ohio they had a very controversial copyright candidate we will murder them like they're very clear about this and the copperheads were very active in the midwest especially in ohio uh yeah the landing game uh ran as a copperhead and uh for governor in 1863 and was was was was was excommunicated from the country by abraham lincoln yeah he was he was yeah there was a whole copperhead situation in the midwest for sure yeah yeah i mean it is amazing to think about that you know and he wasn't just uh originally he is found guilty uh of sedition and his his sentence was death actually the union general ambrose burnside was ready to to you know execute him but lincoln commuted the sentence to banishment and so he was eventually sent to the south and then took a ship up to canada so he ran for governor while he was in exile i think he was the only and he got inventory didn't he get like 36 or something or oh yeah yeah i mean because he had a very stalwart faction of of democrats in ohio who were ready to vote i thought well all these we're let's go back to the charge so all these guys are sitting there and and waiting to throw themselves to their desks and and this is the environment that they are experiencing uh not just uh on the field but in in the army and then the core with that they're that they're marching with but at home then they're writing letters they're hearing letters back from their families about all this yeah so they know this this political tumult is ex exists right that the home front is divided and if they lose this next fight there is a chance that the copperheads are going to change the direction of the war and you know i don't know if the first minnesota was part of this movement to um send political opinions back to the press but certainly they knew about it they knew that some of their other regiments in their army were sending these these documents back so if you're in the first minnesota and you're on cemetery ridge on july 2nd 1863 this this is it this is your your opportunity to prove to your citizens that you can fight and you can win because if you don't if you don't pennsylvania could elect a copperhead and that copperhead could say well we're going to sue for peace right and we're going to recognize confederate independence and this could be a terrible moment for the united states if the war is simply turning in a dark direction really and this is this is the in the minds of every union soldier at gettysburg the only reason it it's it's more pronounced for the first minnesota was because they were at the very end of the line and they were that this was so let's talk about the the people who were in the regiment jonathan i want you to jump in here yeah um what i find most interesting about the uh regiments composition is the amount of german americans and i myself am mostly german american with my ancestry and everything and we're always not really taught the flip side of the radicalness of uh german americans like august village and stuff so when tim comes to me and he's telling me about this you know close to 50 percent german-american regiment that literally saved the entire country here i was like please tell me more um so do you uh do you have any stories about any of these uh german americans celebrating their ethnicity within the regiment um anything like that so you know my my first minnesota expertise is probably not as good as uh the two of you so i will defer to any particular stories you guys have but german ethnicity was celebrated in the army of the potomac generally and most of it was centered in a unit called the 11th corps it was a unit that was built around german american officers you know so there had been a number of german american leaders who had fought in the revolutions of 1848 and they had come over to the united states because they had simply forced out of their home country because the violence there the threat of being arrested and executed and the hope was that they would fight for a republic here in north america and that would be their opportunity to export it back to their home country and so uh there are great many popular german leaders who kind of rose to the ranks in the army of the potomac uh perhaps one of the most well-known was a guy named carl schurs who was a division commander actually temporarily commanded the 11th corps at gettysburg and uh you know after the war is a founding member of what's called the liberal republican party which runs against uh ulysses grant in the 1872 election so but anyway um you know these regiments that served the 11th corps a great many of them carried on certain german traditions they conducted their drill in their native language so they had german officers speaking german to their soldiers and um you know even some of their regimental histories were published in their native language and you know had only recently been translated into english in the 20th century that's so so cool yeah yeah i mean there is a sense that that a great many german recruits that they don't really just like assimilate and form like a melting pot as so often has been described as the immigrant experience but instead they form their own sort of ethnic enclave and that they carry on their their identity as germans in the army of the potomac now there there is there's some blow back to this which is that if um there is a problem if there's a bet there's a battle does not go well and the 11th corps is involved in it then it gets blamed for it and really has no means of redress and the previous battle to gettysburg is called the battle of chancellorsville this is a exceptionally bloody battle and a terrible defeat for the army of the potomac and the 11th corps bears the brunt of it it is on the end of the line stonewall jackson's flank march strikes it on may 2nd 1863 and you know after any of these major defeats northern newspapers have to explain the why and rather than blame the generals who really should bear the the burden of this calamity they blame the 11th corps and they're the ones who are kind of the the goat of this battle and of course a great many of these german soldiers have no way to communicate the reverse and say well no you know we fought hard it was just the bad positioning of our core because they don't they don't read the newspapers in new york city that are in english and the english-speaking citizens don't read the german newspapers so there's simply just disconnects and newspapers just ran down the 11th core and its reputation in the weeks following chancellorsville yeah a great great many of them probably felt the same pressure as the first minnesota did when they reached gettysburg yeah meanwhile you have these guys at gettysburg kicking ass and uh nobody uh wants to talk about that part at that time and like that's what is so interesting to me is like they played such a pivotal role that lincoln was bringing these people in and having meetings with them i mean he sat across from village in the white house for christ's sake and i think the uh more reactionary elements of uh how we tell history in this country recognize that and recognize what a role they played in saving you know some of the best things about this country would rather not talk about it but um pivoting a little bit from that i'm interested to hear your family's immigrant story if you have any stories or anything from that i find it fascinating right uh so i'm not a really avid genealogist tracking down the ore family name but the one story that i do kind of like to tell because of how i don't know it's always caught paul makes me pause and think about you know how history might have been different right and how it would affect my life today so my family came over in the early 1700s early 18th century from northern ireland and it's hard to track the comings and goings of the oars in the colonial era but one individual we can kind of put our finger on is a teenage soldier from the american revolution named john dale orr and he fought at one of the last battles of the revolution the siege of yorktown and after that siege was over he accompanied a military expedition into ohio territory led by a guy named colonel william crawford and crawford's expedition was aimed at doing one thing and that was exterminating the native americans in ohio who had joined with the british during the revolutionary war ohio territory was all the rage back man and this expedition goes poorly the the delaware the miami and the shawnee which are the three nations that are unified against the virginians wipe the floor with them at this battle that is called the battle of sandusky rippers fought in the first week of june 1782 and so my ancestor john dale orr was part of that he's badly wounded he's shot in the arm and it looks as if he is going to be left on the field and this is the story that gets into our family history is that as he's he's bleeding out there uh one of his commanding officers comes to him and his guy named colonel lieutenant colonel john mcclelland he's the second in command of the expedition and lieutenant colonel mcclellan knows private or because lieutenant colonel mcclellan's son has married john dale orr's sister so there's a family connection and so he's going to feel guilty if he leaves private or behind and he says private ore you know i have i'm going to give you my horse so you can you can escape you can make it off the field that's what happens that orr gets the horse and he's able to ride to safety and get out of the encirclement that the delaware miami and shawnee are enacting and so he he lives to old age um and he he grows he establishes a farm in northern west virginia that's where they they settle preston county but mcclellan the guy who gives up his horse he dies uh he is captured by the shawnee and tortured to death uh over a course of several hours and if any of you have ever studied this battle this is the fate of the commander as well uh colonel crawford he has a cruel awful torture where he's burned at the stake and uh there's a great many accounts that describe this none describe lieutenant colonel mcclellan's horrible death uh but we can presume that it was the exact same as colonel crawford's death and so that's the thing i often think about is that if lieutenant colonel mcclellan had not done what he did and given his horse to this this soldier right who he barely knew but just knew because they were connected through marriage then well i guess i wouldn't be here right right like the ripple effect hate is a funny thing yeah so that man that man suffered and died horribly and as a result here i am talking to you guys on this uh beautiful summer evening 2021. ben and colonel mcclellan for that uh gracious gift to us here at midwestern marx and it happened in the midwest too so um so let's get back to uh uh the battle and the chart um so jonathan you had a question about what lee was up to other than invading the united states yeah um it seems like he had a secondary mission in mind when it came to it and who knows according to uh the motives of the people in the army it might have been a first ambition for some of those people in those ranks but um could you talk about how lee was wasting all this time and resources purposefully rounding up free black people and trying to drag them off and change to slavery some of them never even knew slavery right they were born free could you talk a little bit about that because i feel like this is on talked about and reported about this march yeah it is one of the un unstoried parts of the gettysburg campaign sadly uh so you know when lee's army invades pennsylvania one of the things that they do is as you said they round up african americans that are living in those counties that border maryland along the mason-dixon line because the confederate belief is that any african-american who lives there was a former slave who escaped slavery and got across the mason-dixon line to freedom right that's that's their belief so they think what they're doing is recovering lost property in reality most of those that they they kidnap are just ordinary free african americans just trying to get by in the southern tier counties of pennsylvania so they're essentially abducted and they're brought back to virginia with the rest of the wounded and disoriented confederate soldiers during the retreat all right now there's a big question about how many they abduct the best book on the subject is by a guy named kent masterson brown uh he wrote an excellent book years ago called lee's retreat it's a fascinating story of the confederate logistical nightmare that existed after the battle so it covers everything from july 4th to july 14th but brown talks at length about the confederate abductions and how many they were able to bring back to virginia it doesn't seem like it's a very large number it's probably between 100 and 150 people that they kidnap but of course to any of those that are kidnapped this is just a horrible moment where they're just taken out of their house and brought into slavery uh an awful situation as you said that they had never known before and so this is one of the things that happens and i would have to say it doesn't seem like it is a a directive that is ordered by lee or anyone on the staff for the army of northern virginia this is a decision that is done by a single confederate brigade a cavalry brigade commanded by a guy named alfred jenkins uh jenkins he has the cavalry the only cavalry that's attached to the main body of the army northern virginia as most gettysburg scholars know the bulk of the confederate cavalry was doing this weird side mission that had really no purpose to the invasion but jenkins cavalry are with the main body and they're the ones who seem to do all the the abductions and the the reason we know a lot about this is that you know many of the the white neighbors who were there witness these things as these confederate cattlemen go in the front doors pull these families out and then bind them up and they said it was horrible to behold right you know these people they had lived next to their entire lives were being taken to parts unknown and it was just horrible to see no one ever heard about any of them again i mean they were gone right right and i imagine of course many of them if they survive the next two years the war were liberated in 1865 at war's end but uh the question was what happened to them afterwards all right and so the study the studies that are being done nowadays are just beginning to kind of figure this stuff out uh i would assume that a bunch of them probably were able to break from the confederate column during the retreat because it's fairly chaotic and then some of them are almost certainly liberated in 1864 during the union invasion of virginia during the overland campaign but then those that didn't make it out uh i don't goodness knows where they were held right you know because the confederacy probably had prisons for escaped slaves that they just kind of put them in these squalid feted rat holes and talked about where they might be held on the battlefield for the three day yeah yeah gettysburg yeah but that was that was probably the easiest part of their journey the end of it you know when they finally got to richmond or lynchburg or wherever they were dropped off by the army in northern virginia that was probably the worst element of it because as we said these these abductees they weren't associated with masters right there wasn't anyone who was going to come and claim them so they're probably waiting in dungeons for the next two years for the union army to win the war and come liberate them and again there's a lot of this is all speculation because a lot of this research is fairly new but but that is one thing that happens during the campaign yeah now the first minnesota before their charge and and the whole war would have known about the issue of slavery but do you think they would have known or heard about these stories of lee going around rounding up the black folk in pennsylvania was that getting into the army probably not because you have to admit you have to think that the first minnesota and the bulk of the arm of the potomac has only been in pennsylvania for a few days before gettysburg intervenes right because they are um they cross the line from maryland to pennsylvania on june the 30th so it's really only two days until they engage in the battle and that's really what they're thinking about is the the bloody aftermath of that but again the the people of pennsylvania that saw this happen they knew right from the outset of this that these abductions were occurring so you know people in the army of the potomac probably had little interaction with african americans um or anyone who had witnessed it uh so it was probably unknown to them but you know they were they were wise enough by that point to know that that slavery was an institution that brutalized people uh because at that point the emancipation proclamation had been enacted and the army had been liberating slaves since 1861 so they've seen the physical abuse on the the backs and in the faces of those they've liberated in the regiment who they had a guy in the regiment named toby who was a a body servant to the officers who was an escaped slave from the peninsula region yep yep yeah yeah a very remarkable account by a lieutenant named william locke when he talks about him yeah yeah yeah so i mean the one of the things about the civil war i think that is often overlooked is that it is uh a moment in time when black and white are kind of forced to interact with each other on very human terms in ways that they had not before you know i imagine a great many minnesotans had never seen an african-american before right because it is a very white state when it was admitted to the union in 1858 so when they were marching into virginia seeing african-americans for the first time this is a a chance for interracial cooperation that had never existed before and so the very fact that you have an instant like this kid toby who is brought into the regiment to help serve as a clerk or a laundromat or a personal assistant to uh lieutenant lochren and the other members of the officer corps and likely paid by the army to do it you know is an incredible at least first step in symbiosis right you know yeah and i try to explore that in the series quite a bit because it is a it is a strange thing that you never hear about the in such a battle you never hear about the people behind the regiment who are supporting the regiment who are you know making the wagoneers the teamsters the cooks the laundry people all of those staff uh so i tried to put that in there so we we're about three minutes away from zoom cutting us off uh so part two uh coming up uh we will get directly into the details of the charge itself so beginning that let's get back to dan sickles shall we um you mentioned dan sickles at the outset uh for for a minute or two tell us what is dan sickles relationship to the charge of the first minnesota his relationship to the charge is that he is the one that imperils the union left flank right uh this the first minnesota would not have to do a suicide mission against the confederate attack if sickles had stayed where he was in my humble opinion because what he does is he makes it easier for lee's assault on the union left to be successful and as a result george mead the army the potomac commander has to shift reinforcements from across his line 20 000 additional troops have to go to save sickle's butt and as a result that strips the center of the union line clean and the only regiment that's left there to hold it is the unlucky first minnesota and that line i mean it's kind of hard to do a map on a podcast because nobody's watching but that line is is the gap between the first minnesota and any other unit how big was that gap yeah pretty big i would say it is at least a quarter mile to put it in perspective there was a union unit that was supposed to be there uh division from the second court it was 3 300 men and so that unit left and you're sending a unit of 270 to occupy it and where did that unit go that unit went to the wheat field ripped to pieces yes yeah they they did they they thought they fought hard they fought valiantly but in the end they just uh it was not enough men to support sickles front shows how embattled it was and how impossible it was to hold that position because even with twenty thousand additional reinforcements on top of the ten thousand he already had uh it was just it was it wasn't enough to hold it so we're we're about near our cut-off point uh give us your favorite oasis song my favorite oasis song is a song called cloud bursts it is a i just listened to that before the show did you that is a great song isn't it yeah yeah it's a it's a b-side from uh the live forever single um it is a song that oasis played live twice never done it again but i i greatly enjoy that song it's a song about getting stuck in the rain and then learning from it and growing up and being stronger about it right so it's it's sort of has meteorological and life implications woven together well it's perfect for this this this wall i mean it's coming up next on the part two is we're going to get deeper into the details of the actual charge of the first minnesota at gettysburg um and joining us tonight is professor tim orr from old dominion university come back for part two uh we're just waiting for zoom to cut us off here uh less than a minute do i want to upgrade no [Laughter] what's your favorite uh oasis song well my favorite is up in the sky there's no question about it uh it's it's their best it's their most beatles-like uh tune it's the one that sounds most like the beatles it should be on revolver it's a sound it's a song that should be on revolver my opinion right what's your favorite do you have any favorites you don't even like oasis they're okay i like the obvious ones champagne supernova wonder wall you know
