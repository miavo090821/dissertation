Before the ANC started violent resistance there were decades of peaceful resistance that failed. The defiance campaign and military action came later. Yes, there were terrorist attacks, but only in response to white people terrorising and oppressing black people.\n\n2. Nelson Mandela is not considered an icon of peace for what he did before going to jail, but after. When Nelson Mandela got released large numbers of black people wanted revenge. They wanted to murder every white person in South Africa. They begged Mandela to lead the genocide. Mandela did the opposite. He set up the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and promoted forgiveness so we can move forward as a non-racial and united country.\n\n3. The people who Winnie Mandela \"necklaced\" were apartheid informants who undermined the black struggle. It was brutal, but it wasn't for nothing.\n\n4. White genocide in South Africa is a myth. South Africa has a crime problem. More people are killed in poor communities than on rich farms.",

Nelson Mandela is not considered an icon of peace for what he did before going to jail, but after. When Nelson Mandela got released large numbers of black people wanted revenge. They wanted to murder every white person in South Africa. They begged Mandela to lead the genocide. Mandela did the opposite. He set up the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and promoted forgiveness so we can move forward as a non-racial and united country.\n\n3.

Well for starters, by the millions of black South Africans denied the vote and the dignity of full citizenship in their country. And who, if they protested and demanded equal rights, were shot, detained without trial, tortured to death. Does it need to be debated that Apartheid was very very bad? Black South Africans were legally deemed \"third class citizens\", after Coloured and Indian South Africans, who were \"second class\". This was written into law, and displayed on railway platforms, in case anyone forgot that whites were \"first class\". How could a man live under such laws and find them acceptable? It must be considered wrong, as Naziism is considered wrong, as slavery and genocide and communism are considered wrong.

The fact is, if you are going to justify terror attacks against civilians or the theft of innocent people's money, on the grounds that apartheid was considered bad enough by Mandela to justify doing this, then you can also justify apartheid on the grounds that the National Party considered apartheid the acceptable alternative to black and communist rule. After all, if you are going to base your argument on what one group considers acceptable, then it raises the question of why what they subjectively consider acceptable is  fine, but not what the opposing side considers acceptable. If the murder of civilians is justifiable because it was in the name of the anti-apartheid struggle, then why is the murder of civilians not fine if it was in the name of preventing black rule, or the spread of communism?\nIf it comes down to subjective acceptability, then why would terrorism against the South African state be more acceptable than unfair laws? Why would terrorism be fine, but not the arrest of the terrorists? Surely if we are going to say \"Well, you can't blame Mandela under the circumstances\" and say that people should see it from his point of view, you should also be prepared to see things from the point of view of the South African authorities? You can only get around such a problem in your position if you can claim that one set of views is closer to an objectively better moral position.

Instead India got Nehru, a socialist trained in the British Fabian society.\n\nWhich is to say, it was machiavellian British maneuvering that Westerners know of Gandhi and not Bose. \n\nBrits saw that they were about to lose India, so they realized the best way to prolong empire and pacify nationalist elements was to let the liberal Indians run rampant while sneakily cracking down on the nationalists.\n\nThe truth is, Britain simply noped out before being outnumbered and pwned in India.",

BOTH Hindus and Muslims demanded rollback. But many muslims did support this. Infact, this pivotal incident led to the creation of Muslim League, the chief architects of partition. This gave them the idea of creating their own country along religious lines. It was pretty much the decision that decided the fate of India. Now, the division was sown in the people.",

Well, just another Tuesday.\n\nGandhi, for all his veneration, was a deeply self-interested man willing to see millions of his countrymen sent to slaughter in pursuit of publicity and symbolic victories—an approach that, to be fair, was highly effective in shaping his legacy. Even more ironic is that he did not extend his commitment to nonviolence to his own wife. More importantly, he helped establish a government that was not only corrupt and deeply retaliatory but also obsessed with maintaining a performative image rather than ensuring functional governance.\n\nNelson Mandela, despite his later reputation, was linked to numerous bombings and the practice of necklacing—a brutal execution method where tires were placed around the necks of political enemies, particularly those targeted by his wife, Winnie Mandela, before being set on fire. After his rise to power, much like Gandhi, he oversaw a government that was both corrupt and deeply retaliatory, but more significantly, one that prioritized optics over actual governance.\n\nAfter years of potshots at traditional conservative cultural heroes, it’s refreshing to see the right going after the left’s icons—particularly those with feet of clay.",

If Ghandi had not existed, the British would still have left (maybe not on the same timeline).

        "text": "@destinypirate Right, a few things to go over. Firstly, discussing the british in india is largely too simple. There were many different interest groups, all of which had a different vision when they interfered in india yet all of which, due to the shared need for not getting booted, would lock arms when under threat.\n\nSo theres the true believers that genuinely thought they were improving india by westernising it, those who thought india was better improved by keeping its own culture but modernising technologically, those who sought to keep india reliant on britain, those simply in it not for any geopolitical goal but simply to make private money and others.\n\nIf local indians kicked off, all of the above would huddle together with a united front since as much as they were all mutually exclusive, they all shared the baseline need of not getting killed.\n\nSo talking about 'the british' in india, really needs fleshing out since 'british' interests werent a monolith.\n\nSecondly, britain official policy in terms of india, it was dominion status which is ultimately, effective independence. It took a long time since britain didnt think india was capable of forming a cohesive state for much of the 1900's but that was the ultimate goal, where independance, like with the other dominions, wouldnt be a problem since under the umbrella or walking separate, the former dominions would, through shared history and institutions, be natural friends. Things didnt work out that way, due to britain having to rush indian dominion status post war. For the record, the concern of the nation being unable to form was proved largely correct given the raj didnt form a country, it had to form 4.\n\nSo violence or gandhi, india didnt take its independence from britain, it was given it and the financial strain of the war probably played the largest part in the rushed nature as otherwise, it was a delaying factor in britains already agreed upon plans.\n\nNone of this mind, is to imply that britain in india is justified, whatever plans you intend with occupied land, its still not yours to make plans with be they benevolent or evil.\n\nThe final point is a simple contradiction of a claim you made. \"England has become demonstrably worse than it was before. Indian people, with the means to do so used to move to the uk, not so anymore\"\n\nYes so thus far actually. Indian immigration to the UK since 2011 has been the highest rate ever, beating even post independence. nearly 250,000 came between june 2023 and june 2024, half for work, half for study. Thats the latest figures.\n\nSo yes, indians are still coming to the uk, in higher numbers than ever.",

        "text": "@andrewshaw1571  I think that it's great that you took the time to write this, but most of it does not apply...\n- it was never England's right to decide how to or who should rule, or when, or why. All of these decisions were upheld at the end of cannons and guns and bayonets primarily manned Scots and Irish and even Indians. \nWe could take the time to argue the merits of forced benevolence. However there isn't a people on the Earth who wouldn't rather kill or die in order to retain their sovereignty against such Force. Any other man, as exemplified through the totality of History, any other man who became the leader against such an occupying and exploitative force would have gathered the people with serpent knives and pitchforks. Gandhi is unique in history and his philosophical approach. The eloquence of his peaceful Revolution save the lives of countless thousands of British subjects, and quite likely those of other other foreign Nationals who held interest there, and countless thousands more if not millions of indians.\n\nWhat would be an interesting topic is examining how Indians took the influence, which was forced upon them, of British education and modernization and used it to improve themselves and their country so impressively. Many questions could be explored including whether they would have achieved such progress without suffering British conquest.\nWe'd of course have to do a bit of comparative study of other countries, a difficult task give me the different cultural and Geographic factors, yet China does come to mind where we see the pointed infusion of Western culture through Hong Kong.\n\nClearly my suggestion about immigration changes was too anecdotal as among the many Indian International people I know none are interested in moving to the UK anymore and and rather choose to stay in India or satellite out to the US or even varied countries such as Thailand, Singapore, or Canada.\n\nAs reported from everyone of my UK friends who lived through quite a varied strata of the country, conditions in the UK are deteriorating Atari moving from bad to worse, which is quite the opposite of the  reports that I hear from India.\n\nI see no rational reason for this diminishing of Gandhi Nora of this softening of the British Empires history. Undoubtedly there were Great gains in modernization and trade and education to be had for Any Nation engaged with the British or Americans. However this may be it does not change the brutality and suffering and loss of Conquest and occupation, nor the immorality. There's certainly where Alternatives and Thailand May exemplify this better than any other nation, having benefited from their own Royal leadership that acted with the wisdom to not only make treaties and alliances but also to invite in Western expertise and be open to business lia's which built up the countrys  infrastructure. Of course this progress has waned since the passing away of such wise leadership...\n\nMuch more is to be gained from studying the wise leadership of the Great Men of the 20th century than is from tearing them down for whatever personal shortcomings or varied factors can be woven over them.\nMany of these great men were British as well and examination of the beneficent intense and wisdom of such is more worthwhile than simply vilifying Britain for the wrongs that are clearly understood to be wrong already. However in doing so we can't throw out the courage and wisdom of those who did resist the oppressive Brits.\n\n The most impactful example of the dangers of search loaded historical revisionism is the impact on American academia wrought by the naive embrace of A People's History of the United States.",

It's for that single reason he got statues and places named in his honor. Nobody ever thought he was a role model to follow, but most sane people new that he raised to the challenge when he had too.

They didn't have much to work with at the time, they used the drugs to help that they were allowed when possible, often just stuck with basic painkillers. If she actually wanted people to suffer she would have thrown them out on the streets instead of keeping them in care, that quote you're referring to is so wildly misunderstood, especially since lots of who they took in were already basically rejected from hospitals. I feel like many don't even realize what she was actually running was hospice care, not a hospital, at least going by how people attack her. And on the other end, she hated when co-workers and friends would force her into hospitals for treatment. She'd literally try to escape to get back to taking care of others. Not arguing her for being some perfect person or that there weren't issues, but the most evil stuff you'd hear is either completely missing massively important context, or just straight up a lie.",

Personally, I think it adds to the human experience to learn and come to terms with the less admirable qualities of our forefathers. Benjamin Franklin was also an adulterer (what with his questionable taste for French women) but he's on our $100 dollar bill for a reason. Similarly, we literally put Lincoln on a THRONE despite being one of the singularly most tyrannical leaders in our nation's history (he freed the slaves, but did so in the bloodiest way possible and stripped people of their God given rights and freedom of speech, which is ANTITHETICAL to America's founding principles).\n\nI think it would be healthier for society if we taught our children both the virtues AND vices of our national heroes and their legacies because it sends a far more powerful message to our young people: You do not need to be a flawless paragon of virtue to be a hero.\n\nYou can condemn their failures while still upholding the good they brought to the world.",

Someone had to I guess. Is that enough to become a messianic figure? Apparently.  Mandela was just an incompetent leader, an ex terrorist, and frankly just an awful person.  I have no idea why anyone celebrates him.  I'm not 100% sure what Gandhi added to anything?  What would India today and the world be like if he never lived? Frankly about the same. I don't think their politics or course would be changed at all. They were always going to get independence, it was always going to be about the same time. Maybe he sped it up by a year or two.

Bonobos are some of humanity's closest living non-human relatives. Strange that a trait would have such opposite effects among such closely related species.",

To ignore that shows you're either a moron or a sophist.\n\nThe teaching is saying that if you had the choice to follow God or your family, then you follow God. The Abrahamic God is the source of all being/existence. Without it there is no you, or your family. If your family rejects God then you're to reject your family if you hold faith in God.\nWhy would following other flaws humans be considered perfect to you? What if your family are degenerates and your proximity to them is detrimental to your life? You stay anyway or do you f#ck them off for a chance at something better?",

Tribes knew how to fight wars and fight them to the end, and neither is it unique to Southern Africans, this brutality is common where extreme ideologies control the counter movements.
