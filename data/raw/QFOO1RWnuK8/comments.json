Re-educate the Uighur extremists before they turned terrorists.\r\n2. Let them be to carry on their terrorists, then launch attacks, bomb their homes and kill innocent people.\r\nChina chose the first, while the USA chose the second.\r\nYou should know which option is better!!!\r\n\r\nChina chose 1 to solve the problem from the root without committing murder. \r\nHow do the US and the West solve terrorism? \r\nFire missiles from battleships, drop bombs from the sky.\r\n\r\nHow USA and Western anti-terrorism?\r\nInvade their countries, kill the leaders and soldiers together with civilians, destroy their cities, towns, and villages.\r\nDone!  \r\nWestern Media: Heros!\r\n\r\nHow China anti-terrorism?\r\nRe-educate extremists, teach laws and skills so that they can work and reduce poverty.\r\nDone!  \r\nWestern Media: Genocide!",

That and there's a big self control culture that I don't think quite exists in the West. So I think Eddie's assumption that they probably have less idiots is correct. Don't get me wrong, I have a friend that lives in Taiwan that's at bars fairly frequently on weekends, I've had Chinese friends that could drink with the best of them, and I've had my share of Sake and Kirin, but it wouldn't be surprising if East Asian drinking culture vs British/American drinking culture were extremely different. Then of course there's the European religious influence that wanted to ban everything that isn't as prevalent there.",

Was it in his Manifesto? Das Kapital? His critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right? His writings on the Paris Commune? Perhaps Engles wrote about it in his letter to Marx from Paris in 1844? Or was it in the articles in Neue Reinische Zeitung? Maybe you can cite for me the which articles? Or Maybe it was buried somewhere in the German Ideology?\n\nBureaucratic authoritarian collectivism was and always will be antithetical to Marxist socialism. \n\nTell me about Chinese children's rights as they slave away in sweatshops for pennies. Tell me about how socialism works for the Uyghurs locked away in concentration camps in Xinjiang.\n\nTell me about how socialism work for any of the disappeared Chinese Ministers, or perhaps former President Hu Jintao, or the Ink Girl, or anyone Xi views as a political rival and who is now imprisoned or permanently missing?  Xi made the poor Ink Girl disappear 4 years ago into a mental asylum and nobody has seen her since. All she did was deface a picture of him in public. That's not socialism. That's hell, objectively speaking. I guess I'm the type of socialist who believes Marxist socialism, ie strictly bottom-up democratic socialism, not state capitalism. not authoritarianism, not fascism, not nationalism and not brutal police states.",

When China drew 9 dash-lines with the help of u.s. navy, none of those SEA's former masters contested, in fact they support it in order to drive Japanese out of the region. It was only in the 70s sea countries found out there are tons of cruel oil reserves under the sea then YOU GUYS started the fake claims that China had a border disputes.\nIn short, this whole South China sea disputes are fake af, in short it's all about greed, and abuse the weak neighbour( in this case China is the victim) in disguise of being victims, sounds very familiar yeah??",
