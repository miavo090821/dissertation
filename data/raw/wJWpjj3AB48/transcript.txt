I think he retires from music and goes the acting route and comes back in like what's Drake's version of The Joker understanding how Petty this beef has been this entire time knowing that it's like Drake can claim that he could go conscious Kendrick has proved that he could make some pop hits and get everyone to like him I'll put it like this if Drake ends up getting his name on another Euphoria type show you'll be fine with us just never talking about him in a musical sphere again doing this tour in Australia with a best riddled with bullet holes who on your team was like that's the thing he's like Kendrick is a moment but you know sometimes moments are great because sometimes they're [Music] Unforgettable today's sponsor is Aura if you haven't been taking precautions with your

black supporter I have on to Ric Tariq shirt I have Fresca's mug I have Dave Foster art up here listen black business okay look at me um but I brought y'all here to discuss the Super Bowl which honestly was great all around like not just Kendrick but like the Eagles winning like whooping their ass the whole time it was beautiful it was so wonderful in my house I loved it so to the floor how' y'all feel about Kendrick performance it was great you know I'll start I ain't watch it for the game you know I miss the whole game because I'm going to be honest I'm not that girl that watches football right so you know the men are fine absolutely but I love ly's performance Lift Every Voice that was everything okay she she had that wig on baby she sang it down ly gave us very good black moment at um you know at the Super Bowl and then there was you know when we got our moment with Kendrick Lamar so many thank pieces but before we get there I for me I was watching it from the house so whatever I saw on TV it was very theatrical it was very poetic it was very there was so much messaging in it right I lived for every single moment um you know there were so many uh you know Easter eggs people were catching here and there but most of all I felt like this was a very uh this was a very big moment considering the climate right now politically um um and there is no way that we can't look at Donald Trump being in the same audience and you know Kendrick Lamar performing in this same area super black um with messaging that is super pro black and that denounces a lot of the things that Donald Trump says and that was one of the biggest things for me you know for that whole thing um you know so for me it was a good black moment Kendrick is fine loved his jeans um I just loved it you know that's just I don't understand the Jean debate that everyone or I guess the genan admiration it a little Hy he would thick in the thighs but it's a good thing even even as a gay man who like loves to look at Men's legs I was like I don't really see what y'all talk about but it's a good it was a very subtle Bell I think that people were deciding that it was you know revolutionary and I'm like I've seen those at aeropostal before like I you know I I listen I love bell bottom don't get me wrong but um I didn't think they were as revolutionary they were they were very live I think it's must be because of where we live sis because I I was seeing so many people talk like oh he's bring bringing bell bottoms back and I was like when did they leave this supposed be Brooklyn because that bbot they never left they never left yeah they never left yes well I guess maybe maybe men men in bell bottoms but even then I feel like Travis Scott had them in like 2018 like it it's been it's been defin seen kid Cy in in a in a bell bottom in a crop top give me Kendrick in a croptop and then now we're talking then you're gonna get a little a little ibr rise for me um I thought what was really interesting about Kendrick's performance is that he didn't cater to those that aren't familiar with his music and I feel like the Super Bowl is that time where you're supposed to do all of the hits you're supposed to win over new fans or people who you are sometimes they're not familiar with you by name but they might know the hits and I thought it was really powerful that he was like this a for everybody and I'm totally okay with that and I think that that was really bold of him and as evidenced by you know the countless white people losing their entire Minds over it it accomplished what it was supposed to because for that audience it's really difficult for them to reckon with the fact that not everything is for them there were so many people that were like no one I knew understood it no be specific no white people you knew knew what it was about a lot of us knew the songs a lot of us understood the references and if I'm keeping it Buck the references to me didn't feel so deep that you needed like a decoder ring to figure them out like I saw people doing these like critical breakdowns and I'm like if you missed Uncle Sam if you missed 40 AC acres in a mule like I don't know what to tell you like those things aren't super deep but at the same time there are specific audiences that need everything spoonfed to them and it went right over their head and I think that that was really cool on his part and I wish that more a more artists would be comfortable saying if you don't get it you don't get it and that's okay no I really like what I I think what I like the most piggybacking off of what Franchesca just said is that this Super Bowl did make me realize that yeah usually the halftime performance is a sort of like almost Legacy Las Vegas play the medal medley type thing it's based off it's it's based off of trying to have the country come together over the oh hey we've heard all of this ones person stuff on the radio before and this being an almost anti- halftime performance and saying like I said not like us and because of that like I you should not expect to immediately see my perspective like you you are you are not like me and that you know I think there there's a meta there's a meta commentary under there about how like that's also kind of what makes America cool right the idea that like you like this culture is still homegrown American but it is so uh distant to some people's in the crowds own day-to-day experience because like this was a rap show and like when we call it like a rap show uh like two two months ago maybe three months ago I went to go see uh Missy bust a Ry no timberin and like one other person and though they are rappers like when you see them you see the breath control you you you you suddenly are hit with this idea of like yeah you know it's not just like rhyming it's not just like getting a beat these are athletes and I I I think I don't know where we're we going to get into it it is it I found it like kind of minorly funny going from Kendrick to Sia because Kendrick very much so was actually rapping and then when you switch to a new person and like I it was so Stark that I was like oh I don't think s and there were tons of people who were like oh the mic was on the mic was on the mic was on in the studio was on in the studio it was on saw what y did to Alicia Keys and she said not I it won't be me yeah and to her to to Kevin's point it is difficult to sing live in that venue and it's not to say that it's impossible and I am a sza fan but paid money to see s sing live and I've been disappointed so you know I think she see sing live over there um she's a singer sza is a performer right we don't nobody's ever gonna be like and I don't even know why we getting here but just let's make it clear s she's a performer we go for looks we go for Vibes we go for we know her music I don't I don't never be like I'm going to I'm going to go hear s sang it down never so you know not I think for S to have that pre-recorded she looked good it sounded and it sounded good and it sounded good but but but overall it like that that was as a lot of people are calling it that was that was a rap show that it was not a medal it was not something that was um dumbed down in order to to to make it uh consumable for the mass audience instead it was a proclamation more of right like this is actually what our culture looks like and you will like it because I do think to um like the point that I don't know Rebecca or Franchesca just said uh oh yeah yeah it was Franchesca that like this imagery wasn't that deep right like like he he wasn't he wasn't breaking out critical race theory he W like he was not he did not drop the boys or anything out there like it was it was I think almost for me it felt like a perfect middle like it felt like the the the way that like um like Moonlight hit where it's like you don't got to understand everything to be like no this is emotionally affective like this is oh this makes me see something e even I I want to quickly break down like the the flag Motif it's like even if you don't know all the [ __ ] that's going on in America you know gang members wear colors you probably know one of them wear red one of them wear blue you definitely know what the American flag look like and you definitely know they're black they're like that that's enough for you to at least get to oh yeah you know black people are part of this country too and like that might make you activated that might make you say wow wow what a what an interesting piece of performance art and that's I do think that's for the most part a lot of all that Kendrick's ask asking which is like see us for who we are not for our ability to play that game um and that's why that that dialogue between Uncle Sam and Kendrick becomes so important because you know Uncle Sam Uncle Sam is not just black-faced Uncle Sam Uncle Uncle Sam is our inner voices telling us especially around this table as people that are creators like how are we going to maneuver around the white gays and Kendrick I think very importantly being like I am I'm going to do my best to Buck against that voice however just know I I can and like there there is some there is some Nuance in being able to get your um social political point off while also making it slap which is I think which I think no other artist right now but Kendrick Lamar could do such a thing on this type of stage I think it's really interesting and speaking on it like not being that deep but being very relevant uh one of the the impacts that I've seen from it so far is that I had a video that I made last summer about like 1,200 black people who actually did get 40 acres in a mule and had it taken away from them and since Kendrick Lamar's performance that video has gotten a million and a half more views so nothing else like I'm it's just a bunch of people rolling in being like yo I didn't know about this I didn't know about this I didn't know about this it's like not even just white people like it's like a lot of people coming through so it's like even if it's not the deepest message it's not like fullon Theory clear impact clear impact on a lot of people I think like you know I've seen some people I don't think it could be too complex like if you want it to reach people like I think it's very clear that he um he created this show in a very um I guess Tony Morrison like I am not doing this with the white gays in mind right like I'm not I'm not talking to white people like I'm not talking to them I'm talking to us right and that's very clear even in how he uses um Samuel L Jackson in the show like when at the it's when Samuel L Jackson um basically instructs him like oh you know to to to play the Theo blend in this is and next thing that he plays his like scissor hits you know what I mean for white people like it's very deliberate and then like when he plays the one he wants so it it um that thread is through there the entire time and I think also like if you're thinking about the American public that is not the brightest like factually speaking went over it went over so many of their heads it went over so many of their heads dead ass the fact that they're saying like they never heard about 40 acres and a mule is a testament in and of itself yes a million of them went to watch Christian's video because they were like what I never heard this let me look this up and I think um Jermaine depri uh had a had a um a good take that I think a lot of people weren't understanding They Were Somehow Miss again again reading comprehension I missed that one he has a yeah he had a good take but they were misinterpreting it to be a criticism of Kendrick which it isn't he said I'm happy it's people saying they didn't like the halftime performance maybe we can get back to the separation of music and stop letting the internet um jumble everything up real rap [ __ ] ain't never been for all of y'all and I think that's I think that's basically summing up kind but I actually yeah I mean I it's one of those things where I I see people say things like that all the time where they're like bring back gatekeeping bring back gatekeeping and it's like yes and no like unfortunately music is mainstream it's going to be consumed by any and everyone who wants to um it's more of a matter of I'm seeing people and I don't know if you guys have seen this as well but like I'm seeing all of these white folks showing themselves like enjoying the performance and being like I got it look at me and I'm like okay great like why is that the new I understand the assignment it's the blue bracelet it's the is or it's like my mom's 55 years old and she got and then it's like a clip of like a white lady dancing like okay I like I don't what you know and so I think that that kind of touches a little bit on what Germaine is saying is that like our cultural stuff isn't necessarily meant for everyone and it is okay and like I don't need I don't need you to co-sign it in order for me to think that it's valuable or worthwhile and I've seen a lot of that and I saw a lot of that coming off of you know Beyonce winning album of the year like white people trying to be like oh now I now I listen to it so now I get it it's like oh okay it doesn't matter if you got it or not like it was still good before you said it was good and similarly I'm seeing that same sentiment post the Super Bowl where once people are actually oh I couldn't understand the lyrics and then they read them and then they understand it it's like okay I I I don't care if you liked it or understood it to begin with so that's important part right I don't care if you like I don't care if you liked it why are you the cuz I kind of want to make clear that I think it is cool when music can deepen someone's cultural understanding and like have them gain more empathy or whatever the issue is that when my white friends tell me or I see white people say oh I got the performance y'all are never saying that to your white friends like y'all are running to me to be like look like you just like got another new L another level in dual lingo for ionics or some [ __ ] uh instead of like if you if I should not know about it at all to be honest but if you took that same energy and like talked to your other two white friends who also got it even if y all three get it that would be a much better value ad than this weird posturing or like uh I for I'm forgetting the word for it but like you know making understanding rap like an icon of allyship yeah no you're absolutely right and on top of like not needing them to get it I need us to not feel the need to explain it you know what I mean and that's what I'm seeing a lot of like this need to like explain it but also like debate and fight with them I think in in like in inherent in the performance is the awareness and understanding that white America will not like this you know what I mean will not approve of this like that's in the dialogue like you know it's there so Kendra clearly goes into the performance like we said with that knowledge that like I'm not making it for you you know what I mean I'm not giving you the hits I know you're not going to understand it and I'm not making any statement on it so I I I wish we would follow suits like I see so much of like I was wondering this like there are all these like white supremacists whose like opinions and right-wing people I would never see if I didn't see black people on my timeline reposting it mad like engaging it and I'm just like my in my life experience with racist has told me that nothing will upset them more than ignoring them like the idea that their opinion doesn't matter upsets the [ __ ] because that's what they're mad they're inherently mad that like something wasn't made for them that they weren't centered that they were excluded that nobody cared or took into consideration how they would feel about this performance what they would like and so let them Ste but I'm like the more we like engage I agree with it but then it's not and I'm just G to be that person like and then I'm a [ __ ] walk it back to it not having to be a um you know uh you know such this special type of decoding because it had to be for some people right um you know I graduated from the number one HBCU in the nation Florida A&M University and there's a lot of things I wasn't taught coming from Florida south Florida as a Haitian girl going to fam there was a lot of things I did not know now my black American fellow people that were there they knew some things that I didn't know and I had to learn and unlearn some things going to that black University but there are people online baby that just want to be stuck it ain't only our you know white folks it ain't only them it ain't only the conservatives it ain't only the the people who just don't want to get it that are white or you know less melanated it's black folks online man that that performance wasn't even all that for real you know y'all always want to see St it was deep but really the Super Bowl supposed to be a performance and you know and and it's not even that they don't get it they don't want to get it so they're online doing the same thing um saying that this is not about being woke and there are some people who really didn't understand who need needed to go decode it like they needed to go to your page Christian to go get like see what that 40 acres in the mule was about I know it sounds crazy we're black some people are black and don't know about this but that was a moment for them to be like what did I miss what can I learn what could put me on the stuff so that was a teachable moment for people that was for people to get to understand some of these things and where they're coming from um what that means for them in their Blackness moving forward um so I think that was a really good thing the messaging made not have been such a you know a like a big thing for us like such a special moment for us but for some other people they were like damn this is strong like I didn't even know this this makes me understand this a bit more especially in this climate people were Stuck on Stupid for a long time and that performance alone whether some people liked it or not it did open up doors and it was you know for people to learn a little bit more about the different things like what Uncle Sam meant like what the 40 acres and mule like what like the Injustice you know in our systems here in America towards black people those type of things and people got on and and that was just a good place for people to go actually learn what the hell this man is talking about what I loved about this too because he's a political Prize winner one of I think the only rapper that is that so this man is very good with his words he doesn't mince them as ol would say he literally is very great with his words and so everything that he said people can pick up on it or go back to his lyrics he even takes stuff from other poets um and creates rap with it um and so it's good to see that throughout it was like an educational situation and so maybe not for us it may not have been that deep but for some people it was deep I did I mean like I was online with the rest of y'all the the every second refresh was somebody either crying somebody hating somebody doing a thinkk piece somebody trying to you it was just all of the things but I think I give it room and space for everybody to have their moment um but what I did love for me for me I think that it was pretty it was deep messaging um for some people and I love that people went straight to the internet to get some answers from some black creators um about this that whole performance and what it meant for Blackness especially during agree I would just like to say that for I I totally agree with you Rebecca and and just to clarify I don't think there's anything wrong with people explaining the deeper meaning and kind of unpacking some of that stuff for me it's a matter of trying to convince somebody that it was convince somebody that it was smart enough like there's a difference between someone saying I don't understand and I want to learn let me go do the research let me go look up the reference and watch Christian's video let me go do a Google and watch a breakdown of it versus someone going H this really sucked and someone going no no no you have to see it's like then if they think it sucked let them think it sucked like why do you need to you know what it meant you know that it was meaningful and and Rebecca to your point there were black people that were saying the same thing it it wasn't just one generation one racial demographic that was saying that they didn't like it there were people of all backgrounds and I'm of the mind that that is the standard for all of them like I'm not going to convince you and I think the fact that Kendrick himself hasn't come out and made some big Proclamation speaks to that as well he's like you get it or you don't get it and I simple as that and I and honestly I I'll I'll call myself out here I think that's something that I need to internalize myself because I hate being misunderstood I hate being misrepresented I hate when people put words in my mouth and especially as someone who is a writer someone that is so thoughtful with my words and Olay we talk about this all of the time man we text each other and I'm like these [ __ ] are driving me nuts it's really really hard to stand in your power and say I said what I said either you get it or you don't get it and I'm going to move on and again I know that that's something I need to be better about and that that's the big thing that I'm taking away from this perform I just want to say I was something oh no go ahead Christian no no no no okay so something that like I love about GNX that sort of ties in with just the way this Super Bowl performance went is that Kinder there's this entire like debate right where it's like say you're making like a play or a book or a film or something thing well more so for like a player book right and it's about someone like you have family members who speak Spanish do you translate that Spanish for the audience right and you make them feel more like oh I understand this and I feel more welcome or do you not translate it and the people who speak Spanish can get it and if you don't get it you can ask you can check you can do things like that and I think it's something that I just generally love about GNX is that it feels extremely regional and local and it feels like a lot of Kendrick's work whether it be Dam or pimpa butterfly which are albums that I absolutely love kind of handhold you through it right there's deeper meanings to these things but they kind of guide you and narrate you and the the whole thing of GNX is like this is what it is you either understand this culture some Black Culture things some even more specific La things they're things that I was looking up like I don't know what jcat means I had to look at that's like I'm not from that part of the country and so like it's like this is for us and in the same way like his Super Bowl performance was like you get it or you don't ask somebody or don't I'm not explaining this I'm not like walking you through there not gonna be a part at the end where I go and it turns out that was really God and I was talking to God at the G like you get it or you don't and that's something that I think just like this this is the part of the performance that I really really enjoy wait wait real quick I I want to let Kevin talk to Christian's Point modifying your thing you either get it or you get help is is I think really what you were saying right and that's really what it is I I'm not going to ramble off that but like it is the idea I think this is uh what this halftime show has done to Rebecca's point about creating the sort of pipeline is that I think great art is art that doesn't tell you what to do but that just gets you curious on what the person was trying to say and because we are all curious people and we live in the internet where any curiosity can be satisfied it is easier than ever for the artist not to have to explain what they're doing doing but for this to be the Catalyst for you to like figure out why they said it like that talk to people that come from that community so yeah I was just GNA say I was one of the people who wrote A think piece on this immediately um and I wrote it it was I published it on substack like by 7 a.m. like I was up at 5 a.m. reading it because I couldn't stop watching the show and it's not necessarily because all of the stories and all the references were super deep like you guys pointed out but as a someone who's also like a visual artist myself I was just so enthralled by the way that he did tell the story and there are if you're if you're interested in looking at them like not even things that are necessarily about black history or Black Culture which we know was the focal point but is also his life story and so like how many things were in there that if you did the digging and you like spoke to his fans you're like wow that that went over my head like um you know in the beginning the PlayStation remote the lights Flash and it's a PlayStation cheat code uh for a Jurassic Park game when you did the cheat code you got 59 lives and this is the 59 Super Bowl and it's like that's random but cool um also who who has the time to figure that out actually oh I also heard it was um it might have been Grand Theft Auto um full like full health from San Andreas which was one of the GTA that would that would have been set in uh and then and that's yeah yeah I thought it was really cool um but there were some moments that from the show specifically that stood out to me the including the GNX and having everyone come out of it to me was really cool uh because it's the same car and I didn't know this I obviously like looked it up this is the same car that he was driven home from the hospital from that his parents drove after he was born he came home in a GNX now he's uh like making it a big part of this album and this story and for me I really loved watching all the dancers come out of it which I thought was so cool because it felt like he was saying these people come from where I come from like these are my people they're parts of me and I'm not they're not just background dancers like they're part of this story um and I thought that siza's part for some reason made me really emotional you know given the the pre-recorded track um I really loved that in the background we saw the dancers Marching In what I'm going to assume was a street because there were light posts and I don't know there was something about including her and those specific songs that weren't just s cuz she could have just done Kill Bill like she has hits that she could have sang cuz she's going on tour you know with him but doing songs that were optimistic and about hope and about love I thought was really cool um especially when you see dancers in the background like marching or like protesting um having her sing these like hopeful songs to me I was like I I feel like it was necessary I don't know there was to me there was a ton there and that kind of Dove uh doveet tail in with the cuz I feel like people were trying to have a lot of discourse on this just specific line uh after I don't I think I don't know if it's after Luther or before it when Samuel Jackson says uh oh pull in the culture card uh the cheat code deduct one life um and a lot of people were trying to figure out like what do they what do they mean by deduct one life not gonna hold you I still don't have a solid answer because I just have the one that like makes makes makes me feel the best uh when you think about how Regional and and specific not only G GNX but this entire Arc of um of what the Rampage Kendrick has been going on before this right I think a lot of us had had sort of just dealt with the fact that in order for someone to make it of and and be black eventually they gotta like leave the hood eventually they have to like they have to go fraternized with the 1% with the white people with the label uh just to make sure they have enough Capital to even to even bring it back home or they have to distance himself the way from blackness in order to get General Acceptance in that line I felt like when you put in the Contex of of the entire performance it is Kendrick proving like no I can bring my entire culture with me and not have it be diluted right I I can have utmost control over how I want my people to be seen and it can still sell the uh having to make it Multicultural or having to make it broad was uh uh um I I'm blink on a word right now but like was something we didn't actually have to give up and I felt like that was really powerful to be because like don't bring to the drink of it all right like the iny of this is drink in the sense of like being cultur less and like just just morphing saying now I'm G stand on my square and I'm giving you the best of me the best of my culture so that you can see how beautiful this one slap this one slice of the human tapestry so that came right after sorry go ahead jump I was say that that came right after man at the Garden and if you remember the Kendrick and the dancers are like at standing in front of a light post and the camera pans down to them and there's someone laying on the top of the light post and last month there was an Eagles fan in Philadelphia who was celebrating out in the street and he fell from a light post and died he was 18 years old he died um so people think that that was I don't think uh um Samuel L Jackson's line that you were talking about but I'm just highlighting that specific moment they think that that was Kendrick like sort of see it's and I think that um because it's that's why it's art he doesn't have to convince or explain I think that's the beautiful part of like as if we're reading a book right everybody gonna find something different if we watch um I know there was this thing that my super black teacher uh back in high school used to have us do and it's crazy we were children I don't know why we watch baby boy he made us watch baby boy did and um we we were kids in high school and we watched baby boy and he made us dissect it and all of us got something different from that movie so it's like we'll watch black art and all of us as black people will find something that we resonate with or find little things and and have a different um definition or how we see it and I think that it all is it nothing is false right it could be real it could be that's the that's the beautiful part I think of what Kendrick did as well it just falls into the artist of it what I also want to point out is look how long we started this conversation and we we've been having this conversation and we didn't even the first time mentioning Drake was tail just two seconds ago right it was um literally we didn't we didn't mention that because it was just so many so such good black greatness there that we didn't have to go into the whole Drake of it all even though a lot of people also that's the other side of it people wanted to make it seem like he was focusing on just D and Drake on his whole thing and I'm like we did y'all watch what we watched cuz remember he did that little teaser and he didn't even give us the song and then he gave it to us at the end there were he could have did a lot of songs that were directed towards him but he did he has a lot of so much body of work so much greatness that he just took songs with strong messaging and that one still has strong messaging in it but that towards the end because it was the least important um so I think that that's pretty good too because a lot of us are so focused on just especially now I'm telling y'all with how you know with what's going on in our nation what's going on around the world but having this be the the subject of of conversation um black people winning but this at the Super Bowl the same Super Bowl where we saw Colin Kaepernick um you know taking a knee and we ain't never see him on the field since right since Donald Trump was like get your boys in line all that other stuff this is great to see us kind of like reclaim this moment it listening to lift every voice and sing from one of our greatest Soul voices right now of our of our day lety and I just all of it was good and again you know what's understood doesn't have to be explained but it is teachable moment so people that want to go know the information is out there for you and available to you but Kendrick has always been the artist that he is today he might change his look up but the Artistry has always been consistent across the board so what was y'all's um favorite moment of the show because personally my entire household got up scream when Serena uped like scream they that like that was the one thing like my man's parents got everybody we were like they we jumped up like I was too hyped when I saw uh Serena I that was that was the most what about y'all I heard you like I'm young S no Serena was good and what I love about this because see the Nuggets that I was reading see I was I was getting taught baby because I was in people's comment section what that mean um Serena was in there you know doing her the [ __ ] Walk people were saying that related to her her sister um being gunned down um by you know in gang violence and that was that there but then it was like you know her teaming up with um Kendrick Lamar to have her reclaim her time moment with Drake constantly naming her name and songs disrespecting her her husband her relationship um and so she gets this moment to shine and reclaim her time but it was it was Serena came out there and I didn't even know she could do that like but she also also know she could do that because it's she also [ __ ] walked at Wimbleton and got a lot and got a lot of push back reason so the time yeah and I I think a lot of people were I mean man it was so frustrating again to see so many people reduce that to just being about Drake I'm looking at you Stephen A Smith no one gives a [ __ ] what you think if you would divorce her or not you're not in her League you've never been I'm looking directly at you I know he watches ol and friends I'm sure um but this idea of like oh she's she's just you know talking about her ex it's like Drake is allowed to take shots at her and her husband all of the time and the one time she responds and it's a very layered response it's not solely about him yeah it is turned into oh God she's she's obsessed she's a a wife she's a mother why is she thinking about him it's like okay it really shows me people can't do nothing but talk [ __ ] about women they'll find any circumstance it could be the bottom of the priorities list and they be like Serena let me talk about how you ain't being a good wife yeah but also the fact again if you remove the Drake of it all Serena is one of the most decorated athletes of all time in a majority white sport where she faced extreme levels of racism and misogynoir her entire career from when she was a child and so exact incomp and so it's a very very powerful statement that she was included in this moment and she was able to reclaim something that was you know used against her when she was quite literally at the top of her game I mean I think that's really really powerful I think her husband was the one that actually um tweeted out or thread it out whatever wherever it was but he said you know this moment was literally her like you were saying reclaiming her time because they you know scolded her for [ __ ] walking back in the day during Wimbledon and so she gets to reclaim her time and he said you know the y'all doing all this stuff and y'all don't even know this about Serena and it shows so you know that was that all in all I really do like just you breaking it down just now and just all these other breakdowns it was a moment for her to reclaim her time from a lot of people that have been have her name in their mouths or what cuz um Drake has been just there was no reason to sidebar and throw Digs at her husband and nobody saw there was just no reason you know she's been living her life it's been what8 plus years now those type of things so just her reclaiming her moment reclaiming her time and I think that that was also good Blackness and then here go Stephen A Smith you know there's are you're unmarried you know you're everything is wrong and you get on a mic you know a man of your caliber right it's just so weird to be like if I was married to her but you're not but you're not so why are you hypothesizing about what you would do you're not married you were personally wronged in your marriage and want to Humble black women all the time all him all the time and then booy baby cut the mic absolutely not AB see that aboy like defending Drake with all his heart about how wrong this is and I did not see that but Lucy is known for doing that he defends people with problematic past or atic Futures are problematic right nows juy does that we know that he'll get online and be like did he ain't do nothing wrong man they didn't his daughter for being a part of the lgbtqia plus Community get he gets online disrespects her you know he's known for being the this type of person which is very unfortunate you know because I do love that one song you know two red bones kissing in the back which is you know the irony of that too you like two red bones kissing in the back seat but you don't want your daughter kissing no you it just it makes no sense so I would I wouldn't take anything that booy says you know with not even a grain of pepper I'm here to tell yall what he said and now let's discuss he said just imagine all gaps locked just imagining how Drake field after boosting so many the artist career with his features and those same [ __ ] ain't got [ __ ] to say positive about this dude that's weest to me on God if I was Drake nobody could ever get another feature from me hash on Bleak and I'm not siding with nobody exclam exclamation just speaking facts I'm a Scorpio I don't take betrayal I don't take betrayal good at all hash I be in my feelings you know but that that is exactly what ol has been saying like the past couple weeks though about that's what i' be saying I'm Dr I would feel like if if I'm Drake I would feel that I said this said I'm just imagining like sitting there like he mad hurt for Drake I'm not in the crib upset for Drake I'm like I'm like if I were Drake I'd be in my CRI upset feeling like that I'm sure that that is how Drake felt so if I was going to communicate that it would not be in caps lock it would you find people on this show and I know King sh but the role play is is interesting I feel like Dr I mean um Drake Fe I don't we have to conversations you like but Drake has Drake has done so much wrong to people I'm G just put it right there like and by that I mean like lyrically but that's how the game goes in rap so but when it's done to Drake we have to be like you know what like we have to be careful how we speak about people and we just have to look out for Drake he's light skinned he's half white like he's he's had it hard he doesn't know who he is he doesn't know if he's black he doesn't know if he's this all of these excuses but when he was really in the booth coming for people's life coming for people's livelihoods threatening folks you know telling them that they're doing all the above it was it was Drake gang right it was all that but now he is on the other side of it because he found his match or somebody who was better than and all people can do is pull up old clips of Kendrick Lamar saying you know I'm really happy Drake brought me here I'm G to use this moment to show people who I am and they're like oh you see he been a fan he probably was and then Drake showed his ass so now what you gonna do like can I can I can I say the C out oh actually you got Chris no I I was just going to say I think people I I think maybe people just want mercy rule CU it does feel a lot like the Super Bowl game where they're up 28 and0 and you're just like like I don't feel for Drake but damn like but I would go to say it was was it that it was too much was it that it was too much or were they all just great quality shots no they're all know it's only three songs in one concert let me tell you I think what makes it feel crazy like why why I'd feel crazy if I was in my house is Drake if feels like Kendrick put like Beyonce Renaissance level of energy into planning and execution of Drake like a well time like no I like it's the way he did it like I never use a prop before it's the way he did it like down from the first shot it was like Drake just walked himself into that baited it and next thing you know is track after track just murdering you the way Family Matters came out and he thought it was finished and then two seconds later he was dead you know what I mean like and the game over on the screen like I need you to understand not only did Kendrick plan to like he made 2024 the worst year of his life he he didn't end it there he came into like he made like 2024 year was the worst year in his life and that wasn't the Super Bowl performance in that year like then you came in and you said I'mma do it one F he he literally like you know what it is for somebody to beat your ass and it's not like it's not like y'all both get into a fight and like y both got wearing out like but he beat you he just kept beating your ass till he decided he was done he put game over on the screen like I'm finished there's nothing else I can do to you this is the Super Bowl and I've murdered you on TV I I ran I spent months training to be able to run this field so that I could say say Drake at perfectly timed laughing in your face popping up and [ __ ] and now I put game over in like he zoomed out to the to the whole stadium so you could see everybody singing a minor it's like somebody said J jao's in the corner singing I had a pray and grandmother I said now why no I was like let me tell you something I I was when it was happening I was like you know there's some girl in drink house right now going through it trying to like they like it ain't even it ain't even all like that for real no just in there like it don't even I think it going so I think it going so mainstream also was part of it which is like a level of irony in that like Kendrick is kind of calling out the fact that Drake is this colonizer who makes music for the masses and then he takes a diss track that then becomes something that everyone is participating in I mean when you see mainstream Brands referencing like the the diss track like it's just crossed over into I I've seen commercials that have done it I've seen tweets from brands that have done it I mean just so many people have tagged it say Drake meme that brands are doing someone like dualingo tweeted like say Drake and people were like what did Drake do to this s think that's Tre that's Tre but also you call sorry I was just gonna say the whole thing with like the song Going mainstream I think the worst part about it is that Drake asked for this because Kendrick did this song just to prove because Drake was like you don't have any hits he's like I can make a hit I'll make one overnight here you go and it was a huge hit um and my favorite part was when the crowd sang but seeing it from people's like videos in the crowd because the crowd was mostly quiet like because it's mostly white people they didn't get it um and a ton of people were just dead silent but they knew that song and they jumped into sing along and I was like it's so funny that y'all are singing a song so hyped because you think you're you're all taking shots at Drake and like it's this rap beef but this song is as much about you as it is about him like this song is about you you didn't even realize it like I don't think it's irony I think about it being cat or mainstream I think it's intentional or it's intention right in the sense that my favorite through point of this uh homicide of of a lightskin Canadian man is that he's saying the only reason we liked you was because you were able to make catchy things like your superpower was being able to do caty things that's not special to me Kendrick Lamar like I can also do that and I the reason why I find it so interesting because I do see how it relates to I think White Privilege in general like this idea of like when a white person does something like oh look at me I can I can write you know these type of characters or I I I i' I've made this app when we all know in the back of our head there's like some working class brown person in a in a place that has no public education that's trying to do the same engineering feat or trying to do or or or even think of Serena right there like like I grew up in a in a um in a in a tennis like ass neighborhood on the other side of the fence uh and like you got to start apparently you got to start doing tennis at like four years old if you have any chance of like going professional uh and you got to spend a lot of money and do a lot of time to do it which is why uh there's not a lot of black historically haven't been a lot of black tennis players that makes you think how hard uh must have been for for Serena and um and Venus to come up to be honest they would say I don't think I stroke harder I think I was just better or I don't think I got here because I struggled harder I think I was I think what they do is not all that impressive and like that's what I always see with this with with the succession of Kendrick songs is like like once again like as we've been saying Kendrick could make catchy songs but it's almost like that's not the entire point of having a music career perhaps sometimes you want to say something and maybe say something that can also be catchy which is something that that Drake unfortunately never got to do yeah you're right I think it it solidifies like Kendrick's inherent point that like Drake you are a part of the machine like what you do is formulaic right like you yeah you can make hits but it's because you you follow this formula that you've stolen from us and a machine is behind you but you're not special if I wanted to do this you know what I mean do this thing I could do this thing we choose not to do this thing because this isn't what is this isn't hip hop this isn't what we value or we respect this isn't authentic but to prove your point in this rap battle I'm going to create every kind of Dis Track on you I'm gonna create ones just for me ones for the mainstream just for the raphe heads like oh it's so yeah like Drake I just need Drake to just go into hiding for a while like just just sit out honestly just sit out 2020 think time go ahead Christian oh I think it also kind of hilariously played one second plays into like multiple Drake lines that have aged particularly poorly two during the beef but I want to get one from like 10 years ago that it's but two during the beat that age particularly poorly there's one that's like um canri just open his mouth someone hand him a Grammy right now right and that aged terribly and then there's also the the the song that didn't start the beef but sort of is an origin point of the beef which is first person shooter with him and J.Cole where they're talking about being the big three and they like me and J.Cole were as big as the Super Bowl and then Kendrick Lamar is as big he's not as big as the Super Bowl he did the Super Bowl right but the that I want to get back to is that like specifically the Drake Kendrick Feud has been going since like the end of that tour they did in like 2013 there's a line from Drake on the game song 100 where he says I would have like I think he's like I would have half your fans if I sto going pop and went on some concert [ __ ] and I think that like there's something like understanding how Petty this beef has been this entire time and knowing that it's like Drake can claim that he could go conscious and get all Kendrick's fans but Kendrick has proved that he could make some pop hits and get everyone to like him like in the same like in the same field that he's in I think that I think it's just like in this series of poorly aging things like yeah like no we I could do this yeah didn't Drake also say something along the lines of like you make music for like freeing the slaves or something like that yeah that was recent that was in the um one of the so mad he didn't do the second you yeah which is it's one of those things where it's like to your point Christian it's like you're really telling on yourself by saying that like it's a a bad it's a bad thing to make music to free our people like that's that's hiop a I will say as as a side note because they're technically like I mean Kendrick's not on TDE anymore but it sort of has that same Vibe as when people were saying that like DOI was making Harriet Tubman music where there's like clearly just like a group of people who have been so like like I love rap I love hip-hop as an entire genre from Mumble rap to to backpack to battle like I love all of it right and I think there's like we reached a point where there is such a disconnect for a lot of people between like mainstream rap and like like sort of like traditional hip-hop stuff where they'll see someone who's just doing like sort of classic hip-hop stuff DOI she's still making hits but she's still doing every once in a while some classic hip-hop stuff and people are like oh Harriet Tubman rap it's like oh you guys are not connected like yeah or they just don't like it and it's like not for them and that's okay that's the same messaging there too but F quick to to box people in that's what it is it's like they don't interact with these people's music or their catalog they see something that they think speaks to a different kind of black a type of Blackness that they obviously don't like and they group it there so once they decide like oh you boom bap or whatever the or You original anything that comes off authentic to them authentic or like old school or like old heads would appreciate this they assume that's all it is I don't like it and I'm going to put it over there in my anti black box or if it's like a um you know if it ends up on the wrong side of the internet that happens to be a massive place on the internet um then people are going to go with this is just what that person is right like so your special song uh that may be a Tik Tok song Meanwhile this artist has a whole platform and here you are reducing this this artist to this piece this of work that they don't even they don't even sound like no more they've since pivoted since grown from um and that's what they try to do with DOI that's why we've seen Drake do that I mean while I can consider it just stealing people's face accents all kind of things but you know we've seen him pivot and I have danced to every one of those songs and pivoted right with him okay um I do know and I still I ain't gonna lie Drake lost this but I still you know listen to his music he's still on my playlist if I haven't deleted him it's not that screaming numbers are up so so um as you know as she got good music but um you know I I think about how Drake has documented his hateration and the holleration for for Kendrick right he'll be in these interviews and he'll say things like you know but was he that great though like I was watching a clip when him he was saying something um along the lines of his Kendrick's first disc ear early on right one of his first this early on and he's like but do you do y'all remember the line though do you know his music can you name his catalog and I'm like you know that's not aging well because you thought he's like Kendrick is a moment and I said but you know sometimes moments are great because they're sometimes they're Unforgettable he's somebody that doesn't need to be popping out every single week month but sometimes you do got to pop out and show it does and that's your consistency you always do pop out every well every other year every now and again and it's always memorable it's always something that we can quote and say this was a moment it is a moment that is historic Drake you're great we're gonna we're gonna dance to your music we're gonna wrap your lines they're gonna be captions for our um you know our Instagram videos or reals or whatever or Tik toks but Kendrick showed you while you said that he was just the moment and he likes just being the moment but he also showed you he can do what you do so now when that last album came out from Kendrick Lamar everybody took his lyrics and now those are the captions underneath Instagram photos and reals and things like that he doesn't have to stay there he doesn't have to be there but he's just showing that he's a very listen he can't be stopped I I think that he's going to go back into his family man self after this and that's all right too because that's who Kendrick is you know you want to hear my Petty shallow reason for why like I've missed so many Drake's like um shots and all Drake's shade and stuff like that throughout the other of people was never like important to me like I never went as someone who listened to all Drake's music like I don't give a [ __ ] what Drake is who Drake was like oh he don't like or who do what like I never once looked into like what does that mean that Drake is saying XYZ and I think like I didn't realize like I think I just kind of aged out of like where you don't really know all the happenings of the like the person whose music you like or whatever so I didn't realize he was doing as much or living the way he was living but my the reason why I think I don't check the Drake in Drake's personal life and I think Drake is kind of like unevolved and like in an un like not adult way to me I think it's the same way like like old like old old um beham ofans will be like oh they ain't voting for such and such a politician because they ain't got no wife or they ain't got no husband like they ain't got no family like my my daddy will be like my daddy be like if he can't Le his family can't leave me reason why he's not and for me I think if you notice especially of my generation and like when I was in high school when I was in college the most successful rappers and the most popular rappers all had a woman like you know what I mean even if not like a wife they have whatever they had like a popular woman like you know what I mean I remember one point in time people realizing like pointing out that that's what w needed to like kind of you know rebab his image like a cool woman or whatever would have done a lot for him but think about it like L way all had like um Toya you know Rick Ross had like what was it lra either lra Amer I think it was lyrial law America watchs one of them at one point in time like um Kendrick has a wife jcole has a wife like b Sean had J like Walker had timey like every rapper of my kind of my time like had that and it always said something to me that as famous as Drake is as much money as he is as he's a handsome man we've seen Drake Jake Jake's Nudes on the internet you know he running on and on about women and gals and crying over [ __ ] who don't want him in every song I remember the first time he sang Alicia Katia and I said a [ __ ] from the Bad Girls Club don't want him something is up here you know what I mean and I said I it was really then and so for me for that moment on that was enough for me to know anything Drake was saying Beyond like what stood out to me is like why like this catchy little ton wasn't my business like this man is shallow and childish and into like childish things in a way that wasn't my business so that's my shallow or bamian reason I don't take Drake seriously I feel like it's it's it's a big thing because like getting older right getting older with Drake's like Drake's older than me but getting older with Drake's music where it's like yeah when I was in college and he was like early mid 20s maybe and he was like uh yeah this girl I had to sleep in sorority like she didn't call me back blah blah blah she was a stpp I was like yeah yeah and then like I'm dirty now like why have you not changed like you still rapping about the same [ __ ] like I think one of those lines is like oh I took her out she's young so she doesn't know the classics I can't relate to that relative you I sh like a personal analogy about Drake while we're talking about this just what I thought was really interesting cuz I've always wondered why he class C ifies himself or like calls himself like a certified lover boy when he is I guess he is that but Drake is like a a gaslighter I know someone who dated him for a while uh like three years and it's interesting the way that rappers like Drake because I'm sure he's not the only person that does this but rappers like Drake have people play their roles um in the background and like if you get your needs met and you're getting all these nice things and I'm sure a lot of people are like happy doing it but like to a late point I'm like why won't you pick someone like you have all these girls like you have a girl in Toronto you take this is actually a very specific story but it's fine you take a girl from Toronto and her entire group of friends and fly them to a private island for a week just cuz you weren't even there like you're just doing these things for people and I wonder what he gets from that like what do you feel like doing these elaborate things and providing all of this to people that you don't want to choose like you know sound like about FD talks a lot about like kayfabe especially in reference when he's talking about T and people like that and I know we talk about that more in reference to like Drake as an artist or like his Rapp or so or like Drake versus Aubrey Graham but I think of Drake More To Me Drake's kayfabe is more evident in the way his relationship with women has gone not just like in terms of his personal relationship with women but his relationship with women as an audience women as a collective because Drake REM I feel like Drake's music is and I love Drake's music but Drake's music is is musically like sonically the scorned nice guy like telling on himself like because all Drake's early music is kind you know what I mean it is kind of like think about that if you look at take care at the beginning and you look at for all the dogs V are two different but it's the same it's the same mad mad that the first thing didn't work out because like listen I think that that also speaks to the fact that there are a lot of people and I think this is kind of like the underlying message of a lot of Kendrick's Retreat critiques of Drake is that he's not authentic he doesn't really know who he is and a large part of his thirst for fame and thirst for the spotlight is trying to replace this part of himself that he doesn't actually have real ownership of and unfortunately I think that happens to a lot of people in the spotlight there's so many people who you're like you are rich you are famous and yet it's still very painfully obvious that you're very insecure and you are consumed with what everybody thinks about you and you want everybody to like you and you are just like putting on this front because you are trying to fix something that's broken that can't be fixed with external things and I think that that is very true about Drake and it it just it it is this performatives like I'm really cool I'm above it all but it's like you're really not like like and I think that that's why everybody's kind of enjoying this so much because no matter how much he postures it's very evident that this has really gotten under his skin because what Kendrick is saying about him is true I mean it it it shows what a lack of community or yeah what the lack of community does to someone because I think the true difference between Kendrick and Drake in their trajectories is that at least from Kendrick's point of view he feels he has a community that is going to validate him that is not connected to his like job or you know the parasocial of the outside cuz like I find how like when you when you speak it out it's actually s such a sick cycle because if you don't have a community but you get a big platform or or you you suddenly like can be validated peace meal by a large bunch of people since you don't have any like Foundation under that to be like actually I'm good like my friends like my music my friends like my art like I can now be comfortable with distancing myself from the mob you're now trying to get the mob to like you but the mob's always growing and changing so of course you never feel stable in your identity you're constantly having to like adjust it because the only well that you you want to go to is to the public that you make stuff for see see the fairness this this me making my argument she was talking about earlier is I like again for Drake is I think like I have I'm notna lie I have such a soft spot for people emotionally reacting to like things that I know every human being would you know what I mean it's like everybody in Mass is like commenting on the reality that yes Drake is very bothered even though he keeps trying to tell us he's unbothered right and everyone's like oh he should do this do that but I'm just like who the [ __ ] wouldn't be bothered who could take a beating like this like I'm so sorry it's like I I always feel like I have to say that because I feel like a hypocrite with someone with a platform that's so much smaller known by so much less people and I can think of so much [ __ ] that has made me mad as [ __ ] like set the [ __ ] out of me or made me sad or a misar mischaracterization or like I don't I know how I feel when I see people talking about me with authority on the internet when you don't know me and like making these you know speculations and stuff so I'm like I like on one hand I'm like yeah I know Drake should should I know that the answer because I know that we all know even though we keep learning it like we all know it never helps when you try to defend yourself on the internet you it never helps when you try to clarify it never helps when you respond or acknowledge the [ __ ] never but how many times have you fallen down the [ __ ] hole because it's like ah this is this is [ __ ] so it's like on one hand I'm like Drake I know that the answer is for you to shut the up and go somewhere and be quiet and and come back and act you know I know that silence is always the best response but I also know how hard that [ __ ] would be because I honestly so much [ __ ] like I'm a sensitive gangster like I can't imagine can I can I ask a question yes I'm curious what everyone thinks Drake could possibly do to come back from this because at some point he is going to have to try and say something and I I have a thought but I would but Christian seems very excited so I would love for everybody to chime in with what they think Drake should do literally literally nothing he just has to drop another good album and the same people who've been listening to his music will put on his music and I know that's like the thing that about like it's the thing that o is saying is but it's like genuinely if he just drops another album with he he gets another like do you love me moment the album has to do you think that the album has to speak to the discourse and respond to it or it's just like pivot away and just no but it has to I think he has to take off first of all I think he has to take off at least a year I think he needs to not say anything like not be heard from I need he needs to Frank coach in us for a year like a solid year no matter what to nobody don't be seen nowhere you go off on a private island by your Dam self that's one I think two he has to make I don't think he has to address any of the stuff but he has to make a album that feels like it it tells a story like it has to feel cohesive and like unskippable and I also think he has to have no features I think he has to have as minimal help as possible because these will you Atlanta this you da you know what I mean he has to go by himself at a studio in his house with like the original you know what I mean and go relax and I think he has to do that I think he has to put out a fire album at like the top of 2026 and then put out and Then star in a fire movie at the end of wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait okay that's my theory I think he retires from music and goes the acting route and comes back in like what's Drake's version of The Joker like totally transformative be the villain you know you guys say that I'm performative you say that I'm fake I'm goingon to go all the way fake so that you're you're watching the movie and you're like is that Drake and he's like somebody totally unexpected in a Marvel movie or like something like that's a huge Blockbuster this is no shade to Will Smith but like if he could take Will Smith's place as like white like lightskinn mandour and action movies like just one I think I think it would be I think it would be really revolutionary because it would be unexpected and also it's a lane that Drake is familiar with he's been an actor and I think again if the criticism has been you are this culture vulture as a musician it's like lean all the way F into it and be like I'm going to transform into a totally new person that you've never even seen before it's a no it's a no for me dog and I say because I feel like you know Drake Drake I will agree with this though Drake does need to take a break like when things are embarrassing and things are happening I know some people can get through it because they will shut up and they will not focus on that issue but Drake you can tell is so salty about it you know you know the lawsuit all that stuff now it's gotten crazy right now it's got you were winning with other people when they mind you this was on Futures album this was a future on Futures album he wasn't even he wasn't even considered at the Grammys right now he done birth or or or grew this person inside of Kendrick Lamar or had this person come out inside of Kendrick Lamar and now Kendrick Mars all these grimy winners and stuff like that whatever but back to Drake I think he need to just sit down you took an L baby and then you started you started doing the most um it made you look come it made yeah it made you look weak and now we need you to sit down you got money enjoy your life go be with your mama you know check for your daddy I know do all that but the he's already an actor we've seen him acting and I think I like Franchesca I believe he's a great actor and I think that I didn't say he's a great to be fair watch the let me be clear let me clear I'm not saying he's he's greator I'm not saying he's greator I'm saying that he can act and that it is a place he's familiar but let me clarify I said great actor because we seen him you know go into people's culture and just take it right and just you know just be standing by people five minutes and you got the accent you stand by people five seconds you got here so he he's he's a great actor and I think that you know eventually we'll probably see him in this lifetime you know go into acting I believe that he just he needs to step back he needs to take a breather and then come back because he doesn't he doesn't miss retiring album just to like even about what the critic no no no he does let me tell you he has to WRA up I think he would retire too I don't think like like no never put on music again because or not do anything it's because I think he should move on to acting too let me tell you why I I agree with Franchesca on that 50 c as problematic as he is has a book that I have and read covered like front head right like it's really it's really a good one but 50 c explains how he like came to the conclusion that rap wasn't gonna be it for him no more you know what I mean and he was like the problem with a lot of artists like people ask him how he's been able to be so successful in transition he's like because they're not honest with themselves they won't accept when [ __ ] like the writing is on the wall he's 50 he said he realized like he had a song I don't remember what it was but he said he performed it overseas and it was a bangero he performed an American would be crickets and he realized like this is a young man's game this is for me and that's when he started looking into a vitamin water and you know producing and doing these different things I think there are always times to move on or to expand or where you start focusing your energy somewhere else before we didn't realize Rihanna was retiring for a long time Rihanna retired on us and playing sight and we didn't realize it like we didn't realize oh when she started fany Beauty this [ __ ] was never coming back she gave us a fire last album and left right and don't address us with running on with her music I think it would make people respect Drake that he goes you know what I lost this and I'm out right if you think 50 you think 50 really um you know uh I think he just found another place to put how he is he's not somebody who lets go yes the the game is for the young did that right he does all the petty things he does as a part of his like marketing and keeping his social media like popular 50 Cent is a moneymaking concerned about his long-term pocket everything he does evil and evil as it be because I thought laughing at IR Gody dying was crazy the other day and a million other things keeping that post up on the Internet like is he doesn't [ __ ] up [ __ ] but he has a method to his Madness is what I'm saying I think in the case of Drake I think first of all if you at least if you had know maybe you never seen Drake act or do anything but if you are someone like a lot of people seem to believe that Drake's entire Persona is a fraud that this is Drake acting that Drake in of itself is a role and not his real self then [ __ ] he's done that well no and personally every time we've seen Drake even do like little skits his little SK and no Guidance with Chris Brown when he did I think his SNL he's real funny like he is like entertaining in that way I think if Drake goes and focuses on that I think he can do really well and I think I really think I agree with Franchesca I really think but I think it has to be one more album because your last albums don't speak to your last albums have not been good or or at least can't like withstand the kinds of CIS you're getting I think he needs to have Christian you go no I will say that like I think for these other artists the writing was on the wall like there was point in 50 Cent's career where 50 Cent would drop a single and like it was not getting the plays that it used to yeah people despite it all still listening to Drake like billions of stream he's he's still like in a position where like M he could still do music for a few more years no one's tuning him out of all that yet because people still like his music and uh I think that's one of the I think I think he could act potentially I do think that if he did pop up in a movie the first thing would be Kendrick scared this out of rap good narratives and a lot of [ __ ] talk [ __ ] like I I have watched a lot of different like artists and celebrities and even musicians like transcend their mus music careers when was talking [ __ ] at first you know what I mean like so I think it could I think no matter what Drake does they're going to say something like it's going to be negative commentary and I just think it's in his best interest not to respond but I think it could be done because shoot not for nothing I watched one of them days the other day with sizza and the [ __ ] stole the show okay I was like she's great in this put her in more stuff I love her acting I was like wow I already love S as a musician but I want her in [ __ ] it has to be the right Ro I think the right role would really sell I also don't think it needs to be in front of the screen or I think what's more likely to happen will not be in front of the screen cuz we already do see Drake dipping his toe into producing like he has top booy he clearly has like the cap yeah right see he like he he's trying he has already been trying maybe he you could also you could also say he's seen some writing on the wall of like hey I need to prepare my second act I have like a lot of resources I don't but I know hip-hop is not going to pay me forever uh and I do think there is there is a more likely timeline where I'll put it like this I think if Drake ends up getting his name on another Euphoria type show without all the mess he can ride off in the in the backstage collect a couple Emmys collect a Golden Globe and we just won't he he he will be fine with us just never talking about him in a musical spear again as long as like he can kind of get into a new ladder CU these are competitive is really what it is right like if if they can get into another Lane and say okay I want to fight for that now I want spike lepot I want Stephen Ste uh I don't know any famous producers that aren't um in jail Gambino charges Cambo is who Drake thinks he is in my opinion besides the hits and that's a very it's a very unpopular opinion but I think that Charles Gambino is one of the greatest rappers who are out and he is a great writer also also was problematic problematic Behavior towards black wom I think that's actually a really good reference Kevin I think that if he went the Childish Gambino route and did a limited series or something like that I think L people don't know that con with Drake is that he doesn't make good choices like doing this tour in Australia with a vest riddled with bullet holes I'm like who on your team was like that's the thing green so I'm afraid like he's gonna do like zo Zana doing um did she play har Tubman was it no Simone she did someone in black face and I'm afraid that Drake is going to do more of what people already hate him for with film and television um yeah and um oh someone hates child C I'm sorry oh I who who hates Char can know U Christian apparently here's Cino has his own like you can have an hourong oay and Friends episode talking about all childish Kino's problematic thoughts and actions towards black women is damn self that's all I the thing with Donald sorry despise Childish Gambino's Mr and Mrs Smith re like Reb that show was pH the best show of 2024 I thought it was garage I might make video the thing with Childish Gambino I Wason say and now I know I want you Kevin I officially know your TV taste I disagree with because I'd be reading all your threads like what is this Kevin talking about and now I know I was going to say is at least Charles Gambino as an artist I don't see Drake as being an artist which is my thing with like do we need another album Charles Gambino whatever behavior that I'm not familiar with um all of his albums are a story like Camp is a great album and so he grows and I was listening to Usher today on KiKi Palmer's podcast and Usher was talking she's like where did confessions come from because like you didn't have a baby by woman you barely knew so like where did that and he was like I made that album sitting around with my boys and we talked about all the toxic [ __ ] that we were doing at that time and like we were addressing all the things that we had to grow out of and that's where the music came from so at least let me close this chat because Christian is um Christian I want to hear you come talk about Jito please mind you I like respectfully respectfully respectfully sh GNA be known as a jack of all trades a master of none I wouldn't say he's the best at anything but I do think he's solidly good and listenable and watchable he makes shows some of them are really great some of them aren't really great sometimes I'm like oh wow that was really cool then sometimes I'm like oh you went for a really cool concept super pretentious and meaningless but pretty like he he does it all and I I respect and appreciate that camp is C Camp that the camp take is crazy but everything else well I think well here's here I wouldn't say I love camp but it did have a concept charish Gambino is also again with Drake there's so many parallels between them but Childish Gambino is honest about the things that he is Charles Gambino the performer the the the artist is a character so even his music I'm not listening to it digging deep into who he is it is supposed to be a story Drake doesn't know what he's doing I think honestly I think Kevin made a great reference because Char Gambino and Drake both have very shaky very shaky falsettos you know I think it's a great refence I think it's a good I like doesn't mean that they're both great but I think in the same sphere the acting the producing the writing the questionable singing I think I don't have a problem with the comparison I think where I disagree or where I disagree with is um the idea that Childish Gambino is a a fully realized version or a better version of these things I think the comparison is real and that's why I think it's ironic that they don't like each other but I I I I don't think like Childish Gambino is a superior musician to to Drake or like outright anything like that although I do like I really like chalice Cino music I think chalice Cino has a a bigger career a more robust career in terms of everything else so you can't compare Drake to him on that level right like this man he has he and he has the accolades which I think ultimately is what Drake wants which I think is Jake's not making Atlanta Jake's not making abely I will give he is a lot more I guess authentic like personally authentic because in childish Kino I know childish Kino originally as a standup comic before I know him even as an actor or even as a musician as a and as a writer before and as a standup and as a TV writer and he always wore clearly like this is who I am like I am like a black nerd a weirdo I don't you know da da like I didn't talk like this I don't act like this I don't I'm not gonna try to pretend to be a hood and I don't think that's changed so I will give that like I think that much hasn't changed I he's an actor you know no he's Kevin Love it mean it absolutely love the you know comparison no I do and I just think that you know going back to Drake um Drake can do what Childish Gambino has done now musically I don't think that I can tie the two together but I see where you were going and I'm in that I'm on that lane I don't think that Drake's a strong I don't think Drake would be able to write and produce because before before uh Donald Glover gave us Atlanta he was a writer on 30 Rock I mean he was an actor on community you know so I think again I think it's a good comparison in the sense that like that's a career that I think Drake could model the next chapter of his career after and with the right producing team again like the Euphoria of it all I don't think that Drake actually has like a strong hand in the direction of euphoria he's a producer in name but I don't but I think if he was paired with the right team he could create a show not in Atlanta between Donald Drake needs to be um let me just get this out and I'm going give you the floor Drake needs you know in this time it's going to be his development time right he hasn't been acting again he acts in real life but I think this will be his downtime to just be who he is and it will be his development time if he's going to Pivot into something else Donald Glover before we got what we got right what we have right now it took some time but like you said his his history his you know his resume he's been Drakes acted but a long time ago right people want to mention to grassy he wasn't so bad on that but he does act in real life and I think he need a good partner is what I'm saying he can take yeah so I he can take some of the formula um or from whatever we see that with because I like Donald Glover but I also like that he believes in himself y'all may not buy his albums he'll still put out another one if he feel like it y' may not watch his his his stuff he he'll put out another one Drake isn't that confident for me I'm going to say Drake give Kenya Baris a call I just feel like they would let me get let me get out this one real quick thing two two quick things one very GL story of like not liking your Blackness and then like coming to terms with it later on in your life two uh the reason why Drake can't or the difference between Drake and Donald gber really comes down to what were what Franchesca just said about having a team and it's because even on Atlanta there were so many writers on Atlanta they were the different writer on on on swor uh he's used to being in in Ensemble writing cast he's okay with the idea of collaboration in a way that I think Drake is fundamentally uncomfortable with yeah and that really comes from like growing up under under Birdman in the way that we saw they handled royalties and ownership of work but like this idea that Drake for as good as a masterful of a songwriter he is has been terrible at visuals and has always required someone else to have like the entire vision for him to just plug himself into because like Drake's iconography all any Drake iconography we like is either from Director X or from Hy Williams like that's about it he doesn't have that that's why Kendrick beat him so so um so handily right is because like he doesn't uh I don't think his brain work he's not interested in in in that part of the art uh so when you say something like oh have him make a TV show or like have him just partner with somebody I don't trust him to pick good partners that wouldn't be Yes Men or like but that's I think part of the the year-long downtime to actually take the time to reassess I mean and I said Kenya Baris as a joke only because like Kenya Baris loves like mixed race people TV shows and I feel like if kind of on the SNL tip of it all if he did something that was like his version of you know a Larry David kind of like very meta comedic show about you know like a disgraced rapper that's trying to like win back his audience I feel like something like that could be so funny and also unexpected from him and again like win people over I'm on board it would be self it would be very is gonna move like that because she that's what she does too that's what it's very self aware like she would really to be point out that he needs a partner I'll shut up after this sorry but like I I was talking to someone recently about like how people in media artists like they all you can point to really great artists and point to the person that was by their side you know like Tony and baby face and Beyonce and Matthew and it's like everyone has that like other side of the coin that maybe we don't see but like who does Drake have Drake has himself Drake is very very what we're gonna see is that like how you guys just made this very clear like you know Donald Glover has a team people who can he can work a Time Drake likes to be the star of the show and Drake is not confident enough enough in my opinion to allow people to be around him to have better mind or or or have suggestions and mind you I don't know this man I'm not on this payro I ain't got the type of money he got but that's just my two cents on that that's you know well I will say Drake Drake had the thing that I G to ramble out like Drake has a team but he's never been in the workshop so like Drake has Noah and he like hit boy he has like a team of people the the Drake sound that mix of like old R&B plus some rap Melodies and like that sort of reversed Reverb sound is very curated and crafted with the people he's been workshopping with since he first got off of the grassy but what he has never been in is that he's never been he's never been like a line writer he's not someone in a writer's room he's not somebody who had to do a production he's not somebody he didn't have like a YouTube show he wasn't even like oh I was I was having to go in and do Rap Battle beats and then one of my songs blew up and I got a chance like he blew up very fast LeBron James he's never been a like he's a work he's got a work always had his compound he's never been just like not Drake do you know what I mean he's always had that level of success and I think the difference between him and Charles Gambino give it where's credit Charles Gambino did YouTube comedy did standup comedy did wrote on 30 Rock yeah did these things and then like that's years and years in development even if you look at like someone um Quinta Brunson right like she was on BuzzFeed she did the work she did this she was on these shows she did comedy she did this this and that and it's like all these people have that work work Drake's done that for rap and rap exclusively and it's like Tak an improv class yeah improv you know I I really wish for Drake that more people were there like I was when he was under grass he is Aubrey gr talking about wanting to do music and was laughing him out of the building on the end you know like I I want y to Drake was trying he was Aubrey wanting to make music for so long that they wrote it into his storyline to appease him like hair damn do a little music cuz no one's entertaining you it was like between Drake's like or like between Aubrey's first tell gu he wanted to do music and like when the replacement girl which was a flop came out is a is a gap you know what I mean this is when was Replacement Girl flop replacement girl like you talk about Best Best I Never Had is the single that makes people think rep girl that's the first time I heard that that that hit number 10 106 in park I remember cuz I was rep girl Replacement Girl it did I I remember I remember girl it was a good one it was a good one now I he's not confident right now I think that Drake just hit a place if this was if we were having this conversation about Drake um pivoting into this next you know with acting or something else right um I if this was like maybe five six years ago I feel like we that would be a no-brainer for Drake and he would probably be going into developments and stuff like that but I feel like we see how selfish he is is um and how uh he's about he's not taking this l so well so there's not going to be room for development I do believe if he does back up sit on somebody's couch preferably a therapist and just really have a conversation let things out for about a year and see about himself right self-awareness we talked about that and I think that he needs that and then he can bring in people who can actually help development into his next wherever going in life what that looks like but I do think that I could see Drake doing movies I can see that but giving up music forever absolutely not I um you know he might do like a l cooj right right L coj came from the 80s baby and I was you know what was it doing the head shake when I was in high school and he was in movies and he was okay you're disrespectful that's what you are Drake also reminds me of someone else who I think needs to retire and the reason why their career isn't where they wanted to be they don't have the accl that they want to have and the same thing is like they only have yes men around and no one can tell them anything and they don't make good choices is Jennifer Lopez it's someone who blew up overnight you hate her I hate her oh I love that you recognize me for that um yes hate her she's the worst uh but I don't know here's the thing I'm kind of inspired by the fact that she's the worst like she's like yeah the whole time that you guys were like Drake needs to retire in my head I was like and take JLo with you why do you hate her JLo hate me online seeming a little bit forced to me I'm not not not to say that people don't have valid reasons for hating JLo there's a bunch of people valid but I'm saying like train the hate wagon I hate when people pick up visceral hate from other people you know what I mean I'm like I'm like hating J like y'all hating JLo 30 years late for open shes we're we're so far off from the Super Bowl uh but if it makes you feel better no one hates JLo more than she does she is so unhappy um and I mean my whole thing with her is just like it's it's it's about being Latino and like the way that she came up in in the industry and then also like never going back and doing anything for anyone her like Latino identity serves as like uh it's it's she she dips in and out of it she plays European women in film but then like if she wants to get the cover of like people espol or if she wants to like win an Oscar then all the interviews are going to be about like how she like got it out of the mud I was like girl you did not get anything out of the mud like there's not that's not your story you grew up in a very nice neighborhood in the Bronx you went to a private school um but like for me like the whole thing is is similar to Drake like the way that she was like everyone hates me okay let me put out a documentary and a musical and an album all in the same week to prove people wrong and it's like just like Drake it's like you keep making the wrong decision like people want less of you you what I that's great I kind of loved it I thought the movie was I thought the movie and the dock were terrible but I was so inspired because throughout the whole process everyone kept telling her this is a bad idea don't do it and she was like [ __ ] it I'm gonna do it and honestly I think more of us need that energy too often artists are I'm hearing an echo oh it's it's yeah is it okay sorry I was just saying like as an artist I'm somebody that struggles with impostor syndrome and I often try to make things so perfect before I share it with the world and it was kind of empowering to see like the the scene where every musician is saying I don't want to be in your movie they're like no Kardashians and Nos and she's like fine I don't care it I'll do it myself like I kind of thought that that was really powerful but the movie that was about her that's not really scripted but kind of scripted it's like a do what hard she want them in there what was what she wanted she knew that no one would care so she was hoping that people being in it would draw in viewers but it's one of those things where again it's like why are you telling us all of these things about yourself all the time like we we don't need to know this I here's my thing about people like here's this this thing I will say It's Kind when people make things if they have their platforms regardless of what you want JLo is an incredibly famous person and there are a bunch of people that are her fans and that with her what's annoying is when people who don't like her go to go and participate in her like or don't like anybody go to go participate go watch their things just to like be like nobody likes you nobody wants this we want less of you it's like don't watch it then she like she and like I guess like here's my thing like I said I know all the reasons like I know all the reasons from the different perspectives like black people don't like how you did a Shanti and this and the next thing and she don't seem particularly in the nicest or or whatever but I will say some some because when people don't like women the way that they go about litigating like litigating them I don't necessarily like like I feel like you don't like JLo so then [ __ ] litigate all the men in her life into victims you know what I mean like oh JLo's ruining everything her relationship life becomes that way I don't necessarily like I'm not Latino so I don't get in Latino n my things about JLo none of my things about JLo are about her as a person or her relationships or how many times she gets married I don't make fun of her for those things that's none of my business like for me it's just it's JLo John liaz and who apparently invented [ __ ] walking by the way and George Lopez these are the three Latino these are the three Latino Gatekeepers who made it big and have made it a point to be like I Clos the door behind me and I'm not bringing anyone with me and every opportunity I get is going to be for me I'm not giving back to anyone and like JLo is crying in a documentary about not being nominated for an Oscar and it's like girl because you keep playing the same character if Jayla wasn't so obsessed with being the lead and everything she does and went and joined an ensemble film and played someone's like evil mother Hustlers Hustlers was an ensemble film she was the star and she produced it JLo has an audition for a movie in 13 years she does star she wasn't the star listen I don't know I think I feel a little bit of like Franchesca don't make me stand up for JLo JLo do bracelet to keep me inspired when I doubt myself okay I'm telling you I I genuinely I think there's something um I think like we respect when people be very like onean shows and when they like believe in themselves like bulldoze when it works out and like you know what I mean and like when it doesn't or when we don't view them at like the things they're doing is successful like we become against that like that method you know what I mean and like I think like we're watching some of JLo's failures but I think it's interesting that she's being like she's being summed up by all her failures in recent years rather than an overall like successful career and like I said I don't love I'm not a JLo fan I'm not a JLo Stan I don't listen to nobody's JLo music I didn't think hust was good I don't watch a lot of you know what I mean I like a lot I like some JLo films like I like enough I like um wedding planner I like Selena I can I mean and she be singing she be singing songs that are written for her okay they've been hits right and because they were let women be [ __ ] in peace like I just feel like honestly like let women be [ __ ] in peace like there's so many like up men and there so many up people doing [ __ ] up [ __ ] like a [ __ ] you know what I mean like's a [ __ ] like some of them are [ __ ] like let them be egomaniac [ __ ] like everybody else if she is that's what she is but Kevin you you know again you know I might be Haitian but they don't consider us Latino but I'm not in Latino are Latinos my grandparents are Haitian and I've made so many videos about this patian are the original Latinos Latinos were invented but the world it ain't get to the yeah baby so we just you know now now Kevin you know you don't like her I that's how I know you because on the internet any conversation surrounding started it you know you hate her and I'm like why you hate her so much like what happened didn't she block you you so much she has me block everywhere that's let me you don't you don't like how she utilized so you're like she she you don't like how she wears it as like underwear like her Spanish was good at one point and she thought it was so useless to her that she forgot it I don't like that she doesn't produce films for other people I don't like that with all the access and resources she has that her and John leamo have the audacity to be like I wish there were more Latinos in films I'm like make them make them why did she like she doesn't have to if she didn't cry about it that's my thing George Lopez at least he's honest and he say I don't do anything for anyone but JLo and John Lam always like I wish Latinos had more opportunity but they won't give anyone opportunity I don't know that like that I've seen him online being problematic over this weekend so I can't comment on that I want to talk about JLo in a vacuum because you might be comparing it to the devil he looked like he was doing F over the weekend um so I don't know nothing about him um but as far as like I guess like in JLo's career I like I've watched the things I've watched to think pieces and I guess I kind of understand how these things happen and sometimes I feel like I I like I'm sometimes I'm weary of criticizing in people who were in a different world than me when they were like coming up and doing different things and maybe didn't have like it m I don't think it's crazy for a Latino woman to take roles that might have been meant for a white lady you know what I mean like I honestly think that's kind of subversive I'm not mad at that honestly I'm not I think that's way better than a black then um which girl what what's her name um she does like I don't mind that I don't have a problem with that I don't necessarily I I get producing your own [ __ ] and wanting to focus on that world and for like different reasons like for example like I have a whole aarati verse devoted to different shows and things around you know what I mean for myself that I made for my different outlets and I don't think there's anything wrong with that and I don't think that creates an obligation to produce for other or you're not like oh you're not you know what I mean you're not black you're what you're taking off your identity if you're not producing but there are different things that go into that and I want to say like as a creative like I think there are things sometimes that are personally stylized to who you are as a creative and what you want to do that aren't necessarily about your I'll also say I'm not I'm not like some big like trust me if if we wanted to have a roast of JLo I have many critiques of her but I'll say from the producing standpoint because she is a really big star there's a world in which she's tried to produce things that she's not in and no one will make them because she's not in them like we are in a time in film and TV right now where they will run the numbers on the the visibility of the celebs before they actually decide if the the content is good enough they're like who's going to be on the poster and if the poster is not going to sell the movie then we're not going to make it and so you know again I'm not saying that George Lopez is kind of a good example of this because I was watching a video other day George Lopez like Sandra Bullock is basically who pushed the George Lopez show through she is who saw the vision and and wanted that and thought that there was an underrepresentation of Latinos and thought that George Lopez Show would be something good and they wouldn't make she had to like they didn't want to make it none of the channels she went to and the only Way She Got It Made was to put herself in the show that's why Sandra B has that role working at where George L was works in the show so like that very much so is is a thing you know what I mean it was like oh I don't know these you know what I mean like I need somebody that I know to sell this to tie it back in JLo performed at the Super Bowl just trying to I feel bad for Christian and and so I was just trying she did performance superl and it wasn't and here's the thing I think that there is a nu conversation I think there's a Nuance conversation the you know hate JLo though is you know I might not like her like that but you know there was a point in time you know my little 10-year-old self was singing her music and all the other stuff and I think that she looks great right now I I just she got a new man every day if that's a business that's a business I just really think that um also be what she presented herself as outside of and this is outside of Diddy I'm gonna go beyond that we're not even gonna touch that but I think that she had to present herself that way for her to be accepted than just being the role of Selena so she had to be the one that can play the white act actress or the ambiguous actress people couldn't identify who she is or whatever the case may be um and that got her role her different roles um as an actor Zoe we it I don't think it was Zoe I think that she definitely honored or really thought that she was doing a great thing as an afro Latina right I remember actively being a I'm not black bass [ __ ] I remember that I'm not she's Cuban she said she's only was it Cuban was it to play a black icon and Don black face like a get it twisted but I think that she was taking it on because she thought that this was an honorable moment whatever she should have said no she should have said no she should have said when they went to go bring that dark colored Foundation to her face and she knew it wasn't her color that could that should have been the moment she got up and left but she didn't that's that's where the problem is but I do believe that these are these actors um are limited especially when they're Latino or when they're black or they will never get a Haitian person to to play a Haitian person in damn movies it's really ridiculous you know so there it's very limited so they get the actors like JLo or whoever to play these roles um and they accept what they can I think that if JLo was if they made more now JLo is is at a place where she can make it but why should she make it there it should other there are other people who are actual producers and H that that are Latino who don't do it themselves either so um I don't know it's real questionable but I I understand your frustrations for you know not being a great representation I just think I think I think I think just many things can be true like she's definitely problematic and I think she has a long history of taking shots at other musicians when she doesn't have the vocals to back up the way that she talks about other mus who she said oh she said negative things there's a there's a very famous Rolling Stone article Kevin I'm sure you've seen it where she's naming off all of the different people that she's like I don't think this person's a good singer this person's not that good this person's not that good J Lopez yeah it's a it's bad it's never read it because I don't care to hear her thoughts J but you watch the movie though you watch the movie is filled with [ __ ] okay stink ass bad attitude ass [ __ ] they said Sterling to fight her on that movie they had on Netflix it said Sterling K Brown child was like I don't like her for whatever reason I don't know I'm just going to say to tie it to to then I'm going to shut up for the remainder of our time is just what for ex what JLo did at the Super Bowl right and what the way that she was trying to represent Latinos at the Super Bowl to me was like I'm a wear a flag that's it versus what Kendrick did for his community at the Super Bowl was like this is everyone's story everyone's involved there's just something about her and I am very serious about the way that like Latinos represented in media because there's no one out there Latinos represent 2.3% of speaking roles like and like most of most Latino actors are not playing Latino characters so like I do care that like when our shows get made JLo is nowhere like no one posts about it you know what I mean versus when like when Issa Ray produces a movie everyone in Black Hollywood is like we're gonna go watch and support Isa [ __ ] so like I don't know that's just I I just I think she sucks got it you know what I gotta let I'm I'm G let you have that last final word about JLo ha before you look all
