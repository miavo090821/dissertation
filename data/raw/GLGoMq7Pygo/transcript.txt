at the height of the Vietnam Mo Dr Martin Luther King proclaimed that the bombs in Vietnam explode at home they destroy the hopes and possibilities of a decent America while our society celebrates Dr King every third Monday of January can we really say that we have heed his concerns have we really internalized his insites have we really actualized this vision for a greater democracy a democracy that makes good on the noble aspirations of our Founders aspirations that remain open and unrealized like the blank check Dr King elw spoke of I think the answer to these questions are clear it is not the king that stood up against the paride and segregation that the state celebrates it is not the king that stood against war and for positive peace that our state celebrates the state does not celebrate the king who realized after segregation was overthrown that black and white workers were finally free to face together as a people the monster of poverty that the dominant system subjects humble working people to and who led on that basis the multi-racial Poor People's campaign the king our state celebrates every January is a domesticated caricature of the real one king would today like he was then be considered the most dangerous man in the country by the institutions of the deep [Applause] State he would likely be with us on this platform leading the charge cognizant of the fact that to free Palestine we must free ourselves to free Palestine and to free America are one in the same struggle the bombs that land in Gaza land in Detroit W they are made apparent in The Rusted ruins of once industrial Powerhouse cities that were the bases of decent workingclass communities but which now occupy many zombified Soul crushed humans in its City centers humans whose conception of the future is chained to the immediate desire for another hit and F 10 James Madison responds to the elite of the country those who were concerned that our formal structures of political democracy would lead to the abolition of their property privileges how can we be sure that if we give the people the capacity to vote that they won't overturn A system that keeps us the owners of all there is at the top at their expense Madison's reply was to rort to a favorite principle of the powerful deid impa div and conquer factionalized the propertyless masses as much as possible whilst they fight amongst themselves they'll be unable to realize that it is us who they should be fighting against much less that it is because of us that they are fighting each other the ruling Elite is cognizant of the necessity to constantly devise ways to keep us working and humble people divided for a very long time racism was the primary form this took today is it is one amongst others but what has never stopped being true is the need that they have to divide all of us so that they the owners of big corporations and investment firms the black rocks the state streets the vanguards and many others in their Club sustain themselves in a position of power parasitically sucking as dry to enrich themselves these are the people that make a killing out of killing [Applause] they are the ones who trade in the annihilation of whole peoples for profit but today as our people struggle to make ends meet as what was Secure in our grandparents generation becomes insecure for us today as Young Americans like some of us here represent the first generation in American history destined to worse living standard than their parents today as our people face poverty debt and Desperation like never before A Light Of Hope shines this light is visible in the n910 of the country who look mockingly down on the mainstream media who they know is there to lie to dup us into consenting to the agenda of the ruling Elite like some folks which are here today they are there to invent a Topsy Turvy reality that can manufacture consent our people know this now more than ever before the Light Of Hope is also visible in the 8/10 of our population who believe that their elected representatives do not actually represent them more than ever the American people are noticing that under the current system the supposed representatives of the American people are in reality the representatives of the oppressors and exploiters of the American people they're the representatives of those who send hundreds of billions of our tax dollars to fund genocides and Nazis who send our brothers and sisters abroad to lose limbs scar their souls and sometimes return in caskets alter murder people whom they have more in common with than the filthy parasites who sent them there and who profited from their misfortune as Memorial Day approaches this is something we must bear in mind today the American people are standing up and saying no you're a part of it in this room we are tired of living under the tyranny of big corporations Banks investment firms and corrupt politicians we are done serving your profits as if it's God losing our lifeblood for its accumulation another America is not only possible but it is a historical necessity an America that realizes the dreams and aspirations of Dr Martin Luther King Jr and of so many of our heroes and brightest this America is possible because we can through institutions such as the one launched here today bring our people together and send chills down the spines of our occupiers we can get all the various forms descent has taken in our population and give these coherence systematicity unity and Direction and when we do this we will win for ourselves in the end true sovereignty and an actual form of life that is of by and for the people thank you [Applause]
