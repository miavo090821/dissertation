to even be put in the same sentence as a woman extremely qualified extremely merited the best woman of color that you could put in any different situation not only that but that same woman of color will try to go and lean into the aisle and be Centrist simply because she's trying to be more palatable and still even then that g is enough I ain't going lie I getting tired of people pretending like the United States is a secret Progressive Utopia somewhere in the closet you know what I mean if you even look at Jen you turned out they voted Trump but we've gotten so far away from actually building Community we are invested in these careerist opportunities and the and these and building these neoliberal platforms that we imagine to be a part of an American Dream we're not committed to actually building with other they won't see it through our lens ever and this is what we need to really understand they will never the way that we liberal the way that we left or the way that we Democrat is always going to be different from them any like American that can say oh you can't talk for us cuz you don't really know what it's like to be you don't know what uh you don't want freedom is now you playing stupid that's that's not it's not even it's not even divisive no more you dumb dumb like the issue on the left is our Coalition building is nonexisting that is so crazy to me that

black people it took me everything not to come in in and say hi I like that better actually because we the only ones that showed up apparently to the general election that didn't come to disappoint so let's start with that because you know some people up inside they could start talking about black man no no no not even black man they could abbreviate black man because you know them set that like to abbreviate they just say BM y all did this I just want to let you all know the data shows differently so from the to me in my comments and I'm like y'all can't read it what stats y all looking at where come over they keep being like Oh just so you know black man too and can't even can't even fix your do not get that talk about everybody else like a dog but don't get the nigas in that don't mix my C up with all the rest of the cks that was at the ballets and just please don't this this is not a black man Affair and unfortunately I mean for for the folks them for the Yanks in the audience you know this is how things turn out um I am watching from afar on a remote island because I ain't going to lie I don't want to have no I don't want no white people look at me today I couldn't do it you all better than me I could not have any white people looking at me today I tell you Bo you know how white people is look after a trump Victory I was in Iowa when Trump win last time and them switch on a dime I talk about I walk in the class they look at at me said I said you you clear on your throat it's all it God damn St Trump in now bro yall better than me I wish I could see them in real life honestly because ain't nobody saying nothing in my face like if I could see these people in real life you could get cursed out the problem is they trying to overwhelm you with cheer numbers and anonymity online like just like just trying to I've been getting Jump by the thousands today like I telling you I'm I I tell you nowh to lie I swear to my God 3,000 tell me to go back to my country this morning I swear to my God I the drops I couldn't even Beat it I'm telling you the commments was coming in so fast defeated they was disappearing I said oh [ __ ] you know what's funny a lot of people were a lot of people um you know on my little channel it's funny because all this time they were there watching and I realized as soon as the election results came in I lost like a whole bunch of people and I'm like oh what was that about so you guys are only here for this time just watching and and waiting and and and under the guys that you guys are here for support or here to learn or here whatever but as soon as the election results came in immediately I saw the loss and in the numbers and so that showed me what people were there for as well um it's been this is what the day after a few days after whatever not a few days after this is like a few hours after we got the results and we are you know a lot of people are feeling defeated rightfully so I think to be clear like you were saying foreign you know we got these you know the the numbers and it showed that black people women men and women did what they needed to do this time around um but what people are going to lean into is what they're doing to you Olay they're leaning into the where to point their fingers at I and it be the wrong folks people who have been covering this thing since day one when others was trying to be quiet about it um and didn't even and were saying to hold their vote and not um Olay was speaking differently at that time we were speaking differently we were having the the Nuance conversations but to see and hear and watch people look for someone to point the finger at start the discourse once again which is all a part of the plan um the 2025 project plan whatever that is um but to be divisive we immediately we we walked right into that and everybody online is looking at it to be divisive instead of saying hey we we actually did what we needed to do it didn't work out in our favor but we voted and we pushed that and we but nobody's focused on that now they're looking for who to point the finger at where to start the um the think pieces and they are on it and it's pissing me off yeah yeah it's it's truly pissing me off and I think one of the things that we can point to are the exit poles and the exit poles are baffling I am baffled I know we were talking last night Olay and we were just looking at the exit poles and the trends and the counties and the cities and stuff like this and I'm sitting here like this is truly some baffling [ __ ] I I am blown away you know the Senate is cooked the house looks like it's cooked it looks like everything is cooked and if everything is cooked we all cooked I don't think people understand you know as somebody I work for government agency well state agency that works with the federal government I've worked for the federal government before and uh the last time when Trump was President I used to work for the forest service and that was a huge a massive issue and I work in the environmental World environmental laws and compliance and stuff like that which that whole party wants to gut so this is catastrophic on so many different levels and I can't even compute all the things that are going to happen right I think we all have different things in in our lives that the the first thing in our head is is all different and I've been going through a whole bunch of emotions last night this morning um I don't know what I'm going to do I don't know what we gonna do whether that's with organizing or whatever the case may be that's going to even be harder um you know I'm also very much involved in the union space I'm in Union and whatnot and I know they want to destroy the nlrb the nlr you know like this this is just catastrophic I I I don't even know I'm at a loss I I even asked you today I'm like we gon we gonna do this I don't even know me too I've barely been asleep inarticulate I feel inarticulate with words it's it's only like my blood is rushing that's it and those EX post actually did not surprise me what surprised me is that we did not think it was going to happen like you said it earlier when we were checking in Olay like I let myself be hyped I let myself be excited and I have a I have several banned books why am I surprised 43% of the folks that voted for him um you know they don't have a certain level of education and those are the people who are Banning these books so why am I surprised this is exactly you know what was supposed to happen they they stuck to the plan what did not I realize now what how I didn't stick to the plan I thought I was killing that [ __ ] because oh I'm on a ban book list and I'm selling these books and I'm teaching your kids no no no I should have been doing something different we should have been monopolizing that moment of angst and and flooding the streets like babies should be in schools right now dressed up as a different politician that does not believe war crimes like we should have been just changing the needle because I really thought okay we gonna change we gonna get the right person in there and then we can hold her to the you know we can hold her foot to the fire we can make sure she challenges b b Bop but n they all in all all in the same gang just the same gang I feel in articulate I'm very very sorry I'm thinking about like what exactly is going to happen next and like there's about three camps right so like there's things that man could do very easily now like without further approval like with executive action and [ __ ] like that right and then like the stuff that he doesn't need like he might need to go and like collaborate on and whatnot so like I'm thinking it's going to be night of the Long Knives very soon right like the T [ __ ] too but like likeed the Long Knives like all of his denters like man is just about to go around knocking on doors like the Grim Reaper like I'm expecting like [ __ ] like that I'm expecting of course like he can get rid of Obamacare right so like we dealing look [ __ ] like that like what else what else y'all think are the tangible things that we expect to happen in the first like hundred days maybe he literally just came out with the immigration thing you know he's GNA he's been talking about that so he said he's going to send them people on their way what do what does that look like though Rebecca like start rounding them up what it no let me tell you something even during his last Administration people have this energy they like to be like oh we survive I'm Americans boy they blow my mind we survived 2016 you surviv 2016 you know what I mean you bar with the skin of your teeth immigrants ain't surviv 2016 the people who died in Co a surviv 2016 the people who lose right day a survive right so they're going to do immigrants first because the reality is the re immigrant immigration is where the executive branch have the most Authority like no one can check them and no one wants to check them no one no one cares you know what I mean no no one has any issue right because people have it in their mind the the United States media has made the entire immigration itu situation about undocumented immigrants at De Bor and Americans have it in their head that if you didn't do it the right way you undocumented they believe you deserve whatever Peril they could bring you away like we see that Greg know that might be legal now and they V kill immigrants so once they make it it's already that they don't just have the freedom even to do that they're going to do whatever they whatever it is that they they want to immigrants and I Noti this like I I I know exactly what my notice could look like I I I know exactly what it could say because I know what it said the last time I just I I don't I I don't know what to say because I don't have anything positive to say and I don't want to I don't want to be responsible for telling people you know like people have just like today I've been seeing people be like oh like someone's like what is the point of this video what you saying like what hopeful thing you and I'm just like I don't have nothing hopeful to say to y'all I told you all here avoid this outcome because I don't have anything hopeful to say to you and I and I think the I think the painful part is not not that it happened like to what mahogany was saying is that I let them swing me like I let them talk me out of not only what I know America to be but what I I know America Untold me in 2016 I knew I knew what it was and I I think what's Nots right in the line of work we do is for years now it's been clear what America is like the rise of the man of fair the rise of who's taking over in the media like the rise who people listen to how everybody's talking like you could see it and everybody keep telling you that's just the internet oh that's just Bots oh that's just this oh that's just that no it's not like and they and they will and the thing is right people want to hate the Democrats so bad they want to hate KLA so bad they they want to sit there and tell you oh it's Alla campaign strategy oh she ride a bad strategy they love to say Donald Trump is easy to be third election cycle of half the nation belonging to his cult right but that's what they'll say but it a like it ain't like only K lose it was a sweep Across the Nation they swung to the right on everything Progressive [ __ ] failing all across the country like incumbent Senators losing like it it is very clear the country is actively saying like even if you couldn't see the exit poles where they literally telling you we thought KLA was too liberal the laugh where they literally are saying right and the only reason we all know K is not too liberal they just think that CU she's a black woman that's how that go right um so if we couldn't even if we didn't have the exit pole data you could just see that off the nature of every the entire results across the board did we just lose the presidency that the house the Senate St kind of state local measures I'm like I I I don't know what to tell people like I I hear them being like like what are we gonna do and I'm like what the can you do the Supreme Court finish like we already had like let's understand like people really like to downplay that that's Generations that will not have the right to an abortion Generations lost affirmative action all those things you can you you wasn't getting them back but now they are like they on a steady line they made it clear when the court and and and dos when they overturned roow they let us know they were going down the line for all of those rights and they've been consistently doing it and so now what what is what what is uh Donald Trump going to do not only is he going to appoint he gonna have two people retire he's going to point this uh uh new people to the Supreme Court to guarantee we have a nut ass right-wing Court ter ing up our rights for literally the next several decades but on top of that he's going to appoint judges all around the country so it's just like I I when it's like what what do you do what what do I tell people to do you protest you going to jail you know what I mean like they brutal Donald Trump has made it very clear that like first of all we know how the United States go in general about prot even under not under these circumstances how they go about policing and how they go about standing police out but Donald Trump said all Administration police should have total immunity there should be a police violence they should all I've never like I don't know what to say or do with Americans anymore because Donald Trump told them exactly what the it is and they voted for him he just he just understand he just win the electoral college that won the popular vote too so nobody gets swing they specifically asked for Donald Trump and I I I don't I don't know what else to say and I just think you want to say trying to you trying to get in for a second I was just you know I'm listening I'm like taking it all in um but yeah you know I think I have I have a lot of thoughts a lot of feelings about about all of this and um I think the the number one thing that I have been thinking and have been wanting to say is Obama was the exception he was never the rule right and so I kept I keep seeing people being like you know well you know like this Obama did this in 2008 and he was able to do this in 2012 and the reality is that Obama was one coming up in a very different time um and was on the heels of a a very different time um and so with Kamala I'm like you know like I think I think there are a lot of reasons for why the results of this camp or the results of this election look the way that they do and I'm not a news pundit a political pundit a political commentator they're gonna you know do that on their own um they're going to autopsy her campaign up and down that's their thing but what I do think is true is that people vastly underestimate the power of white supremacy and the links that white people will go to discipline and punish black folks for existing right and so nothing about this election to me is is surprising and I think what the conversations that I've seen as things have sort of unfolded for me have looked particularly unnuanced like as if multiple things can't be true at one time and so what feels true for me in this moment is that white supremacist did exactly what white supremacist had been planning to do they were going to vote for Donald Trump what I think is also true is that because kamla did run a cist campaign she alienated a lot of what would have been her base and I think what that showed us is that a lot of folks did not turn out to vote because of it right I think folks did not take this uncommitted movement for example seriously including KLA and her campaign and they became a part of a national conversation that when they first came out were thought to be unserious not important not not going to directly affect her campaign but it did and I think that both of those things are true at one time right I'm I'm to be clear and I think that this might be like a different tune I might be singing a different tune um than a lot of folks but I'm I'm I'm not a KLA fan I'm also not a fan of Donald Trump to be clear I think I have to say that because a lot of people like you don't like K commala so you like Trump no both but the reality is that I do completely understand what it means to live under a government where it is completely taken over by right-wing politicians right by people who are very committed to to continuing slavery in the ways that we know it and I think proof of the fact that this is not just about KLA is the fact that California voted to continue the legalization of California right Florida like Florida Florida had 57% people vote for in favor of abortion rights but because it didn't meet a 60% um minimum there there's no abortion rights in in Florida right like these are things that we are Witness AC so I know for a fact that it's not just about but what I think is most important to name is like it was never just about Kamala and I think people again just really really really underestimated exactly how tired white supremacists were of what they have been calling wokeism and Dei Etc when they don't feel like they are Central to American politics and Central to how the world functions they will push back the reality is that they have the power to because they're white that's what whiteness does that's what anti-blackness does it affords you the opportunity to fight back with no real campaign no real strategy no real you don't have to have any real anything to be able to do that because whiteness affords you the opportunity to you could you could say that they eatting the dogs they eaten the cats you could have a whole dementia moment in the middle of a whole argument you could call PR a whole flicking American territory not like not over us over here American ter you call him garbage and you could still turn around because the oldest white man that you have up for debate that's also it the oldest white we ever had right um that you all Ever Had sorry um and then also this had all kind of indictments on this indictments on his head like a hat I talking about ra this man have sexual um all kind of T charges on him like for for btim aade in jail running from jail literally with his back against the wall for jail impeached twice still Equitable to even be put in the same sentence as a woman extremely qualified extremely merited the best the best woman of color that you could put in any different situation not only that but that same woman of color will try to go and lean into the aisle and be Centrist simply because she's trying to be more palatable and still even then withstanding that g ain't enough and that's why I say I agree Cara not only fumbled but she literally she literally absolutely obliterated what was a lot of fervent energy that you saw a lot of liberals I couldn't stop my white liberal friends from talking to me aren't you aren't you excited Peter about goddamn cameel getting up inside I say like funny when he gives the American I just like I know you got to be excited you got a first black president I'm all like well Aster one two no I'm not that excited but I'll take what I could take because I'm trying to organize I'm trying to have you know my trans friends and them actually have a chance at healthare whilst we could fight but at the end of the day this is what happened as soon as she come top daning you saw the whole I can make isra I can make sure Israel could defend itself I can make sure that we have the strongest scks the biggest s dicks of American Military might that you could ever imagine we always have the longest sticks that could be dragging on the floor they ain't ready for us and like and like they literally like shorty just in one Fell Swoop was just like okay yeah that's what we do we doing the C top dance we got the black the black dude out there laughing at people talking about dead Palestinian children diving in the road getting pushed off the side and treat like how they was doing inflation and money and all these to talk about is maybe the couple bits of stimulus checks that they might think that they could get but they ain't get at the end of the day when Trump getting there and I hope that y get your simulus checks I pray get get the first round S no stimulus checks people didn't get it but here's the thing and and I just want to get this out here because I want to be this was my experience with this whole thing first of all of course they didn't want her this let's be clear it's a black Asian woman black South Asian woman right and so she she's a woman that's one but she's person of color however they trying to put put it on online trying Tove a nation that L that loves the one drop rule and to accept everybody's by sck I'm really I'm I [ __ ] I all I sick of it and I spent election this entire election season like like paying lip service to talking points that just don't make no sense just popular opinions you know I I I genuinely feel like everybody wants you to to it's like oh don't blame the voters don't blame nobody don't blame you know what I mean everybody wants you to just like jump on on on the candidate and on the potty but at the end of the day like when are we going to talk about American voters being [ __ ] selfish and silly and like like like let's talk about it like an election is about a choice like you're never the way people was hellbent on wanting to to um assess K and critique kamla Harris in a vacuum and it doesn't make any sense to set up and say to me KLA Harris can't speak well or KLA Harris ain't not smart or k Harris ain't this when when this is the this is who you go vote for this who you go isn't Al and I'm supposed to accept that is is is absolutely absurd right and this idea that like this idea that you are unhappy with a party not being Progressive enough for you that you feel like they didn't do enough you wanted them to do more of certain things so you allow for white supremacist who want to take all of that [ __ ] even live the bare minimum away you know what I mean and harm everybody I just can't get down with that like I'm tired of being accepted to expect that and act like that's valid it's not valid it isn't it is not like tying the country to the rails and over not only every marginalized group but yourself nine out of 10 who saying these things they the main ones who can suffer they the main ones who could St tired of entertaining this absolute and like respectfully it's like listen I don't I I ain't lie I getting tired of people pretending like the United States is a secret Progressive Utopia somewhere in the closet you know what I mean like the United States voter base are these are these wild secret far leftists it's not true if you even look at Jen you turned out they voted Trump they voted more Trump than the generations before what are we talking about the system a broken sick and tired they literally telling us we sick of y'all and y'all left this [ __ ] it's to left it's to left so we went out in abundance and voted against it and then there's still a five who was at home saying they would never vote for Democrats they want to break the d y y y y y y telling you it's because oh we would it wasn't we wasn't P after this enough like [ __ ] [ __ ] KLA Harris was not going to win come out there with a socialist agenda and blah blah and it wasn't gonna happen and I tired of hear in this it's not true just because you wanted to be true so you could believe you have more power and that people should have listen to you more and you have more say it don't make it true saying it louder don't make it [ __ ] true and you ain't hurting nobody but your [ __ ] self like at the end of the day every issue you claim to care about every marginalized person that you claim to care about every Progressive right that you claim to want so much you ain't [ __ ] getting it under the Republicans and you losing the bare minimum of what the you got so I so tired of listening to Americans all election season with this [ __ ] yeah sorry that's I fin as you should as you should we all feel is it's away right and that's one of them so but I just want to be clear with this whole thing with the with KLA Harris coming in like you were saying deshan um absolutely I had my grievances with KLA Harris um especially with I know we joke about I've said um we haven't seen her in that time we don't even kind of recognize her as vice president um of the United States which she is um we didn't because we didn't see her they didn't put her in any veril roles they didn't Place her anywhere unless it was on BET telling people she be outside um or when she's on the shade room occasionally after they post some right stuff or whatever when I say right Republican um Le stuff on their platform um and you know we didn't see her so this was the first time I feel like we got to actually get to know her see her and some of the Mis information that we were honing in on um some of um the black platforms were able to um debunk those things which I loved and be able to move forward a platform the only reason why we were excited about that because when we seen that debate between Joe Biden remember how we were feeling between Joe Biden and Donald Trump we was like you know what just just give it to Trump and then we saw that we had an opportunity all of us collectively started to come together because this was going to be a chance yes a lot of us not a lot of us many of us if not all of us was like she ain't going to win but at least here's a chance let's see if we can push this forward let's see how we can do this because I at the end of the day I was not going to sit here and just be like yeah no I ain't even going to vote and if I wasn't gonna vote it's okay fine but I wasn't GNA sit here and try to push conversations that were leading to you know we might as well because Trump gave me they want to die on that hill of $1,200 that most of y'all here didn't even get um all of that but I know for me I wanted to make sure I was a broke public defender I I got it and I Democrats pass I was the Democrats pass I was very mad when they got into and got cheap and got the count and after he told us what he said he get $1,600 or some he went ja but it was it was a check that was not only um delayed it was almost denied and he just wanted to put his name on it and he wants and y'all keep saying that he gave it to you but pushing that to the side I know that I was proud in that moment but not only and I'm talking about for Comm Harris not for them checks um uh I was proud in the moment because I'm like okay it looks like we're gaining momentum it was beautiful to see it was great to see that she led as we St talked about Olay and this is what people don't it's because she's black they don't want to say that she led a great campaign mind you in what 75 days because they threw her ass right there you getting just a few days you're not getting two years to start campaigning or doing this stuff and nothing we're gonna give you this and she did a damn good job yes she there were times I'm like girl no no ma'am no but there were most times I was like okay this is still better than Donald Trump and here we are trying to compare and I'm like the comparison it's Stark throughout this whole 7i days and how we've been watching Donald Trump it's almost as if he was still president for the last four years because he never left he's always been in the news cycle he's always been all the things that he put in place before he even left he's just been around just like just just around and we've had to deal with him these last four years because what happened people are not understanding all of that stuff that happened when he won the President right um when he didn't win we talked about this too he they his people scaled the walls of the capital broken people died that day and they don't like to remember that that was just 2020 um but what he has done in the last few months is go even harder on hate and division he has there's no barriers there's there is nothing he's going literally Rogue and he's telling us you know I'm calling black people out putting division in doing the whole diaspora Wars like all over again while leading KKK rallies right um putting out misinformation that has been debunked about immigrants and he's been doing this since his um um since he first became president uh the whole daa thing with Mexicans all of that we saw that and we've seen how he's went from this immigrant to that immigrant to this immigrant to that immigrant and has caused a lot of issues for these people we remember right in 2020 with Co who did he blame it on Chinese people any body that they seen that was agian was getting punched in the face outside remember that uh the whole denouncing of what was actually going on every time with black lives matter of black people in the streets and and police officers literally pushing police officers offering them more money to arm them more to protect them more as black people were dying in the streets and this man has stood on stage every time we've seen him just saw a few days ago that he was talking about the bulletproof windows right and how if these bulletproof windows weren't here the the journalists that are right there they make get shot but that might be all right you and it's okay for them him to say these type of things leading rallies with people that are talking about a upcoming it's gonna be a fight it's gonna be a war we're gonna do this there I played on my show last night uh a couple that I do know I grew up with in the church right I love Jesus um but the Jesus that I know wouldn't accept all this and they tried to go out there it's a a Haitian man right a product of Haitian immigrants he is as black as they come Haitian is haian is Haitian and he got kids that look black and he's married to a white woman and she's always been questionable to me but they put out on on on social media and they make sure they didn't put it on certain ones but they put it out on Tik Tok because that they know that that that biracial couple kind of thing thrives over there they said you know we voted and he used his little soft Pastor white voice and he black um you know we voted for uh Donald Trump and I don't even like the man and she says but we voted for him looking at him like you better say we voted for him but we voted for him because you know why to know that at KLA Harris's rally she can denounce Jesus she can denounce and I said that is not what happened because Donald Trump has for Christian people and said I am not Christian but what I can do for you Christians is fix the election this is a simple Google away you can see that he is the person that denounced if y'all want to stand on that Hill that you guys are uh because of your Christianity because of your faith and you are going to go for Donald Trump you're strong and wrong there as well but that video immediately went viral it went viral and so many people in the comment section are all Donald Trump supporters saying thank you for posting that I got chills from that chills from what a lie these are the same people that are are following things that are not biblical like those Christians made a gold statue of Donald Trump and began to pray to it but in if y'all following the word it's a c blasphemy it's a cult it's a cult a cult y seen that old video of that one person in the car uh praying that Donald Trump to come save him the policeing oh my God let me tell you drop the link drop the link Dr never mind the thing that's unfortunate is I don't think we understand just how powerless we are like I like right I I I really don't think we understand it and it's like it is blowing my mind to see talk like that's not the case it's really like it's really blowing my mind like not only it's not even just that we about to lose a [ __ ] ton of rights which we are it's not just that he is understand that Donald Trump ain't never promise us nothing all he never promised to build nothing just break [ __ ] down he is there and he has all he has everything he needs to do with then the house he have the Senate he could do everything he need to do he's going to tear this [ __ ] up but more than that we not only like [ __ ] we have a voice but no we we are actively being tuned out that's what the results of this election has shown us that it's that the country is sick of us and they don't want to hear from us so it's like it's frustrating for me as like a leftist even though they get they tell me I'm a liberal shill child so um but we gotta figure we got to figure out what to do and I think that's one of the biggest the biggest issues right and I think there and I think I kind of talked about this before is like if you go on Spotify right now and look at the the list of podcasts they're all right-wing podcasts the top five right and this manosphere [ __ ] is constant everything it's like we have no left anything we don't even have left liberal anything like if you look at CNN or MSNBC who owns them it's really easy find out we don't have no left nothing left liberal left left it's a nation full of dumm I really really really love that you said that because that's one of the biggest things that I have been thinking about since last night is Communications right like folks are running campaigns as if we are still in 2008 and 2012 and we are not like talk about it like Joe Rogan and Elon Musk like folks are folks I think the thing that is perhaps the most frustrating thing for me is watching people be like oh you know like Twitter Twitter doesn't matter or social media doesn't matter it's just whatever it's it's it's just online whatever and it's like that's true for the people who don't have power on it sure like for for those of us who are in this small demographic of very very very left leaning I don't even like using that language Who Who Are You know the Marxist and communist and AFR pessimist of the world all the things right we exist in in a very small Echo chamber very small part of of the internet Joe Rogan Elon Musk they have actual access to a completely different level of communications right and that is what allows Trump to to exist in the media in the ways that he does without ever saying a word right like I never actually and kind of similar to foreign I have been very offline so part of that could be love that for you love that for me too really truly like teach me how to Jud like I have not been you imagine what musk could do right now like given like when he bought Twitter like not to the r the show but I actually want to know like what you all think about that but like when he bought Twitter and turned it into X and we knew Ali was talking about it from time in 2021 and told y that's what the plan was don't nobody listen to me don't here is he like not only did he buy Twitter and turn it into X and and do what he's done right like he started an entire pack and and then started a Twitter account called America where he like is very clearly stating in the of the Twitter account that like I am supporting candidates who allow quote unquote free speech and we know that free speech is a dog whistle right we know what that means is that we're not we it's it's hate speech exactly and that's what Elon Musk has been like allowed to do and I I think what people what people don't want to acknowledge or or or refuse to acknowledge whatever whatever it might be is that folks have been making this an election of of Economics right the people who the majority of the people who are voting for Trump are very brokies like like they're they're they are broke white folks right they they will never have access to Elon Musk money they'll never have access to definitely won at work and but it's but what's Wild to me is like they they believe they genuinely believe that the stimulus checks they got or the or the economy that they experienced under Trump's presidency his first presidency was because of trump right and so and and and they don't have to you know take any Civics courses they don't have to look anything up on Google they don't have to do anything because all they have to do is go on Spotify or go on Twitter or go listen to Joe Rogan and they'll tell them exactly what they want to hear and confirm it right so it's like for me I'm like okay if leftist want to talk about what it means to to organize a body of people right that the right whether we like it or not they are organized as [ __ ] because they have the access and the resources to be able to to exist in an organized sense right the left does not have any real organization and so what what I am experiencing or what I'm feeling in this moment is like the noise what has to happen going forward is that actually have to be organized and I don't mean like we have to come up with a a Twitter campaign I don't mean we have to come up with a a campaign on on how to get people Meals on Wheels right like that is very important don't get me wrong like I'm not I'm not tearing down Mutual Aid efforts that's very important but those efforts are not going to disrupt the type of militia building the type of actual organization that's happen on the right and until we take that seriously none of this [ __ ] is ever going to matter Sean can you dig into that a little bit for me because I love that you brought up organizing and I think that folks have tried the unfortunate part about our communities is that our our missions are steep yes in asking outside communities for money which is why we have to end up taking them lumps from whomever decides to give us money until they decide to stop that's why that whole mass incarceration um portfolio from certain very large foundations were extinguished once certain people got in office right so how do we build what what what are your ideas in in building amongst each other especially when we tried to do that in in in a more recent case and found that oh these people are kind of extort money or they don't trust them or the you know you know tribal politics are all say yeah I give up on these [ __ ] y y if you have some POs to say I'm showing up I'm showing up in this conversation as as an afro pessimist so I'm I'm so much but what I also think is true is that is I have been I have been an organizer for the past 11 years um in Atlanta I have been in in in community I've been in movement building spaces um and so mahogany I actually completely agree with you that like have tried and failed tried and fail for a number of reasons right and I think that the the it all boils down to anti-blackness right it all boils down to the fact that anti-blackness because of the way that it constructs this world there like we are already starting from less than nothing and trying to build on less than nothing to get to nothing to hopefully get to something that's what our re is and so when I when I'm talking about building right I mean so I'm part of this Collective called the movement media Alliance which I I really love and I love that the work that we're doing and like I'm excited for the growth that we experien but what that looks like is actual folks who are committed to being movement either journalist or or or movement um practitioners whatever they want to call themselves media rather practitioners whatever they want to call themselves who are committed to these politics that we are talking about um bringing that to the Forefront right building an actual Communications um effort that can disrupt or undercut what we understand Legacy or mainstream media to look like right right now there is no real actual um media outlet that can undercut a Cox media platform that can undercut a New York Times platform right the these folks have a different level of access that we do not have and the New York Times while people might want to think of them as a liberal Outlet or the Cox media as a liberal Outlet right these are folks who are very much pushing right-wing um propaganda and and they're doing so as liberals because we know that Liberals are also pushing right-wing propaganda um and so what I think is necessary is that we are bu Base building right that we're actually in our communities connecting with our with our folks building a base of people who are like you know I've never actually been a super political person I don't really know much about what's like what's happening in these ways or I don't have the language to explain these things in these ways but what I do know is that I can't afford to feed my kids what I do know is I don't have access to no grocery stores what I do know is I can't even get from from work to home in time to be able to take care of of my household right like those folks are who we need to be building with and doing actual political education I'm sitter allads not political educ who has built a platform by doing exactly that it is not I mean it is it is politically educating a certain sector of people but at at some at at a certain point it becomes an echo chamber and you're talking to the same people who are doing the same things who who understand the same things as you and they're not going to actually base build with other people most if if you think about the black folks you know right how many of those folks actually talk to their neighbors do you know your neighbors names do you know your do you have your neighbor's number if they need your help can they get in contact with you right like that's Base building that's connecting that's community building but we've gotten so far away from actually building Community because we we are invested in these careerist opportunities and the and these and building these neoliberal platforms that that we that we imagine to be a part of an American Dream right that we're not committed to actually building with other and I think that is what we're missing out on right now I think Community is a great point you know like say the opposite well well I think Community is a is is a great point we we need that like this what we're doing right now um it doesn't get picked up right you got tyt who is still running and they already grifted like nobody's business baby um we see that every day and they they built for for me and what I've seen they built their platform off of threads and text in tweets of black folks and that's to me and now they've done their thing but they've been given so much money and still continue to to do what they need to do whatever however there are black platforms that don't grow or and it's not because they can't or and there people who are doing this work but it's not because they can't they because they know that if they they move this into the correct um place where we can have networks that are are surrounding this and where people can come and we can really be in community um and get news properly or or or have pundit or com conversations that are nuanced but you look at Roland Martin's Network it it they don't even I think it's a good I think it's quality there but they ain't gonna push that in nowhere they don't want to push they don't want to they don't they're not going to try to push that they're always going to push and here's what I want to say about the um because y'all mentioned them a couple of times you got us black and you got the others right and and and I just want there's a difference and you can see with the numbers they wasn't lying you got black people and you got the people color whatever and they voted majority for him um him being Donald Trump and um but what I do see here is I I've watched as we've gone through this whole thing with KLA Harris and there's this um uh I don't know weirdness about mamal remember y mamala her all that weirdness and we were over here like y'all we got work to do we got we got work to do and then as soon as the Palestinian thing came up right they're like how dare uh how dare we she not and I understood it but it's like we got work we s hey Focus we still got work to do but they would sit on these platforms and do a diservice and have these convers your favorites favorites favorites be on the internet and be sitting right here having conversations and then be on the internet doing a disservice by saying oh you know we G to hold the vote and we G to do this but it will sit here and be like we need black people to do no it's a disservice and then the white people people they will really out here and get mad at that and be be telling people they need to hold their votes and all this stuff and then at the same time have this weird how dare you aren't you're black you don't think that we should no it needs to be more than the fact that she's just black for us we're looking we are looking for Change and we need her to step up and do yeah and it gives that's what it gave to me but I'm like y'all really out here and it's not giving y'all liberalness is not giving that yall really want to do the work and you guys are not giving allies and this is not for all of them I work with some great people on Thursdays with the left Mafia but even then I've had to say hey this has to be more than just X Y and Z but um you know they won't see it through our lens ever and this is what we need to really understand they will never the way that we liberal the way that we left or the way that we Democrat is always going to be different from them it will always be different from them so in this particular time for me to see them white people on that call right that white folks got on that call when we first heard about KLA Harris running I can guarantee you some of them were definitely in in the booth vote was abs and I don't want nobody else to put me in a section of the bip poop no more oh yeah we are tired and we are black honestly I think I my myself have to go back to the drwing board and figure out what the [ __ ] I'm doing and what I'm doing with the platforms I'm building and what you what I'm in like I wouldn't even say community because honestly my experience of the last several years has been that I'm not a part of a I am not a part of communities like they they they am I am mistreated and attacked by every corner right like like the black people online the black leftists or whatever I'm not I'm not an American so they spend all their time harassing you like like talking [ __ ] about you that you're not you're not further left enough it's all this this isn't the next thing we talk so much about Community I feel like I always see this like it's like in left the spaces onl community community community community and I feel like the big [ __ ] elephant in the room that nobody ever talks about is how hostile and abusive those communities and how many people they are less concerned with with power building with Community with get concerned with a SP and they have it in their mind it's like and I understand how it happens how because that's what that's what this anti-black world is we live in right where they treat it like it can only be one black person and because we we we experience that we do the same thing and we cannot see black people doing something without thinking they are the reason why I don't have like they have a platform they ain't left this enough or whatever and blah blah blah blah blah all I see let me let me let me I think the difference is right it's like yes the right is United both in mainstream media and the Independent Media because they're committed to white supremacy and they don't have those same kind of like you know whiteness don't put you in that same it can only be you know a spot for one but my experience has been and on the ground like I organize in real life on the ground and online I see this play out like I us to say it like in doing all my Rikers work or advocating for a Riker's receivership you go to all these groups and all these organizers all these activists and these and they will not get on board with anything until it's until it it's failed like I remember going to them because they didn't want to do the work of explaining what a receivership is to people they wanted to say Clos Rikers now they wanted the slogan and they figured the audiences the people who they they they saying this to don't understand how a receivership gets you there or whatever so they rather not [ __ ] do that work to get that receivership and then when it doesn't happen then all of a sudden they jump on on the receivership I've had the experience where you go and I bro if you could tell y the [ __ ] that I've experienced with like you go to go help in some movement to to go help with some legislation or something uh that is happening in a city and you will see these these on the ground organizers that have not been able to get any traction on their issue get angry at the help that they are getting from bigger platforms because they feel like they want it to be their like they prefer they rather the [ __ ] [ __ ] not take off they get no traction or accomplish anything so they could say they were the one that champion and I've seen that I've been on those phone calls where they are actively mad at help that they have received right and then when you look at it online something that I has happened all year me and Rebecca I talk about this all the time I and I was talking to you about this off off camera I know nothing but influences and people are big ass platforms and creators and all these people that are allegedly they they're on the left too you know they have these you know alleged ideals and all of this but at the end of the day these people have an audience and it's a it's a business to some degree and not and even Beyond just a business they're just regular individual people who psychologically feel way when you're attacked and there is a there is a something about leftist internet internet communities and spaces that are mean and hostile and Pur it they want to just dunk all they want to do is dunk on people and attack people and do all this nonsense and so what happens is all year all [ __ ] year I'm telling you and I genuinely mean all year I'm not even exaggerating all year I've been frustrated at the share amount of progress progressives and leftists that I know that you talk to them and they saying all the things that you saying they calling you they upset about everything that's happening with the election and y y y yada then they get on their [ __ ] platforms and say the exact opposite of everything they're saying to you privately because they want to ponder to a particular audience on the internet and then all of a sudden I swear to my God I have a list of all of a sudden in the last couple days they oh my anxiety about the election they posting today long [ __ ] paragraphs and substep post and [ __ ] about their pain about Trump losing but all [ __ ] year you've been going to your giant platform and doing this like this is even a conversation I have with like and it's mainstream and independent right like I was looking at like even like with charlam man and The Breakfast Club D take for example The Breakfast Club all year all for years now platforming right-wing nuts right-wing people criticizing KLA Harris doing all this this and the next thing all these things that obviously hurt your cause and then all of a sudden at at the end of the election now you want to be proa now everybody sh everybody want to climb it's like every I have never seen this desire to want to scramble and I just I I don't I don't know what the we do about it anymore because honestly I feel like I feel like I have tried to do the things that I have I have heard like that I've come to believe and we all say that we want done right like oh we we should we should try to platform all black people we should do this with Independent Media we should yada yada Y and I do the things and I have never received more hate and animosity and all of this like you when you say oh this platform all I ever he from my platform is how it's not people will tell me I will platform that they will tell me my plat my platform is not left enough complaining that I'm not further left wild time because I don't have on somebody enough that I introduced to them on my platform I think it's and I this is something that really real life like I'm telling you for something that you would think like should be positive like I'm like I have been in in a space of black media both independent and mainstream for years and have have regularly been in a position where there's there are no other black people they're not platforming every other black people they trying to have your one ass talk about every [ __ ] issue or whatever and I'm like yo I platform 60 something plus black people and all I can see all I can see is complaints and criticism and [ __ ] from online you know what I mean and these people that's supposed to be in community with you and they tear you down and I think that's that's the difference it's like but these people are not in community with you la like that's that's the thing but but that's but but that's also what I what what I'm saying comes to be the thing right is like we have a very device we have a very a community that doesn't want to be in community like they split like if you look at how this been handled right the of of how the left spent the online left let me say this particular contingent of the left spent all their energies attacking and [ __ ] on the people most likely to be on their [ __ ] side just trying to tell you like and it's funny to me to hear them constantly say they're criticizing they're mad at the Democrats and they're mad at KLA because they're saying that they didn't do enough to try and bring in these leftist people in these pers and I'm like who is less persuasive and interested in bringing in [ __ ] than y'all I've never seen more fracture happen in the community based on how they've given it up this year like I swear to my God like I've never seen [ __ ] like how how how it is I I promise you this it's been it's been incredible to me the way been barking down your [ __ ] neck and talking to you like a dog and I'm just like if you don't have as black people or you know or whatever marginalized group talking if you don't have the same kind of access as we don't have the right-wing access we don't have those Outlets we don't have Jo we when you think about it Joe Rogan and them are are the version of Independent Media of what you know what I mean mainstream media is we don't have those things so what happens if every time we do have like individuals trying to make platforms and all they feel like all you're doing is being attacked and what's the point of doing it like especially when you're at a you're at a disadvantage like something people don't think about and talk about especially in the world of creation because that's what you're doing right creation online trying to create these platforms and get these messages out you are actively at a disadvantage from the algorithm you know what I mean like you you're disadvantage from like Aaron and we could literally tell you Aaron we was blown away to see Olay and chill make this made more money they gave YouTube give it better advertising dollars for the same amount of views and stuff than Olay and friends cuz the cast was white so you doing this thing you're you're actively putting yourself like behind in the race like let me climb a a bigger uphill battle to try to do something that we allegedly say we want done and need done and that you doing it for are just like you you know what I mean like that's why I think I think like we talk about community so much but sometimes I feel and it's been my experience for years that sometimes the communities that you allegedly are supposed to be in or these people that are supposedly like-minded that care about the same things as you discourage you worse and alienate you from the work in things that you want to do like they make you feel like honestly I genuinely am like I'm not even exaggerating when I say I feel like I have nothing left to give or say to this kind of like I have I I am exhausted of feeling like I'm supposed to be I'm supposed to be everybody's [ __ ] voice everybody's [ __ ] Advocate everybody's Advocate but my own but there's always every time I think it's interesting that no one ever puts a quote on how many times I'm supposed to jump out and talk about what's racist and what's wrong about who which group was treated this way and who was that but if I want to speak up for myself all of a sudden it's like ah you just complaining you don't need to do that oh you're a [ __ ] you're an immigrant you're this you're a blah blah and and I'm just like at what point it does it become like do we do we understand when a person says okay no more you know what I mean like and so I it's like we talk about I feel like we we romanticize Community like I feel like it's always being talked about that in basis and and and we don't talk about how [ __ ] abusive and and how much Community can act as a deterrence to the work that you want to what we don't what we also don't talk about so so I I want to say like the I agree community and the word community in particular is romanticized in a very particular way and we don't think about we we don't actually have a shared definition of what community is but I am very clear with people that just because we share identities or just because we are like mutuals online or anything like that does not mean that we are community community when I say I'm in community with somebody I mean that I am I am in community I am you are able to hold me accountable and I'm able to hold you accountable right we are accountable to to one another to a specific thing to a to an idea um to a politic to an ideology right if we don't if we don't have that level of understanding we are not Community right we might be Associates we might be people who who have conversations we might be you know we could even we might even be be be you know online friends right but we are not Community uh and like I take that word very seriously because of exactly the point that you're making like I've been in like I said before I've been in in these spaces for 11 years now for over a decade and I have just witnessed the ways that people will abuse harm mistreat violate right and and and then just move on right like there's there's no there's no reconciliation there's no um there there's no accountability there's know like there's no care there's no love there's no Grace but what I also think is true is that even when you are in community to be clear Community is not going to save you right like I I think that that is what that is what the the misunderstanding is in a lot of these like movement spaces is that if we are in community then somehow we have found salvation and I my my thing about this is and this is you know I don't want to this might be a different a different episodes I don't want to get too far but uh but the thing about it is is like um black black folks in particular have been searching for a savior for so long because we know that anti-blackness has kept us in the [ __ ] trenches right that we have to find something that is pulling us out so whether it's it's Jesus or it is astrology or you know you one of the the woooo sisters because I love my woooo sisters or or whatever it might be right like we're trying to we are finding something to to ground us to hold on to to to give this life meaning and in the process of doing that right a lot of [ __ ] happens because we we have been stripped of any sort of like real relationship to what it means to be in community we've been alienated from what it means to be in community and so of course of course sometimes [ __ ] go down when it's not a billion dollars on the elevator but but we don't acknowledge we don't acknowledge that we don't we don't get to really hold that and so it's like you know like I just I I struggle with with the idea that um I struggle with that because I I am somebody who is staunchly committed to community who also understands that Community is not going to save us and to that point this is why the to bring us back to to the conversation this is why this election for me has been like um such a like interesting thing because people have made it seem like what was on The Ballot Box was slavery which if you're in California is true um but but the real but the reality is that like you don't have to vote for slavery for slavery to exist slavery has never slavery has never existed it is it is not gone it it has it has existed for as long as we have been forced onto into that hold right we have we have existed on a plantation and that would have been true no matter what and so it's like and but what in my mind I'm like as Community quote unquote Community why are we comfortable with the idea that a vote would be the thing that determines whether or not we are SL slaves if a vote can determine whether or not we are whether or not we are slaves then we got to do something else you you're extremely profound in like the the separation um and and and really like bringing like to like how we mistreat our community but I think the problem is we have conflated Community with network just because we are networking amongst others don't mean we are in service of each other and so we get into a space and it's like all right you working Olay is working on you know prison abolition boom you working on afro pessimism boom somebody say I'm working on representation in media all of those things can happen in a sort of in diagram and not necessarily serve each other yeah right and so when it no longer serves us to be nwork our community separate and and that is the issue is that we don't have a social contract that we've agreed upon outside of our Blackness being the thing that we know uh will you know will get us killed that's the only thing that we can agree on Amen we know that we walk down the street any one of us can get that work period that's it that's the one thing that we can agree upon but like we haven't sat down and figured out no parameters we don't even know if do you remember who Fanny ler is or do you know who lacricia is like who are you outside of somebody who watchs his real housewives of pic which I like and I don't make it so that'll make us Community yeah and like another good point show no sorry like that's like that point in particular and even culminating that with like what a and the Sean saying is like the first thing was blaring in my head was audience capture and essentially how like Olay they see you as a lightning rod for all of their different G es pertaining to not only the black experience but just everything around it and adjacent it and if what I noticed early on is that they like they typ cast you as the foreign black man to talk about a perspective relating to this and the more that I give them on this sure it'll give me some social penances and parities of rewards like you know good comments they'll tell me oh I love y and it's so dulled in my ears I love that which othering weird fetishing weird anyway but like they'll also just begin to give you some sorts of social benefits from it but then the fact of the matter is they want more of it they want you to play The Greatest Hits and before you know it the only thing that you get to exist as is the angry black man talking about racism and when the deeper that you delve into that the more that you invest into that the more demands from you and when you step out of that role when you do something nice when you do an alar pop or something like that right that's when they mad or when you don't exist as the Immigrant for this particular issue and they feel as though like you encroaching onto their territory for black American issue then it's just like okay hold on hold on hold on you tap dance on off feat no tap dance on this beat and then you have to go right back to the mro she show so that's the reason why like very early on I say no I gotta you all up so like early on I gotta mess you all up for real I gota go and throw some show some dance all up inside this and or I'll make another Channel and I see the way in which like different audience say you bleed out of those different Echo Chambers and more and more get you comfortable with being uncomfortable with me and if he was uncomfortable with me anyway then you was a fair weather friend and I mean you know that it is what it is thanks for settling the score but the audience capture in particular is a slavery like what the Sean is saying it will essentially slave you you think that you getting you know a couple more dollars on a particular thing but YouTube making far more money off you that but your audience gets something far more valuable far more vital which is your vitals which is your blood pressure that they have on their on the end of their kebo you and they just you however you want to oh I want to get on o ass today and make a blood run boil okay I could do that today oh I want to get on foreign ass you know what I like y a you talking about [ __ ] type of [ __ ] I ain't like you for we about to go and say this I about to put you in a thumbnail and I about to go and get you from a very unflattering image and make you look like like this and that yeah that's them so guess what that's not her people that's not your people and any black American that goes out of their way to look at both you and oay and say you aren't the kind of black person I'm talking to because you are not from America is really just that sad bouncer in front of the club telling you you can't get in because of your your kicks like that's the only amount of power you got for that one little moment diasporic we are each other we are bound to each other and the way Olay talked that talk I get free so any black American and I said any and I'll say it to your face and your mama face any black that can say oh you can't talk for us because you don't really know what it's like to be you don't know what uh you don't want freedom is now you playing stupid it's very much it's not it's not even divisive no more you dumb dumb it's always me like they are on some other [ __ ] to bring I really just feel specifities I just feel like I'm in a space all by myself like I really feel like like you know no pun intended like I'm on an island by myself because like not for nothing like right like when you think of like foreign living foreign live home you know what I mean I'm foreign as a US citizen on top about it's a different situation people really treat me like I am the target for their hatred for like immigrants and this like I'm not I'm not lying to you I I get thousands of messages like that every day like aack like you know what's crazy like attack me they make videos about me they criticize me like like and then if I even post so much as why talk about one thing or one thing I experienced oh they just trolls oh ignore it don't engage and it's always interesting to me like I got to be everybody voice but I cannot talk like I feel like I created this platform that I'm a slave to and I'm a puppet in and I am I am dehumanized in and it it feels like like I feel like I made a mistake somewhere along the way because it's like not for nothing I I don't advocate for things that benefit myself you I've never made a video in my life like explaining why uh immigrants who come here as International students should get a green card should be entitled to a green card or citizenship and we should be but you've never heard me make that I don't advocate for myself I don't advocate for things for that benefit me and nobody else does either so it's like I do all this work and all these things and I'm just [ __ ] on Non-Stop and nobody gives a and nobody even experiences it and when I tell people like not for nothing like to see this election I told people with the effect of like how much they hate immigrants the rise of how these adol and FP have gotten into like they hate immigrants and they hate black immigrants and I know it because they tell me like I wish like I don't know what to do sometimes because I don't show people a hate and then they they they they dismiss it and minimalize minimize it like it's not a thing and if I was showing them then it's like just showing you hate and negativity but I I'll tell people even people like platform people with my own friends in the space or whatever I show them like I tell them about it they ignored it they dismiss it and they'll be on their own socials like stoking these things you know what I mean that I experience in life and and it's been interesting to see it backfire on everybody in this election but I'm just like what am what am I doing dog like I I honestly I'm I'm I'm not sure what I'm doing anymore because I find myself in 2024 in the same spot I was in 2016 immigration situation and just by yourself and nobody gives like even just the things Americans say to me like the share amount of emailing me as we speak leaving me comments I wake up to a bunch of emails of people being like and this this ain't even just the the thousands of the 3,000 told me to go back to my country this morning but the people who think that your fans being like Oh ly you should just leave the country and it's just like I might not like oh you should you know to show them you what the like i a not telling I've been here my whole life essentially like what the are you talking about you know what I mean like where am I supposed to go and do what you know what I mean like they just I like I I telling you'all I Ain lie I don't know what I'm doing like I I I I genuinely am like even like like this o and friends like doing this I'm like I don't know why I'm doing this like what what what but from the time I made it all I've been I swear for can tell you from the time I made it I you curate a community that don't like you that others you and your own [ __ ] they come on your thing and they complain about your accent they talk about you like a dog like what the am I doing this for you know what I mean only to realize I'm like that's to what deshaan is saying I'm not I'm not they're not my community I'm not in community and that's what I realize that nobody wants me in community with them but the things that I make and I do and I try to share and I try to Advocate and I try to this and I'm just attacked and denigrating I'm just like why am I busting my ass to do this and like to do these things that harm me to do these things that get my visas denied to do these things you know what I mean why am I doing that like I became a public defended all these things I've set my life materially back to like do things and for what you know what I mean and so I don't know y'all I I really I really don't know like I don't have anything like uplifting to say I don't have anything like truly like I don't know what my point really is other than I just feel like I feel like I I've wasted my own time and energy like I truly I truly feel out way like oh I've been wasting my breath like all this time you know what I mean and I just I I I almost I'd almost be disappointed in myself like I wish I I wish I I wish I realized just how much like don't receive me and how much you know what I mean and how how what a waste of time and energy this is like even with like for example like even talking about the ad stuff I put out a video there other day like a really thoughtful video like about like how uh xenophobia is exists in the entire like anti-blackness and xenophobia is in the entire diaspora it's not just black Americans and it's not just any particular it's not just Africans it's not just Caribbean people or whatever and like it's so crazy to be a person who creates a platform cuz people cuz because you talk and nobody and realize nobody listens to you you make a video you write a script like the share amount of if I could show you the thousand [ __ ] people get banned from my my uh comment section screaming and Hauling about oh like I swear to you they don't even listen to you talk even the ones who say your fans they not listening they don't listen they don't watch it they just in the comments like what they assumed that you could say they're like oh Africans did it first and blah blah blah blah oh you you don't call out your own people the whole video I talking I I calling out Bohemians for their anti for their anti blockness xenophobia dations more than anything that's the whole point of the video they watch it Dan listen they even tell you that they listen they say I haven't watched the whole video yet but I'm just whatever you qualify talk and I'm just like what am I talking for what am I doing this for like why do I create a platform that I have to hide from like I'm so abused on all my platforms and everybody's response to me is don't look at your comments don't like that makes sense like in a real world when you think about it like your job and your career is this these your platforms everything I supposed to avoid my own phone how I supposed to see my Analytics you know what I mean it's just me one running all these things but I'm supposed to imagine trying to serve a community that treats you so bad you're not supposed to look at your own comments like what the is that and oay it sucks that sucks I was the first one to tell you don't look at your comments because I came from a place and I'm a an American citizen product of immigrants and I said don't look at your comments because I remember what the hell it did to me when I worked at this really big company and millions of people were literally calling me everything but a child of God I was a uh I was literally go back to your country I'm like but this is my this is really my country oh you don't you don't get to speak for us they we used to have a call in because this was back in the day your girl been here a decade too we used to have a call in where they used to call in and then they would leave voicemails and they'll say Ben at least you're American but that little mut next to you we don't know what she is she needs to go back or the comments used to have that I'll rape you you know uh and kill the kids um all kinds of things like that but hearing those things so I said don't read the comments because if you're going to do this work and it sucks because we live in this type of stupid system that makes us when we want to talk about our own stuff and this is our own platform now I'm I've been since removed from there and been on other people's platform and still get that type of um hate but in order for me to do this I'm like yeah I need to drop what I need to drop put it in that the atmosphere and then I'm not going to the comment section love you mean it but I'm not going to go to the comment section because after this I'm probably not gonna talk about this in my regular life just because I I just need to remove myself from from this because I still have to live my life but I you know I for you I know it's frustrating even right now because you are doing more work than Americans that are telling you to shut the hell up you have done so much stuff you have not only utilized the digital space but you have actually been boots on the ground right you have been that um and you have been you've worked in the legal system you've helped the same black folks that's in the comment section telling you to f off you've helped people just like them um so for me I'm like girl these people and it's not it's not everyone but I've seen the comments I've seen what they said say about you I've seen the things you have a heart that is actually for the work it's a difference because they're only there for the networking for their comments to go viral and have all the likes for their little um uh think piece to be something that oh I I told her off she blocked me she they want that moment and I think that you're so much bigger than that that's what that's I'm like you don't even you don't those beautiful eyes of yours don't even need to lay upon those nasty ass comments because they're they do not define you is it difficult like the point you just made is tough it's your page like absolutely I should be able to look on my page with my work I should be able to read these comments but I don't think you deserve to I don't think they even deserve you to be um given anything but I don't think you deserve that your mental health is very important and if you're going to do this work it sucks that we have to be diminished to this with it sucks and we have to be like what's my point of all this Olay oay and friends is a brilliant a brilliant thing that you came up with um absolutely wonderful you have said it yourself people have came up to you because they've been on this platform and said to you you've helped platform me beloved and so many other people and these people have been work and doing this work before you and you helped to continue platform them people only knew who they were because they were on this platform I remember when you first started in baby since then you have propelled yourself because you've done this work it means something to you you're not just doing this because oh I'm trying to be heard when you heard about KLA Harris you're one of the ones that immediately said you know what let's really have a conversation I've watch this and this is now where I stand with it I know what I've said here this I can trust somebody that can go back and say you know what let's move it here and let's let's start putting in some work I know what I said here but it's looking a little different you have actually created room for us to have the conversations from all walks of the internet to come here and have these conversations baby baby you really that girl okay you know I tell you this on and off the screen but I do understand your frustrations and I don't want to diminish that either it's questions that need answers but it sucks because we live in America and just as we seen a few hours ago how America can just choose whiteness white supremacy KKK folks uh uh all kinds of hate and division they'll they'll definitely throw you on the bus that's what it is it sucks but you are so amazing thank you sis I appreciate y I don't want make y feel like yall got to Y y'all got to therapize me I'm sorry no I'm always gonna I didn't when iction episode I didn't know she was glues that's really my apologies I wouldn't have a blind this for the day of if I knew she was clueless like I I didn't expect to be depressed like you know what I mean that wasn't what I anticipated when I put it on the schedule because I let me neither it's a sucky day my sister's been here and she's yesterday she was on my show like getting ready we had a little champag at the house we thought something was gonna happen you know and and and but we even said because in the beginning when KLA said she was gonna run we was like it's gonna be very difficult and we know there's there's a chance that she may not but we want to be on the right side of it at least and her coming here I've never seen my sister just sleep like this she's never she's very active but she's been so she felt so defeated and she's been she's my prayer Warrior yesterday I was like I just feel anxious Mela I can't do it she's like We're PR and I was like okay she prayed with me got on air baby we was defeat we was feeling defeated on air we was like we just going to have to check out we've been here a few hours and we gotta go and when I was just talking with her as strong as she is I think we get to feel these feels I think people are trying to make us feel like um you see what I'm saying uh we already told you're gonna get a lot of this we told you we told you we told you I already knew from that time I you know what was great about you Olay you came out and was like I don't think she's gonna win because she's a black woman I don't think she's going to win because they're already tying her with Joe Biden I don't you made great points and then you came out because you saw the Brilliance of a damn campaign you saw in that small amount of time what was happening you did and you came out and you had another conversation about swing me and I I that's honestly that's honestly my fault you know I I I I used to be who used to curse people out like honestly I think what it is is I just feel like I'm losing myself in these platforms like trying to be nice and considerate like everybody makes you feel like you have an audience so you have to operate in a certain way and it's just like I feel like I'm being and this is time I talk about a therapy I feel like I'm being gasted on a large scale that I'm supposed to allow people to abuse me and I'm never supposed to say anything about it or I'm supposed to be nice and I'm supposed to be this which is hard for me because as a person I don't let people do me like that in real life but that's what it feels like everybody always trying to force me to second guess what I know to be true because every no it's like people don't want you to truly make an assessment they want you to say what the they want to hear and what they want to hear you know what I mean and so it's like I let make me feel like I was doing something wrong by telling them the reality of something you know what I mean like I and and it's not even just like random audience like back you know what I mean like I was telling I was like dog I I mean I was G message after after you this morning like you see because it was F say o f do just like this FD was like oay I don't actually agree with you I think he's going to win and so when after you tell me that I say like okay maybe maybe I maybe I trip in no a lawyer and political commentator you know and a black woman knowing knowing I know what I'm talking about but this me no man my my respect sensible you're discrediting yourself you're discrediting yourself up like I really discrediting yourself you're discrediting yourself because I watched that video and you still stood T toes down on your first thing you just offered up another perspective and you said if she does but you said it's going to be hard you stated again that she's a black woman you stated what was going to be coming up against her but you gave credit where it was due in that time so please don't discredit yourself you didn't just fall short to the pressures I think that you even saw for yourself um you are a big person on speaking your mind I think you are far removed from that time when you were the pressures of the people sweetie because I remember that time and it only took one time for you and you was like you know what no and um and I curs I was cursing yesterday and today and I was like you know what I I I need to get back to me like I telling you I was cursing you a see it CU you ain't on Instagram I want you know I was cursing she was going in baby pouring like I was in Fox like I mean cursing clean out like Instagram removed your video they Cur them so bad I put it back up like that's that's how I carryed on I really I really try to find the balance on on things like that especially with like organizing and trying to meet people where they are and all these different things ESP especially like me being involved with the union and a union leader people look up to me in weird ways and I'm just like I'm not that special like we all working together we're trying to figure this out and it's so difficult because sometimes people just say and do egregious stuff but you have to supposedly collectively work together to get a thing done and I'm just like I really can't with this mother I really I really hate this like to be honest with you and that is some of the most difficult [ __ ] and at least I understand I do well for the most part as I understand this is about Coalition building and all these different things and I think that's one of the more broadly like the issue on the left is our Coalition building is nonexisting like that that is so crazy to me that we just keep doing this we keep arguing about it and it never ends we can never do [ __ ] like this Con Purity contest that you were talking about earlier it's just like you have to be this much of a left you have to do exactly the way that I want you to do it or therefore you are not the thing that you said you are that I say you are you don't fit you don't fit under that category or anything like that and then it's just like so what we doing actually what are we doing so only that are your sons your sons or daughters or whomever the can actually be a part of whatever your agenda is so okay so we're gonna get nothing done that's what that means and we're sitting here getting nothing done like we're getting nothing done we also don't have platforms communication none of those things and I'm just sitting here I'm like I'm really for real I'm not even playing I don't know what the we about to do I really don't know because I also know how hard it is to organize folks and they resist extra hard because on top of that people want to be spoonfed they want to be told what to do a lot of people not about that life not about that action not about none of that [ __ ] and that's just a reality that's for real I'm not even playing and some people will talk this I i' I've been you know a part of Union i' I've actually been on a strike authorized to strike 94% of people talking about they're gonna strike 47% up yeah come on [Music] now internet Atlanta Atlanta is a place right I came here and I'm like oh my God you know it's the blackest place it's black Hollywood I just I'm so excited and I'm like where do I fit in here you know and I'm coming I'm a Florida girl right um went to an HBCU you know you know I love to say it Florida aam University the first like the number one HBCU in the nation absolutely well that's somebody who also went to HBCU but it wasn't it sound like it wasn't FAMU Beloved Community right um Community not network but Community but um and shouts out to your HBCU um but but you know knowing that like in this space it's so funny because I'm like Atlanta I came here thinking we were gonna do the thing baby I came here in New York when I was living in New York it was more of a thing that was done than it was here in Atlanta and I'm like dang black folks it's Hollywood here I was looking for my and then they come here find your tribe find your tribe and I'm like but I thought it was supposed to be in a city I thought it was supposed to be everybody black I thought it was supposed to be that wasn't my tribe I had to find out I ended up having to go with my Haitian folks and doing that became my tribe doing things for Haitians here in Atlanta and creating Community around that Millennials doing things for the community here that's what I ended up doing um and politically being that voice here for them it's funny because I also see how I ALS Folks at the door this that's crazy it's the UN maintenance y'all give me one moment this crazy the Sean and mahogany because y'all both right do you find do you think that like writing is a I don't know a better way or a different way to like do your like to educate to politically educate or to yeah 100 com yes like like I I so I mean o you know I have been on the receiving end of all that of all that you know you know I have and so like yeah that's a large part of why I decided like I actually can't do this internet [ __ ] anymore like I can't I don't like you don't like me I don't want to talk to y'all like we are not friends I can't do this um because it became distressing I was like I was spending every single week in therapy talking about the internet and I was like am I okay I'm not okay I gotta go like I can't do this no more and so but like I have been in movement media for about as long as I've been organizing and so I just found that like it became it was a lot easier for me to be like okay I'm in my process I get to everything that's going on up here I can just put it out like I can put it I can put pen to paper put it on wax what however you want to call it right and can do with that what they want in their own spaces at whatever because you know do what to do but it doesn't become it's not my problem I get to I get to clarify I get to communicate I get to theorize I get to what I need to do um and and that's it and hopefully it's building like not only not only is it like doing some sort of political education but it is also allowing people to find like find answers or language for themselves of how of how they want to navigate space or how they want to communicate with others how they want to build and I'm not I don't do it because I want to be you know the next big podcaster or the or the next big media person right I'm doing it because I have a real commitment to to this work I have a very real commitment to my folks Right For Better or For Worse I have a real commitment to to to because I know that we're working up against so much so yeah I would definitely say that like writing has been and not just writing because I I do a lot of different media like multimedia platforms for me have been really really really helpful but writing in particular has has been some of the most important work that I have taken up because it's just allow I love your writing thank you that means a lot like it it has been like writing for me has done what I think a lot of folks want to do and think it's easier to do by being on screen but it's so much harder to do because of the fact that there are all these comment sections and because it can be I think disseminated more easily right like folks will folks will are dispersed more easily folks will just like you know screen record a part of what you say clip it and then that goes that goes viral and then people form opinions based off of a a one minute clip right and the same can be done with a with a piece of writing if they decide to screenshot one portion of it but really so many times like depending on how you write you can't just break up a piece of a text without bringing more context to it because it's not going to make sense um so yeah for me I I do I do much prefer to to put that on wax what about you say I'm With You Dean I'm on I'm on the page because I'll fight you you can't say sh like the internet is wild it is wild and writing that saved me in a lot of ways and now it's writing that saves you know I'm like Sonia Sanchez said it best I write so I don't have to kill nobody like truly the writing is the Liber that's the liberatory tool right and if I can archive the voices that they keep trying to forget if I can illuminate the stories that they keep trying to silence if I can make space and take up space for the people they keep trying to marginalize then I'm doing my part but I find that when I take my eye off the page and I start trying to talk to someone who I think got some sense bot or or or teen or otherwise I lose my orientation I like Spiral and I it's very hard for me to come back so I gave up and and the internet is actually how I got to New York I was working at Double X cell as an intern where then yes that's how I began as a hip-hop journalist and I loved it um and then we moved into the Internet space where hipop journalism became constant very right now and the the massage inir you know took me further away to where I could be my own editor and again the poems and the stories the non-fiction can be um they could be uplifted but even then I had to realize that as much as I love that that this that this art that I'm able to create and and these conversations that we're able to have it has to be like something is at stake there has to be some skin in the game and it can't just be mine so the same way you said no one says this to me in my face that's why you about that life and they know it they know it but they know that they can Chip Away armor right if I'm online popping [ __ ] to someone whose heart is as big as yours is whose heart is as obviously glorious as yours is desan it's it's apparent in the writing if I can chip away at that I can silence you I can wound you and I can make you be quiet so continue silencing these other mother that's what we really trying do you trying to liberate too many people we got we got to take a couple of holes into your tires yeah that's exactly so yeah I keep it to the page I keep it to the page the internet I got an assistant love it you no more comments babe and I have my my wonderful assistant Aaron Aaron har and Aaron woodl the problem is like and I'm sure everybody who know me knows this I'm a workaholic like I like you can't outwork me to to prevent me from seeing it that's the problem is like Aaron tries his best but like like for example like the video I put up this morning I didn't sleep last night I election and then I wrote and then I wrote the whole thing and then I recorded the whole thing and then I couldn't bring myself to wait for my my Editor to do it I said I'm gonna edit this video and make the thumbnail and get this out tonight in the morning before and then come still record this show and then go record you know what I mean so it's like that's that's really the problem like we could put looking for him cuz he know I go like you know I have a child and a wife now but my dad are doing that like but also it also has made me slow will not even talk to nobody after 4 in the morning foren will wake up to go to the gym he will answer if had a message from you the the day before he that's it I have time limits all of my [ __ ] I but I I write you love letters right like so like if you if you said if you send me a message I could get it in the morning and you would get me when I could actually ingested and give a thoughtful response or a voice note or maybe just me sucking my teeth for like five seconds but that's thoughtful but like the fact of the matter is like it is this thing will rob you of that like it will rob you the one thing that definitely grounds me is like as traditional and conservative as his son is when you when you get that son and you got that child looking up to you and like he teething n and my boy say da I just like this I say I have like one one one dude that look like the palm of my hand making noise about and and like making moral assumptions and judgments it don't matter what I saying because yet again I got this grounding and it anchors you in so I can't react to everything yeah I have to literally be baited and then I could just devote totally to the things that I find to be worthwhile and I know how your brain work ol because like alimi is like I've we've had conversations about this I've been trying to get alimi to go and lead her phone um YouTube analytics app off of a phone from time I want you to know let me how crazy I deleted 100 times a day like I I I I download and put it back on I don't have fre freaking yourself out no because like I would go mad like I mean like that level of access like they I I get anxious from vibrations Phantom vibrations I don't I haven't heard like a ringtone in forever I haven't heard a factory song off of my iPhone like that just gives me anxiety so I have time limits on every little thing from my WhatsApp to everything if you need to call me I I an abolitionist thanks toay but call Cuz don't call me why you calling me what I could do I can't resit take nobody because if it a and then if it isn't like if it is really that urgent I'll sure someone go find me but ultimately that do allowed me some peace I'm been on Twitter I I don't know what the hell going on Twitter and I don't need to know do you think you'd feel different was in the states yes absolutely and that's why like I mean like I still wouldn't be online though but like it would feel world away if I was a Nassau I don't think I'd give a what they're talking about it literally is feel like you get transported to a new universe but I feel like I'm right here I I am so but I am here right I'm I'm in Atlanta and and I've been offline like it is hard like it's really hard like I will say I will say jumping offline for me was less of a like of a choice and it was more of like I I am going crazy because of because of the what my life experience was at the time like I have to go and then after being away for a certain amount of time I was like I don't even really know how to get back on here like I used to tweet all the time and then I was like I don't even know what like what I don't know what to say I don't know like I don't know how and then you tweet something and you start get reactions and you're like no I can't like I can't I can't do this I I cannot talk to y'all like y'all like I've changed y'all have not changed like and it and it becomes like it it just you get to that place where you're like I can't I can't be a part of this space in that way and then you have to find you find a balance right you find a way to be able to exist in the space because it is something that that drives you that you thrive off of that you enjoy um or or something that just pays your bills right it's your business and you are also able to find other ways to exist outside of it to where it no longer like becomes your main source of I don't want to say entertainment but like being let me let me ask her a different question and I think like have y'all ever done anything on the internet like created a platform or anything else that wasn't political like and you know what I mean I mean but everything is political to an extent Sor to say like maybe because I have a linti pop now right and like also I like be trying to like learn from other people right like let me go see what other creators say about how they deal with hate and y yada ya and you'll be watching all these YouTube videos from these other creators who they ain't in your world they're not in the internet that you're in and they don't even know what that internet is hidden for cuz I was watching these videos of these YouTubers forign that was like they were like talking about oh you know you know you just got to know the difference between criticism and feedback and Y yada Y and accept all right but hold on when they go on to say what the worst comment they ever get is you're I say they couldn't make it in my street son they were like the worst coming or somebody talk about they hair or something I like you dead if you see the say every day and then what I realized is like like I have a and I realize like you'll be talking I have a bunch of creative friends who are big way bigger creators who don't know nothing but the kind of hate I get because they don't do this kind of stuff because I created a learn Audi pop and like I genuinely I'm like wow there's a world where you could be a creat and it's a positive experience like when I create videos on a learn like I create videos on a learn a poop genuinely because the audience is nice and appreciative and they just treat you like like when I put out a video I'd be happy to hear from them they make you feel like it's like I make all this content on linati that I think is so valuable and I trying to like sh you know blah blah blah putting all this effort in to do something that I think is Meaningful and all it is is criticize criticize criticize complain complain complain what it they there meanwhile you cracking jokes talking [ __ ] but TV shows and AER how pop and they're like oh my God thank you so much my weak needed this I was depressed I needed this you know what I mean and I'd be like and they'll be on there like I they don't make you feel B but just it's crazy it's like you could Bleak five cursed words on a learn they can't even hear it and they still denigrating you and talking about you like a dog and beliefs in yourself or whatever meanwhile I don't happen over on lurina and I be like dog is this what it could be like could the internet like I swear to God I'd be like feeling like I it's a up I promise you let me tell you how serious it is the difference between my olti and audience and my Olina pop audience if I go to go to my YouTube studio and I it start off in alady I have to blur my eye fast so I can click ady pop and get over the way a safe it's like a f it's like it it feel like they put me on the front lines of wall when I got to go to lurina like I have to get about say go safe they could be they could be so nice here everybody oh just nothing but goodness and I be like why am I doing this dog like we could have a nice time on the international yeah no it's funny because the the space is real iffy and fickle um I had to like I said there was a time when in the first uh you know when 2016 When Donald Trump was in office that was my time to shine digital space for politics was just just coming in and it was people but it was just coming in and that was my time in that moment to do what I needed to do I felt like okay I'm gonna you know be a journalist in here because I was just coming from a journalist and be and doing a whole bunch of other things and then I came into politics that was a very different platform and the digital space and it became very very very stressful and so for me knowing that I was in there and getting my behind ripped apart just for being some somebody who spoke up against Donald Trump and who pointed out what was happening with Mexicans and who pointed out the mass murders and who pointed out all those things baby they was like you're just this is what they called me I thought it was funny at first but then they started to call me stupid and bimbo and all oh she's just pretty and she has nothing to offer because I came in there as a journalist I'm literally a journalist that's literally what I am and we were taught to L to say um we were taught uh to be unbiased coming into digital journalism you RI that off and you have now an ability to say the facts and also have emotion so now coming in there and again I'm trained in that as well master's degree baby and so here we are and they're telling me that I'm not equipped to do this all they're telling me is she's just pretty that's all she got and I'm like y'all didn't hear nothing I said y'all didn't see that long script that I wrote with all of the facts and the videos and all of that the that I put together they can't do anything and then so coming from there I said this is too stressful for me for years then I worked with Sean King and seeing your favorites your favorite people actually not be good people um it's crazy and I seen that in real time working alongside him okay and so after that um and when I say alongside him he never show no we're not going [Laughter] there what it was I was like I need break from this and then becoming blacklisted because you challenged those people who are at the top you become blacklisted now I'm coming back in and I'm just trying to feel it out Benjamin Dixon whom I've been working for for since since 2016 we've been working alongside each other um he's been like a mentor to me um also somebody that encouraged me to come back in and when that that was in 2020 I was ready to get the hell on baby I went to corporate and corporate was just not for me okay it just was not for me because I was always rebellious in the system but um all then I you know was just doing like it or not just to be able to do the thing and job it do the thing and drop it but then I realized Rebecca especially after meeting Olay um especially after meeting Olay I was like you know what she Olay was encouraging me constantly to be like hey don't do you're really great work I'm like girl I don't want to do this no more I would let I'm you that was you that was you I ref and then and then so she moved me to do that but I went into a space where I'm like you know what I'm gonna do the work and I'm going to Melinda I'm going to do the work and then I'm going to leave it I'm going to do the work I'm going to talk about and then I'm going to walk away from it however I was like IP to be like for him I love the work right but I don't have it and ask me CJ ask how with it and I'm like I'm I to put boundaries because my mind matters my my whole I was becoming a person who was just so stuck on what these people were saying and asking of me they were so entitled they were pulling for me to do all of what they wanted to do to cover what they wanted to do and I had to say I no longer want to cover mass murders every every month I no longer want to talk about this particular issue and just because it's a Haitian issue y'all don't really care about it so I'm going to talk about it over here with the people that matter actually in the community that I'm in but when I'm here talking about it with y'all you guys are telling me this is not the case that's what was problematic to me and then understanding um once I say what I need to say once I turn that camera off do not expect anything further from me do not expect anything further from me because I'm going to go out to eat I'm gonna put on a cute dress I'm GNA do my hair I'm gonna get I'm gonna get rest um I'm gonna probably tweet I'm gonna probably tweet about twerking I'm probably gonna tweet a Bible verse because I love Jesus I'm gonna do all and so I created and then I was telling oay actually push me to do this um and it don't get it gets dust but I still love doing it it's called Shades of good news where I just highlight Positive Black stories randomly about black folks all the joy in the world and so other than that that's where I'm at with it I like to talk about P I like the work but I can do it and have you we' seen our favorite activists at the end of what they're doing end up what do they end up doing they go and retire in another country I don't know if I like talking about politics or if I've just convinced myself that that valuable work for black people you know what I mean I think that honestly and that's something recently I don't know when was the last time I asked myself if I enjoy this you know what I mean like not for nothing it's like I didn't become a public defender because I thought it would be fun or because I enjoyed it I I thought like I told the St whole story of how I became a public defender why I decided or not like I was in college writing my thesis at the time with a Ferguson protest and stuff and like long story short I ultimately was like I don't think it's sufficient for me to go become a lawyer and not do something that directly serves black people right so I feel like I always do these things out of a sense of obligation that I put on myself um that I think is like important and and that's what I've done with like I was talking to eron I was like we have like such a we have a box like like or I feel like I boxed myself I didn't box myself in because I do a lot of different kinds of content you know what I mean like I I I am very creative I create different kinds of things and different Outlets but like there's still all the I guess the the thesis or the purpose for all of them is still ultimately like how can I help advocate for educate some something that I think is important that I think is hard for us to get attention to otherwise like how can I make that creative versus like I don't just create things because I think that's fun or I would do you know what I mean like that's kind and so and I don't know I'm at this place where I don't I don't I don't I don't know how much I even feel like it's okay to be like ah let me do something cuz not cuz I think it's valuable for black people or because it's just like I'm like I don't know if I enjoy talking about politics like I do that is what I'm I talk about that's what I talk about in my real life I am ranting about these things and stuff so I guess I can't say I don't because I always R I always R about it but I can't say if I truly love that or if I just think that it isn't done enough there aren't enough black people in these spaces and like that's what we need to do and we need to platform all that but I'm like in a different world where I could just truly be a creative which is what I I fundamentally think at my core like I think I'm a creative and I really enjoy that and making my shows and producing my content like would it would it be this would it have to be you know what I mean like I mean but I don't think you have to enjoy I don't think most people who talk about politics enjoy it it's it's you're talking about your experience you're talking about like what you are living through and I I have come to that conclusion about my work too like um I don't love I don't love doing any of this [ __ ] like if I could like if I could do something totally different like in a in a different world I would be some I would be in somebody's recording studio putting out albums and [ __ ] like I would do music like music is what I love to do like I would be say life is too short let me tell you as probably the oldest person on this Zoom um you know I'm old you just perceive that you did call yourself old by calling it Zoom I did I was trying to nail The Landing um you must ain't nothing else worth it nothing nothing here is worth you not being joyful you not having Delight I we ain't free if you not happy I think people who talk about politics they really enjoy that like it's like seduko for them it's it's there's you know it's a journey and there's a joy in finding the key but when it's no longer fun I I implore you go towards the joy there is work still there for you money is still there for you you don't have to do the thing that's GNA burn you out at the end of the day if you're not well we're not well you know what I mean like when these poems get too hard for me I turn and I start writing a ya novel and when the ya gets too tough I go back to poems I left journalism because it became too hard and I love hip-hop it raised me but I'm not willing to sacrifice my body for something that I love right like it's that's not love that's not love so if it's not bringing you Joy um let it let it go let go let God let it go your joy is actually going to bring us freedom it's actually going to bring us Liberation and I say that knowing so I'm met Olay because I followed her her her station and I was like I have to give this sister an award that the black girl magic bought because teaching all of my young people this is how we this is how we can move and I don't have to like you know shroud myself and cloak myself I don't have to change my language I don't have to like speak in two languages for people to deem me correct I can be me and my full wholehearted self and and kick truth and still be worthy and so that's how I met her and even now knowing that this is causing you such pain I would rather you leave this [ __ ] to dust and go start a book club baby I will read whatever book you say which is what we already started trying to do you know Cliff of books me to buy I yet that book [ __ ] I read what but the joy is where it's at that's how we get free but we ain't gonna get free if we sitting here letting the the the the the machine grind our bones to dust yeah last T thank you for that look it's it was for the but I felt I sound like you no video by the way I saw somebody said to me boy this made me so everything is run me hard I for it but somebody didn't say to me what it was what I what I put out recently some video and I musty mentioned I was talking about oh must the [ __ ] video like talking about about someone's like oh you need to make more content about the muhammads or in the Caribbean and it pissed me right off because I was like look at you watch that shut up watch watch I did that's my flop no that's what I want to do I did a video about Vibes that's my flop for the year I one FL I just like this ain't even hit 100K but that's fine because as we do one for us the rest for the algorithm or whatever that's fine but like the people in your comments they lead you down a dark alley to get bludgeon by the algorithm so don't don't mind them absolutely and no you that was the point you made they they always be like well why don't you just maybe you should and how about it's just like when you meet somebody in person they know what you do they've seen you on bigger platforms theyve seen what you can do they know exactly who you are and then it be like do you you ever think about do you you might be better at and then I tell them but that's not what I like to do then they be like offended I ain't doing that but how about that like online I tell them all the time I will skip your comment I will tell you I'm not interested in that I'm I'm not and when that I'm literally the oppressor in Rebecca's life Erin that because that's me calling Rebecca like oh yes yes dou it's a good news now also Rebecca we got to do something for this audience and they like negativity do that because they're going to be and I'm like girl where I am in my life every day I be on ph her where I'm am I'm I'm where I am in my life right now I just I go hiking I write bikes I like to get nice flowers and I like to be uhuh because they've taken that from me already and I'm not going to allow them to continue to do that do I want to talk about these things yes with my mama and my daddy because they're my mama and my daddy will always be my blood people I don't know telling me how to be a Haitian how to be this how to be that what to talk about oh my it just really grinds my gears because there's so many videos of me talking about this specific thing and if you are a supporter of me you would know this and and that's why I be feeling like I don't have to answer to you and especially in this climate like even on this this whole thing um we're going to be talking about this because we work in politics or or we're pundits or however we're gonna have to write about it um about KLA Harris I'm also going to be mindful about that yes I will be on a few shows this week talking about it but there is going to be a day where I say hey that's my last comment on that specifically hours you know I know that I know that we are I know I know o you're about to say we're at two hours but I I have to I have to because Rebecca said something earlier um about like not about what it was like covering Trump in 2016 and I really just wanted to like go back to that before we wrap if that's okay because yeah of course um because that I know I said at the start of this that I was not GNA autopsy commas [ __ ] but I'm about to um because like I think that is perhaps one of the biggest things too right there like we know there are a number of reasons why things went the way that they went um or are going way that they're going because I see that some ballots have not been counted which is not a surprise anywh who um what happened in 2016 from like an organizing perspective was so frustrating because so many people came on to the scene and were like oh my God they got kids in cages oh my God they're killing black people oh my God the prisoners have are under horrible conditions oh my God blah blah blah blah blah and then 2020 came and those folks disappeared here right but we know that Biden enacted some of the worst conditions for immigrants in the country right mass deportations under the Biden Administration Obama dropped more bombs around the globe than any other president in US history right and Kamala ran this campaign and I will say I think kamla with like the time that she had did a really great job with her campaign I was actually really surprised by like what she was able to do with her campaign but she she used a little bit of what Obama did in OA and a little bit of what um Hillary Clinton did in in 2016 and for me it was like her approach to this campaign was I think also a really big determiner in in the outcome of the election because she chose to not distance herself from Joe Biden and I think that was a mistake considering the fact that that not Obama kamla was so unpopular when she was running for president initially that she dropped to then join his ticket because she was that much of an unpopular candidate and like Rebecca said at the start of the episode we never saw KLA unless she was walking somewhere her and Joe Biden was walking walking somewhere in the white house that's when we saw that's when we saw her but that was it we never got to see much more of kamla until Joe said okay I'm dropping out the race and all of a sudden we saw KLA everywhere I think if we saw like a full campaign from kamla I actually don't I actually like a full campaign now considering that we have seen more of her in the past like couple of months I actually think she would have a good a good chance of running but I think where she messed up one of the places where she messed up in this campaign was that she didn't distance herself from from Biden that she didn't show people that she was not going to be the same as Biden was and for folks who again I agree with with you la that like leftist I don't even like using that language because I think it's it doesn't have any real meaning I don't even know who is defined as a leftist but people with like a people in movement right do not have I think as much power as we like to think that we do also what I also think is true is that there are folks who are directly impacted um by the conversations that we have by by the the platforms that we do have um and who may have been more motivated to to go out to vote um had kamla shown an inkling of a difference between her and Biden I think it was very clear after the debate between Biden and Trump that folks were like we don't want either of y'all like neither of y'all are doing for us what we need y'all to do and instead of being like you know I I've been here to support Joe Biden whatever whatever whatever and I think that this is where I would differ from him this is where I would like to show differently um she didn't do that she stood tin toes behind exactly how he's shown up in the past four years and I I think that was a mistake um and and not only did she do that but she also was like oh yeah and I got the chaines in my corner too and it's like don't even start okay like I don't I don't think that's a compliment I don't think that's something that you really need to lean into for real and I just I think that that approach was a huge mistake in her campaign and and and I think it's as we are as we are folks who are in media who will be covering like this election and what has and what has transpired I think that that's something to really deeply consider because folks who who have been on the ground and who will remain on the ground will be the ones who will have to deal with the aftermath of all of this and in real time in a way that folks who just come in because of the fearmongering of of what Trump could do don't actually have to really put up with on a day-to-day and I think that's what's most frustrating it's like folks are like well you know four years of trump and then four more years and then and then that's it as if Trump is the IND or of the violence that we're experiencing and it's like he is the Democrats are employing a lot of the very same tactics and in a very different way right like in a very neoliberal way and we have to contend with that too and if we don't contend with that we will not we because I'm not a Democrat the Democrats will continue to lose elections and folks will continue to move further and further right and that'll be the issue thing I mean that's the thing is at the end of the day it only hurts the people like I feel like I he like he a lot people talk about the Democrats as though the Democrats are going to suffer in anyway like at the end of the day you you're gonna have a hard time I think this we're only you're never going to convince a party or anyone or the nation that they're supposed to move that by moving further and further right that's proof that they're supposed to move to the fur further left it's just it just doesn't indicate that it doesn't illustrate that even if that's what we want I don't think that is what's going to happen and more importantly is like we always talk about these elections and we talk about this stuff as low Democrats or who's suffering like oh the Democrats gonna lose Democrats gonna keep losing elections they don't give a they're not the ones losing their right you know what I mean so it's us so that's what I find frustrating to have a bunch of people that are in the same that putting us all in a hot boiling pot constantly talking like you know what I mean like the like the people who are who are learning this lesson are dams no we're learning it we're suffering and I feel like here's the thing I want to believe like I would like to like I listen I agree that I I can see where Kelo tried to be more Centrist but I'm just not convinced that that was what what was wrong when the nation is screaming to us that they wanted to move far right I just cannot see I don't think that it helped that's what I'm saying I think like I think what would have happened regardless is that America was going to be America I like I think we are completely forgetting the fact that America is literally built on slavery and genocide so like that doesn't surprise me at all that people are are white supremacists but what I'm saying is that her being a Centrist doesn't help because if I'm gonna if I'm gonna vote for right politics I'm not going to choose the cist I'm G to choose the one who who is most true to the American the America that I want right like and she and so she is like she doesn't give any real right difference right like she it's like it go ahead people if people wanted Trump light they they didn't want Trump light they just wanted Trump and and if they were gonna want Trump wasn't gonna be a black woman like no yeah that's that's that's actually the the point desan um it's it could have been anything but this is politics all of them previous presidents including um Obama have played the game dirty this ain't nothing new she was going to guide some kind of wave to get her in especially in this short window we it's just all of the things that were given to her in this time um it was all first of all a black woman again she ran before and then in that time they was like f no we're not definitely don't want you so um nobody respected her as a vice president especially and I don't even think her own Administration respected her as vice president um we didn't see her shining in any type of way a lot of the and then when she said she was running all of the sudden people spoke to her as um she is the president everything was addressing her as if she's president oh this is for KLA Harris maybe Joe Biden is still the president um so a lot of the things that I'm seeing and I am the first one you can find me um in on other uh channels or other people's shows talking about Joe Biden and criticizing uh his policies that affected my people Haitians and I you know have had these conversations however um when it came to uh the person that was is a part of his administration which is K Harris she couldn't fully remove herself from that running in running the way she is because she's still a part of that Administration I think that it would it would have definitely hurt her coming in like that she's still a part of the Biden Harris Administration they have to play She should get the opportunity to play politics like every one of them other men have but they won't because she's a black woman she's gonna have to go harder we're gonna have to require more from her and that's how I saw it um whether I like her or not and I absolutely began to like her I can't even front on you I did um but she because of how they treated her as a as a old like like at the end of the day like how you feel about it her substantive you know her being a liberal or her being too CC and all that that she is a highly qualified black woman being talked about like a dog and I as a black woman just cannot like get over that and like respect and I think the thing that like I find frustrated with with left like leftist in this particular election especially a lot of white leftist and how they gave it up um in general is they would be racist they were being racist it was like very very thinly veiled even the amount of times they were acting like they they made it their business the minute KLA became the nominee all of a sudden they they focused all their energy on attacking black people specifically every day like oh we're only we're only supporting her because she's blacking racist black people overwhelmingly support the Democrats and and when when the candidate is always white because the other party is a white supremacist party committed to our subjugation so that was some racist [ __ ] in and of itself and I'm just I'm not convinced that the leftist listen to them all election I've seen it I've seen it all I like participating that's who's yelling at us every day I'm not convinced that the people the people who cared the most about oh she's too Centrist or the Cheney this or I wanted her to be PR Progressive more were G to come out for her they would have same people like you would see it like even the main like vocal points like commentators who have the biggest platforms who were leading that elk made it very clear they would have never reported her even if Palestine had not been happening they would have found another reason to cling to they they even if she had tried I feel like she couldn't try to distance herself to from the Biden ad administration because what A Rang un sincere she was the VP and they weren't having it like it was the way it was interesting to me the way they they got rid of thein Biden wasn't the nominee all of a sudden if you didn't know better you would have think KLA Harris was the president that was no Netanyahu and she is the one who sick on Palestine that's the way they were talking and giving it up so I'm just not convinced that's the case like the leftist who were saying that and all of that I just don't I don't buy it they they I do not buy it and I think the rest of the nation like sometimes I think like especially like other marginalized people and stuff have a hard time really coming to terms with what the like like how black women are perceived and like how black women are really like really are criticized and analyzed and I just do not think especially the fact that we are calling Kamala Centrist we all think she's Centrist we all think she think she Republican like they think she died Republican all of this or they they calling her fascist and all that and the fact that the nation and the show out to vote and stuff was still calling her too liberal is a reflection the fact that they don't listen to you when you're black wom they don't care what you're saying they don't care about the facts they don't care about they care about what they project on to you you know so I felt like she was doing that she was trying to counteract this narrative that she's a she's a radical leftist and all of that this woke this which is exactly what the who do show up to vote vote against and like for me I just feel like yes we know all the things KLA all of this like I've heard nothing but non-stop ad nauseum criticism for kamla and the Democrats this entire year but what I want like I'm like at at what point do we talk about the people who knew what the consequences are and didn't give a they thought it was more important to prove a point to prove I'm the retic oh you didn't P it to me you didn't did and I just think that's some selfish [ __ ] and I don't know why it's being so downplayed because at the end of the day what do you mean like what do you mean like you like what what people are you talking about like non voters or people who voted for like who are you talking about I'm I'm I'm talking there's not one particular group I think they're yeah yeah it's not one particular group this I wouldn't I wouldn't direct it at like third party voters or something specific I don't think third party voters cost her election or anything like that they got on my nerves this like year they really got on my nerves this year just how they gave it up they were just very like it was a hostile attacking it was it was no consideration like you were not allowed to want to contend with the fact that this is a two-party system they did not want to hair and contend with the fact that jillan was not going to be president no matter what the you wanted that any of these third party candidates were not going to be president they literally it felt like you talking to these loud angry brick walls who want to be mad you for pointing out that regardless if you don't choose KLA Donald Trump is going to be president and they did not want to contend with reality because they were more concerned with what they running on with you know what I mean so they're not to blame that granted they're not to blame for her losing they're just not like statistically they're not that's not the case so I would never say that they got on my nerves though and I thought that and I think they were not helpful in terms of the left in Progressive I think they actively splintered splintered community and solidarity and like the movement all year because all they did was attack on their side like it was they made it their business they started attacking black people they started attacking progressives they started and I mean attacking like I mean attacking and I don't want it downplayed cuz don't be on the receiving end or that [ __ ] or whatever be no they were on 10 all year on 10 and it was crazy and again it was a lot of racist [ __ ] especially the talking points that came out of green parties his VP or whatever towards black people and [ __ ] it was insane and was not trying to say nothing about it because like I feel like not for nothing so many of these people who like are so annoyed they be so annoyed with who they want to call Blue mag or or you vote blue no matter who and all of this and they act like oh y'all are so committed to this party that y'all don't want to criticize them or all this but that's the they do the same [ __ ] times 10 on a party that has not done [ __ ] while they saying crazyy things and doing all this N Stuff and I just felt like is a lot of i l it was a lot of hypocrisy and that dis election was a lot it was tough but I don't think those I want to be clear I'm not blaming third party voters and any of those people for why comma loss I don't think that is the case I'm just saying that I think there's been this like desire to want to be like Oh I'm going to do this and it's not my fault if she loses and the them lose it's that fault you have a role in that you're not absolved from that like when now when everybody's right to getting like stop you do not get to opt out of the consequences of your choices that's all I'm saying like I'm like yeah I get it KLA not the best Democrats not the best we know that we all know that but this idea that like you can decide that you think you're going to spite the dams or you're going to show the dams and all you're doing is showing us I I don't like that's what I that's what I'm fed up with like punishing the the dims I I've seen that a lot and I'm like that [ __ ] that don't work I mean there is no way there is no way to punish The Establishment unless you destroy the establishment so they all go out to eat together after this [ __ ] anyway I mean she like they not not KLA and Trump but in most elections folks are like oh that's my friend right like I mean we did witness with KLA like like KLA called Joe Biden a racist and then was like oh yeah we've been friends for years I'm like okay politics that's that's what politics that's what it requires and I and I think like and the green party was doing that [ __ ] in Reverse like the green I swear I swear to my God I I have said it listen y'all Ain never y'all ain't never hear the end of how that but was my biggest fan all year he BEC as the VP nominee and he R the place talking about how I'm a fraud the ancestors the me and [ __ ] I'm telling you [ __ ] mad I swear to God I should put a billboard in time can see how that [ __ ] was talking about me I'm sorry the ancestors is crazy the ANC said mitochondrial he said Harriet Tubman Angela Davis and Bell hooks disavow me child is Angela love B Hook and how do you know what how do you know what Harriet and Bill hooks got to say I didn't no I don't know N I don't know but I don't think all I don't think all the I don't think all the dead black folks work as our individual ancestors I don't know so I don't know how you spoke to them I don't that that was had me laugh is like all election season was telling me I'm an like he he was on some real 80 [ __ ] oh I'm other I'm this I'm not a black American then all of a sudden you're black American at that they my ancestors not they my ancestors just conveniently to disavow me that was crazy I was like wait which is it are my other or are they my ancestors I'm sorry that is actually wild to me like I I didn't know that was happening and I'm like that Des Sean I'm telling you you was on the internet you would have seen some real you don't know they was giving it up crazy around this [ __ ] they try to get him up out of there recently and the man end up being and they know I thought was funny too he's he's anti he ended up coming out he's uh he's transphobic and he wants an abortion ban right saw that and then once we put that out then all of a sudden these same green party who've been acting like KLA Harris is responsible for Palestine the VP all this time they suddenly they was like oh he's the VP he's the VP pick you know the VP don't determine policy or anything now I said look at this you see what I'm saying it's the hypocrisy of it all is what I'm saying like it's the hypocrisy pivot yeah no I mean yeah I I I agree with that completely if your your VP pick especially in a non like um bipartisan party right like right like VP picks in in Democratic and Republican parties is very very political but if you're gonna pick a VP in green party like it don't you don't you're not working by the same rules so I absolutely will believe that your VP represents your views like sorry I'm gonna believe that because you don't have to play by the same rules that the Democrats and the Republicans do so if you didn't CH like if they don't represent your views why did you not vet this person before long before you chose them as your VP like I just because he was the black face and he ain't even we don't I don't know this black face that way and and and and and then we just recently saw we just recently saw um his um the the endorsement kind of from Donald Trump with um Jill Stein and that's that told me all told me all I need to know oh you see the whole is yeah he said uh I think Trump said oh this she's my favorite politician Jill the people are before the election no they was giving I'm telling you you desan if you was on the internet you would know them was giving this is not internet because people are mad and it just does not make any sense very very unw like and it doesn't make any sense to me and I'm just like I yeah that's why that's why I touch grass that's why iass I love my Lord that's why I'm about to get I've been St Twitter but I I literally don't stop fully stop using Twitter like would only have Aaron like tweet out something for like promotional but then I used it for for the election last night and instantly today me I'm telling you when I go on Twitter now with smaller platforms you the minute they see me tweeting it comes an opportunity in their mind to try to like quote tweet me bait me into something if I don't engage them or I block them or something they they then they trying to make content out of attit too because they trying to like get following and [ __ ] off of you like I instantly some little [ __ ] did that today that the little boy follow me the soon as I'm not on your run I don't want to engage you I block you then they know you a liberal this you that I'm like you know what let me get the off this m like I don't need to be here with these preserve your mind preserve everything they don't need all of that listen this is going to be stressful enough people are going to be on the internet saying all kind things as soon as I saw a little bit of something I got off I I I'm tired and I really want to preserve all that I have because I'm a person too I get to be sad about the outcome but I also know that this is our this is just what we have does that mean that we got to stop fighting no but also does that mean I'm about to be letting people drag me on the Internet or require things of me that I have I'm not going to give them absolutely not I'm going to definitely like I wish I can get off the internet but that's just not my ministry right now but it will be I'm in the block Ministry so so I'm I'm up the street um so soon I will be off the internet hopefully and just be able to get on YouTube and come off I really want to delete my Instagram um but that's just where I'm at with it I I'm just tired of people um on the internet I I'm going I'm leaning more towards people in the streets now and just going back to loving the physical person to being out there giving myself more into my society and my home because I love my home and just doing more of that because I I just feel like this thing right here Will run me ragged it it will run me ragged I think these apps need to get rid of like especially like YouTube when you think about it Netflix don't got no comment section you don't go on on your you're not typing on your streaming services you're not there engaging in [ __ ] you think about it so it's like why do creators on YouTube and these places have to be subjected to abuse and these apps intentionally do not set up like they do not try to protect the creators I truly don't understand why like I I can't just upload my content and not have to have these comment sections and the way they do these the algorithm is to incentive advise you to have it like oh if you don't have the comments determine how much engagement you have and how much they going to put [ __ ] in the algorithm and [ __ ] but like if I realize like I could I turned that comment section off on that video today and it's almost a 400,000 views let me find out I don't need this comment section and I've been misled because I'm always seeing like I have mad videos that have way more comments than a a popular video you know what I mean and stuff so I'm like I'm starting to believe it's a scam and let me find out I could turn these comment sections off oh a lot of people do that they they post a video and turn that comment section like me turning off that comment section on that one video I had to go like when I tell you all these Republicans like they they are harassing me by the Thousand today and they are literally going on my other videos just trying to be like oh you thought you deleted your comment section trying to beon I'm like now I got to hold comments on all the other videos too because now they looking for a place to be ridiculous I'm likeed sending me emails like I'm gonna kill myself what is this like leave me alone [Music] [Music]
