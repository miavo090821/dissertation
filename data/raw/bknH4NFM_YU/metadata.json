  "title": "Noah's Show | Noah Humiliates a Neo-n*zi and More!",
  "description": "This is a re-upload of last night's live stream. Someone saying he was a \"goyper\" (read anti-american scumbag) showed up to debate. Of course, that's no big deal for us. He was handily demolished, in proper Communist fashion. As per usual, though, this grown child proved his movement is made up of grown children whose brains can't function after they leave middle school, and his obvious set-up devolved into a grade A temper tantrum and cry for attention. So we are re-uploading without the temper tantrum. Enjoy.\n\nThe Noah's Show Promise:\n- We will always be a 100% bozo-free zone. Bozos get the same treatment the bozo last night got.\n\n- Addendum: we now have a zero tolerance policy in regards wizards and/or magic spells. No wizards allowed.\n\nCheck out our Publishing Press books and journals here: https://www.midwesternmarx.com/books.html \n\nIf you enjoyed our video please consider checking our website out : \nhttps://www.midwesternmarx.com/\n\nAlso, if you are interested in helping us fund our project become a Patron : \nhttps://www.patreon.com/MidwesternMarx\n\nCheck out our online library for FREE books on Socialism, Philosophy, History, and more:\nhttps://www.midwesternmarx.com/online-library.html\n\nListen to our Podcast on Spotify:\nhttps://open.spotify.com/show/3Dv6DvcOuSXQ5LhmA1YCPa \n\nFollow us on Instagram: @midwesternmarx\nFollow us on Twitter: @MarxMidwest\nLike us on Facebook: @Midwestern Marx\n\n(Music credits: Track: \"Stomp Clap Rock Rap\"\nMusic provided by https://Slip.stream \nFree Download/Stream: https://get.slip.stream/MeA8IB)",
