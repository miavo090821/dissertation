a lot of black women don't realize that they're attracted to masculinity and maleness but not to the man those memes and Tik toks about like when your girlfriend mad at you for being right that is emotional harm us as straight men are conditioned to that's what I got to be that's why I got to Aspire to be in order to prove myself as a masculine man it wasn't until I read about love being a politic the idea that love is supposed to be reconstructive figure out how to love me the same way I try to figure out how to love them but I I think it's really interesting because if this happens when straight people are around individual career folks then that means there the grammar actually exists you turn around and you say all right you know what God it's 2024 life is crazy you know let's see and then they have the audacity to be like to tell you to your face I'm the pride I think that's some of the most destructive debilitating like keeping people from Finding Love things that they're supposed to come fix come ready come all of this and I'm like life is a constant constant evolution [Music] [Applause] [Music] today's episode of Olay and friends is brought to you by rayon that's

and Flo Millie for getting pregnant so let me let me start off by answering that before I say so Flo Milly I don't know FL Milly is doing I didn't even know if they matter I'm GNA get to that I didn't know if I was like are you bloated are you fooling us what's going on here I don't know why you would do that I they'll get to it but Sky Jackson is because Sky Jackson is a little Disney baby um and I guess this that she is pregnant for like he'd be dogging her out she would I guess she met him writing like prison letters he'd be like yeah he'd be doing like [ __ ] up [ __ ] like online like CL he got hacked I be like Sky the little yes little Sky stressing her out I don't know where she got this from but I'm telling you and I feel so bad for and I I feel bad for her CU now people giving her the hle treatment where they act like they so concern for you that they bul you in the worst of times like I'm like she's a pregnant young girl it's not helpful for y'all to add on it like oh what the you done did I'm sure she's trying to cope with her decisions likeo red hair what going I can't this Disney [ __ ] like making little comments about her like dead friend he's he's he's he's bad oh wow rich girls need to leave prison alone I never saw how were they finding each other that's my question never got it he look like kid from kid and play son for real wow I was expecting at least see like one of them young YN y I was expecting at least see a dude I'm like well at least I see the appeal if you into that type of aesthetic this dude look like extra from High School Musical name is y YY y that's also part of why people are mad no sayy no that's his name you guys hit me I just didn't even said I didn't know my niece was pregnant but one day I don't have a Drake on this show is when you bring this up great thank you is he a rapper at least we don't know he's she asked said she met him writing prison letters you ain't heard me pen pals and prison but how dides she start writing a prison letter was she part of black and pink like what going on you just you found a random he was because he put his hands on her no he was just in jail was writing lce to a jail that's what let me don't say that let me don't say that as a defensive journey I like how that sound wait we got cornbread a little bit let me matter it's a specific brand of doing [ __ ] like it's not ca he is in jail there is there is now I will say I will say going shopping in the dating pool in jail is a little I don't know why you would do that like I am not not sure no the the only I asked was because before she was spotted pregnant um the roote reported well it's flashing back to when um she actually was arrested because she was pushing her man more than once in August so that was a few months ago oh yeah she was being abused and so she was she was to every part of what that little boy be saying whatever have you I'm like what that is a pregnant little tiny girl what is and I've seen how that talks about her online and have you seen the pictures they took her the other day where she's outside pregnant and like TMC don't have no respect for nobody and is visibly rowing this pregnant little girl stressing her to [ __ ] out you could see in the photos so is this the guy that she was supposedly beat on yeah so that's what's confusing me so get let me get this straight light bright y YK prison right he called the police um millionaire actress prison Bay that he somehow got a letter so like this is I was talking to my cousin about this type of stuff the other day and he was talking about you know cuz he was in prison for a while and he was just like you know there were girls that were right me they were the come up girls like you knew you wasn't you got out maybe you have a couple little sex but like or you could use them financially and this really look like a comeup sis that done got manipulated and now he she pushing him back because he probably saying some dirty ass [ __ ] if he's saying that [ __ ] on Twitter or on social media what's he saying to her face and then he had the nerve to Gaslight her and call the police cuz he was pushed and he probably in her house she pay the bills this incident happened way in August though was she pregnant back then well it takes nine months to have a baby she pregnant hown right now okay okay like so I'm I am and yeah she was because they reported at the same time like they they spilled the news to like she told the police that she was pregnant and then the news reported it when it wasn't supposed to be all public okay so when they took her on Facebook he said I'm salty I got this dumbass Disney Channel be we pregnant I hate oh Jesus yes serious I'm sorry on Facebook is the the craziest part about this whole sentence to be honest but um yes and let me just say let me add this to the picking out your men who are who are actively in jail or prison right now as someone used to have to listen to the listen to the calls right like listen to all you know the call law go through or whatever nothing would blow my mind more and I mean religiously religiously that reikers with mad [ __ ] and cussing them clean the out I mean on the phone mad talking to everybody like life or death situation like carrying on with everybody meanwhile it's mad [ __ ] like like and and different energies fall it so a lot so so much has um gone on since we just said it so I just want to um somebody summarize it for me um so this little girl she Sky Jackson actually like you were saying uh she's you know millionaire billionaire I don't know coinage um Disney legy as you know and here we are so you're telling me that she met him outside of the gilm so she was you know you know her little boyfriend and he went in and she continued to write she met try to see I'm trying so hard not to believe that I didn't I said that's not what my ears heard but like was she part of a volunteer organization they of it Offa the writing how you find can I reframe something real quick because I we because I think we're all thinking it and we have to delicately get in here right so like I do want to say it's just because Sky Jackson is smaller than him if she's battering him then she's battering him however why is she with him like with DG G is it ddg g whatever Haley's baby father like okay so he's not on her level and he maybe not that cute you that that never bothered me at all I thought that was all just internet shade Lord Jesus but this dude is he has three other children from what I just Googled stop stop Rebecca wait oh no there more children oh my God three other children he was in prison when she found him this gu he's not uh any type of other entertainment industry thing this is just a this Kevin fine adjacent is what this is which forces me to Circle back to Sky who if we're if I know more about Sky than I probably should partially because like my wife was a fan pointed out way back when she was a in a Band-Aid commercial so because this is like she also got didn't she have this a similar run in with um Salange son or something wild like that yes cange son I remember like I think he like he did something crazy like put out her nude or something something really fed up yeah Sal s did something crazy let me find out the specific cuz child actress woman honey much like Britney like child actresses be [ __ ] up um and like I and so I'm just trying to figure out what's like if there's more if there's a if there's a reason we should be more concerned she she's a little aggressive maybe but maybe she keeps picking these guys where she feel like she got to fight maybe um or she's okay with that bad boy cuz why are you searching for a man in the jail mean if y last [ __ ] sent Y show news to the whole internet I mean there's some Trauma from that alone you know mean and that was that wasn't a jail that was Salon son yeah was some that was rich no she has there's something going on yeah he a private like a private video of her cuz apparently she had not not that there's any reason for it but yeah but but you got to think about that though if you Le a private video of a Disney girlly nude that's her whole career like you're supposed to be innocent ear that's not just a nude that's that's a hit absolutely but he's salonon so you know we got you're right that up historically these Disney girls don't have they have a clean look for so long and then they get in with the most like they don't want that anymore so I that's cool about women in real life they go thing is like we looking at it in the Disney vacuum but that's true about women in real life I don't even got to reach my hand out too far to I I have three examples off the top of the Dome and my personal life real close like women do that every day like choose n like you're FedEd in so many ways right like you're fed as a young girl to like bad men like you're you're taught that like oh what how they like you is whether or not you know they being mean to you they believe you teasing you and everything that you watch the the handsome who's who's framed is the cool guy the handsome man is good who's being you know what I mean like that like so it's like it is like when you doing that era to believe expen women are not taught like when you think about it right women are not taught to be girls girls and women are taught to like see themselves in competition inherently with other women so there's something like you notice it listen to music listen to women talk listen to what all you see it all across the world of of women feeling like it means something about you it's personally affirming or validating to you the idea that you got man who ain't no good in every other capacity to every other woman but you're special so you changed him it was different like it you see it and when I think like oh how women I know when all the girls of my generation I don't know what song did it for her but I know when Lloyd had Southside when when when a Shanti they needed to meet him on the South Side everybody wanted them a hood like not me I always knew I couldn't hang me I had you know I I from South Florida my man had to have dreads he had to have all the things you know he had to be a touch of hood had to be Caribbean with hood it it ain't right it was all wrong um but I say that to say um you know we all have well women we can say that we have our history with choosing people who are not the best and I I go back to that vacuum of Disney because when I when people see me I'll say this I ain't no Disney girl but you know I grew up in the church so for me I was supposed to be matched up and um somebody had posted this online and they were like you know they teach you to be like 19 and looking for a partner so in my mind I at first was like I'm going to go look for me a man but then as soon as I got a little bit of Florida A&M University you I know I'm always gonna mention every show but when I got a little bit of that I was like you know what I can have like a light skin a dark skin an African in between all all of them right because they have them all over the campus and I can still live my life and love the Lord that's website I I get it I understand um she's in never got the opportunity I guess to spread her wings so this how she's going to spread her wings she went really deep in it but I think here the reason why I say that is because we see a lot of these people who are on these shows made to be princess like in front of our face so we naturally like you were saying ol we want to nurture them in some kind of way right all of a sudden act like we auntie I have not seen skyt in years um but when I see her when I see her though I'm like oh she's so beautiful she's so adorable but seeing her pregnant does it shock me right now in 2024 no but to see who she's with you know for me if I had a bag at the My Generation if we if I had that much of a coin um the guy that I would choose I say this and maybe this is not true but I am beyond that age but I would not choose and be right in a man from the jail but that's when you have a bag is exactly when you be you become convinced that you could have whoever you want you know what Ian think about it like think about how many rich women you can think they all Mary Wendy all of them I can think of gener and generations and generations epic you're right yes it's a real thing of thinking all right cool I don't have to like because think about it I feel like women being in two groups in terms of how society makes you feel plagued you either feel like you're searching to get what is an elusive Rich successful educated man that you feel like are in limited Supply or you go ah I'm successful enough for what I've heard that I can be with whomever I don't have to you know what I mean and that usually allows you some latitude to pick up a who you might not have no business with girl I think this it's more like yeah I'm I'm sure I only know the I mean G do the same [ __ ] cuz you feel like you know you go up you like you want to get you a man who's a man's man the more masculine crazy fool right not the little soft cute boy over here who probably gonna take care of you and do the right things and then like you know even me I got my first little bag was like oh I can afford a little Hood he can't destroy my life it's great go back home and as you see on the wall I had to go give me a nice little soft Butch Queen and get my little engagement ring had to get my life you know but you think you can do it particularly when you got a bad you got a little bit more success you think you're immune to their BS and you don't have and I think the other part is like the lack of mutual commitment because you know they really not gonna be down for you but now you got your coin so you ain't worried about nobody being down for you you down for you so it's a really interesting thing that I think the people that desire men are shaped to kind of deal with their different iterations I mean it's kind of almost like moving like a straight man like when you think about it yes it's is being able to to embody that uh because you have the monetary means to like almost in a certain way that's why I think it's such an interesting uh perspective because I guess you're right it's like especially on the on the fem side when your partner is you're taught that it means so much and it becomes such a reflection of you to be able to say I'm I'm fiscally independent enough that like yeah like I don't need a partner that makes more than me or like my it's kind of like Chloe and and ddg right like we don't look at ddg and think that that is the income that that H Chloe or yeah yeah I knew what you I let you have uh we know H is the bread winner and like that kind of that that gender Dynamic is in a weird way kind of also empowering I can see that so but still these like that's the you get you a hood at least get a hood a desirable one you don't got cleaner I a want to say it I'm just saying you don't know what this doing in the bed he just got out of prison too so he got some P up [ __ ] you don't know what type of game he G in that bedroom being a 22 year old girl is so rough because it's the oldest you ever been dumb you're a she 22 like I feel like I've said this before I I feel so bad for 22 year old me when I think back to what made sense to me like the kind of things that felt like big enigmas like when I think about me and all my girlfriends at 22 doing like these big deep dive assessments and whether who obviously didn't like us liked us like you know what I mean like you think it's you think everything is so much deeper than it is you think you're the oldest and more mature than you've ever been like like when I see these things I'm just like and everyone's like I don't care it how I was like you've never been a 22y old girl doing bring that up and now I'm starting to remember things I've suppressed I Liv in New York I moved to New York child and I feel like damn I was dumb also I have been somebody who and I've shared this already but I have been somebody who benefited from having an abortion um in my life thank God that there was no law prevented me from doing that cuz then I'll be trapped with the hood dread I was telling y'all about now he's like a baby daddy of three and I don't even talk to him no more no offense to that man because I thought I was in love um but I was I was at that time but 22 in New York and what I was doing was out of control and I really thought that these guys because I was so young um I really did think that the police officer loves me he loves me you know he he he's picking me up at night taking me to all these little he just he loves me girl can I say something that anom me this why Hoes Be winning suan said that she said that someone in s she say you know be you about to be a hoe you know you made a hoe out of me now these men are doing these to these women ripping them a new one I feel like maybe they're not going to last like ddg and hlee we thought not we because I knew I said I look at I just didn't think it was nice to to me to scream it from the hilltops at her I can't say she's a child she's a young young young woman and she just been this is like the oldest she's in her actual adulthood and when she's like 24 or something like that also really sheltered and conservative if you I mean Jon ran off with with Bobby Brown you know so I get it yeah was Wild One in Bobby Brown who ran off with Bobby hold on I Janet Jackson and Bobby Brown her daddy said no the F you not Janet ran off with Bobby Brown why I didn't know that she was with Bobby in the like early on but her daddy said this broke can't no that's a hood get him out of here he didn't want nobody to do a was it re when she left with that man but anyway said J you're are very rich honey no she's Rich my daddy my daddy was big on that I like my dad well my dad first of all my dadd want nobody around his daughters let me let Rebecca go no for real no that's my dad now he's like so what are we doing are you I remember one time I went home and he's like um first it was no first it was what we call as Haitian kids um La that is home school in a church um that my daddy ain't even go to but um it's like we that's how that's how we were built around and then finally like you build your Escape Plan mine was going to fam and when I went to fam and I would come home and and after that my dad was like okay this little girl she think she grown she going out and stuff coming here coming here and going out and then coming late in whatever yeah going to see the um and then you know when I got older it was like now Rebecca okay you're about 28 now you know what's going on one time I came home and he was just like me and your mother want to know are you I'm like what cuz I had shaved my hair off and I was rocking a cute little you know my dad's like are you gay I'm like no no I'm not this is all the rage the kids are wearing their hair like this now um no but I say to say like when I was that like I don't when I look at a sky who I think is beautiful but her being phys I want to go to there because I told y'all on few episodes ago on Olay and friends you know there were times where I felt like I had to be with this person and the things I would say with that physically abusive person at some point was stupid stuff like you know if he don't really get upset is do he really love you like and I got that from social media if he don't really like girl he get a little jealous do he like he let him get a little jealous me and him go back and forth but he always going to know her home at like what are indoctrinated to like toxic like we just are it's fed to you everywhere like in every you watch it's just it's just hair is a toxic and I promise you was nuan and the whole show you but but I don't I don't know if I where where where is that where is that coming from like where no no no no not like your actual experiences I'm not try to when I think about when I think about the images of black love and like what is attractive about men and black men so like there is a thug erotic that has always that has been there for a long time right my wife really liked DMX I was like baby you so lucky you met me first you know what I'm saying right so there there is neurotic there right but overall like the the the at least for me growing up the heart throb dour was Denzel Washington oh yeah yeah no no no I didn't say they're Hood I say they like toxic toxic all Aesthetics and loveones is a toxic I love your video see selling me on Love and Basketball but that's still a toxic [ __ ] okay like Bank I see how it's like is the excuses we give hood or like metag General right uh like especially I think in the black community where it's like black women are expected to like hold down black men and like see any sort of shortcomings they have as like systemic more than or to to to to Veer it towards systemic or he's tired because the white man is putting him down rather than like trying to ask for more emotional vulnerability or accountability uh and like through that since you're expecting I'm think about that Nicki Giovani like James Baldwin conversation right like think right getting being used to getting somebody at their worst forces you to like create all this type of compart compartmentalization uh about like what the standard is because when I heard Rebecca say like oh like do he love you uh if you don't get a little mad a little jeal jealous I like for a second I like where does that come from exactly because like on the other side of as a man I'm kind of told to keep my emotions to myself right like to even be uh mad as a man is kind of is is kind of a little sus even though that's the only emotion I have uh access to but then when I think about it from the other side right it's like if you know that can happen you gotta let other people know as as the resident hood on the panel I can I can tell you that what I was trained was that uh anger equals masculinity and by extension it equals protection if he going to get mad at me imagine what he going to do when another come sniffing around and decide to lay hands on you that's just the price that you got to pay for having a man that's half a man so that's that's how what I was trained to believe growing up so I believe that's probably part of it no that's I think I think I think I think Tao hit hit it on the head and I think back to let me let me get all let me get all cornbread with us for a second uh their eyes are watching God and teacake yeah um like I remember having like some debates around that I was like look are we gonna interrogate like how zoril Hurston speaks to Teak's abuse and like fond like like Amorous uh tone and like the how that carries because I had never like I had known about that book forever and it wasn't until I read it that I knew that was a part of it and I was I was confused especially like as a buring just learning about a lot of this black feminist thought stuff and that kind of like you know it wasn't it was engaged with but it it didn't it didn't present a uh a conflict and some of the people I was talking to about it um if I get no I get that because you're making me think FD about you know the the coraly story to that which is uh Paul D and beloved right and we have a man who's been enslaved who's been beaten and comes to setha and setha is worried about her own Beauty and if she's worthy and he says you know you are your own best thing you know and he talks about her and he begins to trace his fingers down that scar down her back that the whipping that looks like a cherry choke tree and he talks to her and he says you know uh she she knows the best of me she takes all these parts of me and she puts them all in the right order right uh and so you get that with TKA you can you get SORA kind of being in a weird fetish almost kind of way about this kind of like the weird strength of black men what they can handle but then you get Tony Morrison coming in and showing you this black man who's experienced brutality that none of us can ever experience who of who In This Moment becomes the most vulnerable man in the room right in in the book If you will right the most loving and and then births that love or gives that love and tries to instill it into setha right after beloved has been killed and all these things so I think it's interesting because if you look at our literature there's always this both and but I think even to the point that you bringing up teacup right here there's this there's the reality that we have these vulnerable men these emotional men these human men right what we're probably really striving for here but they're never lifted up through the cannons of of black thought right whether it's black feminist thought or whether it's black queer thought or even R black political thought which is usually run by black men so I think it's interesting I think it's what B hooks is talking about when she talk right and and and I think Bill hit on the head where it's this idea of like you're trying not to show emotions so you're also seen as impenetrable right that you cannot be harmed and you stand as a warning for everyone else but so I think it's really interesting last thing I'll say I know we've been talking a l about Hood but I do want to be clear you know the audience we just talking as black folks we ain't putting all Hood a toxic box there some good Hood out there there's some rich that are more toxic than a hood can imagine absolutely I'm I said toxic I'm talking about toxic and they come in all Aesthetics and I think I think we're judging because we have a rich woman cause cause if if I'm gonna the the the Judgment I'm gonna down the hill of is that there is this like rampant fetishization of hood that doesn't get interrogated of you know like nobody's nobody they might do what we're doing and say oo girl why but nobody interrogate how that is why is he even a hood though that's my question we is he a middle class put this under the umbrella of hood but the why is really because I'm like why did she tap into the jail for this guy so my thing is maybe proba he'll be more loyal probably believe he'll be more loyal or or like for the same reasons I guess like it's the flip side of like how they were like oh these girls are like what bill was saying earlier like they come up in some way you expect him to receive you as that it's the same reason you give a try a chance that you thought were Ben you that were chasing behind you for a long time you think that they will appreciate the catch you know what I mean and treat you accordingly but what what only happens is oh I can her that's the level by which I can bag now not I'm the priz ass bro turn around because I just got out of one like that these menet tall and you know I'm an Amazon feet tall reaching with little dinosaur hands and I'm just like my goodness and then you finally say you turn around and you say all right you know what God it's 2024 life is crazy you know let's see and then you do it you give this person a chance and that's the thing you love them you love them through the Teensy BS of you know cuteness that you had to pull you love them you you just there for them and then they have the audacity to be like to tell you to your face I'm the prize them being the prize and think that audacity is beyond me and it's not only the guys that do it women are doing this to men good men right there and I think this I don't know where this thing came from um I don't know I don't know why I reached back for that because I don't know where I what I was doing in my life in that moment I toar pass I think what like B Hook kind of talks about this and I was about to bring bring it back up too yeah we all you know call is gonna come up but B hooks kind of talks a lot about how in the effort to like you know something she felt like was missed in feminism like feminist scholarship is like in the effort to like uplift women or into like decenter men you know like it makes people like some women have become scared to like address men or like try to or seek to understand men or recognize that if we are to love men or to be in relationships with men or in community with men it requires us to like understand them to try to you know what I mean and and I think on both sides that that's what happens a lot I think you see and we see it like we joke about it but when the the of the gender Wars every you know what I mean or remember when it was like waste her time 20 whatever waste his time like we've been in engag a cultural men versus women you know what I mean men versus women thing for quite some time and we only keep like escalating yeah exactly so I think that's what happens let me picky back off this because I think um the the awkward thing about it is that I think she talks about this in the will will to change maybe not in this exact language but w women are both um afraid to to speak in the men uh in their lives openly because of the harm they could face but also men do not have an apparatus to learn what true love looks like or like how to perform it like like like we we're not actually and and like I especially as I started to like engage in my own masculinity and like started to be more open I realized like oh to really care for a person I was not going to learn that from my barber like I I I trust my barber with like so many things but like he was not going to show me how to be consistently vulnerable how to show up like that's not things that like I am I'm given examples for in my male life and I'm also taught that my life should be predominantly masculine I should keep and the lessons men can teach me are the lessons that are worth learning so I do often wonder like when especially uh when when Bel when um hook says that uh yeah like it's hard both to open up to men but it's also hard for men to even vocalize or even have the apparatus to practice I think what they want off the Bell hooks but I think she says in in uh in the same John where she makes the point about uh about us being conditioned to learn how to love maleness over the humanity of men and to and going going back to that whole you know Hood aesthetic going the erotic Thug pona or whatever a weird condition to you know frame that as being you know bad boy and to fall in love with that very overt very obvious display of masculinity display of manhood and us as straight men are conditioned to that's what I gotta be that's what I got to Aspire to be in order to prove my in order to prove myself as a masculine man so again we don't know if this Ginger really is is hood or not but that aesthetic is something C elements there somebody maybe he's just an idiot I don't know with aood aesthetic I I don't I wonder what his chares were R this is uh this is interesting to me what you're saying Bill and also like what you're saying on color M because like I was writing a piece writing an article about what Bel hooks was saying and like reflecting on my own cousin this piece I was called black queer it's called sexual profiling black wordss on the run and it's really just thinking about how like often times I had I had this really uh fem young cousin will well older than me but I was like five when he came out and I noticed that like you know with the women he would they would like have him do different types of like feminine Services right he'd be like doing hair but they would talk to them about their men right and so he would kind of be the translator then we'd be around my uncles the my uncles would actually feel comfortable expressing their emotions and why they're stressed and what it is like you know about my aunts about my Grandma my my grandpa whatever too little 8-year-old will right now mind you they're still castigating him as housing sugar in the tank being this being that not being a real boy whatever and then when I grow up it's the same thing so particularly like queer men and like straight men friendships I think it's really inter and often times straight men feel this ability or even this imperative or prerogative to share their actual real emotions with another man that has not seen as a type of masculine or sexualized threat right and I think that women do the same thing with like Butch Queen or uh Mass fim on the on the borderline or fim men too so I think it's really interesting that when people get around queer folks particular like Butch Queens there's this one demand for emotional labor which we don't talk about enough but there's also this kind of portal where people are able to open up their own Humanity right because that often tells you a mirror of what you could actually be doing with self so I I think it's interesting because we've been we o kind of brought up what I call you know show about the gender Wars but I call this moment of straight people in crisis where y'all just be going back and forth with each other all day go the straights crisis again her War let me drink my tea but I think it's really interesting because if this happens when straight people are around individual career folks then that means there the grammar actually exists to speak about your vulnerability speak about your feelings to say what they it's not that people don't know how to say it's not that don't have the muscle it's the threat of rejection in the moment and I wonder when we talk about men because we talk about women a little bit what does it mean that we beat the humanity out of boys and then when we become problematic toxic Men We castigate them for being toxic and and problematic right this is how ra them as not just mothers but also as siblings as people that want to date them like we we demand this script and then when they perfect the role we say baby you're doing it too good you know so it's about to say it's not all castigation it's also reward yeah like as we as We complain about toxic men we also recognize that that toxicity somehow correlates to attraction so it's mixed signals it's mixed messages there's a lot of men that will tell you um some of the worst advice I've ever gotten was some morous like Mor house would have had me the worst in the worst way ADV advice get you killed right cuz cuz they were like because they would say like the most toxic like awful stuff and but they would say that and then I would see it work for them right and it was only my genuine like that just seems awful like like sense to not go that route and on the flip side some of the advice they would give would be like don't ever open up to a woman don't ever tell a woman Your Truth feelings and like that is not just like a manage for talking point that's a thing that many many black men will speak to that the moment they opened up that creates this inflection point in the relationship because as somebody I think it may have been not was Nan or Bill there was like a lot of a lot of black women don't realize that they're attracted to masculinity and mess but not to the man and that the way to that and that and a lot of men don't even realize that like we don't realize we we kind of start getting it when you hear men complain about their relationships at a at a certain level like sometimes it's just you know [ __ ] but like at a certain level those memes and Tik toks about like when your girlfriend mad at you for being right like that is that is emotional harm that is happening in a relationship so so right now there's this trend so like I said right now I just went through a breakup but ain't nothing that's I'm holding over my shoulder new [ __ ] who this soon but it's like I feel like in this time right now especially now that I'm older I'm a 34 year old woman so there's no games I'm trying to play with somebody I'm trying to be wife I'm trying to give my eggs crap what up for real I'm really like and it's a different place in my life than I was before but what I knew because at such a young age my first little boyfriend I had my first little boyfriend at 18 17 and I left him behind because I knew I was going to fam and when I went to Fam I'm like oh my gosh I can experience so much stuff that little boyfriend of mine um he was my first boyfriend he cheated on me and I was like nobody's ever going to cheat on me again you know ever again I love that you your first time get cheated on was college and I turned you into a demon me my my senior year of high school when I went to college I was like I'm dating them all I don't care who they are I'm everybody here Rea I have a question though for you cuz this this was like cuz I know that like queer and women experience be different but sometimes be hella similar like for me I did not really date before I went to college cuz I was like y'all [ __ ] are not about I'm not get caught up with you and then go to college and my little house of cards of success falls apart because of like what bill and FD were saying about being attracted to the masculinity and not the I knew that was I knew I was on that masculine [ __ ] like I knew that if I got entangled I might be in a trap house like I'm not I'm not going to be at Howard you know did you have that I can't get caught up with y'all this guy in high school hurt me and that hurt my feelings and then I know the girls is half of my friends had gotten pregnant when we we all went to fam not me so I said I'm going to focus on getting up out of here um I got caught up in in a little bit of stuff and once you know I got a little touch the stove a little bit I said no that's not happening because that will mess me up I be no I need to get out graduate yeah I was like uhuh so but when I got out that was when the problem happened now I was in the world and I started like being like you know what like just be free I'm a butterfly that's how it was and I just started like thinking about the conversation that you guys are all saying about your experiences with people all these things I'm like right now us the way that I was then how I knew I was protected of myself and where I was going to be but when I got out I don't know why I just was more so like all right let me just try somebody and then my naiveness in that moment was this person who may be so bad to everybody else he can see the good in me and I can like protect this person now I'm trying to kick out windows in the car because he locking doors we had this conversation on here already I you know like I try being in an abusive relationship I also it goes back to what you've seen I've seen that growing up my family seeing the abuse so now I'm going to go for somebody who may be a good father figure or a good person here but when they get just a little Improvement you know and and and here here it is next thing you know I'm looking crazy then I see who are great with women who put their hands on them be running up in their face cursing them out being Psychopaths and the right now it's glorified even more every day I go on that's why I had to block Justin Le boy because it was too relatable and I said devil get behind me because there is no reason why we are selling this to everybody and it's like oh you know um if you if you really love me pull up to my house no he's mad at you he's not pulling up to your home oh you know he going to get mad when I um post up his his friend in my in my stories but he know it ain't true where are we going with this because are you trying to what are you promoting now if you going to be in a committed relationship we got to move as such or if we want to be in a poly relationship move as such this is why and the guys that I talk to um they're all saying when they have conversations here's what they're saying oh you know she online this is what she is there's trust issues between us from everybody whether it's you know in theer community or within you know the uh the heterosexual Community we got problems and it's because everybody we're not trusting each other so I'm happy to the people who are married together loving each other but us out here it's nothing it's like it's really tough I know my there's good out there but it's really really tough because everybody is dating with like hey are you gonna hurt me or am I gonna hurt you let me hurry up and put this wall up let me like for a guy to tell me that he is the pride no wait wait Rebecca I think you bring up a good point because cuz it's to that point it's almost like dating is becoming more masculinized cuz I wanted like I was going to bring up this this trust thing right uh to tie back to what fet said the fact that uh you know Dusty basement slouse uh uh undergrads will tell you you know don't ever trust a woman uh right but I I also because I mean I bottom right you know like I I went to a state I went to uh University of Maryland which is is not that's a pwi I still heard that from this from in the same basement from the same black people but from uh what I also thought is well what do I also hear about on the other side of the gender binary AKA what does every rapper tell me don't trust don't trust your friends your the the ones closest to you is gonna be the ones that backstabbed you watch out for your family watch out for your friends my question is who can and I'mma just keep this to Boys Like who can boys trust and we speaking about this the Society of like mistrust and Trust communication where are we even being taught there are possible like good Avenues especially like I'm thinking like for my sisters like gen z uh like yeah good Avenues or good Rel us the answer Bill gave us the answer well I mean among men though but I think Bill gave us the the answer for men because the answer with men is that's afraid of you someone that knows what type of violence you will do if they betray you you can trust him right predictable I troots with you yeah I I disag I disagree it's so men trust a they mama that's why that's that joke black community it gets crazy saying this is a healthy thing I said don't get thought how much they hate M dat a man and realize he stopped liking you because his mama like you my m c like this you can't even do issues like with like because because their mama will be the I'm sorry because their mama will be the only person they can trust it does create the Avenue for those toxic really weird relationships between black men and their moms um I think black moms of boys have a very unique that's a very unique experience that is not talked about enough from a from a analytical perspective as a as a man who was constantly in conflict with my wife about these boys we raising trying to like be like baby you can't keep doing this for these little boys what can't do what can she do I'm not this little stuff like we we got into it the other day because my my oldest son had a project and she wanted him to redo the project and she was going to end up doing in my opinion half the project for him and I was like nah he made he did all this stuff with the project make him fix what he already has done because he took initiative to do that and and then and then take hands off and see what happens um but there's like there's a deep probably like gen uh what is it epigenetic deep epigenetic connection I think that black women have to Sons they give birth to because of the nature of what Sons end up being out in the world and I think vice versa that creates a lot of [ __ ] but I didn't want to stick there don't be have enough of their daughters can I just give like a quick perspective that because like there's something different cuz I I think that so many most of the black queer people that I know that identify as male their first abandonment was their mother right and I'm not saying that their father the father not being there was an abandonment but the first time you were betrayed by somebody you love was your mother and so I think that like maybe for straight black men that might be a different thing but I think a lot of people have end up having very toxic and trust issues because the person that they were most trusted with as with as a child was the first one to throw them out so I I think there's a very different relationship with queer men to their mother uh and straight men but I think your second point on that and I know you're going to say something else to this but I think to your second point on that I do think that is for both of us I think that does become the root of that toxic thing about distrust because the person that loves me most can say this one def defect about me is that means I'm not I'm not valuable then that messes with how I interact with dating and everyone else in the world and even how I value myself I mean the black career Community we're looking at an epidemic right of meth right and it's killing folks and often times people are on these things because they need to fill out of their body right they don't trust or have a positive relationship with their body because that is the thing you know whether they're desirable or they've had sex or whatever that's the thing that makes them disposable so I I think it's something that we have to sit with across right black manhood I think you know I I so so being raised primarily by a single mother what my mom did and and and I'm glad that Fe had brought this up and I think I talked about it in in a video I don't really remember but what my mom did and she told me was that she was explic she was much harder on me than she felt like she ought to have been specifically because I did not have a man in my life so it conditioned it conditioned me to be uh it conditioned me to be distrustful it it conditioned me to be hard it conditioned me to uh create this veneer of you know this masculine image of what was expected of me because my mom knew that this is what the world expects from you this is who they gonna want you to be you feel me you can't be running around here being you know uh you know little soft boy want to sit in the house you know and read books and do all that kind of stuff or whatever or whatnot because I you ain't a drug dealer yet like you don't you don't you don't get the privilege of childhood you don't get the privilege of ex right priv of Boyhood right exact from day one you got to know how to survive because if you don't this is what my mom said is the difference between me and the streets is I love you the streets don't care about you so you better learn it from me in other words in other in other words I'm going to teach you how to be a man so that when you get out there you'll be uh you'll be eligible for somebody who's looking for that specific type of masculinity that Society tells them is desirable otherwise you know you ain't gonna be no good so that just my two cents on that all all of you guys are saying these things you know and it's so interesting because when I was dating in the past it was like he got the general things that we learned right the terrible toxic things that we learned um and some things that we learned from watching Disney movies or whatever we expected like the woman didn't I feel like I did not date with I had this one thing that I thought okay the guy has to be this this and this he has to be these things and that's it and now that I'm dating even though some of the guys don't be no good so now that I'm dating I kind of look at all the aspects you got are talking about what's your relationship with your mama now there the ones that be the ones like you were saying anany it do be a little different with these ones they just too close even though if they don't like their mama they get with a woman they can't wait to compare but anywh who um you start looking at their um you know their relationship with their mom what they've been through in life so some of the things that I used to think were non-negotiables um like 10 years ago in the relationship that and now outside of abuse because you ain't touching me but um now I'm looking at it and I'm like okay you a little upset you're really not understanding like what where I'm coming from I guess let's tell me how to and me saying this you know I love that for me but like tell me how to make it better what can I do in this moment to help you out to help you understand or figure out where we're going with this cuz I can tell like you got some issues person like you went through some things and then there's you have intake form sis yeah and my question is how how how well are the articulations to that response in the beginning cuz I am somebody who uh when people figure out okay that's why I never tell people what I do but because I am very everybody loves me right on the outside at first but then when I have something to say about something then it's like hold on girl woman woman woman right please and then I'm like wait a minute now hey you know I can say this and sometimes it comes off as okay she's too dominant she needs to know her place I was told many a time like you are so beautiful you know how to take care of things you you are always like you take care of me you do those things um but you just um you're a little sometimes you're a little too hard and I'm like when when when it's time for me to step in and be that man sometimes I need you to you know pipe down a little bit or you always have a response right you always have a response instead of letting things be and I'm like you know I I remember he said I feel like I'm dating a man sometimes when we have an argument because you always have something to say and I felt so offended I felt so offended I was like how dare you after all and then sometimes I'm like okay what is he really trying to say is he trying to say that I'm you know he said I feel like I'm I might as well just be with a man at this point because that's how you making it feel I can't be a man relationship good luck but it made me feel like um you know I'm a little too strong and maybe I'm not feminine enough and maybe and you know but I'm like no I am feminine enough here it's just how who I am how I talk where how I present sometimes and then knowing that because I work in politics or because I'm a journalist hold on Rebecca but part of that is some [ __ ] though because the reality is a lot of don't want a woman let's keep it a buck a lot of don't want a Woman They want a pet okay and that's the reality the idea that like even the language that he used about like I feel like I'm dating a man the code of that is I feel like I'm dating an equal that's a point that's a that's a major point and I think that was the the point I was trying to get get to before but y'all was you know pouring into me and I appreciate that but um where like I said 10 years ago I would the kind of what they were trying to instill in US wasn't right and the way that we detached from that and then when I went home and I was like yeah I'm not really focused on that I want to focus on something else and D my parents at first were a little worried about that like why aren't you married why aren't you looking towards that and I'm like y'all I can't I've seen y'all I seen other folks I seen this I seen what I y'all don't even know what I've been through for real and I detached from each one of those things right and so now even in how I treat men um I remember when I wasn't good to them like just because I I didn't want them to not be the same way to me so I immediately was like they not going to try me those kind of things and then now I'm at a place where I'm more open to okay I'm dating somebody and how I treat them and then if it does not work for me I might cry a little tear but the sleep is had and I wake up in the morning and I'm like you know if I a date I can and if I you know um if I don't I don't have to um and I think the society has this way on the social on social media but in the real world I don't my real life that I live I'm okay with being single hopping online there's this idea that if you're single like you just ugly or you're just this or you're like you're missing out on stuff and if you are single after 30 you are dusty your eggs is dried up all kinds of stuff like or you you're a man you're no and it don't help that 25y old [ __ ] want to call you Auntie when they are a handful of years one called me an old chicken and I had to get her together like literally um and this is in like a comment section right and that's because people value that relationship and they don't like this is to your point back and we were talking about B hooks earlier right but she says and like I think it's all about love it might be the second one I know it's not New Visions but she basically says like we have to think about love as a politic right and love is about the mutual co-investment in each other's uplifting and not only in each others but also in the communities that you share and all the people you're connected to and so people will break up you know this petty stuff kind like you were talking about or even some toxic things because we see people as replaceable like Solo cups right disposable we can just toss them and get a new one and a lot of these I'm gonna go there I don't believe black it's supposed to be let me leave that alone but the point is though that often times people will see you to Rebecca's point being like either you're single or your relationship the question really is do you have a partner in love right you might be in a relationship but you do not have a partner in love this person is not committed to being like Oh what they said yesterday earlier today really pissed me off but let me sit back with instead of yelling at them and say what why did that piss me off why am I upset what is that and then let me come back to him and say hey Bae I needed a beat so I couldn't talk to you right then but this is this is this thing that you did that pissed me off and maybe it triggered something to me but what were you thinking what did you intend when you said that and and in this moment I'm choosing our relationship so this is the conversation I want to have so that we can continue to have a loving and successful relationship but that that's not what we do we we just want to have a partner we don't want to have a partner in love and that that's that's the problem and that's the thing we need to be promoting yes and I think that's true in so many like something I'll say like women I'm sure everybody does it but I can know I I be speaking to my life experience as a woman right is I feel like very often and I this was something I realized about myself and I think I've told this story before and I realized in Reading Bell hooks like many many years ago like um I was like I don't are am I trying to know these men as individual or am I even picking men based on like my individual love of who they are or do I have an idea of like a relationship I want and I'm trying to fill in whatever man there and I think that and I think like so often when I think about my 20s and my early dating before you think about these things and not just mine but my friends ownes too you know I'm like there are so many times where I don't think we ever even stop to ask ourselves do I even like this guy for real or am I just you know what I mean like in search of a partner I am looking for some level of affirmation I want the spot fill like sometimes you'll be like I can think of times in my 20s when I was crying about I know I didn't like like was giving me like the a the cringe but just the you know what I mean like the inherent rejection in this search for the partner or whatever have you you know and I'm like oh my God like you know what I mean like you'll realize sometimes like I have Partners I have ex-boyfriends where I'm like I don't I don't even like that person like I then even then like much less fck around like love them you know what I mean you realiz so much it's like it's about these other things you know what I mean it's so much so much less is not about the relationship or the person or really loving them I don't know if this is going to be controversial from the well let color my I don't know if there GNA be controversial from from from the male perspective but I I often I'm going put it like this so I've been I've been in a commited relationship for three years like you know it it it's rocking you know new masculinity we're we're good and I do credit with reading the will to change shortly before redownloading hinge for the success of this relationship mostly because um it was the not sponsored but it was mostly the idea of men are i i as a man was was bad at love because men on a whole are sensitive right we are taught to be sensitive and we are the most sensitive to rejection and often the reason why men are so guarded or or the rationale to be consistently guarded is because the more I keep my kayfabe up the more I keep my mask the less chance I have to fail and as far as I me when I'm 21 22 cuz like I I was living foolish but like when I was in relationships I was like day by day as long as I keep being this man as long as I keep being the person that I know they like me as this is adulthood right this is what I'm supposed to do as a man and it wasn't until I read um it wasn't until I read about love being a politic and and really more to the point the idea that love is supposed to be reconstructive like yes I I I should be open enough to let one person like deal with me like figure out how to love me the same way I try to figure out how to love them I know the internet frame words for what you're saying is like it's the problem with with what keeps being spread on the internet that you need to come healed you know what I mean like like fundamental problem that was actually having that conversation with my sister last night like I think that's some of the most destructive debilitating like keeping people from finding love thing this idea that they believe that they're supposed to come fixed come ready come life is a constant like constant constant Evolution like even who you're I'm like I'm not you can go through a million different things in this life and you will go through a million different different things in this life and transform it's about it's not about coming healed although you want to try and like we're always supposed to be trying to work on ourselves and doing this but it's it's about being willing to be in that partnership and allow somebody to see you and give you the space and the grace to like transform and to grow and to open and to like accept that like you don't come a great girl like I used to think I was the greatest girlfriend on earth right like to everybody to every man I've ever been with right used to think that until like I met my partner and I realize I'm a terrible Communicator like like you know what I mean like terrible like years and years of trauma and triggers like just not even not even from relationships just in like my own family my parents are the type of people to block you they get upset you will get blocked like swear to my God like I had to call my mother long distance the other day blocked you know what I mean like um and so like a lifetime of that has made me very like all right it I feel if I feel you think you're sensitive to rejection I was raised by like a little and I love my daddy my little misogynistic Nigerian Daddy but he had a bunch of daughters first so he raised me the same way like I was raised like to even hair like when I hear women talk about femininity or I listen to Rebecca said I like men I'm like I never I feel like I only ever had masculinity modeled to me and like having my mom I feel like my mom is somebody who would be angry at you because she's trying to like she believes you're supposed to be something that in no way has not been modeled to you and in many ways again I was raised my daddy is who modeled to me what we were supposed to be like so it's the antithesis of what you're calling femininity is received very negatively you know what I mean by my like I was never someone who like none of my sisters we have a bunch of sisters no one could tell you about growing up thinking about their wedding or blah blah BL blah it was we gonna be the head household D professionals blah blah blah and that's how I was you know raised and and and and brought up right there's something to what you were saying about like you know thinking the past you're the perfect partner y y y everyone else got all these problems like with my fiance we been the first five years now um I did not realize how toxic I was that I got in that relationship and that was the hardest thing for someone who writes about the politics of love and like black love and not black non disposability and emotional violence and all of that to sit and be like all these things I've read all the things I've been preaching these are all the damn ways that I am not showing up to par and that was so hard for me because of ego to note that like [ __ ] who you think you are you not and then the other part of it is and they still love you so what you gonna do do you love them enough to do the work and do you love you enough to be vulnerable to be like you ain't [ __ ] in this way but you're not [ __ ] in this way and that's why it's a little bit of a two-way Stree right because they got to make you feel like safe I always say like like for like my partner is very like everybody always says he's like a Golden Retriever and I'm giving him very much black cat but I I always say romantically I think I am like a cat like in a sense you get a cat and you let them and if you just get a cat to your house and they immediately go hide somewhere and they got to get the temperature right and even still don't move too fast on them after they've gotten comfortable I'm very like CJ had to teach me like oh it is okay for you to express your feelings here like I always felt I felt and I still have this like even though there my relationship is very like oh safe and blah blah blah but I still have that ingrained in the back of my mind that I have a quota system on how many times I can complain or not seem like the perfect partner or whatever I always have it in my mind this is being this is being stacked against me for someone to say you know what I mean and it took a lot for me to realize like oh I can really whatever the hell it is whatever emotion whatever blah blah so you know it's a two-way street because like one he had to make me feel that safeness but that required he had to force me to communicate like force me to realize like sit down talk about it you cannot just run out of this relationship and then when I think about that I be like damn if this is essential for me to have like I have an amazing relationship and this thing was essential and that was missing from all my [ __ ] before one thing okay that's the point like literally that I even in the last relationship that I was you know he tried it but I learned some things I literally was like Rebecca you can't block that man because I'm in the block Ministry I am in the block Ministry and as soon soon as something happened I was like I gotta this is absolutely not not at your height see that I was being disrespectful AAC there but but no but then I was like I would I saw that I'm always running when like I feel like I'm about to be offended rejected um set like I'm always running instead of saying hey this is my issue here so that whole thing you were talking about Olay online they do sell this thing where and I used to say that 10 years ago was come here so I don't have to fight your demons and it's like baby listen I thought I was healed I would always say I've done the work we I've done the work and then I would realize as soon as something triggers me baby I'm back to square one in this relationship I'm showing up as I that that problematic person that I was but I'm like okay as a grown woman okay some things relationships don't work you can walk away from it but I did learn a lot of key things of about myself and I actually was applying those things and he would say hey I don't really like that or or can you be like can we talk about it Rebecca you don't have to run and I used to like felt that offended me too but then I was like Rebecca you don't have to run sitting there and actually one time I wanted to leave and I just sat there we were in uncomfortable silence and then we talked about the issue and I realized I just needed time you know I want my man but I needed a little bit time to like process what I was gonna say so yeah that's why I love what Anan said about do you love do you love this other person enough to work on yourself because the actual point that I I feel like to to at least drive home especially to to younger people but uh definitely also to younger men for from really from my own personal experience is that we both oay and Rebecca have been talking about like I I've stressed and lost sleep on on that that I knew didn't like me right I I I'll be a I've also been in relationships in which I've realized like two months in do I even like this person or was I just ugly in high school and in college now and really want the validation of like being liked by this person you know and I and I did that like a couple of times before I realized oh wait I think I'm supposed to like want to like this person outside of how they make me feel normal and I also realize what makes a person likable to me might not be what I'm I'm currently searching out for because I'm looking for somebody that's going to affirm me rather than like somebody who I this where I get to a lot of men like do want a person that challenges them but not too much I often think it's like they get scared of what the challenge poses once it comes to them in real life and they don't want to rise up to that challenge but that is a when you feel challenged that's usually actually your mind saying like oh I like this person and and you're not used to that because you're like oh no usually I like that I'm a bit usually I'm used to being a bit B bored by my girlfriend I'm used to Family Guy and all these sitcoms being like my ball and chain that's not that's not how relation supposed to go you're supposed to be like to vulnerable with and that's really real too and like to to people marrying and and settling down with people that they don't even [ __ ] with like that because they have it in their mind that those aren't even supposed to be roles filled by people they with like that that be the real you know what I mean seeing men like actively choose to settle down with women who they don't like like that but they think embody the archetype of what a white woman Terror too though right people be with someone because that like I think some people won't be with someone because they fear to uh K's point that like if they're get with someone that has that challenge and if I can't meet that challenge does that mean I'm not valuable right like I I think there's an internal disposability that we have to deal with too FY what were you saying uh there's a couple things one thing is um I kind of lost it a little bit one of the things I knew I wanted to say is that so I've been married for uh 20 two years you've been married for 22 years old you you do not look like you I've been with my wife for 20 years we've been married for 14 years God damn not like you been I'm only we met at the we met in college um and like one thing I wanted to add with that perspective um is everything you all are saying now is version one of the challenge um and like people don't Bill smiling because you know because Bill married for a second too because like the thing that people like i' because I've made a couple videos about relationships and one of the funniest things to me is I feel like I've helped people realize they're just not built for monogamy or for like long-term relationships at all and like I respect that I don't think there's anything wrong with that and I think that's good actually because then you can be more clear about what's out there for you and what you're really looking for because monogamy long-term monogamy and marriage are difficult that those are difficult like institutions to consistently participate in because the the guy my wife met in 2004 is not the guy she married in 201 is not the guy she had kids with in 2015 right is you know what I'm saying and so on and so forth and and vice versa like we're parallel lines the the the the analogy I often use is your parallel lines and you um at some at different points in time one of y'all is going to beer into a different direction and you have to make a conscious decision to bend to stay parallel or you start to goow apart and when people and sometimes you can't right I know people have been divorced that have divorced you know because they couldn't been with their partner in the way they needed to and it was maybe okay divorce and maybe it was like the ugliest [ __ ] ever in the world and they not recovering they both been therapy the kids therapy you know what I'm saying and that's just the that's the game now I I'm blessed and I feel really good about it but I always put out there to people as you as you're hearing if you're hearing some of the things we're saying and you're like uh maybe not roll with that for a minute cause you are you are entering into what did I say in one of these videos I said some [ __ ] like like the these people that sleep with you every night can kill you like like that is that is you're letting a person in to your deepest darkest parts of who you are and it feels great to feel like that person's there solid but it's also scary and that person can say that one thing that one time that they weren't they may not have even thought about it that how that makes you feel but boy that'll hit you harder than anything that's ever hit you in the world vice versa they say that one thing when you're at a low Point you're like man that's why I [ __ ] for you God can I ask you a question about the FD cuz I mean as a you know you've been up in this uh relationship for 20 years 14 years Mary shout out to that blessings for that but you made a statement and you were talking about kind of like the difficulties both of like you know being married for a long time but also uh difficulty of like long-term you know monogamy and me and my partner you know we've been monogamous the whole time but I don't know if you've had experiences with both but do you feel like like monogamy is more difficult than because I feel like with us you have to have conversations now about other people while also keeping your household in a particular type of not of honesty communication is very yeah so I I know some folks I'm never and I want to be clear because I get this a lot I think it's just fans we are we are not non monogamous we are not non monogamous right now yeah okay DMS are closed DMS are closed they still closed two people two people it's me and her that's it I'm a jealous mother like could never said it could never never oh my it's so funny my wife didn't realize how jealous I was till like recently that's so funny after cuz I feel like I would have guessed that like that that would have been my guess was fully gives that CZ I'm CZ I'm a I'm a um a Hufflepuff golden retriever type oh no that's so funny you don't give that at all either you give you give Gryffindor sun with a Slither and moon no that's the Gemini I was going to say the I'm not jealous so far as like you know sex with someone else my partner does I don't care we talk about it but my thing is I would be more jealous of time quality time no no that's mine that's mine no my partner is amazing and a rare and a and a needle and a haast stack as far as these men in this world there's no way first of all everybody loves CJ like nobody my miserable and there's no one that meets CJ and doesn't love him he's just a gam there's no way on Earth I could let no woman play around with him and she not going to be out here trying like nope not happening not happening even the mayor the mayor thought laid up somewhere smiling would a [ __ ] would would drive me insane like I can't even imagine and God forbid it be someone you know how that go like I'm a I'm a row and Caribbean lady too like I could only imagine some woman who don't have to be with him that is the most Caribbean phrase to come out your mouth on this show listen and I said all the time I row all day CJ could tell you only I could I'd be sick to death about a [ __ ] who don't have to spend all day with him on his PS5 get being [ __ ] annoyed and she like I don't see why she prob you deserve to play a game and blah blah you know that like no way I'm not I'm not built for it like I can't do even rules I get it I'm not mature enough me neither a because I'm know everything's on fire in here um but says something about the relationship though said okay sleeping around see every what I was saying in the beginning you learn that other people's the the general non-negotiable when you get into relationship and how you relationship how you commit it's not you're non-negotiable anymore I had to tell a friend the other day she's like how could you and what baby because that doesn't bother me about it this is what bothers me but this thing in my relationship it doesn't bug me but this thing will bug me so you realize when you get older hey all that little stuff I thought if he and I'mma leave him and no that actually don't bother me no more I'm a grown woman this I'm I'm literally going to Left Eye this thing I'm everybody's house on this block is getting burnt down just because you live next door but says quality time quality time if he gives that up or if they give that up to somebody else that will bother you because it's like that's for me in your relationship that's how you guys you know iamy as a to answer an's question from earlier I I see anom monogamy as a bit of a cheat Cod cuz I feel like on one end like I because I know several people who are polyamorous or uh I have a couple friends they're all divorc now yeah all of them still together they together strong we talking about 10 10 years plus yeah with kids uh all of the ones that that I know that I know because more are and I won't know because you know everybody ain't putting their business out there right um and what I observe is they get to if they can accomplish that skill tree of not being jealous not being possessive Etc um they get to like be they get to not have to get everything they need out of one person that's right um and all they have to do then is manage that that you know that testy um Dynamic of I got to be honest I got to have good communication Etc with my partner with my partner my extra uh marital partners Etc and when they do that um they're good and when they don't do that do things I have you know heard some horror stories don't get me wrong but I've also people worked through them you know game but a different game so like it's it's a boundary game so like like shout out to all the ply folks in in the in the chat and in the uh yeah in the com I have I definit have some there there's a girl I don't know why her name is escaping me right now I follow her maybe her name is Gabby I think and she's paully and I feel like she like her relationship act and every time I see a post i' be like this [ __ ] is so much more mature than me like I be like like I love it like I literally read like what she's saying and I'm like I understand exactly what you're saying and it's so it's incredible ho I'm not there I like I like FB for bringing it in the space because now I can give my um you know my my crazy leftwing conspiracy theory about how we could solve a lot of these gender War things um if we could normalize homies in polyamor relationships with themselves and they girl we would solve a lot of like you remember that one Black Mirror episode when they when they playing like like the Call of Duty game don't know listen we say this all the time right like like [ __ ] love man right men love men around the man who we be talking about we be thinking about when people be like oh they should just be poly what's your missing fundamentally is they don't want a bunch of people honest they don't want honest relationships they don't want those women to be I'm just saying a lot of like what people be thinking would be solved isn't GNA be solved because these like the dirt they like the idea that I'm I'm doing this a moving like this it's not about you know what I mean like it's not like that's something that you have to work through too if you're gonna be in a nonog relationship and to be clear me and my partner are not pully right we're not dating other people we're not trying to have relationships with additional people uh we're not monogamous so if you want to you meet someone you have a good vibe y want to hook up do your thing right that's it that's done that's whatever but before this like I was in a poly relationship with this dude great great well now they identify as uh her she her but at the time great dude right and I actually loved it I thought I was going to hate it they had like seven other partners and I was like At first I like oh be really jealous whatever but then I realized that like you know what like if they call and I'm busy I don't got to answer the phone right now because there's six other people that have that are dedicated to their emotional well-being and they let me know that they're like hey if you're busy I don't want you feel like you always got to drop everything for me because there's other people I can call right and it took so much pressure off of me and even when I would go visit like on the sexual tip maybe I'm not in the mood but I also know that you could I don't got to do that I'm here because like my Essence is valued I don't have to check all these boxes but what I got with my current partner I realized like I actually I don't have the energy to have committed relationships of other people I'm too old now it was cute for my 20s I can't do it but I mean I think there's a difference though between I think people to be clearing the differences between being poly and then being non monogamous and then also just having an open relationship and for us the rule is like if you're going to hook up with someone I need to know right it don't have to be before it has to be after just so I can note that like okay what is going on what is the universe of our intimacy right now are there are there warning signs I'm not seeing are there things that maybe you're not aware of that I might be aware of so like that's where I'm at now but shout out to people that are paully I think it's beautiful uh but just to be clear don't be in my DM trying to date me I'm not yeah everybody here's in a relationship I'm fresh out of one but it was two years but dang it's so beautiful marriage just what black love looks like love is so not a monolith and how people date isn't but I do think that we all have this idea about the growth of what what it looked like before for us and you know I think that as we mature how we go into that and how we carry ourselves um um in that in that way and there won't be no ply over here because Rebecca I don't share my knowing listen I just I just feel like black love is so Redemptive and I and not just like as like a spiritual thing but like black people our whole life I think that maybe FD or o was saying this earlier right we always we never we always have to be perfect and we never get to achieve Perfection like in these relationships you don't have to be perfect to be loved and I think that's a beautiful thing you just need to be in process okay you got to be in the do your therapy I ain't dating nobody's not in therapy got to be a team player be be doing the work I don't expect you to have a ride if you believe you ared now I know you a [Laughter] liar oh that's episode that was that was good [Music]
