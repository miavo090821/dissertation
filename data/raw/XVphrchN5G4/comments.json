    "text": "Olay you hit it on the head at 57:07  . In my teens and early twenties I just wanted a boyfriend because I could see how having one accorded girls more social value. Like one of the first things people would ask me, from the lady doing my nails to a new cool girl I met somewhere was if I had a boyfriend and I could see their estimation of me calculating as I answered. It wasnt until was older that I actually started really wanting a partner and defining what love might feel like and what kind of relationship and person I could experience that with.\n\nAnd that kind of love is what F.D. Is talking about 1:10:16 that I have with my husband. Kudos to people who say their marriages aren’t hard but I think it’s really hard to stay on parallel paths your whole lives even when you are two individuals growing and changing at different rates. Love at that point isnt about ego or looking cute or presenting a certain picture to others, it’s constant decisions to care for eachother through that.",

I don't lol but I don't have romantic partners either, but from what I've observed from the outside looking in is that most people have other people in their lives that are close yet not romantic. There are other types of relationships and I think the problem with monogamy is that some people will throw all their other relationships away for that one romantic one - which is so unnecessary and can even be detrimental.",

I was a very jealous partner when I was trying to force myself to be monoam, but when I started to realize I shouldn't be trying to make one person fit all my relationship needs, and I don't need to fill all of my single partner's, it helped me not just greatly manage my jealousy, most of it turned into compersion. I'm also on the asexual spectrum, which means I don't have to worry if I just am not feeling sex, and my partner wants to seek it out with someone she trusts. She tells me about these things, just like I tell her about my romantic interactions with a friend that has been blooming lately into much more. And my partner of 8 years loves seeing how happy it makes me. All relationships take work, but if you can't openly communicate, then you can't do that work. It's step one no matter what kind you have.",

I can get in that although this may be an uneducated way to say it the little boys need to be involved in the wave of feminism. \n\n\nI have four male children and one female child . And I am watching in real time from my three year-old to my 17-year-old that I’m the only influence that is pushing any thought to them. Society, and all those outside of those who intimately know me and how I raise them teach them nothing but toxicity. My oldest son came into my room almost in tears because he was upset and frustrated at the thought that he’s going to be associated with “men” he expresses that the only way to be good, is to either except the role of the villain in conversation, be almost totally alone, or be complicit in the mess because he’s the teeny tiny minority. \n\nI hope that all the women who are participating in 4B and that will be thought leader in the next wave of feminism will include rhetoric for the little boys .\n\n\nA real quick edit; \nWhen it comes to my female child, she is a rough and tough bob you over the head. Tell you what’s up call you on your mess type of girl and I make sure that that’s not stripped from her in many ways calling her brother’s misogyny out in front of them and her loudly walking them through it standing over her shoulder with most Disney movies cause I don’t want her to miss out, but I also need her to know that Anna is a fool for both dating Hans and Christophe.",

He is a tall kid, mature for his age….as in he can sit down and have conversations with adults at 9 years old. She is raising her son to be a feminist through language, conflict resolution, and the real meaning of empathy. Recently, he was been teased by a girl in school. He retorted by making fun of her weight in classic school boy fashion.  I witnessed the most awesome conversation where my girl asked the boy if there was anything he didn’t like about himself. It went on from there, and seeing the boy put it together and think of other solutions…\n\nSome days, we are on the phone as she is living her life, and I see a woman who can NEVER stop. Whether it is mother/son dates, where he learns how to treat a lady…and also what a “lady” is…long conversations in the car about relationships and friendship….yes…and he is 9…he has so much to say about his little life, and she doesn’t miss a thing. \n\nI see parents like my friend, who sees her son as a full being….the. There are others who are attached to their sons in a toxic way, and will project all of their fears and dysfunction onto that boy….using him as an emotional stop gap. This is why so many of my male gay friends felt so much pressure to “be a man” for their mothers. They were not taught that they are already born complete the way God made them….they simply lack experience and perspective of an adult. Raising a kid is deep, af. \n\nY’all have my full respect. My kids are cats….lol. I’m just here as moral support.😂",

All this to say “attachment”, how we attach, if we attach to the people who are to care for us creates a future road map.\n\nI also have to wonder if the women who attach to men who are in prison also like the idea that at least their prison man is “faithful” not accepting that the same way he connected to you is the same way he connects with OTHER women while in prison, not to mention the men he can connect with WHILE in prison.",

In Halles case, it feels more like she relates to the YouTube come up of DVD seen as that’s how she got her big break. Less fetish and more like a grounding? Like she’s closer to where she came from w him. While Skai’s situation feels like she enjoys the stark difference between their lifestyles. Could be trauma from what she experienced w Solange’s son and his release of their s3xtape . Idk.",

The framing is off:  \n\n1) Why are young women intentionally making a choice to have sex with fertile men that they don’t want relationships with…solely for the purpose of becoming pregnant? If that’s the case are we here to understand their choice and help them do it better? Perhaps they want babies but not a relationship at all? Can we discuss how they can further transgress and make this work better for them?\n\n2) Why do they avoid or just don’t want healthy relationships? The conversation is clear that healthy men are few and far between while women are constantly groomed to accept men as they are.  So the conversation should be framed as: how to help women let go of patriarchal idealization.\n\nNone of them are choosing to be single mothers…and if they are then we can help them do it better and fully let go of the toxic dynamic with the guy rather than being shamed into performing a relationship that neither of them wants/and that is actually impossible because of men’s inability to feel and women’s inability to let go of a desire for motherhood.",
