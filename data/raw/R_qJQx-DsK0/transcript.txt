uh because obviously this comes from the end of september trump issued an executive order saying he's going to ban the teaching of critical race theory not only in the federal government but also via he's going to withdraw contracts from uh private companies that teach critical race theory that i get that have contracts with the federal government uh this this was an amazing uh feat uh when you put it into the context put it into the framing of the sort of battle of ideas you know whose moral structure should be put forward because critical race theory has a lot of presuppositions based built into it that are frankly antithetical to the liberal ideal of judging people by the content of the character rather than the colour of their skin critical race theory as you might well take from the title of it is entirely based on racial judgments and so trump ended it he said this uh i ended it because it's racist i ended it because of a lot a lot of people were complaining that they were asked to do things that were absolutely insane but it was a radical revolution that was taking place in our military in our schools all over the place we were paying people hundreds of thousands of dollars to teach very bad ideas and frankly very sick ideas and really they were teaching people to hate our country and i'm not going to allow that to happen now i've spent quite a lot of time studying critical race theory because it seems that this is the ideological lens that is the source of what we can call wokeness um and i think trump did exactly the right thing there the department of labor weighed in saying that the elimination of race and sex stereotyping and scapegoating and employment was a key civil rights priority of the trump administration and that they were going to root out ideologies that label entire groups of groups of americans as inherently racist or evil in diversity training materials by searching keywords such as white privilege systemic racism in sexuality and unconscious bias um completely correct this is exactly the right thing to do because critical race theory is predicated on the idea of raising racial consciousness among a certain racial group now raising racial consciousness was precisely what and i hate to go godwin's law here but it's exactly what the nazis did the very purpose was for every individual german to view themselves as a political actor a political agent because of their race so in all times in all places the the political german has become uh something that exerts power on other racial groups and it's the same thing for critical race theory the politically black person exerts power against the white supremacy and this means that all of liberal democracy has to be recast in a racial mold so liberal democracy itself is now not merely a set of ideas that happen to produce good results for individual citizens now this is an expression of the white racial consciousness and and basically it's a framework that is designed to exclude non-white people there's i've got many many criticisms of this line of thinking obviously i don't subscribe to this tool and and you can check out my conservatives guide to white fragility on the website premium content if you'd like to know more um but the question was is joe biden is his administration likely to overturn this executive order and it seems that it is likely that he will uh usa today reported that a joe biden administration would likely scrap an executive order from the trump administration that restricts the federal government and its contractors from offering diversity training that trump labeled divisive and un-american trump's executive order gets rid of it all blah blah blah one uh frank turner a partner with law firm mccarter english who represents the multinational contractors and small and medium-sized companies told usa today that he thinks it's highly probable this executive order will be rescinded in fairly short order and we have a quote from joe biden's latino agenda manifesto so he has racial manifestos and racial agendas on his website which i think is the sort of thing the nazis would have done again i hate to bring it up but it's i it just runs totally anthetical to how i think the countries ever all of our country should be run but um in it he said he will also reissue and mandate strict compliance with the obama biden executive order to promote diversity and inclusion in the federal government and as you can tell by the words diversity inclusion they are ideological words they are sort of shibboleths uh that the the activists can use to identify that they're on the same team uh if you say well i'm very much in favor of diversity and inclusion they will be expecting you to dog whistle it's a dog whistle uh they will be expected but it's it's it's not even just a dog whistle though i mean they they they use them in a way that they consider to be legitimate you know it for them it describes something that is definable um and anyway presumably this would supplant trump's proposed patriotic education uh that won't teach people to hate their own countries and uh and this frankly is bad news if biden does turn out to win for anyone who at least isn't a racist the racist will be thrilled this is exactly exactly the kind of reason this is exactly the kind of policy i imagine that people like richard spencer actually voted for joe biden to enact because raising racial consciousness was core of the alt-right's message which is one of the reasons i was so opposed to them and one of the reasons they hated me so much because i'm an individualist and raising racial conscious is explicit collectivism so the only people who benefit from this are the racists i wonder though do you reckon joe biden has thought this through himself or is it just the activists have witnessed for him i don't suspect for a second that joe biden really understands any of these things i think that joe biden has throughout the course of his life being an intellectual grifter where he's just been ripping off other people um from various other countries and other people's speeches and he's lied about his own educational achievements i think that he's just a fraud i don't know i mean i wonder because there's there's been a screenshot put out of like all the first things i'll do in my days of administration i don't know how genuine it is but the wording they used there was he wanted to rescind trump's ban on diversity training within the federal government i can imagine him saying that you know we should have diversity training it's a good thing you know that yeah nonsense but he would never speak in the times of critical he would never speak in the terms of critical race theory or saying he wants what is it the manifesto here to ensure political appointees including the president's cabinet um would be diversity heights ensuring racial diversity among clerks staffers and interns so he's going to have a lot of racial uh firms of action policies he's going to bring back critical race training and he personally probably doesn't understand anything of the philosophy behind it and the way that it's framed but he's going to hand it off to a bunch of academic activists who are going to be trained marxists in the term in the quotes of the black lives matter founders and they'll be allowed to indoctrinate people across all of these systems and it'll go as far as they can push it the only thing that will stop them is just where they've run out of money i mean this is happening in the uk for what i think tony blair brought this initially so it's been like 20 years well the the discipline seems to have been evolving quite rapidly i just mean when you start applying it through the the national government yeah i believe it was him who well i think peter hitchens talked about this where yeah it was him who first introduced that everyone working for the national government in the uk had to sign up for uh promoting i think was diversity and inclusion or diversity and equality you know some garbled word and that was essentially the first instigation of this sort of thing in the uk and it's been going for 20 years and it's not good like this doesn't produce any good results no it's been going for longer than that it was in the 60s and 70s this first came out of critical legal scholarship in the united states um this has been a genuinely long march that they have gone through through these institutions the critical race theorists came out of that um by the 90s by the late 90s it probably was in roughly the form that we recognize it now it probably had the the basic outline but there's been an awful lot of evolution in its own uh sort of wheelhouse to um get their own to get all their ducks in order get everything to be interlocked and say no everything's a white supremacy black people are oppressed that you know all of these things are aspects of the light conscious the nailing down of the hierarchy that white women yeah not really part of us and the rhetoric as well the yeah of course uh but the rhetoric as well the the angles of attack against what we could describe as normal discourse because what this is all predicated on is the idea that they have the ability to change the definition of the words that we're using because if they would say oh well you're a racist what they mean is that racism is a system of structural inequalities and oppressions that are going to be holding black people brown people down forever it's like okay but that's not what i believe you know what i mean you can't really accuse an individual of being a system you know it doesn't make any sense so if we allow them to redefine racist then calling someone a racist is no longer an insult you know they they have to they would have just called you prejudiced or something like this but they don't care because it's all about but they don't care it's martin bailey you know they they will use your definition of racist when i'm accusing you of hating black people my definition is the other one yeah we'll use my definition of racist when we're talking about whether we live in a fair and just society you know and so it's completely completely backwards but um but yeah it seems that we have ample evidence to suggest that joe biden will indeed reinstate critical race theory so let's hope those recounts happen god you can look forward to what was it were some leaks from i think it was the raf of uh what they were teaching the aria after do so they can look forward to people in the us military calling each other as a we have an article about that do we not yeah we do on the i don't think it's premium actually it's free yeah i think it is free article on lotus.com about uh the the wokification of the british military [Music] you
