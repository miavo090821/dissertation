The central idea posited by CT is that *everything* is ideological in nature. *Even science (math, chemistry, etc), according to CT, has been affected by human interests.* To CRT, science is also not independent and objectively unaffected from those interests, and there is *essentially no objective knowledge or truth.* But CT, CRT, CGT proponents don't possess \"all knowledge\" to make the claim that all knowledge is ideological and has been affected by human interests; It is a Sweeping Generalization they proffer.\n\nB.)

Thus the conclusions from, and what is posited by, Critical Theory are *erroneous.* They cannot say that all knowledge is equal but that some is more equal than others (or something else along those lines) as that would be akin to Animal Farm and even that idea would be subject to the conditions in B as they *don't know \"all\" or possess \"all knowledge\" to make those claims.*\n\nD.)
