the minute I heard Cassie's the lawsuit I knew it was true the entire thing there's not one thing that I doubted you teach people that if somebody is smaller than you and you can control them you use violence this man has always built people and broke them down that's what we've seen men who are abusive who aren't as abusive chical as Diddy they use the Diddy situation to basically make themselves look good because every time we see it every now and then people are like oh my gosh I can't believe this is happening I don't think it's not that people can't believe it I think it's the fact that now we're seeing it on a grand scale the men that aspire to that power the idea that that man can also be held responsible ruins their entire understanding of what they're aspiring [Music] to all right hello beautiful black people let me tell you why I've convened you here today Shalom we are doing our follow-up episode to the Diddy deep dive this one now on the heels of the footage from a hotel incident from years ago that obviously the hotel buried for Diddy um but the footage came out showing Diddy brutally assaulting Cassie she it seems like she's trying to get away she's at the elevator he comes running out in his towel and he begins kicking her and beating her and dragging her which by the way are allegations that I'm pretty sure she had alleged she referenced this hotel incident before in that footage was something she would need had the case um went on and what I think before I hand the wheels over to y'all the thing I'm going to comment on is did he release an apology video after where he goes oh I was at my lowest I am working on being a better man and blah blah blah and all this [ __ ] right something about Jesus and let me tell you it's not even like it's this isn't even like the innate slander of like an apology video or blah blah blah no specifically let me tell you why this one is [ __ ] did he came even after he settled his lawsuit with Cassie he settled that lawsuit with in less than 24 hours he still went out of his way to put out a statement saying they absolutely deny any of these allegations right he then went on to proceed he literally as he put out the apology video his pins tweet his pinned tweet was still oh this is a smear campaign with I can I can't sit back and and while people continue to lie on me and disparage me and drag my name and this is is the next thing so there's literally no [ __ ] way that you are a man that recognized that you were at your lowest or you did something wrong and you've been trying to work to be a better man or take accountability literally cannot be [ __ ] true because according to you you are already the best man and [ __ ] was lying on your [ __ ] name so to y'all [ __ ] you that's all I gota start with that first off [ __ ] him and everything he stands for I personally went over to me I was like can I have an opinion on this because I've been keeping up with like every I don't know why but particularly this particular case has me like ler eye focus and I'm keeping up with like everything to catch a lie at all but from like a obviously he's full of [ __ ] because it's just pretty obvious that he's full of [ __ ] but the thing that I find fascinating is like what was the idea behind issuing the apology who was it to cuz he doesn't mention Cassie for instance he doesn't mention who he's actually apologizing to so I'm assuming that it's primarily a PR stunt or a PR trying to uh you know stop any damages or whatnot but with an ongoing federal investigation and now you're essentially admitting to the violence that you've been alleged I just feel like this is a really bad idea just from like a PR point and also you're a terrible [ __ ] person and I'm happy that everyone sees it now so that's I just that I believe part of the settlement with Cassie was that neither one of them could speak on each other in public anymore going forward so I guess that's why she hasn't really made a statement towards him or towards anything and he didn't say anything I do want to say didd he was to me one of the most prominent hip-hop icons ever and the minute I heard Cassie's the minute I read the lawsuit uh I knew it was true there was no there was nothing about it that there was not one thing that I doubted along the entire thing there's not one thing that I doubted and yet and still I was shocked when I saw this video yeah the level of arrogance the level the level of not abuse is one thing and not to put that aside but it was almost as if she wasn't human being it was scary it was almost as if there was no love it was sheer control sheer arrogance sheer blatant disregard for a person that you show called love and at that moment I understood everything that wasn't said in those papers at that moment I saw him as somebody I just I read the papers and I still thought okay didd he was he's freaky or he's you know maybe he was just abusive and I don't even know what just abusive is but I didn't expect that and then now I had to reconsider everything that I thought I knew about this person every single thing it was like so you knew he was arrogant you saw I worked on making the band I worked beside him oh wow I've seen the way he's treated people and I took it as that's just Diddy I've seen the way he act he's acted on television I've seen the way he's acted uh on on you know say the four or whatever those shows that he was on and I'm like all right he's just in character this is just character I had no idea even with her saying this and you guys can definitely speak on that about people who don't believe it when it's being said that it was to this level yeah I you know what's funny so I didn't I wasn't shocked by the video at all like or or the violence that we were seeing in the video and that's maybe because for me I had a I had a my boyfriend in college it just 10 years ago now April 2014 uh attacked me like tried like and he kicked me in my head more than 30 times like 36 is how much I remember counting and I remember getting a concussion and I think the thing that when I see the Diddy video and I think about my own experience and what I want to make sure we really parse out and we don't do is when we do see these incidents right like when we see when on the occasion where we're able to see the kind of allegations that so many women so many people because not just women are abused um uh allege right like these are these are experiences that lots of people are happening which means that every man is not the boogeyman right it's not like this how did it happen like this like special like Diddy is not some like exceptional monster that we don't know how we got there Diddy is the result is the result of exactly what we're breeding in society right because there's a reason why there is a normaly obviously we know with abuse for as much as like allegations or something that are theoretically treated like the boogeyman like something people are avoid because it's going to end you or whatever in real life we know that it doesn't end people every day right like it is very normal we can think of lots of different hip-hop icons that we know of abuse allegations or we know confirmed solidified abuse right like a Dr Dre all these different people that are going to get Awards and all these things so how it's happening is the result of this kind of reason why it's so normal to us or it can keep going on and is because we know on some level that how it is that we normalize or we encourage men to be or breeds for this right like if you live in a world where you it's okay for us to know that a diddy is exploitative or is abusive or in the way that his arrogance or his ego we recognize on so many levels that a man being considered powerful or successful or Rich becomes like a pass or something that we think normal for them to be in to act out all these other things that are consistent with someone who is then going to go and to be violent right like so I think that is what I think is important and I don't say that like from a condemnation standpoint I think like at the end of the day that abuse and domestic violence is obviously regular like common place it's happening common place in our society which means we don't have the ability to just round up it's not like some special pill that only the abusers have there's something that we are teaching and we are fostering in our society that allows for that and if we keep treating it like these men when we find out about it are these boogie men that we just get rid of or we don't know what to do then it becomes just like expanding the the prison the prison system and this and next thing but nothing actually gets done for how do we deal with the men and the boys that are in our community and the people and not just them because obviously uh little boys lots of little black boys are abused by grown ass women all these different things too right so there's a whole shebang to this but I'm like how do we address what what how we actually got there right I didn't think but like Diddy Diddy didn't come out of nowhere AR kelly didn't come out of nowhere like Russell Russell um your boy Russell Simmons didn't just come out of nowhere right all these men are not listen I feel like um and wrestle brand but um I feel like also we can talk about it being Diddy I have this really great shirt that has Diddy and um uh big on it it's great it's the you know the culture for the culture type of stuff right and I I love what Diddy brought to the culture what we know him to be um you know with Making the Band even in those times I knew to me having to them to go get cheesecake speaking to the girls of Danny De Kane a certain type of way I saw all of this as this man like uses his power and he acts as the Boogeyman and so scary but we love what he creates we we can't lie we like to when I be in the the club and they playing music I play around do the Diddy Bop you know we do all of that so but I'm like this man has done for the first group that he made what are what are the names fatty coup we never seen nothing come of that never nothing and nothing at all this man has always built people and broke him down that's what we've seen um from you know his presence on television yes consistently um we even seen him talk to his colleagues like that um the boom cat lady and you know how they fell out and all the stuff he has lot of stories or other people have a lot of stories of falling out with him and we've seen some of it um on television play out but I say the this this man after um Cassie put out all this information right uh a lot of people instantly went to she want money she want this and that and yes like you said Olay um to have settled immediately the next day we know something was fishy but the she put in those documents to the te details right uh and um we look at footage and it's it's down to the te walking us through it and because she said it immediately it's better to say another black man why are we speaking against another black man why are we doing that why why aren't we um you know uh innocent until proven guilty then the video comes out and the people who were who are rappers and celebrities some of them who chose to speak up in favor of Diddy now their videos are um you know I'm still going to stick with innocent until proven guilty you know sorry to Cassie um hated to see what happened you know uh so but it's like no we don't need that that type what does guilty mean in that cont the court of law in the court of law not okay and didy himself said that um put a statement out as well um right before that said you know he denounced all the allegations he denied them he said none of this is true and you guys will see well yet we're looking at it I think what it what like concerns me is that or it wasn't surprising I agree it wasn't surprising natural violence was shocking to me and what I think a lot of people shock is the fact that there's footage showing that type of violence because every time we see it every now and then people are like oh my gosh I can't believe this is happening I don't think it's not that people can't believe it I think it's the fact that now we're seeing it on a grand scale it's kind of like when we started seeing um police Brut on video like everybody knew that's what police were doing but seeing it you can't Gaslight it anymore and like a part of my concern with it is I don't want Society to kind of like do this reality televis of it where it's like now we got to see like this crazy um footage of it because I'm watching I'm watching it you know similar to Ula I'm thinking like it reminds me of of a situation I've been in like that type of violence is not something that is is unknown to me and not unknown to a lot of women I'm thinking damn what if my [ __ ] was like like on the screen like this and everyone were to see it that's what was triggering me about it but people are still like does it have to get to the point of like now we have to see this footage of this grown man treating a woman like a dog the thing is it won't make a difference I it won't make a difference regardless because in the same way that we've been watching yes when people first started seeing the videos on social media of police brutality it's like oh my God outr and then it continues to happen and then it continues to happen and then it becomes normal and the system the system doesn't respond because what people always fail to remember is that the awareness is not for the system the video is not for is not for the system the system knew the system already seen it the videos are not new to the system the system don't give a [ __ ] the videos and the stuff are for you and still the same way that people respond to incidents where they watch Police Murder black people and they go oh what did they do and they start trying to vilify them is this exact thing you see the discussions I clicked on no jumper for like two seconds the other day and these [ __ ] were on there talking about um were on there talking about oh didd he getting dog piled and oh everybody jumping on it and this and that and next thing and you know what I realized so something Rebecca said um about like people at this rockas like they love what a diddy creates I don't even think it's that people love what a diddy creates they love what a diddy has he represents and its power because so often we will know we know what is Central to a diddy story is just how much of Diddy success is owed to artists that we know he leaves penniless that he takes from all kinds of people right that have worked with them and told these stories and that is known we [ __ ] know that like documented the Diddy curse all these artists that will talk about it so it's obviously not about what Diddy truly creates or what his inherent value is but it's the power people people admire and they worship this like this idea that someone can get to a place where they are unstoppable or whatever have you that's why whenever you see these happens to like diddies or Bill Cosby or whoever people are like oh they want to get another powerful black man they want to get another powerful black man and it's funny right like in the same breath that they're infantilizing this person like a victim that needs to be helped and protected is also what they're talking about and lauding them for is being powerful right and so much and if you truly if you are in awe of power if power is something you aspire to and you like it so much of course that it allows you to like a figure that you know exploits his artist exploits his friends hurts people that you've heard in association with all these things for decades yeah you're gonna that is going to foster a society that even even still when they finally see yes the violence or whatever have you we've become accustomed as a culture as a community as a society as a society to walk past these things to to somehow act like we're not sure about things that evidence has been out for that things are confirmed we do it all of the time like again I just watch Dr Dre get an honorary Grammy a or a new W named after the man right like this man still in the Super Bowl this the next thing meanwhile I follow D Barnes you know what I mean like in real life we know this we know deich story we know D Barnes we [ __ ] know that and these artists move on and they continue to be celebrated right like nobody gives a [ __ ] about how Eminem and whoever else was there like totally fine with the abuse that Dr Dre was doing to these women and we continue to like love and celebrate them in a culture so are we not like clearly what it's really about is we like where we like the idea of where someone can get to that they can't be checked yeah I was gonna uh talk about um so at the root like you said at the root of abusive relationships it's all about power it's about who trying to the police trying to lock one of y'all that's yeah over here that's K look at nyp do you see Eric Adams been here for three seconds and they were like come closer Pier so we can hear you Pierre come closer to the mic so we can hear you sorry about that now I was saying like yeah the root of abusive relationships is power it's about a person wanting to have power over the the person um and because I work in the field of domestic violence the video coming out wasn't surprising to me either because that's the stories we hear a lot from survivors um and like like you guys mentioned the the boogeyman because when videos like this come out um men who are abusive who aren't as abusive quote unquote as Diddy they use the Diddy situation to basically make themselves look good right so like long as I'm not doing what Diddy's doing to Cassie or Diddy to other people you I'm not that bad of a guy you can accept me you know for not being as bad as Diddy that's why when these videos come out as much as like they can be helpful for people to realize that this person was abusive this whole time people who are who are abusers who are emotionally uh phys emotionally U mentally verbally abusive can use that as a shield to protect themselves from being held accountable as well right so yeah I think that that's one of the things with that video came out because people are now using this video to trying to say that abuse can only look this particular kind of way even though we know of the verbal harassment he's done towards other people we know how he's stolen money like Financial abuse of other people people people now take this one incidence of what he did as like the only thing he's done when we know it's it's a history of him harming people um in his life of people in his Circle well how do we even get there go go KY go go go I was gonna say like kind of combining what Pierre and oi said I've always found it fascinating the men that kind of usually men that kind of fall on the sword for when a powerful man is being scrutinized rightfully for obviously abusive Behavior I I kind of read it as like the men that aspire to that power the idea that that man can also be held responsible ruins their entire understanding of what they're aspiring to because they're aspiring to not be checked to be able to um commit sexual violence physical violence emotional violence with impunity um and I feel like a lot of times it's wrapped into masculinity and like I am the the ultimate man if I can do these things um which was also I was kind of talking to oami before we got started I was kind of curious though of course there are people that are still defending Diddy because there's always going to be people that do I do find in comparison to other men who have been um even before the the video came out and maybe I have like a warped perception just because of the people that I follow on my algorithm and whatnot but I didn't see this like influx of really falling on the sword the same way that they may for another abusive man and I and I was kind of curious if maybe there was some EV like some element of homophobia particularly in regards to him because there's these ideas that he had also victimized men um and at that point it me and my friend have a joke like I love black people but we have a problem with prioritizing sometimes because people oh my bad go go go go go no no no go ahead you're probably gonna answer yeah I was gonna one of the things I worked on um in my Master's thesis I talked about like sexual violence and there's this idea of like the authentic victim and if the and people not understanding of someone can be a victim unless they look like this type of archetype um I think a part of like who Cassie is I think that also plays into it because if you look at like kind of how negn stallion is more masculine masculinized and there was people who was falling for Tory Lane's little [ __ ] ass um I almost said a lot more but compared to like you know Cassie um and like her ambiguity and I think there's like an aspect of that definitely um and then the homophobia right and now you have you have men that are like victimized by him and those men are like other rappers that people like like Meek Mill um and now Meek Mill you you Mak m m come out looking like he's gay and like that is what the focus went on so it's like right no Diddy some yeah you know and like so sometimes it's so frustrating too it's like we are here with abuse and you're focused on whether or not someone may or may not be gay like God who cares yeah I think when the allegations first came out like late last year that's what the tweets were about because people were also questioning oh how come a lot of men aren't coming forward and saying anything about Diddy and some respond oh we don't we don't care about did like we stop caring about did and they'll say some kind of thing about like how he's messing with men whatever it is or how he they know how he moves or whatever it is it's like so your issue isn't the sexual violence no that he's committing towards multiple people but the fact that he might be queer you know think about this too like um back to like what like comes to violence it's all about power he might not even be gay but the fact that he can have power over people by using sexual violence is what he's going to do his power goes so deep right he's one of those people we just use Diddy for example just Diddy alone like just how um he goes he can change his name up change his Persona um say that he's healed attach himself just like Kanye did I think we talked about this in one of these videos just like Kanye did when he needed somewhere to lay his head when the world was saying that he was too much when when he believed that he was being rejected so now he um the latest thing that did he did was attach himself to the church changed himself yes to the um the change his name to love right went over to TD J him and then changed his name to love and for me uh it goes it plays into my perspective it plays into that sick power move because love going to the church is already sketchy enough when you know you ain't no good and you know you just going over there over there to let people think that you you know you're in a Godly place and to be accepted and and forgiven by these people and so to have the name love for me because in love biblically uh God is love I believe that Diddy believes that he's God and he can literally just do anything to anybody and get away with it we know this from him thinking that paying that who the hotel off that what 50 plus Grand or whatever it was it was going to disappear but baby come on now here it is for such a time as this so that the act of of abusers going to church to you know gain like some kind of shield from accountability is an aspect of spiritual abuse um because in the church the whole idea of church is forgiveness right so if the church forgives me and you guys aren't forgiving me you guys say the church is wrong then and and that there's no work that comes with it right like there's something I you know funny I was watching this docu series on Netflix right now about Ashley Madison about the Ashley Madison I just watched it oh you feel me it's so good right it's about there used to be this uh well it still exists this website for this dating website for cheaters right like people normally signning up to cheat on their spouses right and then there was this big huge data leak where all their business got out cuz ha the hacker decided [ __ ] this right um there was a couple there talking about the husband had been on the website he had been cheating on his woman on his wife and all this and then when he like you know he Li her they do this like YouTube video because they're Christians and he's like he's like yep so God is yes I it's true I was in late but God I spoke to God and God has forgiven me so that's all there is to it you know what I mean and that and that's that's what it is like in their mind like if you even see on that apology video from Diddy all these comments from oh my God you see like Kelly and people letting you down and [ __ ] like in the comments like coding scripture and this this is and the next thing and it's it's it's it's crazy right because this is something I'm really struggling with and trying to I feel like I try to walk this like Balancing Act Right of like I believe that it's I believe that it's a dangerous attitude to have that like especially with things that I believe our society actively Fosters and I believe that our society is create creates the rape culture the violence the patriarch patriarchal violence and the things that we experiencing are not things just happening because they're just Boogeyman men these are the tools that are happening and I think in order for us to actually correct that we have to address problems rather than like like condemnation of people but that being said that can be a fine line between where that and you see this like I and I feel like I've been seeing a lot more Rising conversations about like Gen X black women that want to get the blanket out to to cover and protect and conceal you know what I mean all of these men that have been abusive and I think like it's like you go so far and I'm somebody who's incredibly simp like I'm I've I've experienced domestic violence I'm also a defense attorney so I have represented tons of men like especially black men accused of crimes even accused of domestic violence and stuff so I have this like I want us to I understand I understand recognizing Rec or recognizing this world that we're in or how much harder the world can be on black men versus other men and wanting to do these things but I I fear that sometimes we go so we go so far to be empathetic towards the black man that we entirely forsake the black woman right like because I'm like in the breath that you want to you know protect uh or you or you don't want to see a diddy destroyed or whatever the [ __ ] they come up with you know in the breath that you don't do you care about all of the women and the people and the men and all these people that have been harmed right like do you care like when you when you still want to appreciate what Dr Dre has done or whatever so you don't care that this is a man who would violent like have you read the D bars like what what heard D Barnes tell that story like what happened or these things like that we so I don't know I really I really don't know and I'm I'm I'm struggling with trying to Tahoe I must say it's kind of difficult for me to to to experience all of this for one um and I have been in abusive relationship I was abusive uh at a point in my life I had no idea uh I don't even if when you're in that I don't even think that you see regularly I don't even think you see Humanity I don't I called her yesterday and I asked her and she was like yeah we were just angry and I was like was it me it was was it you and she was like it was us it was just the way we were like that was just the way we communicated and when y'all are saying the video and men not really knowing whether it was true or not do y'all think that it's because they've experienced this before in their relationships but it just didn't look like that yeah so so from what I know my my particular work uh the violence is a learn Behavior right right so if a lot of it a lot of people who are and that that I'm part me P I'm sorry to cut you off but please stay right there when I was talking to my therapist about it years ago she was like well you were beaten a lot when you was a kid you that's something that you learn and that's something that you applied and I promise you I am not trying to make no excuses for my behavior like uh I've I've continuously stood on fighting against that protecting woman protecting every woman in my woman in my life uh strangers everybody I speak on it continuously but it being a learned behavior like that's really a thing that can happen for to you like when you're young am I right yeah I I I want to take a second to point out like what Tahoe did which I think is great and what you want to see like um because I saw what Joe buen recently had come out finally like saying something about Diddy and he was like mask like condem and Diddy right and people on social media are like um not you right like not you of abuse right and then you see people who want who were defending you know Joe but by being like y'all wanted him to talk about this and now y'all are mad at him for talking about this and it's like there's a specific way that people want you to do something I think we live in a society that says and I think the reason why you see so men so many men who maybe have been in situations like this or whatever were unwilling to concede to this or admit this or recognize it it's because we live in a society that when it's like when you tell white people that yes you will have internal ized racism you will have or they did something racist what they hair is you think I'm a bad person who consciously chose to be racist and that's not what you're saying right it's like you can do bad things you can believe in bad things you can have bad ways that you respond to to to to life or bad ways that you handle things and it doesn't mean you're a bad person or that there's no Redemption for you but it does mean that you have to acknowledge that right so the way that you speak about something if you've done something or you've experienced it there are lots of I am not someone that's have the mindset that you are are everybody is to be discarded or whatever like I live in a real world in a real Society where I know a lot of different people who've done and been through a lot of different things and they are not as what they are not their worst deed right but it's about what you do after so see what Tahoe did is what people would have reasonably wanted uh Joe Buton like theoretically this isn't me even commenting on the situation I ain't getting in that I don't want being their part of their verse but what people would have wanted from a Joe but what you could what accountability would really look like would be to say I have been in an abusive relationship I have been abusive I have done things and this is me realizing why that why that's [ __ ] up how that's [ __ ] up how I've tried to like reconcile that that's what's wanted that's what's needed that's what accountability actually looks like not just like yeah I also want to say I'm not trying to make any excuses for my upbringing or Nothing Like These just conscious decisions I had no idea who I was what I was doing I just didn't I didn't know no better I was a [ __ ] idiot and I learned from watching other people I saw my moms be abused I remember open the door and see her fight in a guy she told me go back in the room and I saw my friends my older friends they doing it with their girlfriends and I don't know maybe printed on Me Maybe I just didn't understand it did like anything print on you and I just didn't know you know yes CH my I have the this this way of how like society looks at romantic relationships and they do we do this like oh that's not my business not my business really iry because I really think that there needs to be like Community within romantic relationships um because that's where you hold the accountability and romantic relationships are embedded with all the [ __ ] that we're being oppressed and marginalized by anyways it absolutely gets imprinted on us it absolutely is something that we need to be like deconstruct and I think like it has been frustrating for so many years and decades because it's women will be like or people be like I we I I'll use women for right now um but just to say that I know it's not just women who are abused we'll be like we all know a woman who's gone through some type of sexual assault or violence but then the other way around it' be like oh [ __ ] don't know any other [ __ ] who's done that and it's like you got to know there's there's two sides to it and there's I think see speaking from my perspective as someone who's been a victim in a domestic violence situation I knew exactly what my abuser went through and how he got that I saw his parents I saw how his stepdad treated him that and it was actually that comp passion and empathy that had me staying longer than I should have because I was like oh my God this isn't his fault oh my God this isn't his fault well we're trying to go to therapy well he might have BPD well he's taking off his meds and he did it out until I found myself on the floor like Cassie like oh my God and the only way that I got like out of that was it was in front of someone and she I was apologizing to her like I'm sorry you had to see that and she said the words to me I'm glad I was there because if you did that in front of me I don't know what he would have done without me there and I had to realize I can't even confidently be like I would have survived that night so it's it's a constant finding of the line just real quick of like understanding that it's we we know AR kley was was sexually abused as a child we know Chris Brown saw his mom um be be abused but what when you become like a danger it's like what what do we do with that because now it's like well you're actively dangerous you know regular VI what I was going to say like the learn Behavior part is that um even acts of abuse is intentional because it's an action you're choosing to do it it's just that when you saw it happening there was no consequences when you saw happening like no one like the person that abused your mom didn't get didn't go to jail probably right your homeboy beating up his girlfriend didn't go to jail so in your mind I can do this thing and not be held accountable for it you know what I mean so like it's like a psychologic psychological thing where like and L my mind I can cause harm without being option you think it really exists right understand I feel like our society and our community like lives in one where you can punish for something criminally and that doesn't mean that people think it's wrong right like cheating is like and I think that's important there like secretly among themselves not the opinion that they can express I have sat across from men and like had I again I'm a defense attorney and I've had the the deep conversation in this and I some people genuinely do not see what's wrong with it like their understanding of how they've been raid like I live I'm from the Bahamas the Bahamas is constitutionally Christian right and what that means is a whole lot of misogynistic [ __ ] [ __ ] is the law like marital rape is a thing that is regularly debated on in our parliamentary floor it's not a legal and the reason and and behemon the smartest kindest behemon you know or man whatever will be there arguing you down why marital because their idea their literal thought process as informed to them by the Bible or however is that this is a woman's duty duty they literally don't see you as the ability to have that boundary to have that consent it's not that they're setting out in their mind they think they're the boogeyman or whatever they're being educated and raised to believe in things that Foster and abuse you know um and so Something Christina said that's beautiful about when we talk about community and needing community in relationships there also needs to be Community accountability like in the sense and let me say what I mean about accountability like whenever a person a a man or woman or whoever is an abuser everybody Acts like they just came out of nowhere it's even this thing something I you know I recognize from my childhood that I season up when I was a kid I used to know all these parents like my friends my my parents talking about um their friends or their friends talking about like another person's kids like they're like this anomaly like oh that person just ended up with a [ __ ] up child they did everything right and blah blah blah as an adult person every single [ __ ] child and that I know is a a direct extension of their circumstance their parents their circumstances none of them are not Ames none of them like every time you see it you know exactly what like there's more to life in who people become than their rent was paid or they have two parents or whatever I what you teach people is what you believe in and how I could really give you an example of that right to to people acting Brown you I remember my college boyfriend who who abused me who attacked me before he ever physically attacked me I remember us being in the mall and his him and his mommy getting it in the food court him and his mommy getting into it like getting into it and she jumped up and ran and took off and I ran behind her like oh come on and she was like she was like she was like he's looking at me like he wants to white lady he was mixed he was black but you know his his mama was white uh and she was like he's looking at me like he wants to beat my ass like like she was like you need to determine if not someone you would be with right he's she's his mother and she recognized him as a [ __ ] physical threat and I want to remind you that put a pin in that or whatever for a year later so the night my college boyfriend attacked me he first of all he had been like fighting we had been at uh M and his fraternity had thrown like a joint party right and he had just cross and the only reason he even crossed he even pledged was because he felt jealous of my relationship with like uh [ __ ] in the Greek Community right so he starts fighting with the the the kappas he was a sigma he starts fighting with the kappas who come there because I used to talk to the kappas so now we hate the kappas right so at this point I know he ain't WRA too tight I've been living with him I don't think he's ever going to be a physical threat because the time I was like 20 like 2019 I didn't see I didn't know the cycles of abuse like years later once I seen them I realized like oh very clearly like oh isolated me like immediately got together and he's like oh quit being an RA like so give up your school hous and can move with me off campus where the only person the only way for me to get around was for him to drive me to and from I couldn't talk to my male friends so he was doing all these crazy things like building up the but while he's doing it like manipulating me he's like always being like Oh I would never hit you I would never like always like talking down on men that like are physically abusive or men that cheat so I think these things would just never happen and I think all this like emotional possessive jealousness is like you know love oh he loved me right cool now I see why I should have seen it but that night he starts um he gets into it with all with all the kappas I like uh calm everybody down like hey please like don't beat my boyfriend up like I y'all I understand he goes out of nowhere he comes back to the the club up with like a paddle he got out the back trunk to try to fight with them I'm like y'all please don't beat my [ __ ] up like right and so then me and my sori sister are trying to like drag him down the street as we're dragging him down the street he sees like he sees like a Kappa sitting down and Wendy's minding his own business eating his food he gets upset he want to go into Wendy's to fight so we're like like pulling him out my S sister is trying to like stop him but how it looks he's Skin So buck with her on the street it looks to the police like he is um it looks to the police like he is like arguing what I to the police the police stopped to ask him like they're like to ask us oh is everything okay and I want y'all to understand y'all know how I feel about the police y'all know how I feel with the police so if I tell you the police are not wrong there was no racial profiling or anything happen in the story you know it didn't like y'all the police are just like hey what's going on everybody else sobers up when they see the police it's 20 like like you know what I mean oh not this [ __ ] me and and we're 20 right we're not 21 so me and um my friend like oh it's okay and he's like [ __ ] that [ __ ] this so the police are like all right arrest him right so they go to put him in the car I spend 20 minutes convincing the police to let him go like hey blah blah blah if you just give me the key I'll take him home this is the next thing and they're like if you could just get him to apologize if you get him to apologize we'll we'll let you take him which is crazy by the way like talking the [ __ ] out of handcuffs right and so I go after like 20 minutes I convince the police then I got to spend another 15 minutes convincing him to um to to just apologized to him he's like no [ __ ] that they racially profiling me blah blah blah and I was like okay baby yeah but let's talk about that when we get home like you know let me like let's talk let's just say with us now so you don't get arrested you don't go to jail right so I finally get him to get say sorry they gave me the keys because he's drunk the minute he get out the car he takes off down the hill right like I'm walking behind him like with with his keys like oh I want to drive us home right he's like am i s sister and his fraternity brother are with us like they just finding out he crazy right we I get to the car I jump in the car to to drive us home let me tell you how [ __ ] nuts this [ __ ] is we are off campus it's like raining cuz I'll never forget it cuz the ground was wet and I had to walk through it he jumps out the [ __ ] car before I even bring it to like an official like stop to park right he jumps out the car and he darts to our apartment right he goes how our apartment was set up you walk in and it's the living room and we had two bedrooms and they're both on the left side he go and our bedroom was all the way back he jumps in the living room and he goes [ __ ] you you want me to go to jail [ __ ] I'll call back right now I just talk this [ __ ] out of the police out of handcuffs in the police car right so at this point so I go you know what this is after a year this man being like emotionally unhinge like when he starts cursing me I want him to go to jail I don't care about him I said you know what I'm done I'm done that's what I say I go I I say I'm done I walked back to our bedroom I Chang into and I still have it I changed into this giant navy blue shirt with Tweety Bird on it and I go to bed I am telling y'all I close my eyes you have no idea how fast this man ran from the living room there like before I could open my eyes like adhering the sound of his voice like or ad heing the sound of him running down the hallway he is choking me right and like and I remember I realized like dog the moment where I realized I cannot get this nigga's hands off my neck like I am doing everything I can to get and I cannot like oh this [ __ ] can he's gonna kill me right and so he only lets go on my neck long enough to take I had braids at the time to like take me by my braids grab me and throw me across the room like he he grabbed me so much my literally the braids like three braids from the top of my scalp rip out right and he kicks me in the head like 36 times I tell y'all and while he's doing it he's screaming like oh I don't take accountability I don't take accountability while he is doing this right cool then I like when I finally get free I'm trying to like call his mommy for help right like call the phone I'm like screaming for help when I run to the kitchen that's when I hear a knock on the door I open the door it's the exact same police officers I just convinced not to lock this [ __ ] up the small town in Ohio so he's going to jail they not like hearing it right mind you I'm now like ripped up tattered all that like and I'm still like please don't arrest him don't arrest him don't arrest him he's in the back bedroom like [ __ ] that [ __ ] [ __ ] that [ __ ] blah blah blah blah blah I could hear him right now we call his I call his mommy to help him to have his mommy like help me um um not get him arrested right but I told you he's black but his mommy is white this woman tells them to take him right like tells them to take him but then she comes like the very the next day comes drives down to the apartment to take my [ __ ] and throw it out our apartment and tell me oh this is my fault because I shouldn't have broke up with him that was immature that I'm done is the reason and that was and that was the story that was [ __ ] you and your son yeah because I said I'm done so there's a way mind you like there is a way that every you act like they act like [ __ ] just comes out of [ __ ] nowhere like these things it ain't happen out of thin air right like how something and how you go to go enable some you think something is cool is in a world where you have mothers and fathers and friends and people who like give you feed you the excuse or like look into like oh what did you do well you shouldn't have done that and you should have thought this even though they know that these people didn't just [ __ ] abuse you out of thin air they know they've seen the [ __ ] aspects of these people's violence and whatever have you and it's that [ __ ] right there like it's it's it's what we're raising and how we're raising and it's this mistake that we act like we act like agre our children and the people because remember that like these are originally people who belong these are children they start off as children people raised and groomed by their communities and what are we who what are we raising and then once the [ __ ] comes like up to light it's like everybody act like like like they had no part in it and it's like do we not take do we not have a part in what we're what we're raising like in our in our community and what we're excusing and like we all do it right like we all do it I could even say my own like I said that I I can think of at when he did that the same way like Christina's like oh he got me cop in that loop I remember I I Jo I didn't want him to get arrested or anything like that I wrote a leniency letter to get him out and all of this I was there like oh you know maybe I never seen him act like this like oh he would never hit me that there must have been something in the sigma juice like I'm coming up with all kind of [ __ ] and reasons like oh maybe he has like some kind of psychological you know what I mean blah blah blah blah blah I'm like come up with every reason for why this other than like a man who believes who who truly just doesn't believe that I have the right to to you know what I'm saying and and a lot of that is that and I've been yeah Tahoe yeah I I was gonna um mention like kind of gonna bring back to the whole Cass situation somebody mentioned like the video Diddy's running out of the hotel room in like a towel which means she thought this was the best one for her to escape and it wasn't um which like I hear this a lot from people in the community and whatever it is people just think the solution to a abive relationship is to just leave but Cally speaking the most danger time for a person who's in a relationship is when they are trying to leave that's when they leave life matter of fact there's been many stories of women being killed at the courthouse parking lot because she's trying to get a restraining order yes right so like those things like um that's why there's something called a safety plan a lot of um domestic violence agencies do these thing with with survivors where they have to figure out like let's talk about this abuser like what are the ins and outs where did they go to work what time do they wake up because we have to find the most like safe time for you to leave because any to just walk out middle of the night or walk out when you think he's asleep or he's in the shower can I could be the worst time yeah if I may if I may add a little context Rebecca to that I have so many points I want to talk but I'll just do this one right now I remember trying to leave my abusive relationship and she wouldn't let me like she held a gun to my face once I remember another time trying to get out the house she literally climbed on my back and like ripped my shirt off my back and like ripped it and so when I finally found like when I was finally done I laid in the bed next to her I waited till she went to work I counted the minutes that she was gone to make sure that she made it to the train and I was like all right she can't come back now so I get up I start packing all my stuff packing all my stuff the landlord calls her I guess while I was bring my stuff down to the car the landlord calls her and was like yo are you moving and she's like no and he's like somebody's moving and so she's calling me calling me and she's like I'm on my way you [ __ ] ass [ __ ] you better not leave you better not leave and like I literally took my phone like I left all my stuff and I took my phone and I left it in the house and I left and I just basically disappeared off the face of the Earth but yeah like basically to you saying that there's like a sa what did you say is a safety plan to leave I literally had to plan it in my head on how to [ __ ] get up out of there and obviously I know this makes me sound like I was the abused one we were in an abusive relationship it it was both but at some point I realized like yo this is crazy and I it was hard for me to get the [ __ ] out of it so even when you're in cuz I guess we all can say that or most of us here can say that we've been in some sort of an abusive relationship um and even for me no long story here but when I lived in New York that's the reason why I left New York because of an abusive relationship um to the point where cops will be passing by and wouldn't give a damn that man like I was locked into a car and a cop was passing by and I'm screaming in the car this man is locking me in here I'm I'm kicking the window in and they're just looking because they've seen us in the streets already it's been so much um and they're just like oh it's just them and people just it it was that type of thing also Tahoe you know I know you said you were both abusive sometimes when you get in a relationship and you feel like you can't leave because this person is going to be physically you know is something's about to go down you become you've been in the relationship so long you don't even know who you are anymore you become that person and now both yes and now you're abusing this person they're abusing you that's the only way you're surviving in the relationship for real um and the the the day that I decided to leave I never forget it he thought everybody in the streets wanted me and it could be anybody who looked my way or whatever the case may be he called called me all kinds of names he was half white too oay um he was um congales and he was Russian and um you know I I feel like he had a lot of issues and all like you know there the the excuses that I used to make for him he and then me as well um not too much on it but I love you know my parents but I grew up in an abusive household every single day every single day and then to go here and I watched you know um my parent saved the other parent when you know police came I I watched the same thing that you were saying that she went through LA and for me I'd be like I remember when the cops did take us on the street and they were like you know tell him to be quiet or whatever I had I'm like well he is running his mouth he's over there doing the same thing F the police they trying to because I'm this because I'm that and I'm like you know can you guys please just let him go I'll walk him home I'll do that those type of things and we'll get home and then he's cussing me out saying I was looking at the police officer or I was doing I was all kinds of things and I was only he was older than me I think I was only about 20 years old and I never forget my Escape because I said man like he's I have to do what he's saying I remember it was so bad I had to jump the Turn Style with no shoes on in the snow okay um but I remember the day I said it was enough was I came down um and I was having bad cramps during my cycle he came and saved me and it was and he brought me to his place and I was laying down and he was like you know just going off about something I can't even remember and I was just looking at him I'm like this man is going to hurt me today he's gonna hurt me I'm just so tired I wanna I I don't want to go back home I just you know graduated college my parents didn't want me to move to New York but I need to go home I need to go home I'm from Florida and I remember that night like it was yesterday he got so mad at me he was cursing me out for whatever reason he took his size 12 s and I was like in this little room um he took the size 12 sandal and he threw it and it just barely pass my face and I was like dang he told me like what's so crazy y'all I had to calm him down the best way I knew and I wasn't even into sex like that but I had to do that to calm him down and so that he can just be calm and sleep he even tried to use that against me and said that my body belonged to him that kind of thing but I knew if I did that he would just relax he relaxed I called a cab and I just took the little that I had and I left he allegedly showed up at the airport but I made it home like I made it home when I got home um this is what people who feel like they have power over you do when I got home he sent me messages and threatened to take um to sit put out a video that I again I was new to sex right and he filmed us without my acknowledgement and threatened to put that out send it to me and threatened to put that out there um and then on top of that I didn't answer none of that he found my parents address and he came to my house I was sleeping that day he came to my house and my nephew came to me he told me my father was there he told me um tati that's what he called me he said I seen um somebody came here for you he this he knew how to talk really well he like somebody came here from you and he had the same skin color as me but grandpa said you weren't here he told him that you were not here and for that guy never to come back and I'm thinking who who will come for me here and then I looked at my phone I had so many messages saying I came there your dad lied I know you're there but he said that you're not there and for me not to come back and I never wrote back I deleted that the whole thread and I changed my number and then I um mov to another state because I didn't want that that man's crazy I didn't want that drama coming into my house and all the other stuff I just move State and I just think that it's really it's really great that that video came out I know it's horrible for Cassie um and I know it it speaks to a lot of the like we all normalize a lot of this [ __ ] and it's all [ __ ] up but I think a lot of a lot of people seen themselves in that video um and I think that I think it's necessary for you to see what the [ __ ] you're doing um even me today I'm thinking about what happened to me what happened with me over 27 some years ago and I'm just even more apologetic now but I start thinking about why that happened and I just as Pierre said it's like once I saw it it became an option something that okay so that's a route that happens in relationships but then I think about how I present myself in relationships um how men show up often as women are property almost like you have to as I said you I own your body even like I don't see you as a human being you have to listen to me once you don't listen to me or once you invalidate me once I'm not this powerful sexy amazing man to you and you start looking at me as if I'm weak I now have an option to show you I am not weak which becomes absolutely right yeah it's not just one thing that that make somebody um abusive actually like just I think the recent video of like Joe bu where he's literally talking about how he stalked somebody or whatever um whatever he did I think to her name's like uh Tahiri yeah Tahiri yeah like those instances like when you're like the combination of men being told and taught that they possess and own women and then seeing examples of how you can maintain powerful women all that combined you're going to get an abuser here's here's the one step further I think the black Community never like truly truly wants to go in these conversations right like and I think that's the reason why like what's so dangerous about people just throwing their hands up like oh my God this person's so terrible through them you know like God a boogey man right is when you say I was having this coners conversation with Anette on her podcast around the way girls but when you say something like oh what Diddy needs help or these men need help or these people need help what people think you're saying is that they need therapy or they need something or you know something and something that they have the resources to have gotten but what it really is is we all need help for what we think is okay because this starts with child abuse I think like and let and let me just say this like the way it's not just Tahoe hit it on the money on how um men you know seek to control women or how they think and respond but we also have to talk about how women especially we're talking in our communities we're black the show is black and all this right but talking about how we raise children how we treat and it is normal to us like it makes perfect sense like there actually some statistics this I think FD signifier might have some videos like some good like good videos on this but if you think way it becomes normal for like okay the man can then turn around and beat his women or his woman or whatever right like that's who small at them that's who underneath them and then the woman turns around and beats the children and there's a way like what are you I always think about this what are you teaching like what are you teaching if not to respond with violence when someone doesn't you know respond like this you teach people that if somebody is smaller than you and you can control them you use violence because think about how many women who talk about how they used to beat their sons and until their sons were big enough to physically dominate them right like that is a is a thing like I even think my um one of my my brothers has a is is has a little bit of a a psychos he can have like a psychosis kind of thing from once in a blue moon and he'll be violent and my mummy will be on the phone with me acting like where did this come from oh my God like he's this like alien monster that we can't control that you don't know where it's coming from and I'm like from y'all you I mean like from [ __ ] y'all like all I'm like it makes the only re you see what I'm saying so I'm like if you combine like like like that's what you taught like you ruled with violent with with brute force in the house and now you're shocked you know what I mean and that's what I I I've talked a lot about is the way that we like we groom like not just like not just men because women too but like we're grooming people in patriarchal violence and then somehow expecting them to like turn 18 and be like oh I have all these healthy tools you've never taught me you know what I mean like that's what we teach it's so normal and think about it to me the the the reason why it doesn't strike me as as helpful to see like the video or the video come out is because I know the community is not ready to have the real conversation because anytime anybody talks about not beating your children every [ __ ] body you see the smartest people the this people d d Everybody fighting for their right to beat on little children like in real life there's nothing that an adult like it's not a normal common place for you to respond that way but yet we think it's okay like we need to be able to be kids because so many people use children as an outlet to to to to to exercise Authority and power and control they have nowhere else in their life right so like if you're teaching it's really it's really not this like crazy foreign concept when you talk to people about what they do or their habits or how they respond to life or they handle problems it has everything to do with how they were raised I am a person like people I block like I'm sure that all kind of people in the internet talking about how I block them right like I block your ass and a heartbeat and I block in real life if you know me as a personal person I will block you in a [ __ ] heartbeat and you know why because I have parents that are avoidant and will block you in a [ __ ] heartbeat like I was raised in a household like that you know what I'm saying like you're not like we're not these foreign [ __ ] anomalies the reason why you see so many people willing to respond with violence is because they grew up in households where people were responding with violence and if we don't have Grace for little children if we will justify as a community is the communal position to believe you need to beat your [ __ ] children of course there going to be men that think yeah even though technically out in the public position you know public I'm not supposed to say that yeah a lot of there are a lot of them will quietly have that conversation and think it's normal you know what I mean or even the way that like the amount of and it goes both ways think about the way we don't respond to like violence against we don't see women will it's the way you'll be watching a reality TV show and a man a woman will be be beating on a man on the show all the time and the show just continues the minute a man is Accused do the screen is black and they're off the show right meanwhile you watching women Abus men on there for years because don't think of it like so you see what I'm saying it goes both ways of this constant violence and who we deem it to be okay from and when it's okay so I think like the actual help we need as a community is how much we're invested in violence we can't pick and choose when we like in we enforce violence we give violence like Pierre said like Tahoe said like once you show people that that is the tool that they can use that's what happens and especially to what Christina said early about that like reactive abuse like I remember when I was in that relationship with my college boyfriend before he ever physically put hands on me but he was just nuts every [ __ ] day just arguing arguing arguing and every day I'm trying to find like ways like exacerbated like like exhausted trying to like figure out how to communicate with him healthy and then eventually you go I have to match his crazy that's what you think you know what I mean and then that becomes normal that you think like there's some relationships like that a waited like I'll see people talking like they'll talk about like uh Tyler peris Why did I get married and people will people be trying to be edgy and go as far as to be like you know uh Tasha and thingy were actually the healthiest relationship no they're actually still not a healthy relationship those other relationship are [ __ ] up and it's [ __ ] up to at any point be screaming and like violently violence towards your partner or emotion but we have all these different circumstances throughout our community where we tell ourselves H well you know and act like this a great area sorry so Andel like because we see instances of like physical violence on screen we try to minimize the verbal the emotional violence and like I'm glad mention Tyler Perry so many people get their idea of what domestic violence is through Tyler Perry movies and think that's it could be abusive I also think like for some [ __ ] reason within the black community it's not like this [ __ ] happens with white folks it happens we see we see white man kill kill their wife and they put them you know on news right in jet ski as part of the headline but it's like we I feel like there's a part of it where it's like we've indoctrinated that we deserve violence so for as much as it's like I've I try to delicately like figure this out because I know it's like well this is white the premacy and patriarchy yeah but like if the white man wasn't in the room we would still be doing the [ __ ] and that is what we see like yeah yeah I think what it is is when especially like mentioned like child abuse um like when you're a child and you're being abused you're being told why you're being abused yeah right so like they're giving you an excuse about why you being abused when you get older and your partner is giving you another reason as why they're abusive why they abusive towards you it's like okay yeah that's that's what my parents told me too so maybe I am the problem I want to say this go ahead Rebecca I just feel like you know it's it's so true how I feel like it's systemic the whole thing we've all said it it is how you know the upbringing all the things it's mentally it's emotionally it's all of these things that play rolling it and then there's that piece that is also you know I feel like our community isn't ready to have in it in a way like how Tahoe is expressing himself and remorseful for his actions but trying to understand why he got there how he got um we here we are it's like should we forgive Diddy or how like Kelly Price coming out and saying just immediately um not acknowledging um Cassie or what happened with her but more so just the abuser and how he deserves forgiveness um and that that's the problem a lot of times a lot of us here as we talk about our experiences with that it's like we put ourselves back there seeing it was triggering so healing is not a definite thing like when it comes to um the abuse I bet you Cassie having people reach out to her you know it was like reliving the situation over and over again but she did it because she know she had to do it um but my thing is with Diddy like does he deserve like I said I up in a family and every day I'm telling you every day every single day up until I went to college I saw abuse in my household um my mother was somebody who the way that she had to become she was very soft in the beginning and the way that she had to become was very tough and masculine which I see in me at times even before I got into an abusive relationship because that was something I created for myself like to Shield myself from people like that and then get in it and now I'm acting like my mom again in protecting those type of people while I do understand that they deserve um people deserve uh forgiveness I believe that but those type of people that like Diddy who have re just been out here a terrible person so many different story somebody who's been actively doing this um using his power abusing his power um threatening folks uh and acting on those threats all types of things that type of person I don't know just because he's black and he's he's done stuff for the culture do we have to sit here and say he deserves forgiveness no I feel like he should be right there next sorry I was gonna say like especially with no particular work like I I have two points because there's a lot of times where people think the work is asking for forgiveness the work is going to church um or even going to therapy which isn't like any example of being at all repentant or actually looking back on your on your actions because again when it came out that she had these things alleged he didn't stay quiet he didn't uh say yes that was something I did and blah blah blah blah he denied it vly said that that was not him that they were lying on his character and until that video came out he continued to do that and now his apology again is for who I assume that it's for some weak attempt at PR but also I wanted to bring up uh as we were talking a bit about like repeating the same violent behaviors I think there's also something to be said on the emotional side of it where we kind of um not only normalize like emotionally abusive behavior that often leads into physical physically abusive Behavior but we also in a way romanticize it and this is something that I've been kind of like wrapping my head around a bit because for a very long time I was one of those girls that would like read like the romance novels and blah blah blah and it's usually riddled with like and not just in novels but like movies and media and especially if we're talking about in regards to like Tyler perryan Works where there is this tying together of emotional abuse with romance or love and in some ways getting those wires crossed I remember I um I saw like a tweet that was lightly like in a funny way talking about like yeah that's how relationships are and then there was a video under it that was like a guy getting bombarded by his girlfriend just like going off like emotionally abusing him while he's asleep and he's like oh that's just how it is and I kind of I retweeted it saying something along the lines of like I'mma need us to start recognizing when we're getting emotionally abused because y'all everybody in everybody in the comments was just like yeah that's how it Isa it's so crazy has to do with like no like no reminds me of like because we were so used to violence I forgot who made that point that we're I think we've all just kind of echoed that point that we're so used to violence so it's like you'll talk about oh well you know he called me a [ __ ] or he told me to shut the [ __ ] up and then maybe you have a friend or your mom your grandma like well you know my man he dragged me across the floor my man he did this and it's like you also were abused so we agree that we collectively have been experiencing abuse and I remember my mom was askue me down to this being you know pattern when I was in my abusive relationship I got out of it and she was no blaming right but she was like dang I'm asking myself like how did my baby get in this scenario and I was like well girl it's time to have a real discussion because what did I see between you and Dad and when your son my brother started exhibiting these behaviors really young and started hitting on me right y'all allowed it and then hitting on hitting on me as my brother as an adult you're talking about well you know it takes two sides to for a relationship to break down it's like that is something that's been normalized and it's not I'm not mad at you because I know you went through it and I know Grandma went through it but like this is the pattern so how can you ask me how did that how do you find me there when I found I found you there before I could even cognitively realize it and you found yourself there before you could cognitively realize it and she was like damn you know like that's that that's true so and I feel like we haven't yet gotten to that like it feels like such a specific black community like thing because we've gone through so much that we just get crumbs and it's so difficult to like realize okay but this emotional abuse this man calling me a [ __ ] is also not okay he might not have yet put his hands on me but I was being abused the whole time you know your mom is like years ahead of most cuz like my my mom don't get it like when I try to explain her like CH like like I remember my daddy wasn't talking to me in like the ninth grade because I had a [ __ ] boyfriend and and like and had a boyfriend I had a boyfriend and someone spread a rumor that I had like done something sexual with my boyfriend oh my teenage you know my daddy is not speaking to me for a year for a year I am ashamed to the family or whatever and my mother rather than think about the level of [ __ ] like when I see it as an adult there are so many times as a kid where I knew my [ __ ] parents were wrong and I was at B at with them and they were trying to tell me that oh and I'm older now and I'm like you're even wronger than I had the understanding of like and like and I remember my mommy made my daddy was not talk imagine that you're his wife you this man not talking to his daughter for a year and she's telling me to write him a write him a letter every single day that he's not answering and she's like oh just keep doing it and I think about what kind of [ __ ] what you would have taught me like the lesson there is to run behind [ __ ] men who don't who don't want who are not speaking to you or not acknowledging you and beg that like you see that and she doesn't see that you know what I mean so like something I've been thinking about recently right is because I'm really really really trying to be more mindful I I try I try because I don't like a lot of the opinions of random people on the internet I have to be I have to be a lot more right I have to be a lot more introspective so I could at least say I am doing some kind of reflection even if I'm not reflecting on what you [ __ ] is talking about but there are a lot of people on the internet like I have people who feel like who like there are black men who say I hate black men and then there are black women who say that I ha black women because I cudle black men so much right like there is all of the different Dynamics and I feel like I have this complicated relationship as someone who is a victim of domestic violence but also as an abolitionist and a defense attorney and all these different things um but also something I'm I'm reflecting on is especially as the rising conversation on Gen X black women as we see Jill Scott and Erica Badu and tar taji and all these like older black women you know be a part of the problem and we know historically how much like when you think of abuse in our community how much there it has been hidden and protected by older women and stuff in the fames um I'm thinking about how much that generation was educated to or like we're all raised including ourselves because that's the generation that raised us right to to sympathize with the abuser or the abuse right like I realize how much like like how it's not even in I think sometimes like I remember being in like my freshman year at College when like the Evelyn lozado and and and um ooo thing for stop I've been like 17 18 and I remember my first [ __ ] thought thought process was to vilify Evelyn you know what I mean like my first thought process is what the [ __ ] that you know what I mean and I it's because I I had a mother who was like the little girl with ar Kelly is fresh you know like you know what I mean who who will lay over dead before you say something about a Michael Jackson in the house you know what I mean and so and I so sometimes I get so annoyed when I'm trying to I guess I'm trying to reconcile this to myself and I'm just speaking loud to y'all because I've been thinking about this sometimes I get so annoyed with how the the internet or my Internet space I feel like is the opposite extreme right like it always feels like it's like this really Parral feminism this real like adoption of all the things I don't like in the criminal system but in our social rhetoric and then uh and like I don't like terms like abuser and all these different things and then I think to myself well well especially when I was looking at Kelly Price's comments and all of them and I was like Jesus Christ I guess if the entire Generations before have all been educated the opposite way to have sympathy with the abuser I guess in order to to create any generation of people that have sympathy for the abuser is we might have to have this generation of people that are like intensely the other way you know what I mean like even though I don't like it I thought about it I was like is this what's needed in order for us to even because right now we don't seem to have you know a a a community or a world that is inclined to be on the side of the victim and that being said also I want to make sure I include this about um men and boys especially black men and boys black abuse and sexual abuse and violence against black men and boys are so eras like erased like invisible like in a way even the way that like we talk about like abuse as though like yeah factually like majority happen women and and it is happening a lot to women and happen but it's also happening a lot to men the difference is a man cannot discuss abuse that Society doesn't perceive is abuse like I always think about like men in my family who've been like I know as in my family I know how to what abuse they're experiencing or whatever and and they're like I would be laughed at I would be I would be made a joke of like man people will not take that as abuse I think of my freshman here at College I was a learning community leader and one of my like mentees was actually assaulted by a girl but what he asked me was can I be sexually assaulted like even as a man you know what I mean and I think about the amount of men that I have dated that have been or I've known that have been sexually abused by older women or even older men or you know what I me in their families and that is just like it happen so it's it's unreal how how common that experience for as common as it is for me to know women that have been abused and have experienced domestic violence is as common as it is for me to know black men and black boys that have been sexually abused and like you even see it like in real you see the famous people they would be discussing they're like how they lost their virginity and like you were raped you're a victim like have a theory that a lot of men who who will struggle to to to believe the victim or see the victim uh is because they haven't yet realized their own victimization especially when it comes to domes violence because a lot of stories I've heard for a I'm like you were a victim so and if you've ever tried to actually talk to someone about their own victimhood there's this trigger that happens where they're like that's not me no that's not me that's not what that is because then they have to realize and see themselves that they have survived that when I was um going if I may very quickly P I apologize um I remember growing up and and going to my friend's house and seeing how his parents treated him even in adversity even when he did something wrong it was still like a loving it was a Stern conversation it was you know some sort of hey you can't go to this event but when I went home it was you violated me you now have to pay for it physically the the environment around you is now almost hateful it's angry there is pain that's coming because of this and as I got older and I realized that it's a difference between being raised with fear and being raised with love and then how that again imprints on on to you um I remember running away at some point and going to his house and he W up letting me his parents W up letting me uh stay at at their house and I was like crumbling like as a boy like why do I have to go through this I actually said this as a as a child 16 I think was when I ran away why do I have to go through this like why doesn't she love me right um I just want to say that to that because as I got older of course I never knew how to express that I never knew how to really say those feelings to anybody else and then when it got to a certain point I shut down again it became physical right um oay I said earlier that it's important for men to have seen that video the reason why is because I believe a lot of them weren't raised with dads a lot of them were raised by their mom who were trying to cover the space left by the father not being there and who had to be a lot more aggressive to raise this boy and that [ __ ] now again imprinted on them and they're acting that way because they don't know no [ __ ] better A lot of these [ __ ] just don't know there a lot of followers on the internet a lot of followers on the internet that are look still looking for their father so I think that it's important for them to see that see the vitrio that the community is placing on that video on that behavior so they can say oh wait what I learned before that's you're not supposed to do that oh [ __ ] if if if I do this they're gonna see me they're gonna see this behavior in me and they're gonna not they're not gonna like me a so so I guess like oh so many things right uh so many things to what uh Christina was saying like what about them like not being able to R not wanted to recogniz recognize their own victimization right and like why we which is a lot of the reason why black black people are not interested in accepting child abuse right and Bel hook talks about like B Hook talks about this and all about love is this idea that like we believe that our parents love us unequivocally right like we and we see love is like what they tell us what they believe not just in all the actions and what have you and if we have to accept a world where that is abusive that that shakes at us about what we believe about our relationships with our parents and about what love is and all these different things and we're not willing we're not willing to face that also I have an ex-boyfriend like a like a long-term serious ex who sexually assaulted me um or like a few years back and I remember like shocked flid outrage you know by that and I remember like a year later like him experiencing something like pretty much almost identically the scenario but a woman doing it to him and I thought he was calling to tell me he gets it now you know what I mean like I thought like okay like God in my mind like God put you in in the same position so you could see what was so [ __ ] wrong about that and it was in him talking about that that I realize this man fundamentally doesn't like literally doesn't get it like he's in like even when he was describing it to me and like he realizing like it's uncomfortable or he didn't like it or he felt away or you're going through something when I called it like sexual assaults like yeah she did he's like no no no no no no no no no no no no no no you know what I mean so in or and and I get that because I can think of times even when like in my um when I think I think back to experiences when I was 22 or whatever and I realized like oh that man took advantage me or that man like pressured me or whatever but and when you realize that and then you realize how many times that has happened or whatever that [ __ ] you up like that really [ __ ] you up it's not like that [ __ ] you up tell you today and then you realize how many of these experiences were not what they oh it's a [ __ ] it's a [ __ ] up feeling like it's really is really it's really something so I I um yeah dog like it's like the processing has been delayed so you feel you like relive it and now you have to relive the trauma of it because you didn't realize it was trauma it be [ __ ] you up you it's the worst is like realizing like they don't perceive it like that like I know there are lot that's the like that's the thing about it they don't perceive it like that they are not consciously and that's the scariest thing about this gray area of life when people are when these things are being received as though it's normal and this happens and people's understandings like I remember in law school right um when we were learning about rape and criminal law because rape is a a legal thing and it truly like it changes from jurisdiction to jurisdiction so like what rape means is like uh uh sex is is sex without without sex without consent by force right or something like that each jurisdiction defines those words differently so you have places that like jurisdictions in this in America that see by force as meaning physical Force so if that woman wasn't like fighting you off they won't consider it rape or you'll have places like a New Jersey that like will recognize a forcible compulsion like oh the way you like like manipulated so there would be cases when I realized how tricky [ __ ] was there' be cases we'd be going over as a class where like they reading all the facts of the case and all the different like step by step and the whole class is wased to like votee in on whether or not we think it was rape and [ __ ] truly being fighted like whether or not we felt like consent happened because of the way that we live in a society like we live in a society that's not about enthusiastic consent or affirmative consent like there are some jurisdictions like think about how this like become there jurisdictions that be like they recognize like oh I think uh New Jersey is an affirmative consent jurisdiction so you need to have like explicitly said like you consent to this so yeah yes versus some states are like no so there's all these different things that basically reflect all the different misunderstandings we have about sex and consent in our society right so like what one per like is being received is a green light versus this and da D and they in the class like we trials and tribulations and that's the [ __ ] that is like that's what really [ __ ] me up about real life and I think [ __ ] people up about recognizing whether or not they've been a victim or they've been a perpetrator all these different things it's feeling like this person doesn't know this thing that tell them like I don't if y'all seeing baby rain there yes but like yes such a good show such a good show yeah but like even in baby render like how he feels like how could I have reported her when I didn't report this person who committed this greater abuse against me right like and there are a lot of people that feel that way and a lot of people who also feel like how do I how do I recognize or own this as having been this experience for me when I don't believe that this person perceives it that way or thinks they set out to do that or how you know what I mean and it's all this different [ __ ] that just makes it so question the legal system does play a part and like how people uh report certain things um because I think in California defin that's only that's the only state right now that recognizes stealthing as a form of sexual violence so like California yeah like if somebody off without consent they'll they'll say yeah this was bad but there's no legal repercussion we can give to this person unless you're in California so right so like but like let say I'm in Florida because I'm in Florida whatever it is I could have experienced that kind of like that kind of violence right that kind of kind of experience but like I I feel like I can't tell anybody because I know the legal system is not g to see it that way and if I report it and like said I do report it and it becomes like a whole public thing and then the person doesn't get charged I look like a person trying to take somebody down right but that's that's how people perceive it right now on on the internet how um Cassie tried to take uh Diddy down that's the that's the talking point and we'll see that with other people even with the Tahiri and Joe Buton thing of course we're going to have all these different views online but I think it's a patriarchy thing it's a systemic thing it's literally all of the above mixed in together but what we need to be able to do is call a thing a thing did he his abuses power I don't care if he was black white in between it sucks to see a black black relationship or a black man in a relationship and see him this way but we got to see him for what he is because if we continue to make excuses like these people we're GNA get people like Cameron's ass who think it's okay to try to have that conversation like we need to talk about that AB I'm that video no no Rebecca Rebecca now we got to see it cuz I it was your brought talk it I was disgusted then when I did it I'm disgusted now I'm truly sorry joining me now is Cameron gues better known as the rapper Cameron he's also the co-host of the podcast it is what it is thanks for being here first when you saw that video of Diddy Cassie uh in that hotel did you recognize that Shan comes um what I want to say first of all when I seen the video um everything in the video is egregious I'm against uh I don't support uh all the charges that's alleged against them I don't support any of that traffick in minor uh domestic violence I'm totally against it so when I seen the video yeah I was kind of upset with it uh no being that I know him he's not not necessarily a friend but yeah I was upset when I seen it but did you recognize I just said did you recognize that kind of anger at all from your experien I like that what do you mean do I be recognized did I recognize them I seen them what you mean my experiences I've seen them and I thought I thought it was disgusting I didn't do a zoom see if it was really him or nothing but he admitted it was him so the way this [ __ ] acting ER [ __ ] tated with her about the appearance he agreed to come on AC like [ __ ] like someone bothering you and passing like [ __ ] what the [ __ ] you asking me for already said leave me the [ __ ] alone like I said I'm going like that's how he's his whole energy is like the question is very why you come on here like you clearly intentionally came on to disrespect this woman I'm call I was just talking I was I was saying 10 words but let me before we continue to play it because I was on mute and I need to get this out before we continue to play it let's be really clear right I'm a journalist right for people who be like oh my God no I know how this goes yes when you're sitting in interviews like with Gail King those long 15 minute type things these short ass appearance this is a short appearance she was not trying to do a 10 minute 20 minute 50 minute 1 hour interview with him where she's you know gonna do followup questions ask to what he answers no there's a time limit and for these slots first of all see and stop bringing these people on to your platforms that's one but let's be damn clear when you are asked to come on the show and especially if your you're um booking person is doing it or if you you are going to ask they're going to send you questions the topic you either choose to decline or you come on there and for me like this right here this Behavior there is no excuse for it I don't care if he's a rapper um Amanda seals did a little um a little diddy where she was like oh you know quoting his raps and you know how whatever the case may be and saying he is who he is and when you know when you bring him there you know who you bringing there girl please that does not that does not like give reasoning or make an excuse for his behavior to this woman Abby Phillips doing her damn job ask you small questions you could have say I declined to answer this I'm not comfortable with this but thank you for bringing me on you know whatever but you had to do this in disrespect her and we can continue to play it because it gets really it gets really disrespectful really disrespectful yeah what's up what did you think about the apology that he gave in that other video ain't me for this the apology ain't for me decid for Cassie what what I what I think about it matter a do nothing to me Cassie need to need to ask Cassie if she accept the apology I told you I feel I said what I said I said like why is he play a conversation that you had on your podcast back in September with mace listen yeah when you had your record deal why did you take me to Biggie Smalls and not bad boy man this almost going to bring me to tears to say this I just being that I saw you as as such a good friend friend I wanted to put you with somebody I knew with thank you man I really appreciate that a lot of people ask me that on Instagram that's why here crying and [ __ ] I want get emotional in here man instantly I knew biggie would would do right by can you tell us a little bit more about that I mean is there um is there something known in the industry about how Diddy treated his artists so I'm going to get some cheeks after this horsepower drint um Yoo right here this is it like this where like Rebecca really made like I saw Rebecca give a take on this but it's actually And the fact I saw so many men like defending this cuz Cameron gave some stupid excuse like they wanted to be with the mask so I'm with the mask or whatever like what the [ __ ] like what the actual like what what what what's actually indictment here is that Diddy is a [ __ ] someone who [ __ ] is unprofessional abuses women treats them this way you know what I mean disrespect like you had be like [ __ ] what the [ __ ] like you just he this woman ain't done [ __ ] to you you accepted this appearance like she ain't forcing it on you ain't nothing happening you accepted to come here only to like disrespect her for what she asking him Baseline questions like hey do you know this [ __ ] to be violent like that is there a reason why y all didn't want to do business with Diddy um how do you feel about about it and here you he oh I'm taking this drink so I could go get some cheeks you're literally here we're talking about a man who's been sexually and physically violent towards a woman and you just hear disrespecting this woman talking about get some cheeks like what a [ __ ] dick I can misunderstood yeah was to pay attention that's what he said he literally this that was my take on it and like you said Olay so many men were literally jumping into my DMs people that I know people that I I'm close with and they were saying but you got to is that really the take you want to go with it the take I do want to go with it is that this man was invited onto CNN which again CNN needs to stop with these rappers and stuff like that and bring to bring them on there however they asked you to come on you knew the topic you get on here you start to answer the questions you act like it's problematic to have this conversation yet on your platform you had this conversation you you brought this up and you go on CNN and then you're told you this woman had nothing she's doing her job come on there and do your job right you take a sex a sex stimulant talk talk about a man who's abusive disrespectful to women all the things you take a sex stimulant and then you um um proceed to talk about getting cheeks disrespecting this woman on literally her show her platform on CNN and you're disrespecting the whole interview camon would never allow somebody to go to his stuff period and get on there and start behaving like that on his stuff he would literally been get the [ __ ] off my show it would have been my stuff and disrespecting my show so C 's excuse after this whole thing um was oh you know like they asking me about Diddy and I'm like what the hell don't don't ask me about Diddy like it's mace doing they don't even know that mace be out here feeding the kids no he was something like you know talking to kids every day that kind of thing they don't know mace is doing good in the community here's the thing they don't know because you didn't say it in that interview you could have said you know what Ma is somebody that made it out and he was attacked by Diddy and some way and that's what he was asking him about exactly you could have said mace made it out and here's what mace is doing for the community think that we should focus on while Diddy did do a lot of bad things to people mace was one of the ones that made it out mace was one of the ones that walked away and decided to do better from that it would have been that but you went around and you're making an excuse for disrespecting that lady you could have said that in the interview have some theum because you wouldn't let nobody do that on your platform yeah I agree that there was no excuse for his behavior however I do believe that CNN as you said Rebecca should not be looking at black people as a as a one siiz fits all as this is the type of person I want to have this type of conversation with we should look at his history just over the past few months and saying things like oh y'all can't cancel me y'all can't cancel me he talks about women in a certain way he talks about gay people a certain way they there's a whole culture of people that he will not lose based on this character that he's presenting not one person is not gonna that loves cam is not gonna listen to cam because this happened so I believe that this was just really a bad uh casting when it comes to on CNN I'm really sorry that this happened to her like especially being that she's you know really trying to address a serious issue this was not the person I believe actually think this right here is not about black people and this is about hip hop let me explain why Cameron is actually dead [ __ ] wrong the actual larger indictment is that this kind of [ __ ] abuse is rampant and acceptable in hip-hop culture like that is actually what is really like at issue here right is that you [ __ ] know what the [ __ ] Diddy is like you [ __ ] have known when your [ __ ] greats and your icons abuse women and you go on about it and that misogynist is Common Place in the hipop community that's the real serious [ __ ] indictment so it's [ __ ] crazy that in a time when someone your one of your icons is literally in four [ __ ] K like doing this recognizing this and you as somebody who is in that Community as somebody who is respected and why and know able rapper has an opportunity to say no seriously to take it seriously to show that you you believe in something different or to say to to reflect to be a spok a spokesperson for a different perspective in the hip-hop Community you decide to demonstrate exactly how [ __ ] like this comes to be because you [ __ ] don't have no [ __ ] respect for women that's what that is so no it ain't this ain't about CNN looking for no black man to be a monolith this has everything to do with these [ __ ] being jackasses and this ways let me tell you it really there's ack La of respect I've never the level of sexism that I see from this like side of the verse like the side of the hip-hop verse the content creator verse the ones that there with them is in [ __ ] sane like the way they deal with women like I it's incredible to me talk to a man like that and that's what I want to stop to say this too whenever women and I noticed as a woman who is like does this stuff professionally everybody feels like they get to litigate how the woman responded or how she deals with it and I hate the idea that you only get a [ __ ] stamp of approval if you quietly and politely and Olivia Pope like take disrespect right like if this woman all men don't put up with [ __ ] like this men be on their shows disrespecting their guest throwing people off doing whatever and he kind of what the same way camon could bring his ass here on CNN and act a plum [ __ ] fool but this woman got to sit here and like politely politely keep going these nigg are out of pocket she should have threw his black ass off that [ __ ] show re I totally agree with everything that you said my only point is in this era right now where people are paying attention to how you behave how you present like what you represent he has said I don't care about what y'all think I am going to act in ass this is what my platform is going to be that's all I'm saying is he said yo he's already told us he don't care he's already told us I'm gonna say the things that and y'all can't cancel me because this is who I am this is the brand that I've I branded myself as and I'm not changing this is what he said and I'm talking about recently I'm talking about recently actually saying y'all ain't going to change anything I want to say if I want to say gay people this if I want to say bit Part of Me Okay CNN didn't say C and CNN didn't the Abby Phillips did not tell him not to feel that way not to say that none of it so he brought that energy and first of all Cameron allegedly even with who he was dating right formerly has um history that is abusive himself so just coming on when we're talking about an abusive man and then you come on and your respecting a woman uh and acting as if she like this is the type of don't don't don't get on her with that energy cuz if it wasn't something that he didn't care about he wouldn't even bring it up on his own platform again you can decline to answer there are ways to do that and you interview he every day here's what's important this man wanted to do that he got the request and he made a decision that he going to come there he is like that what from beginning to end this woman is not asking him anything requires him to decline to answer or anything like that he brought his ass up there to [ __ ] do that he consciously decided he was going to go on CNN and be [ __ ] disrespectful and that and the fact that that's even [ __ ] okay is what crazy because if the RS were reversed yeah this is my point that I said way early in this episode that I'm I'm worried that talking about domestic violence is GNA turn to this like reality televis type you know aspect to it because why the [ __ ] we living in bu's episodes this is just so silly to me the fact that you invited this [ __ ] is crazy the fact that this [ __ ] decided to go on and be ass gr like this is just so unserious and this is me what's actually sad what's s to me is not even that it's sad that you invited this [ __ ] it's sad that [ __ ] decide to represent themselves this way like people should be able to think that [ __ ] that that that like pillars or notable people in the hip-hop Community should be able to come discuss [ __ ] that's happening with [ __ ] they have known and with or or worked with for years like you should be able to it to me it's a dangerous what's actually unfortunate is for a [ __ ] to act a way that makes it do seem like you know what you wrong to ever think that [ __ ] could have had something intelligent to say like is that the message you want to I agree you but if you gon act like it look I'm just saying that everybody yo a lot of these a lot we have to leave some of them behind like at this point that's just what it is you just out the everybody can't go you know what I'm saying you can't put these this this certain sector they are dangerous not only to women but to men to their children to everything to everything that we trying to do change address they don't care there's no amount of sense that's gonna get through to him it isn't he's soaking the misogyny for me for me as an educator like it's hard for me to accept people like need to be left behind oh no understand like it's hard for me like my top is educate like so I think the issue that I had with this H particular thing is like he's he is agreeing that whatever is on the video is harmful but I think something with men is we can't call the man an abuser right I he not no he isn't truly agreeing he say it's egregious but then he proceedes it's like a dismissal like he knows that he yeah it's like this is bad but like I happens when you think something is egregious you know what kind of word egregious is when you think some when you say some [ __ ] is egregious and you believe it's egregious [ __ ] you're not like and no one ever has seriously been like whoa that's egregious [ __ ] don't ask me but [ __ ] none of that that got do with that's not when you think some [ __ ] is egregious that's just when you know at the bare minimum you have to say that so that the [ __ ] who going to C for you going to be like he said it was wrong you obviously were not particularly [ __ ] moved by it like you that's that's what he went out of his way to demonstrate is that I don't really give a [ __ ] and if you don't really give a [ __ ] you didn't think the [ __ ] was egregious for real for real like that's that's that's what we gotta keep it [ __ ] real about like nah this [ __ ] you know what I don't like about every single time I see Cameron in real life I think Cameron has one of the most underrated acting performances ever in pyton full but the problem is every time I see this [ __ ] I'd be like is this you you really want to be in real life that's so crazy to me like you know no ceron used to be my baby daddy like he used to be my baby daddy when I was younger I was a kid right you know and I remember him being in the drip you know the pink and all the good stuff whatever that Miami song that he made whatever it was but he was so fine to me right that's how I se the rappers are fine that's my baby daddy then I started to see how he talks to women how he treats women um the history with him and and his ex just in that I'm like this are we really bringing him on to have these type of conversations and then to him for him to come on to have this type of conversation and really deliver in that way he didn't have to he chose to do that on purpose and that's that's where my problem lies you didn't have to disrespect the uh um the the um TV I don't like that Abby Phillips we know already she's been having it tough since she got on the see and and people disrespect her and she has to stand her having to sit there and listen to this man talk about taking a sex stimulant cuz he about to go get cheeks later is so like don't disrespect my craft don't get on here and disrespect me as a this ain't this ain't that and it's exactly and by the way [ __ ] like that lets you know why these [ __ ] be getting charged in real life let me just say this not like not to do a cameraon but like [ __ ] will be so upset about a me too movement [ __ ] be up in arms about the idea of HR they be so up like up in arms about anything be inappropriate but like how do you move through your professional life if to you it makes perfect sense to be on CNN with a [ __ ] woman and say you going to go you taking your your thing so you could go get some cheeks like how do you believe like this act in their private professional lives like what do you say to your assistants what do you think is normal for you to do in front of people that you work with how do you deal with the women that run to get your drinks you know what I'm saying you bought that at a gas station before this like that's CRA and had it in your PO no that's his that's his that's his that's his thing he used the moment as marketing for his product but even so it was still just a have to do that there's nobody on CNN to use that moment to disrespect that woman to promote his his [ __ ] like that even more problematic like that's he knew he knew it would be a viral moment this will go viral and then he gonna go get some cheeks people gonna go get his txt stimulant and at the end of it to do that yo who booked me for this like what this is crazy yo like son no that's really it was t it was behav like that that's very questionable to that he could have said the exact same if he had any feelings of that like why am I here there was a respectful way to have that conversation I agree with y'all he chose that for real he every moment of that he wanted to that disrespect he wanted y'all to feel this way and that's why I said some of them Pier I'm sorry I tried to talk to I see I be not wanting to use the b word and the nword on here but I be trying to talk to [ __ ] and at some point I be like yo you [ __ ] can go I'm good I'mma try to save the other ones that actually have a fighting chance but some of y'all is just dead weight and I know y'all don't want to hear that about our people but some of them are everybody can't come that's what I'm saying like I mean I'm roing for everybody black I say that all the time I'm roing for everybody black everybody doesn't act but everybody don't act in Black I'm rooting for everybody black but a lot of people don't act in Blackness there's a lot of people that are acting in whiteness and those are not black people to me so when I say I'm rooting for everybody black I want us all to win or want wi win I never be in nobody's politics don't have me in nobody's position to power because I'm efficient but I'm just gonna be a one man Sho of listening I'm telling you [ __ ] will [ __ ] will pop up missing in the middle of the night like I would get rid of that's it you only think I thought Thanos got wrong I swear to God I have a Funko about my B my uh boyfriend got me for Christmas because the only thing I think Thanos got wrong was being random like it's not random like don't randomly get know you need to I turn I would get [ __ ] out of here if y ever heard my dream Not only would I get [ __ ] I thought this through Not only would I get [ __ ] out of here I'd get anyone who' miss them out of here if you have much allegiance to a [ __ ] that gotta go you gotta go if you might miss the [ __ ] that I got anybody who I even feel might when you you need to just wake up in my new world and just be happy for the assets you have don't ask nothing but these missing people if you say [ __ ] about a missing [ __ ] you got to go I understand Harriet T every the more I live every day I wake up I understand Harriet and I feel so bad for her because I know she's looking down being like you're still dealing with this we are auntie we are and I get it I'm so close I'm so close to just having to I think I'm make that our official wrap up the show [Music]
