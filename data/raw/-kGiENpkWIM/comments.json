Why does it matter if she said she was gonna \"keep it in house\" then decide not to? People can't change their mind? Also, why did she have to believe his ex? I mean that's not healthy to jump in a new relationship and just take the exes side. I just don't understand your point (on the first comment).",

Especially since she admitted to experiencing some signs of abuse early in the relationship. Both of those things tells her what she needs to know. Her sitting online smiling and acting like everything is wonderful knowing he was abusive to her and the ex is a huge problem. \n\nAnd if it is okay for her to disbelieve his ex about something like an abortion that he made her have, why are y'all are claiming people should believe her. It goes both ways. So that's a crazy hypocritical position to take. Too many women diminish the experiences of other women only for it to turn around and happen to them in MOST cases. You are right that black women are not believed often, that's because far too many black women don't listen to and believe other women. We have a huge Pick Me culture that is detrimental to women at large.",

He knew exactly what he was doing when he started courting conservative Christian personalities and conspiracy theorists despite having spoken out against them for his entire career. Then when the documentary came out, it was “see! I warned you this would happen! Now that I’m speaking the truth, they’re trying to silence me and smear my name!” Then another allegation came out, and he announced he was a Christian. Then he was baptised by Bear Grylls in the River Thames (which is full of sewage 🤢). He also has a Messiah complex just like Diddy.",

Especially one that doesn't involve me in anyway whatsoever. My whole life it has felt as those I can never be wronged due to my size and blackness. Hearing a panel of progressive black people defend me themselves without knowing me is powerful. If nothing else you changed my life tonight and bolstered my desire and energy to fight. \n\nAgain, thank you, beautiful black people. You saved me tonight.

    "text": "I hope the term reactive abuse fades soon. We need to call it what it is self defense. People are getting abused. It's human to have the right to defend ourselves. It not might be the most healthy or ideal thing, but it's human in the face of being abused. With healing we can help recovery time from reactive activation. I've been abused by multiple people my entire life and it just fucking hurts to see victims and survivors and the surviving getting victim blamed with that term. It sucks, because there is real, deep, heavy guilt and shame that comes with having to defend yourself at times against people you love and want around and have tried everything you could think of or create to try to help them, you, the situation...It's hopeful though, because people are using it and addressing things we need to so we can finally call it by it's name self defense. For those who've been in or going through abusive relationships, especially the ones that can't currently safely escape, I hope we all start forgiving ourselves for having to defend ourselves at times when we just want to be allowed to live.",

I grew up in the 80s went to high school and uni in the 90s and I've been having the same conversations about sexual violence, intimate partner violence, and emotional abuse since I was 13. So little has changed. \nI'm not Black so I obviously can't speak to any of the stuff you talked about that's specific to the Black community but there are some things that remind of trying to talk about these topics withing the queer community. Like, people want to believe that abuse is a strictly straight thing and violence between people of the same gender doesn't count because there's no \"inherent\" power difference. Or, if you try to talk about it people want you to keep it quiet because you shouldn't be \"airing our dirty laundry\" and making us look bad to the straights. \nI think it's really important to have spaces like this where people within marginalized communities can talk honestly about this shit.",

    "text": "In the beginning, Tahoe talks about how hard it was to believe the level of harm and evil Diddy was capable of, and that is discussed a lot in spaces about trauma. Abusers use people's optimisim or kindness against bystanders. They know that people dont want to believe that someone is capable of being that purposlessly cruel to a person they say they love. It is more comfortable for a lot of people to believe Cassie is lying instead of the reality of Diddy's widespread abuse. \n\nI think one of the reason women tend to believe abuse stories is not just because of the increased likelyhood of being victims ourselves but its the actual SEEING how that person changes from public to private settings. Seeing the mask drop, when they know they have the ability in that moment to do their abuse, it feels unbelievable to witness (and there are plenty of abuse survivors that stay because you completely divorce the \"good/nice\" them from the \"abusive\" them to cope). That someone can be the best, most respected person in some area of their public lives, and so unhinged in their private lives. It changes how you view/trust everyone, and i think there are a lot of men that just have never really seen that.",

I’ve never been in a relationship mostly because I don’t want to bring a stranger around my father and I know that at the present moment I wouldn’t make a good partner. The hotel video was triggering for me because my father chased after my brother and I, in 2022 after another physical fight between the three of us (there’s been many) and we decided to go to our grandparents house and he chases after us with a broom hitting my car hood and cracking my windshield. There’s still dents in my hood and he finally had to pay up to get my windshield fixed because I couldn’t pass inspection. There’s so much I’ve more but this comment is already mad long",

The most demented shit I've ever heard he had twisted a super innocent young woman into doing. What i learned, quickly, and frustratingly growing up with only 2 older brothers was just how much a woman will *endure* because they feel there's no way out OR have been deluded into thinking that reprehensible behavior by men is acceptable. It makes sense, and I am reminded of when my brothers and I got bullied by guys in our neighborhood (real sandlot or a christmas story type local bullies). We were able to fight back at what those boys did cause of our size growing up though many thinner guys around couldn't and just hid, basically.\n\nThose smaller guys that couldnt fight those bullies is every girl. What more a responsibility ANY man ought make who has the means to help like my brothers and I did for each other does anyone need? We grew up and were able to feel secure due to the protection we perceived in each other. Women deserve that same peace of mind.\n\nMy wife & I just had our first kid, a son, and something we both want to instill is the humble protector mentality - real Aragorn type man who looks out for his fellows at great risk to himself. Like thwt little boy who took a dog biting his head to save his little sister and blew up in the news years back. It's a rare breed of man these days I feel that fell out of popular media as all the WW2 vets started dying and men have 0 real masculine role models that aren't toxic or clout chasing.",

I think I crossed expressing to someone my needs and feelings can lead to an argument which automatically leads to yelling and slammed doors. I know that's not the case now but it took so many years to actually start unpacking why I am the way I am. Yes, the Diddy situation highlights even more how much the entertainment business enables people like this. However, unfortunately some people have seen this right in their homes. They lived this. That's another reason so many people don't want to dig deeper into why it keeps happening.",

Please, please know that these conversations are so so important, and I thank you for making a platform and taking the time to share it.\n\n\nTW discussions of physical abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI didn't know reactive abuse had a word, but I definitely remember saying to one of my exes, \"Oh, we're doing this now?\" because she tried to say that I wasn't giving her enough, and \"oh, how dare you need space\". I'm so, so grateful that I had the strength to stick to my guns. At the time, I was in a poly relationship structure, and she was one of my girlfriends. She threatened my other girlfriend, and tried to sow doubt and anger in me about her. She tried to get me to leave, and turn me against her and my friends. I'm so glad my friends, family and other girlfriend didn't give up on me. I was so strongly in denial, but my other girlfriend finally convinced me to get out.\n\nI remember one night the abusive girlfriend slapped me on the ass, and I told her not to do that. Another night, she slapped me on the ass AGAIN, and it was much harder than the first time. I yelped, said \"I told you not to do that!\" I felt humiliated and vulnerable. And she said \"I forgot\" and \"I was having fun\". And I remember thinking, after that happened, \"This is how it starts.\" That was the moment I knew I had to leave.\n\nI couldn't find a way to get out, and away, fully. We tried to be friends, but we got really close and touchy at one point, and she said she wanted us to get back together. I missed her, and I missed the connection, but not enough to put me through the hell she gave me again. She scared me. \n\nEventually, I broke down and blocked her everywhere without a word, on an impulse. She figured it out by the next morning, and called me on a Restricted phone number, since I had blocked her number, to chew me out. The most cunning thing about that is that I couldn't even get a phone number off of that for my records. I couldn't block it. I think I had a panic attack that day, after I hung up. I was physically shaking and crying and hyperventilating because I was terrified she would show up at my apartment when I went back to school.\n\nI got a no contact order against her at school, and that expires when one of us graduates (we met at college). I'm terrified of that day, and it's coming up. I'm going into my senior year in August.",

    "text": "Another awesome video and I really appreciate everyone who shared their experiences. And I'm trying my best to describe something I've been thinking about that the Camron interview further brought up. Where yes, it wasn't a good idea for CNN to bring someone with the attitude and rhetoric of Camron on. But also, we can critique the fact that he went on there and chose to act the way that he did with the news anchor. It's true that we can't 100% control someone's behavior when they choose to do something wrong but it's also not impossible to try to uphold standards for conduct. \n\nI see sometimes that people will highlight the initial part of something like this, where someone who typically hasn't shown that they are a good choice for the conversation/situation will be in it. And the critique will be levied at having that person involved because \"Why would anyone think they would be better than that?\" or \"It is what it is, they should have already known how this person would be\" (and I'm talking about the people who don't think situations like Camron being disrespectful to the anchor and the topic on CNN are that big of a deal for the problematic reasons they have, not where Tahoe is coming from). But an important point is that if he was going to choose to go on CNN, there were basic levels of conduct described that would have been easy to follow instead of the disrespect he showed. And in an ideal world, critiquing his conscious disrespect wouldn't be such an issue.\n\nIt's really something when I see people that are more mad at the critique leveled at someone like Camron than at his behavior. More mad that we don't see it as an \"It is what it is\" situation (partially because of patriarchy, y'all are right that the roles reversed or him talking with another man wouldn't have yielded the same reactions or conduct) but as behavior we need to further discourage. He is who he chooses to be but also, there can be consequences for that choice. We shouldn't stop having these standards for conduct just because some people aren't meeting them. And that needs to count more in general society too.",

Forgiveness is optional to the abuser but you need to forgive yourself for falling for such fuckery,  checking power is mandatory but walking away is the long term solution as its the penalty of such abuse.

I was caught in 3 long term relationships that lasted over 10 years before I finally had enough and decided to be single.\n\nAnd yeah, my mother is a very overbearing very Christian black woman who treated me more like an extension of my dad than her son. Lots of emotional abuse and manipulation and guilting coming from her, to this day.\n\nAnd yes. I am mixed. Dad is Scottish (Anglo af), Mom is Nigerian.",

The con was he’s the man and he takes care of things and he was older so he always said he was experienced. When he got angry he’d beat up the people around him horribly and it was horrifying and embarrassing. They remained his friend and never pressed charges…nothing. He kept guns and I won’t lie I was scared he wasn’t the funny well mannered guy I fell for. I ignored the first red flag when he accused me of sneaking around with a friend smh.

    "text": "I think the mistake CNN made was inviting someone on the show to talk about abuse who has a history of being an abuser himself. A lot of the way he acted struck me as 1. indifference to the topic because he didn't think it was that big a deal, 2. defensiveness, because if they're trying to get him to say Diddy is a bad person, that means he has to think that about himself as well, and 3. guilt. For him to admit he DID see signs of that in Diddy a long time ago, or that he KNEW Cassie or others had been abused, that means he said nothing and did nothing to stop it. It means he is complicit, and none of these men in the hip-hop community want to admit they're part of the problem. Just like when the MeToo movement was sweeping through Hollywood, most men were quiet on the subject because they knew damn well they could (and likely should) be next. \n\nAlso, it seems like in the hip-hop industry, they are reluctant to speak negatively on their own to anyone on the outside. Just like comedians have been reluctant to say anything negative about Louis C.K. or Dave Chappelle. They talk a lot about how comedians should be able to say whatever they want with no recourse, and Louis should get a second chance. Why? Because they know they have either said or done problematic things in the past or want to be able to in the future without facing any consequences.",

    "text": "I'm still not finished watching this video (currently 48 minutes in), but I feel compelled to highlight a fundamental issue in this otherwise insightful discussion. Abuse is indeed a learned behaviour, but it's crucial to understand that the very concept of \"abuse\" is also a product of societal conditioning. Colonial oppression has stifled the authentic expression of emotions for all people, not just Black and marginalized communities. \n\nAbuse can be unlearned, just as it is learned. Society must address the broader context of emotional expression and the criminalization of anger and violence. Anger, a necessary and natural emotion, is often misunderstood and suppressed, leading to its explosive and abusive manifestations. We need to stop criminalizing anger and instead focus on understanding and addressing it constructively.\n\nIt's essential to differentiate between abusive conduct and the actions of angry, neglected individuals who lack the tools to process and express their emotions. Figures like Diddy, Dre, Simmons, and Cosby are capital-A Abusers who exploit their power in psychopathic ways. In contrast, people like Tahoe and those Pierre mentioned likely grew up without the emotional education necessary for healthy relationships. \n\nThis distinction is not to excuse or diminish the harm caused by either group but to highlight that one form of abuse stems from a deep-seated, systemic lack of emotional maturity. While psychopaths in positions of power are likely to reoffend, society has the potential to reform and reeducate those who lack emotional tools, provided we stop condemning violence and anger outright and start addressing them as symptoms of broader social failings.\n\nAs a Black woman, I see everyday microaggressions, systemic racism, and institutional discrimination as far more violent and abusive due to their generational impact. These are the learned behaviours we must focus on if we truly want to address abuse at its roots.",

Hip hop reps lifestyles of the rich and famous,  it's the Godfather, Scarface  and Playboy; it is a celebration of success and the power of celebrity,  it's the glorification money/ hustle culture and exploitation and yes it is ugly. That's why America's real Oligarchs don't talk about getting cheeks on CNN or what really goes on behind close doors at the after after party. PR industry exists  to spin and gaslight us of any news that gets out but every once and a while we learn eg Ellen, Harvey Weinstein, Jeffrey Epstein, Bill Clinton or the Wolf of Wall street. Yes something is wrong within Hip hop and it is as American as Apple pie.",

I could tell they were somewhat romantically involved?  because every once in a while I'd be able to hear them yelling things like \"I'll never have your children!\". I told the super of my building, but was afraid of calling the police in case I was mistaken and someone was just dealing with a panic attack/meltdown, and was also afraid of getting involved myself physically as a woman living alone; I still think about that situation regularly, and wonder what I should have done.

        "text": "depends on state/city if in the US. If it involves police that can escalate violence, especially if the woman/victim (based on context) is trauma bonded enough to defend their abuser. Cops rarely intervene and when they do, if they post bail it can get nasty. *I'm an abolitionist so have strong options here but cops really don't handle DV well on average* \n\nSome places send social service professionals to do wellness checks though  Again it depends on your local PD, how you feel bout cops, and other factors like the presence of a firearm. \n\nBeing a neighbor and introducing yourself when the partner is not around and making it clear you're a safe place to go to. You might not know it's abuse, they might not want to label it that or be ready to, or a lot of other factors. Personally I'd call local resources like shelters or survivor advocates who may have resources or references that are helpful, especially with legal advocacy. When I've called places like that they are usually happy to share resources at minimum and potentially advice. Even knowing that there are people to call for help is reassuring so having those numbers on hand to offer is helpful. \n\n*Judging the relationship can cause denial and evasion so all of this is tricky and challenging to say the least",

They may know it is happening or could be, but because they do not personally witness it, it is easy for them to not think further into it. \nI called my ex MIL many times to come get her son when he was putting his hands on me, but after he left, and came back into our then home to attack me, she still saw me as problematic when I went and filed a restraining order against him. Even though she scolded him for putting his hands on me, she had a problem when it came to him being held legally responsible for his actions.",

To put it in context, according to Cam said they never told him what the interview was going to be about and he was upset about being ask about the questions so he basically disrespected her because he felt he was being disrespectful back and promoted his products.   He did make reference to her speaking to Mase \n\nIf this is True.  Then that's the Cam you will get.  If not he's just being Cam'ron aka Ass.  \n\nThe brother on the pod who spoke about Cam is 100% correct. They should've known what they were getting.\n\nCam from the 90s. He ain't changing who he has always been.\n\nCam is like this to Man women whoever.  Not siding with him just saying he an Ass . If it was a man wouldn't be any different.  In Cams case",

The idea of people acting against their better interests for my sake feels wrong. I worry about people agreeing with me just to agree with me. I have an ego, I admit that. But whenever I think for even a moment what that ego being unchecked would be, I become terrified of that hypothetical version of me. I fear being a monster, not just the consequences. I have a chronic need to make things right when I make mistakes. I feel distressed at the idea of not being able to do that. I fear my own anger because it is the only part of me that might be able to reach that darkness. If I did what Diddy did to Cassie I would 💀🔫.
