I am one of the directors and founders of the midwestern marks Institute um I'm a philosopher I teach uh philosophy at Southern Illinois University I am a Cuban American and um I spend most of my time writing or or doing various forms of popular education whether it's the classes that we do through the Institute or the other forms of more public writing that uh that the academy kind of shuns but that uh I think is is essential um for anyone who considers himself a Marxist and a scholar so uh before anything I just want to I want to say I I was actually pretty shocked by something I saw today just from Midwestern marks and I can't believe it but I I didn't know I didn't understand it because you know why do you guys just hate Jews so much no in all seriousness I saw a tweet from you guys and what does it actually say the Tweet reads I'm going to paraphrase it something along the lines of the Jewish working class is not your enemy Finance capital is pretty straightforward okay but somehow a swarm of and I usually don't talk about leftists but I kind of see how you guys are under attack now in a lot of ways that we were in the beginning of when infrared was launching and I just it's incredible because all these left commoms I mean pan leftist what I like to call them because they're from across the board right they all have this unanimous agreement that that tweet was somehow anti-semitic which kind of seems like they're telling on themselves or what I mean what how does that work if you say Finance capital and they say oh you must mean Jews what what is going on you know it's and and the saddest part has is that these are people that you click on their profile and they have a hammer in yeah and they can't they can't uh recognize that this is a basic term in Marxist in the Marxist tradition and not even in the Marxist tradition just in in general political economy everyone knows what is referred to by Finance Capital so it's it's pretty absurd especially because I mean the whole purpose of the Tweet is to combat this Rising anti-Semitism that I don't for the slightest bit think is spontanous um it just so happens that right at the time when it's undeniable how badly the Zionist Nazi entity is losing the information War perhaps the most important War besides the one that they're losing on the ground to uh the forces of resistance uh right at that time when it becomes a a conscious process of reflection in the leaders of the West that they're losing the information War there's a sudden spike in the most politicized social media platform and anti-Semitism of course it serves the purpose of of uh legitimizing the claims of of of Israel uh that anti-zionist uh anti-zionist discourse is actually anti-semitic which I mean it's it's pretty absurd for a few reasons first the Palestinians are semites um so that's kind of strange uh second L some of the leading voices uh in opposing Zionism have been Jewish people uh that's something that we've seen with massive protests in the US a lot of them have been led by uh primarily Jewish organizations another thing Zionist is a bastard child of imperialism it has nothing to do with Jewish self-determination um it uh it's precisely the connection that it has with British and American imperialism that allows it to even survive and uh what's being criticized is the culmination of a 75e ethnic cleansing that has led to uh to an intensification of the genocide when in October 7th the Palestinians bravely uh attempted to escape the the prison that they've been contained in um for for decades known as Gaza a place where 75% of the people um uh ended up at they were displaced from other parts of Palestine so uh criticizing that horrendous condition that depicts I think the bankruptcy of uh the capitalist imperialist project at a more bound stage is definitely not anti- anti-jewish it's definitely not anti-semitic but they it's explicit why they do this and uh the leftists just feed into it they feed into it and uh the way that these algorithms work is that it creates these positive feedback loops that end up influencing people who somehow 6 months plus in might be neutral on this issue and they see the leftist say one thing then they see the uh I'm pretty sure not very spontaneous rtist uh jump on and say well who are the real Finance capitalist it's um and it just feeds into this anti-Semitism that just divides us uh this is something that uh marks writing on the Irish Question uh and on the question of American slavery these are just like tools that the ruling class uses to divide working people and Marx has a he refers to it as the secret the secret through which the ruling class sustains its power um so it it serves to divide and to um to recuperate this increasing uh elevation of consciousness it's surrounded by the fact that people are seeing a genocide unfold on their phones and they're beginning to draw other connections besides the Israel Palestine affair they were beginning to question the system as a whole and um in times of Crisis capitalism has always turned to Nazism and fascism so that's what we're seeing before our eyes and at a time when groups like ours and and and like the infered collective are are trying to combat this for these leftists to come after us uh just shows that the Stalin once said they are objectively the left wing of fascism yes because it's curious they've contributed nothing to the effort to curtail the rise of this new form of anti-communism which you know as you mentioned uh I don't know actually if you mentioned this directly but it it it's a swipe against us why anti-communism at this moment in the form of anti-Semitism why now why why communism why are they mentioning communism you know it's not like there's a communist movement it's because of us gaining traction us gaining Steam and many people recognize it some positively and others are very terrified of it actually they're very dis d brought now I I I do find it interesting because when you probe into the leftist arguments more or less it seems like they are saying something along the lines of well why are you privileging or focusing on finance Capital when industrial capital is just as much what upholds capitalism and is a part of capitalism and then I see it's funny because you guys are just linking Lenin's imperialism and I I I think um I don't know if it's like Lost in Translation or something but do people not know that Monopoly capital is finance Capital that they're one in the same thing because so-called industrial Capital was the type of capital that Marx was primarily describing in capital volume 1 which is the traditional form of industrial kind of commodity production and reaping a profit based on the sale of Commodities directly and accumulating capital on the basis of surpluses reap thereof that form of capital does not exist anymore it's been completely subsumed by Monopoly Capital so I would even go so far as to say because people are say well you just side with industrial Capital rather than Finance capital and I'm like okay show me the industrial Capital there isn't every single independent let's say entrepreneurial or Industrial interest is dependent through debt on finance capital and if they're not in debt directly the only way they can Ascend in terms of the expansion of their business operations is by having funds allocated to them by Finance Capital right so the notion that there's even such a thing as industrial capitalism anymore is an absurdity where are the industrial capitalists they've all been subsumed in a hierarchy Archy the top of which is Monopoly Finance capital I mean even I mean Lenin observed that to be true for his time keep that in mind it's especially true in today's era where it's even gone further in the degree of abstraction from real production and you know well well well you know most of this nonsense comes from a guy nam I don't know if you know him familiar with him his name is moi postone and he's a kind of darling of the leftcom crowd so-called leftcom crowd you know the the non- stalinist left and post Stone kind of came up with a brilliant idea that basically you can be anti-semitic without mentioning Jews he called it structural anti-Semitism so when you personify capital in any kind of way when you associate Capital with a specific Concrete in interest of any kind rather than a pure abstract structural relationship that's actually a form of structural anti-Semitism so for example uh thank you so much sty so for example if we say that you know okay there is a monopolist ruling class it's act it's an actual concrete class with a concrete class interest and it's like controlling the government and it's starting all these wars and it's ruling society as a ruling class it's in the name postone would say well you're not mentioning Jews but the similarities with anti-semitic conspiracy theories are so Stark and and they parallel each other so strongly that you're actually a structural anti-semite so that's where this idea comes from and it's interesting because the the Vogue high IQ Marxism of the left coms because keep in mind these people have this idea that it's kind of funny they're like oh you guys are MLS that must mean you're like idiots we're actually the guys who like think there's even this this like meme that like oh lefts read a lot of books no they don't right but anyway um the Vogue idea interpretation of Marxism is that classes are just pure structural relationships and patterns which have nothing to do with concrete interests it's actually just a kind of specific form right of society which is totally impersonal which totally is abstracted from any kind of like real Flesh and Blood interests and that you know they they identify this roughly and it's all bundled up in what they call the value form it's kind of German value form Theory right and this is where this kind of notion of capital as this Transcendent Force comes oh Capital has subsumed everything oh capital is doing this capital is doing that how can we escape Capital it's just so in Escape capable and it's like marks and Engles are writing yeah the process of capital accumulation inevitably is laying the foundation for its own dissolution like the acceleration of capitalism is laying the foundation for a transition into a new mode of production these guys are saying no no actually the fact that the origins of socialism are from capitalism means that it is forever tainted by it that everything we call socialism in history is actually just capital ISM because it Bears the birth marks of this prior mode of production and capital is this Transcendent inescapable Force which is totally impersonal has nothing to do with concrete class interests or Collective interests or groups of people and that if you if you departure from this let's call it abstract Marxism you are no different from a fascist or an anti-semite because their mistake is personifying capital and attributing to it concrete interest so that's really where they're coming from That's the basis upon which they associate your Tweet with anti-Semitism right and thank you thank you for sharing that I hadn't heard of these figures um but what they're doing is the same thing that has been Central to bouro political economy forever which is treating capitalism as this it's allowed to flourish um and you can get deeper into this by talking about how they speak about human nature um Etc but it's it's completely baseless um and as you mentioned there are tendencies that consider themselves to be within Marxism I don't know if I would consider them to be so but uh who do think in these ways and um an interesting critique uh of that way of trans historicizing capitalism emerges in Ellen mik Woods book the origins of capitalism where she goes over the different forms that that's taken specifically in different so-called Marxist spaces and what's interesting also about these value formed people and I've read some of them uh specifically because I in some of my research I try to see the homologies of the Ascension to the concrete in Marxist capital and the three volumes and Hegel science of logic and some of these people work within that area people like Christopher AR Arthur and Tony Smith and others and uh what what's interesting is that the the sort of groups the clicks that they're working with which include people like Michael Hinrich just wrote Carl marks and and the birth of modern society as a historian he's okay um but as a as a theorist of political economy they're rejecting the foundation of Marxist political economy by rejecting the reality of contradictory value production um so just from from there on you you realize that this is a way of thinking that cannot grapple with contradictions objective contradictions and uh if you can't do that there's there's no semblance of Marxism in your outlook what's interesting about this reaction which is very unexpected because I think we had made a similar tweet a few days back and it just went viral as normal and there was no reaction it was this one person that started commenting and then people saw that person commenting and then started getting into it and then somehow the uh the folks from the right get into it in the other side and it just creates this this cycle of idiots talking to each other um and I think it's it's a good depiction of how in many ways uh what you have is a mirroring of these positions a a left that uh sustains its identity by just being anti-right and a right that sustains its identity by just being anti-left and their positions end up just being a mirror of each other whatever the other is it's just a an immediate opposition and um it's ridiculous because as as Lenin uh had a pointed out more than a hundred years ago Finance capital is the dominant form of capitalism in the stage of imperialism it consists of a merger between Banking and Industrial Capital so it's it's not like when you say Finance Capital you're keeping industrial Capital out of the conversation you're just um you're bringing up a specific type of relationship that this industrial Capital now has to a form of banking Finance capital and um if if you look at some of the profits of the Fortune 500 companies the vast majority I think Michael Hudson's uh pointed to like 95% um of it comes from interest stock BuyBacks and uh rents so it basically Finance uh Capital so it's become the principal form of accumulation uh it's developed uh distinctive forms of um of contradictions in society I think the contradiction between uh the contradiction that's present in debt is is one that's intensifying more and more specifically within what what we've called that the Institute the repr proletariat uh this portion of the American uh working class that elevated itself to uh this position of middle class um it uh you know to use engel's term it B wasfi itself and uh has now landed once again in precarity in a position where there's no Economic Security uh and uh where the minimal capacity to accumulate that embodied the fact that they were able own house and car and all that stuff is is gone and this is the positive way of formulating I think the what's been accepted as the death of the middle classes and a lot of the central contradictions that these people uh exist in with capital is not necessarily uh through a process of extracting Surplus value because they they're they're not the proletariat they're part of the larger toiling masses the working masses but they're not the proletarian they're not the class that's producing Surplus value um in many ways you know as we know marks points to in volumes two and three of capital it is on the basis of the extraction of surplus value from this other class that the salaries and wages of these agents of circulation uh arise uh but the central contradiction that they find themselves into with with capital is debt um a lot of them are in tremendous debt just for for trying to get uh by and uh markx uh prophetic as as as he is uh did notice that this was going to be an increasing tend uh Trend in in capitalism uh the indebting of the working class and in the third volume he calls it the secondary form of exploitation the one that occurs after the direct moment of production I think that's one of the primary forms of exploitation that we have today and to have people who consider themselves marxists who identify as as as as marxists um go out and say that we can't speak about Finance Capital when it is the form of capital that uh is at the center of some of the most principal contradictions that we have in our era it's just ludicrous it's it's Insanity uh but it shows that for for these people communism is just a label um I call them in in in my book The Purity fetish the identity socialist it's just an identity there's no actual incorporation into any movements that attempt to build power uh for the working class by the working class uh and it's just a social click uh that's that's all it is all they're really interested in is having a a small group of people whom they can uh guarantee that whatever ideas arise in their head those people agree with them purely it's it's a commitment to these abstract pure ideals that uh are not necessarily realizable in the world anytime soon and if you don't share them you're getting condemned uh so it's just clicks that surround uh themselves around these weird pure abstract ideals and it ends up being almost like a monastery feel like if you buy into the ideals you're there you're pure enough and and uh communism becomes not a project of incorporating the working classes into a consciousness of how they are the the agent of history that can radically change the world it becomes a social click that has to be very hostile towards the entry of anyone that thinks in the slightest way different to them and that's uh that's no communism at all that's uh you know you can basically Trace all of that to the creation of the fake left and the compatible left as we call it in The Institute and it's it's a product of the Rockefeller Foundation the Ford Foundation the state department and it was explicitly done for the sake of challenging the only force that the imperialists have always been scared of which is real communist and uh real Communists are back um historical necessity has brought us back and uh they're going to throw everything at us the fascist and the left as well yeah I I I think that you know some of these arguments stem from this notion you hear it repeated often that you know part and parcel of fascism is a demonization of big capital and a championing of small capital and that was trotsky's appraisement of the class origins of fascism actually he said it the problem was the petite bisi the small little class now trosy obviously had these views because he was an elitist and he detested any kind of populism but the facts actually contrast from this view of History while while for purposes of demagoguery they did engage in this kind of rhetoric here or there the facts are fascism was not a phenomena of small Capital it was a phenomena of big Capital fascism was rooted I mean this was the analysis of the common turn in Monopoly Capital right and that's not small Capital that's not the petite bisi that's actually the advanced whatever Progressive big capitalist actually so this this kind of trotskyism has become commonplace Additionally the the notion basically where like okay this opposition between the concrete reality of production to the abstract reality of like institutions and financial abstraction and so on and derivatives this is actually a kind of fascistic Distinction and actually you know to understand capitalism you need to kind of De essentialize oppositions like that so for example when Michael Michael Hudson makes an opposition between the productive kind of aspects of society versus the rent-seeking parasitic one you know that is kind of a fascistic trap and it's just first of all it's ironic that they're speaking from a pretense of Marxism because the first gesture of Marx was what I mean the first thing he did to distinguish himself was from Hegel was to reject the kind of pure abstraction of idealism and descend into the depths of the concrete which is the proletariat right Marx is privileging of the proletariat as the Revolutionary class the laboring class over the civil servant or I don't know some other kind of subject based on contemplation and reflexivity was itself I mean that's materialism it's the essence of materialism right and obviously it's a given it's a truism within Marxism that socialism amounts to the unleashing of the productive forces from the Fetters of an increasingly outmoded increasingly super structural and increasingly abstract uh relationship of capital and and the valorization of capital SE cees to be organically based and reproduced just from the concrete content of production but increasingly takes a political abstract and super structural form that's imperialism right so when we oppose the parasitic rent seeking elements from the kind of and and what are the productive elements in society it's actually bricks it's Russia and China I mean is that outside of capitalism entirely I mean people can debate about that but the fact is that they are positioned against Monopoly Capital be yes because that distinction between the productive versus the parasitic is operative in that case right and which one is on the side of socialism I think it's I think it's plainly self-evident you know and it's like uh you know this view that um that oh actually you know you're talking about productive Capital but we're calling what we call productive capital in China and Russia and bricks and so on I don't really think you can reduce that to Capital anymore I think the extent to which the necessity of the productive forces in those countries to have to be socialized you know the the the extent to which they have to obey long-term planning the extent to which they're inexorably entwined with with an overall view of production based on use value more or less but overall the the notion that material reality is on our side I think has been lost in Western Marxism it's been replaced by a view that the contrary true material reality is this kind of demiurge keeping us in the prison of capital and that you know the only way to escape is to ret ourselves Retreat into abstraction Retreat into kind of you know um the pretense and veneer of hyper conscien ious and you know being smug and being a knowt all who's like looks moral precisely like you know I'm a leftcom I'm not like a vulgar stupid stalinist who's actually like in the dirty muck of reality I'm in the know about true Marxism right so it's like that's really the kind of nonsense we're dealing with I guess well uh previous generations of Communists have had to to to deal with that and uh thankfully for us histri not on on their side have yet to see a successful leftcom revolution in construction of socialism besides mus yeah it's a good one um you know it's so important to to talk about the real origins of fascism and and why trosky is is wrong with seeing it as rooted in in the petty bouro Z that's not to say that there wasn't Petty boura elements within it but it's it's abundantly clear if you look at uh the evidence that the Nazis and uh the fascists in Italy and in Spain could not have came to power without the most developed parts of big business and specifically Demetrio's formulation it's Finance Capital it's it's Finance that's the most developed capital and uh for those listening if if if you want to look more into this there's a great book by Jack Powell called Hitler and big business that points out the ties of Hitler and big business there's of course the classic in our tradition uh Michael Pen's black shirts and reds and there's a few other it's uh indisputable that uh the economic Foundation the class backing uh the fascists were the most developed sectors of Finance Capital um I I like how uh I mean of course you're completely correct to say that given in Marxism has been the fact that uh that we're here and if if we succeed or when we succeed the forces of Productions will be Unleashed that's uh the Cent one of the central guiding threads of the movement of History um of the of the materialist understanding of the law of development that's operative in different forms of of Life uh Marx makes it his his mission to to show how it has been um the fets that the feudal mode of production the corporate guilds presented to the development of the forces of production that were one of the central components in the development of the bourjois and that's not done for no reason uh that's done for the sake of showing well there's this historical tendency that as soon as uh specific forms of intercourse specific class relations prohibit the development of the the forces of production uh along with the specific classes that embody those contradictions you will have a condition where you either have the disillusion of all classes in society or you have a revolution um and he points this out in various different societies and then he elaborates that very much uh as to how it exists in capitalist uh society and this is tning for a few reasons every year I have to teach marks in my history of Western philosophy class and there's many assumptions that people operate with about Marxism one of which is Marxism is just a sort sort of Christian aestheticism where we all just want to be poor uh that's obviously a mccarthyite manufactured lie that it seems like a suspiciously large number of leftists are accepting today um that's not the case uh but one of the central uh reasons why Marx had the confidence that socialism will succeed is not only the capacity of the proletariat that sort of embodies in its individual will uh the will of History where this cunning of reason is operative but you also have uh an understanding that capitalism stifles development capitalism stifles development and socialism doesn't um and that's that's extremely clear from history the most uh rapid developments and the forces of production were under collectivization with Stalin then with China uh and the societies that have grown the quickest have been communist societies societies led by a Communist party where Society served Society itself and that doesn't mean that uh unleashing the forces of production people hear this and they just think about like a factory cranking out shirts uh non-stop that no one needs it doesn't mean like expanding the parts of capitalism that today function as a system of waste as William Morris the famous British socialist called it um so like if if if [ __ ] like Fast faction fast fash fashion I mean it doesn't mean just making more [ __ ] like that that just ends up in a landfill um it means producing more efficiently it means that our cities will not be crumbling uh it means that our we don't have to wait two years to get potholes fixed um it means that we can develop and create the sort of abundance not that's just uh ridiculously wasteful but the sort of abundance that allows for each human being to have the conditions necessary to flourish as much as possible as individuals and that's uh that's something that capitalism prohibits for the vast majority of people and when you phrase it in those terms it uh for the American people at least it it becomes almost self-evident that that is some that's a condition we don't have today they can't flourish they can't uh actually actualize those rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and that communism when you actually explain it to them is a system that is is foundationally rooted in giving you those actual concrete real freedoms that are experienced as freedoms um not this [ __ ] bouris Freedom that's it's a freedom for them to accumulate capital and for the vast majority of people is experienced as a form of unfreedom just like their democracy it's experienced by the vast majority of people as a highly undemocratic Society um but as things intensify I agree with you that uh productive Capital industrial Capital takes more and more a uh a a an explicitly Progressive uh an explicitly Progressive condition and I I agree totally here with Michael Hudson's analysis he holds that if the old uh Cold War was one explicitly between socialism and communism today it's one that's between industrial productive capitalism and and this more parasitical uh Financial capitalism and I don't know if capital is still the right word to refer to it I I I I still refer to it as capital but um it's not capital and and how it functions within capitalism where it's elevated to this position of Supremacy over and above any other common interest of society it's Capital being used for the sake of society um and the Chinese have been extremely successful in doing this to the Russians even though they're they're not led by a Communist party they have the Communist Legacy but they've been extremely successful in doing this and other countries have as well Iran has been successful in doing this um and others have those that are large enough to to um to not be as damaged as as other countries smaller countries like Cuba and Venezuela are when they're you know hit with 900 [ __ ] uh sanctions and this hybrid Warfare uh so yeah but I'll stop rabit no I mean um yeah I think one of the reasons it's also because people also kind of are operating with this distinction like okay well industrial capitals from the past so if you're opposing if you're if you're championing these outmoded classes and interests and not getting in with the times you're basically a reactionary and that's kind of where it seems like the logic is coming from but I think what PE what they don't appreciate is that when we talk about industrial Capital first of all we're talking about an incipient interest so it's mainly an aspirational interest of society you know I'm I'm an entrepreneur and I have this Vision to produce this and do this and I can't do it because there's so many Gatekeepers and institutions stopping me and you read L's analysis of the um Russian capitalism uh and that's what he refers to the the the the petite bisi Among The Peasant as an incipient bisi it's not really an established Bazi but it's a kind of it's aspiring towards something like this but it's being blocked by the forces of feudalism and Monopoly Capital right and their Democratic aspiration is to get rid of The Gatekeepers and open the way to have the opportunity specifically by resolving the land question now obviously we saw that the that peasant Revolution that Democratic Revolution as it's called wasn't didn't actually lead to the creation of a peasant capitalist class the stoin reforms were a separate historical phenomena I would argue which were reversed very quickly it was a return to the actual or you know more or less organic Comm form of production that the peasants were participating in for a long time actually right and when that was modernized through collectivization it was even that that aspiration let's call it incipient boua aspiration actually turned out to be not bgea at all in content but rather a type of concrete content of socialism itself you know an economic problems with the US Stalin said you know socialism isn't just State Property socialism is also this new thing called the collective Farm which isn't State Property it's a form of people's property right and and so I think the lesson you should draw from that is that the incipient let's call it interest of industrial Capital isn't necessarily an a capitalist interest and if you look at bricks and the countries that actually are that represent so-called industrial Capital let's call it like I said it it's kind of and like you mentioned it's kind of difficult to precisely say this is capital still right it's the only way the aspirations of the incipient industrial element can be satisfied is through socialism because the the extent of socialization represented by let's call it like derivative Finance Capital because we're even at a deeper layer of abstraction now right black and the you know this massive concentration of the uh of wealth the ability to print money right that is held by central banks uh that the the requirement for the centralization of the means of issuing credit let's say and allocating resources which is ultimately tied to like actual natural resources like oil right behind the bank is you go so abstract and then behind the bank you pull the the curtain and it's oil under the ground right and that's even true if if just real quick that's even true with the turn that happens in the 70s towards financialization it doesn't come out of thin air right it's because of the explicitly you know and very clearly observable long-term uh trend of the rate of profits falling yeah that the capital is I mean capital is a relationship of accumulation and the capitalist the the personification of capital has to accumulate some household they're they're forced with this question well what do I do with this productive Capital do I ship it abroad and uh and and and pay workers less so that uh the rate of profit has improved there or do I just turn to this to this more parasitic form of capital yeah even though you could trace all of these investment firms and finance Capital back to like the railroads and yeah I mean in the beginning they started somewhere but yeah it's the law of capitalism they ascended to the status of abstraction and and the the capital form let's say increasingly became institutionalized and distanced directly from production itself but I think that um nonetheless though the extent of socialization represented by Black Rock let's say right I agree is irreversible that is irreversible right yeah but the reason why let's say industrial capital is Progressive versus Finance capital is because the aspiration of industrial Capital can only be satisfied when there's a red rock when the function the institutional function taken on by the oligarchical capitalists is assumed as Engle said by the state itself directly and made to serve the common public interest so for example we don't want to abolish Banks entirely we want the bank to be owned by the state by a proletarian dictatorship right so the the extent of abstraction and centralization is not the problem the problem is how um that is that is still being trapped by the feds of this institutional Capital just money for money's own sake which increasingly assumes like a ritualistic you know um purely ideological and institutional form you know they have to go to Bohemian Grove every year to burn the ow or something I mean it's like a metaphor like capital is not directly a result of the material reality of the productive relations it's something increasingly tied up with the the the superstructural realm of the propagation of ideas and information and you know and politics and so on and you know you look at the United States today which obviously as the global heiman is the center of the puzzle the central piece of what we call global capitalism how is this institutional Capital maintained is it maintained through production no it's maintained through military force almost directly now when because the US has to kind of act as a World Police and you know directly enforce the rule of capital by military means I don't think these postone people or whatever appreciate they'd rather go well you know actually in China and Russia and Iran that's still reproducing capitalist relations and it's like okay but read marks and Engles if you actually succeed in reproducing capitalist relations what you're actually doing is developing socialism actually materially reproducing a given thing is participating in the process into which it develops into its contrary right it's precisely because the US can't reproduce capitalism or the or material relations of production at all and has to act as a Fetter upon them an obstruction upon their development is is why it's reactionary actually that's that's what act that's what defines the Nexus between reactionary and Progressive and then finally you know I also think that um when we when we consider the overall tendency in trajectory of capital like you mentioned um and how it's nonetheless it's a derivative form of capital which is not based on profit directly but based on profits from profits from profits right it's like derivative by many layers of abstraction when you fact when you look at the interest of the the ultimate form of capital that exists today which I don't I'm not confident I could say I could describe directly is that black rock or is it the network of offshore Banks and banking cartels that coordinate you know monetary policy on a global I I don't know like I don't know they all own each other so exactly exactly so to to discern the exact Circuit of capital that is at the top I I'm not going to confidently say I can do that with certainty right now but I I could say that um when when we consider how it how it makes profit from printing money for example um pumping in in credit and just kind of signals which are no longer directly tied to the production of material wealth the degrowth stuff is actually real because when you think about it given this structure of capital accumulation actually real industrial production becomes increasingly factored in purely as a cost rather than a Source uh like it's it's like the derivative form of capital isn't saying oh no no we need this industrial Capital to make a profit it's saying this is actually an investment cost it's an operating cost and if we can eliminate it you know we could increase profits it's almost exactly like how the capitalists the industrial capitalist used to regard the proletariat you're just a pure cost even though that's the source of the Surplus value the logic of capital is such that it wants to kind of attack like an autoimmune disorder attack its own material premises so you have the exact same thing going on now uh except with the real material and Industrial premises of the production of wealth out of which capital itself is valorized because you know these value for Marxist I don't know if they appreciate it but Capital it the valorization of capital is actually derived from a material process of the production of material wealth the the way Society produces its material wealth like now I'm not talking about symbolic relationships or structural relationships or any Pomo nonsense I'm actually talking about how people feed themselves where your food comes from um that is how Marx and Engles understood what a mode of production is they didn't say oh no it's just like totally e it's an totally ethereal you know um you know structural pattern uh of capital and it's like no this is based in actually a form and of production like words have lost meaning production is no longer about actual production it's about reproducing a specific form of ideas you know the the platonic ideal of capital right so it's just kind of I mean they they've really just vent into idealism and accuse materialism of being fascist basically well if the thing is and and you you put it brilliantly if you can go consistently from M to M Prime if you could just continue making uously money from money uh which is what we've seen I mentioned very high percent 95% is basically just making money from money productive Capital even if it reaps profit is seen as a burdensome investment because you still have to put down the cost of production uh that create the conditions for the Surplus that then is reaped as profit why do all that especially when the rates of profits that were coming in through that form of capital made it not worth it specifically after the crisis of the 70s so it's it's gotten to the point where capitalism that operates with these systems of real abstractions those real abstractions have themselves abstracted to deeper levels to the point where everything is just so disconnected from the the meat and potatoes of of just uh engaging in the sort of activity that allows one to survive and I think uh for us Communists what this does is make it easier to show the people and in many ways we don't have to show them they know it already how parasitical the elite is um they already know it they just have different World Views through which they inter it that are somewhat spontaneous but um that instinct and I I see this every year in my classroom because most of my kids are they come from poverty from workingclass families everyone hates the status quo everyone hates the establishment and it's very clear they just cannot survive and obtain any form of security and they're they're seeing their parents live in constant precarity and they can't even imagine getting to the level of stability that their parents' parents had uh so this is it's it's creating a very dangerous condition for for the elite um and it's not disconnected with the the rise in this sort of I've called it environmental neom malthusianism where it's just promoting this uh you will own nothing and be happy you have no idea how many people every time I talk about how in class and that I just finished the couple weeks on marks every time I bring up how it is that capitalism feds uh the development of the forces of production you have no idea how many people just come back to that slogan you will have nothing and be happy and that's the reality of the Contemporary bourge Z and it's not new Engles mentioned in a review of Thomas carlile's past and present Thomas carile was one of these uh um reactionary conservative socialists of sorts and uh the past and present text is actually very interesting I I think that there's some homologies with some of the ways that terker Carlson talks today uh but that's besides the point he he says in in the review that uh that malthusianism is always present in in a section of the ruling class it's always been there uh they want to depopulate and it's because at the at the social level they don't value Humanity they just value their class they don't value Humanity at all and it's uh it becomes burdensome and if it wasn't for the fact that we make profits for these people they have no need for us as the Harari you know one of the favorite idogs of the WF we have no need for the vast majority with the dog whistles here all right the anti-semitic dog whistles oh I mean you just mentioned I actually don't know if he's Jewish but you did mention a guy rather than an abstract Capital oh relation so no but they're literally saying it we we have no need for the vast majority of humanity and it's scary and that's why we have to affirm as as Communists you know our fight is for Humanity it's not just for the working class it's for Humanity itself these people are evil um I don't hesitate to invoke that category uh they're against life they're they're they're a cancer that just devours all forms of life and um it's it's it's a very right is cause that the one that we have and when you have in the west and specifically in the US such a crisis of meaninglessness where people are just you know falling into deep forms of nihilism of bad consciousness of of um you know these positions that are that you know it they attack the the very essence of what it means to be human having a purpose in life being able to exert yourself creatively and uh and Endeavor to achieve that purpose uh when you have this crisis of meaninglessness and you have a group of people that are saying that are allowing you to make sense of why it is that your life is so distra that are showing you the systematic roots of your individual ills and that show you how to move forward those people are very scary because not only do they say here's how your condition gets better but they also afford the vast majority of people a purpose unlike any other which is the purpose that one obtains when they fight for something bigger than themselves when they fight for something that's not just that the things that are around them when they they're not just fighting for basic when they're fighting for Humanity which is ultimately what our fight is they fight for life we love life um that uh gives everyone a tremendous sense of purpose who actually takes it up seriously and doesn't treat it in this monastic faction fashion if I'm just going to sit around and excuse my I've seen reference circle jerk with the five people that [ __ ] agree with me when you treat it serious it's a tremendous source of purpose and uh it makes it very easy to sacrifice the things we have to sacrifice I live in poverty dude I have the degrees I have everything but I live in poverty and I'll continue living in in the way that I am uh if it means advancing the struggle and that sense of purposefulness is something that I think uh the vast majority of the people especially in the US are dealing with this crisis meaning the rise in depression the rise in anxiety um is something we can afford them at the more subjective level that's not just we're going to improve your conditions but we're also going to give you a project in life that's meaningful um and as meaningful as any other yeah I mean I I can somewhat relate a little bit uh thank you Eddie appreciate you kind of hurting my case right now the poverty thing with the subscription but no I can somewhat relate cuz I was wasn't I did get a scholarship to law school and I was in law school right and then like I got some marginal success streaming I wasn't making money at the time but I was like get marginally successful and I was like you know what I'm going to do this instead I'm going to be like a full-time preacher of Marxism I guess and so I like I left didn't fully leave it's still kind of a leave of absence although I don't know if haven't checked back on a long time but I I do understand that like you know committing for a deeper purpose and you know i' I'd be way way more wealthy if I went down the other path but it's just like I don't even care it's not even worth that you know but uh you know I think one of the things I wanted to say though is that I think this is a good example of I don't know exactly what I would call it philosophically or theoretically but it's like very hegelian move where you're in this kind of unhappy Consciousness and you think that the contradiction is just between your Consciousness and the world and then the hegelian move is a kind of displacement where you recognize actually the contradiction is external and it's imminent it's out there actually this is the kind of reconciliation and it's really similar when it comes to this stuff about Marxism and the the the pan leftist Twist on Marxism According to which you know capital is this somehow rational Force that's reproducing itself materially you know not just institutionally but materially reproducing its existence at the expense of History it's like transcendental because you mentioned for example something that is paradoxical if mm Prime is pursued and the actual material premises of capital's valorization are cut off how does the derivative Capital continue indefinitely and then they would reproach us and say no you see they depend on the industrial Capital so it's an absurdity you know how how could it be that they are trying to degrow and how could it be that they're trying to kind of attack their own premises that's an absurdity and I think they're missing the point because that's our Point yes it's a paradox yes it's a contradiction that's exactly why capitalism is destined to be supplanted by another mode of production because it actually doesn't succeed in reproducing itself the Triumph of capitalism is actually the Triumph of socialism because the Triumph of capitalism is the same thing as the destruction of capitalism it's literally the same thing yes the logic tends into a direction that ultimately leads to the dissolution of Capital itself but they find this so like difficult to believe like H H how could that be how could it be that something tends in the direction of its own dissolution because capital is clearly something that exists and if it exists it it must somehow omnisciently attend to the conditions of its reproduction which it clearly cannot do and that I think maybe is the only real limit of conspiracism is like actually the cap capitalist elite can't preserve it will lead to I mean socialists and Communists marxists across history have never said uhoh you know if we're not successful you know capitalism will win it was like if we're not successful there's going to be a huge crisis there's going to be irrationality Madness and insanity and people are going to start eating each other or something right right cuz they're not going to know how to cope with this contradiction so people need to appreciate that you know um capital is not a boogeyman capital is something latent with its own dissolution up to the present stage where that it should be like abundantly clear by now exactly how that is now I understand there's a sense of there is a sense of craftiness of the actual ruling class in terms of preserving this kind of system I mean a good example of that was the American system of the Britain Woods After po it was a brilliant way of saving the ruling class you know by kind of developing Germany and Japan after the war after the destruction as shock absorbers of capitalist crisis this was actually a way to extend the lifespan of capital is it still capital I don't know but clearly the institution of capital at least right as it existed and um you know you could say that okay uh you know why can't something similar happen now well the uh the issue is one you can't divorce the Marshall Plan from the context of Communism as a as a as a is a kind of pressure uh upon the ruling class to actually adopt socialistic and communistic policies sorry communistic is a little loaded I'd say socialistic policies to uh compete and you know to to stop the spread of Communism but um I think that what what really we're looking at today in terms of why that's not viable right and some huge crafty I mean that's what the great reset is supposed to be actually right it's supposed to be that but the reason I don't actually think it's possible is because um I think that when you when you look at the nature of Monopoly Capital today and the extent of the overhaul literally a great NE reset that would be necessary to meticulously fashion the economy in such a specific way that allows for the reproduction of these institutions right that is not politically viable you can't do it because there's a lot of political hurdles specifically the phenomena of populism and actual resistance by the population right furthermore you also have to understand that of course capital or the capitalist institution of capitalism capitalist civilization does lead to Fascism it does lead to Madness it does lead to war and that's exactly how they plan on bailing themselves out of this crisis because China Russia and bricks are accelerating the productive forces so rapidly to rapidly for the institutions of capital to react they actually need War it's like actually necessary it's a life and death struggle and it's going to be articulated that way right so you know if people are like well uh you know Capital might be able to reproduce itself if if the ruling class is Crafty and I'm like yeah that craftiness is already on display it's the craftiness of the war agenda you know it's the craftiness of destruction of our constitutional freedoms and Democratic rights and the total mobilization of the economy for war and implementing that agenda all of their intelligence is being poured into into that it's you know it's so funny WR is I argue with them and I'm trying to explain the the ruling class literally has like one agenda and it's imperialism like all of their intelligence goes into that how do we you know um maintain control over the system globally but they somehow think that's not the primary way the ruling class is exercising control and and its craftiness they think that no actually the ruling class is primarily exercising control by by preventing Christian symbolism in the government by like by by these Jews that are like you know instead of saying Merry Christmas the the white house now says happy holidays really I mean I I kind of think they're getting It reversed I think the actual thing that's they care about is imperialism and all that other stuff is like very Downstream you know but what do I I think for regular working people yes uh for the ideologues uh I think there's a purpose behind that sort of distraction um to move us away from looking at imperialism and I mean you're absolutely right uh and this is this isn't this is something that has been acknowledged for a while there's nothing better for a a period of Crisis than a good War uh the war economy comes in as as indispensable in moments of Crisis which is also conjoined with you know the the rise of fascism fascism on questions of War and Peace it's very clear where it stands um I don't think it will have the same success that it's had in the past uh simply because the material incentive in the population is just not there it's not there we don't have the um the Absurd super patriotism of the past of my country is always right even when it's wrong um I I think in many ways the sectors that would have had that have become a lot more critical of the foreign policy of their country we also don't have this sort of fracturing that existed very in a very real way in the working class in the pre civil rights Revolution era um where it was very easy to divide workingclass people and get some to buy into imperialism and others not to um on the basis of race I think that the Civil Rights Revolution creates the conditions for the possibility of of making the the the class struggle more acute that's just the basic position of leninism you know Democratic struggles once they one they make the class struggle against Capital more acute it's easier to fight a multi-racial workingclass struggle if you're not literally divided by uh aparte as as we were and then you also have a condition that I I think is irreversible within the context of capitalism which is that we're literally the first generation to live lives that are guaranteed to be worse than their parents like at least you had in the the first and second world war period the prospects the idea the potential at hand for a better life than those that the sort of life that was lived by the people that raised you that potential the vast majority of Americans recognize is not there so the the material conditions the objective conditions have changed such that the incentive that was was present in other eras that allowed for the war economy to be a successful way out I don't see that there anymore as for the other point that you were making before that it's interesting because I I mentioned that a lot of these value Theory people they start people like Michael Heinrich uh by explicitly rejecting the theory of surplus value and contradictory value production and that relationship which you just mentioned that they cannot get their head around where on the one hand you have this this drive this force moving one way uh that requires this other Force but that in moving that way it's moving against this other force that is a reflection at a more advanced and abstracted level of the basic contradiction in uh commodity production of they split the contradiction between exchange and use value an exchange value that has to in order to perpetuate itself almost forget what it is based on and the split between the buying and the selling of the commodity that uh is the foundational contradiction for all the other ones and that's all a crisis is if you look at the theories of surplus value of Marxism the most the place where he most explicitly deals with the theory of Crisis it's uh it's all it is is that foundational contradiction um exploding to a certain extent that all the other ones do as well and this tension that you correctly point at these people not seeing it's a reflection of the fact that they can't see it uh when it occurs at the foundation that leads it to occur in this other more abstract macro level at the core of it it's just an absence of dialectical thinking we can't accurately reproduce the concrete concretely because the concrete is it's filled with contradictions and if you think contradiction represents as orities the uh the way of opinion you're going to be lost you're not going to understand the world um and I think that uh there's been this tendency in Marxist quote unquote Marxist economics in the west to reject that contradictory value production that when it comes to uh issues of geopolitics issues of Empire uh issues of these contradictions manifesting themselves in more macro and develop forms they're never going to understand them because they have forgone the apparatus that would allow them to understand the foundation of those contradictions which is the ability to think through them as a as a real Unity of opposites operative in the world not as this uh you know syllogistic mental it's it's a real Unity of opposites in the world and if you cannot grasp that uh you're not going to understand it you're going to be groping in the dark every time you try to explain the world you're not going to be able to make sense of it uh and this is I mean in in the project that we have here uh that we have in the midwestern marks Institute and in my personal scholarship I find that nine 99% of the time the failures that I encounter in the LA are rooted in the fact that people do not think dialectically they're unable to see contradictions they're they aren't able to see things in the processes in which they exist and they're aren't a to see things and how they're located in in various forms of social holes and social totalities they're unable to see how things turn into their opposites how stuff is preserved even when it changes that the very you can't have the understanding of change if you don't have the understanding of some identity that's sustained in that process of change this it's not just Hegel goes back to Aristotle so it's a complete absence of dialectical thinking and it reflects itself in these uh political judgments that are founded in a deep misinterpretation of how the world is and therefore an incorrect assessment of what the [ __ ] is going on every time a a new political event enters the uh the sphere of discourse so it's an absence of dialectics as you know angles has this this quote from a letter that we I know know and I cite all the time what all these gentlemen is dialectics thank you so much black all they see is cause here effect there sorry I was just thinking uh thanking someone like I don't mean interrup yeah and um I don't know if you want me to talk about it but the the way that we have formulated this absence is as the Purity fish um it's a you know it's a it's a term that captures in a positive form the absence of dialectical thinking because when you don't think through contradictions you don't think through movement you don't think through totalities or heterogeneous totalities what you're operating with is the notion that that that which can be supported that which can be accepted uh is is only uh that which measures up to some abstract disconnected pure idea that exists only in my head and not to interrupt but you know we arrived at an pretty identical conclusion uh in parallel obviously separately we but instead of the Purity fedish we called it just formalism right bwa formalism and you know one would ask why formalism you know cuz isn't being one-sided with regard to content also the same thing just as undialectical and i' say yes but when when you're one-sided with regard to content you are faced with form so you turn content into form and form into content and ultimately the real content is beyond your purview then all you have is the form because the content actually is always and perpetually in contradiction with anything we aify and we take as a kind of static uh object so it's the formalism right and um that is uh profoundly you know similar to the kind of critique of cartesianism and you know um I I I I really um I guess racialized it in the beginning of streaming because it was like the Anglo stuff you know it's this is Anglo-Saxon metaphys I was I was debating sdl and I was like [ __ ] Anglo-Saxon metaphysics from the 17 century and talking about because he was trying to like bring up some data stuff of like support for gun ownership and I was like nobody gives a [ __ ] about your Anglo-Saxon metaphysics no uh no sh no shade at the anglos but the it is these Traditions that at least in the Academy have the have been the most fierce uh opponents of dialectics of course yeah I mean eveners even among marxists who I like personally I'm not going to name them cuz I like them a lot and I don't want to put them on blast but the British do have a problem with dialectics uh even the ones I like who are marxists who are theorists uh and then you know the I I I'm not letting the Germans get off the hook by the way because I don't think they understand dialectics either and I always think to myself I'm like why was Hegel German Kant is the German Hegel is like Russian or something I don't know how that guy was German right makes sense that was German but not Hegel right and what I mean by that is that also German marxists tend to do the opposite of the British ones where instead of focusing on the empiricism they focus on the kind of transcendentalism of Kant and so on both both being yeah both being the fun yeah it's interesting you mentioned the hateful being Russian because uh Mark says in one of his letters towards the end of his life that the people that have understood his worldview the clearest have been the Russians um so and and I mean U there has been quite a bit of scholarship as to how much the Hegel engaged with the certain Oriental uh Traditions uh and how much they influenced him in his thought um that that's a an interesting field that that I haven't done too much research in but I think uh I I think you're correct to describe it as a as a as a problem of formalism and I think that the Paradox is that when there's this overemphasis on form not only do you not get to understand what's going on at the level of content but you also don't understand what's going on at the level of form yep precis the correct approach the the heelan dialectical approach to it is is not just even like in the traditional philosophy have this well you have appearance and the point is to pierce through appearance and get to the real Essence get to the real content and that's also wrong it's a it's a more developed stage than just I'm going to focus on appearance and form but it's also wrong because the correct position is inquiring why it is that the content required taking such a specific form how is it that the content um in order for it to be as content needed to take the form that it took look and this is you know I saw the meme the other day uh the the gorilla meme with the Pepe and I love this one oh gor the gorilla with the paye and and it was that's uh if if you read uh the logic of essence that second part of the science of logic that's what that's what you get you can't come out of it thinking you know really the goal of philosophy and critical thinkers is to pierce through appearance and then get at the the essence of something no it's understanding that relationship what is it that requires the essence to to shine forth and to reflect itself in the way that it does Bally it's like the interdependence of both it's like the the the the essence doesn't come at the expense of the appearance right and it's the same kind of even formalism isn't necessarily the only way I I say Anglo-Saxon metaphysics from the 17th century you can we we had the word the Anglo box it was like big in the community it's like formalism but all of them kind of either it's a either it's the Pure formalism or there's a kind of positing of this ultimate Essence behind all appearance we'll never get there we'll never actually make it something concrete but it's like a pure Bluff right that that's a necessary point of reference of buwa thinking and yes you're right the the the the real uh knowledge let's say lies in precisely understanding how precisely how it is form arises out of the content and also importantly how the content is the reconciliation of the contradiction itself that's what the content is content is not a form behind a form I call actually it's substantialism is the word from Spinosa substance because I had this view that Spinosa was the one who ruined to materialism in Marxism because to me substance precisely was a kind of essence which was simultaneously also a kind of form and which was behind all of the forms right and for me uh the truth of the matter is that the essence is actually what reconciles the form and it's not behind the form because content is not itself a form content is the dialectical and the concrete Unity uh of the dialectical relationship that form is suspended within the process of right of the development so um but you know to kind of uh you can also kind of add more comments but to slightly shift gears because I did want to talk about this a little um you know uh I don't know if this has been explored I know Paul cockshot who's a British Marxist has explored the relationship between he's one of our writers at The Institute he's one of our researchers he kind of explores the relationship between capitalism and thermodynamics right the direct like basis of capitalist production that Marx was writing about in actual energy which I find a fascinating topic because when we talk about this this tendency of kind of abstraction that cuts itself off from its premise one-sidedly and it's like the Purity fetish actually right like what you're talking about it's cutting yourself from your premises and just seeking to kind of arrive at a pure or or fetishizing a false ideal of your premises and it's the same thing right it's exactly the same um it's abstract thinking yeah right uh but but within sorry yeah within physics though you think about industrial capitalism specifically and it's it begins with the steam engine right and what is the steam engine what what does that actually do because that's the center of what of of I would argue of industrial capitalism as a whole right there's no way to talk about a mode of production without referring to actual like concrete means of production right right and you know the central Paradigm of 19th century industrial capitalism is based on the steam engine and it's like what does that do and it's kind of fascinating because you because for the whole history of mankind civilizations um civilization or production was powered not just by human labor but also by some external almost autonomous force and that had always been water right it always been water power and then marginally wind power in some cases but mainly water power from rivers in particular right and ports and so on and what the steam engine does is it kind of abstracts Economics from geography in a in ways and it's like okay you don't need to build cities near uh Rivers anymore to have large scale production you know and how that mechanism works like physically kind of does seem to parallel like what capital is and how Capital works you begin with some kind of concrete store of energy like in coal or and firewood and this is almost kind of comparable with use value if you want right as far as capital is concerned and then what the machine does is it kind of frees the energy from it to turn it into an abstract energy an energy whose app whose concrete application is not defined uh at the outset right it's kind of like general labor versus concrete labor you know and the steam engine in particular begins this as a kind of autonomous form of generating energy through but ENT trapped within the mechanism of the steam engine it's not it's not abstract energy quite yet right but it is a form of the abstraction of energy because of its ability to kind of um abstract itself from like concrete ways of the transfer of energy through relationships with rivers and like nature and stuff right then it's electricity and kind of like how work is in measured abstractly and in general that you really kind of see the how the homology with capital is very clear right how you're kind of taking o fossil fuels kind of literal concrete um concretion of this latent forms of energy in the cosmos right and emptying that from its concrete context into something abstract and then then applying it to reality and the outcome is unknown um I think it's fascinating how much that kind of topic of energy in general has been overlooked I think I sound like an idiot because I'm not that I'm not that well read on on Marxist political economy thinkers the history of Marxist political like I know about Marx's capital and stuff but this history of the scholarship on it and so on I I don't know if enough attention has been paid to again a more concrete view of political I mean cockshot takes us to a a huge extreme because he also rejects dialectics in general and he kind of rejects this notion of social relations as irreducible to Natural relations but I do find it to be an interesting Direction because I don't think it's I think it's a very underappreciated one and finally it's like it it it is important to ask the question of like how is it capitalism outlives its Concrete instantiation in a specific Paradigm of production like is it a coincidence that the era of imperialism was also the era of the combustion engine and electricity and a kind of kind of shift to a totally new way of harnessing and dealing with energy and you know continuing up to the 1970s with the new found significance of oil for the world economy and information age I I'm kind of rambling but what do you what do you think about that or I uh I hav an Engaged with any work akin to an analysis of the homologies between the development of capitalism as a social totality and the thermal dynamics that's connected to it um I would say this that there's a paradox at Play Because capitalism is itself as a as a totality as a form of social totality a very concrete one and in many ways the most concrete form of life uh that Humanity had experienced up until the point of its development then I have this this thing I do with my students because um one of the texts I always sign is hegel's short little popular article something he doesn't do very often which is called who thinks abstractly and um I I I one of the things that I I I tell them when I'm trying to break down the concrete abstract is I ask them what is concrete and then all of them just want to start touching stuff want to start touching the table notebooks right right and what is the abstract and like the the image that comes about of the abstract is like you know Plato's depiction of the philosopher as a stargazer the wrongful depiction that other people make of the philosopher and it couldn't be more upside down like if you trace the eological understanding of these words abstract this literally means that which is disconnected concretus means that which is complex that which contains within it um many different determinations that which is composite which has the most concrete would therefore be the whole uh and what you have in in capitalism as a concrete mode of life is one that is uh constantly um not constantly one that is uh integral to it is having these different series of abstractions these different moments that are integral to the concrete ho and so they participate in the in the concreteness of the social totality of the form of life but they participate in a way that is through abstraction um and if you look at something like uh labor I mean Marx uses of course concrete labor to describe the specific type of Labor that's going on and Abstract Labor uh this sort of General socially necessary labor time and it's it's Quantified and therefore theic specific type of activities are just completely homogenized all to the same type of thing the differentiation is a quantitative one but that abstract labor which is a a real abstraction just like the abstract commodity that it produces it's it's a component in uh a concrete system it's something that is itself concrete and obtains it obtains its meaning through the concrete it can exist as an abstraction only because of its dependency on the concrete just like the concrete itself can only exist through the relations uh that uh that it contains between these different forms of real abstractions um don't you think it kind of um I I think it is a paradox within Marx because Marx begins Capital trying to begin level with the reader I would argue right in capital volume 1 like okay concrete labor is like labor as an immediate use value but we know as hegelians that's not exactly a correct description of what the concrete is right but I think I I would argue actually that I think Marx was trying to make the case that rather than capitalism being concrete the concrete of capitalism was actually socialism right the only way we could appra the concrete content of abstra ra labor is if we recognize how it's being assailed by this larger historical tendency through the increased socialization of Labor through this increased Divergence between the material necessities of production and labor in general versus the form it's taking in form of in the form of capital um it seems like it's not just our job to recognize the concrete of abstract labor as a form of like analysis I think he was hinting that this in reality it was being made concrete through the arrival of as Engles would put it socialism from the future Victorious socialism from the future and I think in in general when we look at capitalism as a concrete totality we're already describing socialism actually and maybe Society is not aware of it but this is one of the things that is so interesting about the nature of capital itself because Capital wasn't just a pure analysis of capitalism it was also a kind of gospel of socialism I would argue right because it's really saying once we have appreciated capitalism as a concrete totality we have actually proven that this thing is on its way out and it's turning into something completely contrary to it right um so I think that's what I would say on that and I I think what I mean by like a concrete store of value is just kind of like immediate but I think that does open another question which is even though energy turns into kind of abstract energy whose real determinant content cannot be presumed that's just the case for thought just like in the case of Labor right when markx talks about abstract labor is it actually abstract labor or are we just not able to presume the determinant content of that labor right and of course it's the latter that's true it's a limitation only of the Mind actually in reality it is concrete you know in reality energy um is concrete the way in which it's utilized and applied and consumed and on it that is concrete that does obey a concrete and determinate kind of pattern that reconciles all of its the many different determinations like the concrete is the concentration of the many right and it's same thing with capitalism I I I think that's uh you mentioned that in reality it is concrete um I agree but not in its social reality and it's social reality it is an abstraction um and the form of real reality that it takes under capitalist forms of intercourse it is an abstraction because it divorces itself from the concrete reality of the complex specific type of Labor that performs it that requires a wide array of different things certain types of materials skills uh types of specific qualitatively different types of work and it just makes all of this into a number it's just a quantity that's why it's an abstract you also bring up something very interesting you you you say that uhu and please let me know if I'm paraphrasing wrong that the concrete of capitalism is socialism yeah um I think that the way that I would understand that is that capitalism is itself a concrete social totality that is in movement it's pregnant with certain contradictions and amongst those contradictions one of the things that you find when you study it when you study the concrete totality concretely it means when you ascend to it as a concrete is that on the basis of these contradictions a new form of life is already taking shape that if we think about socialism modern socialism uh it cannot be done without what capitalism develops on feudalism that centralization of the forces of production is is fundamental for socialism to achieve its ends um and in that sense socialism does exist as a socialism exists as an IT exists abstractly within capitalism but it is an abstraction that through the understanding of the concrete totality that it exists in gives us insights into how it will itself be a concrete totality one day so it exists implicitly so that's why like even you know after revolutions like the socialism we describe today it's still a socialism that is unfolding that is concretizing that it's becoming itself as this radically new form of life and so like any that's why I hesitate like any attempt to to you can't provide a concrete political economy of socialism yet why because the totality that we would be analyzing it's one that is still in a process of maturing it's still in the process of concretizing just like the flaws of classical political economists which Marx respected very much are rooted in the fact that the object of study still wasn't as developed as it would be when Marx is I think though that um I think I think you know uh you know hegel's famous saying about like the owl of manura right and this kind of issue of like always being too late when it comes to the sphere of Consciousness and I I suspect something similar with capitalism actually because you know capitalism was around for hundreds of years before Marx I don't know if You' agree right I mean yeah yeah yeah yeah I see after the black death and but that was not seen as like capitalism in its purest form because it was still attached to the feds of feudalism but you know actually I would argue that capitalism in the days of early modernity and mercantilism that is actually when you might have been able to describe capitalism as a concrete mode of production right a mode of production which is the riddle the hitherto riddle of the history of feudalism solved all of the various determinations of the feudal mode of production were entering into contradiction with each other so what is the positive reconciliation of that you know for which all of these different and contrasting determinations are part of are concentrated into one thing right and it's clear that that thing was capitalism so I think there's an irony of I don't know if I would call it an irony but I think before capitalism assumes its purest form so to speak that's when it's at its most concrete as a unique mode of production but I think when Marx was describing capitalism the industrial capitalism 19th century England as it began there I guess I think the thesis more or less was that this is capitalism on its way out capitalism is exhausting itself now as a mode of production and the only reconciliation of now because it's freed from the feds of feudalism so to speak its real contradictions are now laid bare and and these contradictions represent different determinations of the same mode of production right but how are those contradictions reconciled into one mode of production right and I think that obviously when taken in the positive sense that mode of production is socialism it's socialism that renders these contradictions Superfluous and is therefore worthy of being the concrete of industrial capitalism I I wouldn't put it in that way um you mentioned that capitalism as a concrete existed in its most concrete form uh in its mercantilist stage I think the the notion of concrete that we're dealing with when we do that is one that's a lot more akin to a sense of immediacy it's a lot more concrete precisely because it's still operating with self- earned private property and it it it's not as I don't mean in that sense I just mean like because of the proximity with the prior the vestiges of the prior mode of production it's precisely because of that proximity that it is not concrete yet that it's still abstract it's like I mean um it it still had to mature as a mode of production it's kind of like like if we say I can pass concrete judgment on a child like a child is not completely a man yet I I think the difference yeah they become a man they obtain the complexity that makes it more concrete because concrete is just having this complexity within it they achieve that as they develop and as they develop we uh alongside with that object of analysis develop the capacity to describe it concretely we can't describe it concretely if it's still it's like imagine trying to pass judgment on the character of a person they're seven no no no I I I get what you're saying but I think the the the contrasting premise I think at work here is that guess what I'm trying to say is I think there is an inevitable delay where yes that I don't think that was necessarily capitalism in its immature stage it's just that the super structure so to speak or Consciousness could not have possibly caught up by that time to the fact that capitalism was in its mature stage and now that when capitalism seems to have matured fully in industrial England it's precisely because it appears to be an adult that it's actually already dead to us so there is this I don't know what I would call it even tragical relationship like the owl of manura I guess the delay this time lag where precisely when something appears to us fully it's already gone it's it's already taken flight and become something else and I think it it I think that should change maybe our understanding of what the material concrete actually is is it really just the sum total of these various phenomenal appearances or could it even be regarded as a kind of materially concrete um this is going to sound like Pomo nonsense but almost kind of like a a a virtual object the the concrete thing to which the whole logic and the whole existence of the present Society is actually tending towards and actually referring to okay can I say because it's a very interesting quote the olive minurva only flies with the falling of dusk right but when dusk Falls the day is not over you still have the night which is the other component of so the light of the day the rational part of the day is gone but it's irrationality the darkness continues and so I think this is what we're seeing I think this is partially um what's going on here that uh you seem to be describing this process whereby early capitalism existed in this um in in this form where it still had some light and rationality to it and I that's that's fair I agree and only now uh when it has developed to a certain stage can we look back at it but in looking back at it because there's this delay um we assume that we're looking at something different from what we're looking at now but when the out of manura flies that we're still in the same day you get what I'm saying you still have the night going on after the daylight ends and uh I I think that's what Marx is picking out like capitalism has matured and in the same way that he says in the Granda um it is the anatomy of the man that gives us the blueprint or something for the anatomy of come to understand the beginning of capitalism it's Mist stage concretely because we see it what it has degenerated into if you wish to describe instead of maturity what it haser what I'm more saying is it's like when something appears to us fully and fully fleshed out like this is it in its pure form it has already become something contrary to that I think that's more kind of what I'm getting and I think that it's not necessarily like to be fair it's like Marx and Engles did kind of jump the gun even themselves when they thought that industrial capitalist England was like the the final conclusion toward which all world history was going to tend towards and they were clearly wrong about that right they were clearly wrong in in in ter even in terms of their and this is early in Marx and angles not way later in Marx's life especially but at least early on the Assumption was the revolution's happening in England and then it's going to and then everyone has to catch up to England and kind of this issue of time you know is was also a huge operative issue um for the Russian revolutionaries and the Russian marxists right because the whole dispute was stagis them right okay by what procession of the time is Russia which is some kind of backward feudal society in their eyes right uh going to turn into socialism so the economists were like okay leave the politics out capitalism will just take us there and you know we we shouldn't intervene in politics at all and the menic faction of the social Democrats and others were saying something along the lines of we do need interview into politics to Aid the bisi to overthrow the autocracy and then we're going to then will be our time for socialism right and then the only one who was a time traveler I guess in many regards actually because Lenin's devel Vel mment of capitalism in Russia you could say that's a work of time travel right but also in terms of his revolutionary strategy actually um we don't need to collaborate with the big bisi we don't need to wait for a liberal we don't need to redo European history we can distill the essence of the laws of history and apply them in the present like here and now right and I I think the significance of that is is is necessarily a different view of the material concrete it's the whole Paradox that gives rise to what gramsky I think describes as the relative autonomy of the super structure with regard to the base which is like how how do we even Implement Socialism or how do we justify socialist Consciousness when there's a huge delay going on in reality the the premises and material Foundation of socialism isn't even here so we need to actually create it to catch up with us and I think the only rational explanation would be that because the view of the material concrete is probably more like something like a virtuality toward which reality is bent or tending rather than like the sum total of the instantiation of specific kind of phenomenal formations like like like the the existence physically of factories here and proletarians here H how is it that for example in China you have Mao um leading a proletarian Revolution like without a proletarian right but but not only that but then ultimately actually creating the material foundations of a proletarian dictatorship almost backwards right I know if Ione saying is confusing cut me off and no it's I the interesting thing and and I like how you qualif if I by the early marks because we both know that the later marks wasn't think like that he wasn't thinking like that precisely thanks to the influence of a little Russian thinker U whom Lenin will base the title of one of his early 20th century books what is to be it was Nikolai shvi who said that uh history gives to its uh to its Sons the bone and to its grandchildren the marrow so these societies uh did not have to go through all of these stages because they already went through them in another place they can just obtain the fruits of that uh development and attempt if and here is where the super structural Dimension comes to it if they're successful in this political battle um obtain the fruit without the uh with all the hassle that that led to it and Marx's Marx had a lot of faith in the Russian OFA um the the Russian commune and when it came to the debates between the Russian populist and the dogmatic marxists in Russia and we're speaking here up of course late 19 1870s he cited with the populist who said it's the ABA it's the commune that if we're able to develop the forces of production here that have already developed there and we can uh we can build communism on the basis of the Oba we don't need to wait to develop a proletariat and you made a comment earlier about collectivization um collectivization was in part the realization of that prophecy that it is on the basis of that communal form of life that was present in Russian civilization uh that you build once it acquires the technological developments of capitalism you have the potential to build a communist or socialist uh Society now um as far as the time thing I mean I you can you can blame Marx um I'm not saying you I'm using the the general U uh someone that that has engaged with say the first volumes of the first volume of capital they can blame Marx for not predicting the development of capitalism in of of that industrial capitalist stage into a monopoly Finance dominated capitalist stage the interesting thing is you know as we both know he does get to that later on people don't read through uh Capital as a project as a whole but I still think that um that if we think about the concrete in that sense the sense that Hegel and Marx use it as that uh which contains the the many and the most concrete would be that which is the whole um it is very clear that in so far as we can even speak about an imperialist stage of capitalism what we're speaking about is a capitalism that is still developing now we can also understand that that development just like in life is is a development towards death form of P towards death a direct engagement uh a process of life turning into death but you're still I'm better able to describe someone's character if they live up to 70 uh and I'm able to see it that if I catch them only when they're 60 you know and in that process process the older that they get the more sense I'm able to make of the uh the first years just like if you look at Capital as a project the development of all of the categories yes they start abstractly uh but they're abstract precisely because those are the building blocks so that you can get to the more concrete uh categories after and it's not the case and and people do this they just read the first part of capital and they're like okay now I understand the the early part I understand the first no to understand those first categories um and to to understand them comprehensively you have to see what they unfold into yeah so that just like you couldn't understand what they unfold into without seeing the first ones it's it's a it's a it's a reciprocal relationship and the example that I use in some of my texts is the Godfather if you if you only watch part one you can't speak comprehensively about the Godfather you got to watch part two and three because watching part two and three are going to help you understand what part one there isn't a part three no no there is I'm just saying that was like I don't know if you don't watch Parts two and three um you can't have a comprehensive understanding of part one to understand part one you have to watch part two and three and that's what happens with these forms of life as a whole we can see um and this is what the Libertarians do the Libertarians look back at this pure idea of capitalism that you had the self forn private book that's already been dissolved by by industrial capitalism that has been sublated by Finance it's basically like a like what you would call classical capitalism right it's almost like libertarianism is like capitalist neoclassicism like just like how they tried to go back to the ideal ages of Greece and Rome it's like right similar but you know to be a little difficult I I could be wrong about this but I do remember reading Mark's writing eventually that the window of opportunity for the op was passed is that true or that he wrote that I have not found on the contrary I think the more he dug into he learns Russia which is because I I I could have sworn I read that that was that he said like okay um originally like yeah this is a window of opportunity but then later on in his life he was like but the window now passed and it's it's basically all the window of opportunity comment was already later on I think the these letters if I'm not mistaken are from um 71 yeah uh it could be a little later but he engages with it in first in a letter to manovski yeah a Russian um right-wing populist who is telling the marxists well if you if you really want to be a Marxist just sit around and wait with your hands in your pockets for capitalism to develop and Marx writes a long response he never sends it um and then there's the ver sish interaction where he was already prepared by that reply to manovski that he doesn't send and prepares four drafts of the vulis one and he ends up sending the last one and the conclusion is basically you know these stages where my analysis of Western Europe um uh The more I've studied Russia I I I think that this could be a potential for for socialism and that you don't have to go through this stage you can just obtain uh the fruits of it in a very shvi like manner but it was always a hypothesis it wasn't like I there I have not found any evidence and I've looked at uh some of but are you are you aware of like the claim that he said that uh that he said that there was potential or that there wasn't that the window of opportunity passed that comment I have not the windowed any claim where where he says that ends up towards the end of his life it's not just Russia he engages with apologist sorry he engages with Inca societies and Mayan societies yeah through the work of of um was uh kovaleski Maxim kovaleski one of the Russian Anthropologist he called him his his scientist friend and he he comes to the same conclusion there's different forms of communal life in these areas that uh could leap to socialism if you have the capacity to incorporate the developments of the forces of production you don't need to wait to develop a proletariat now we can say that he was wrong uh in that change towards the end of his life and I I think there's something to be said about the fact that constructing socialism and incorporating those forces of production is very hard or nearly impossible without developing the proletarian um Russia eventually has to develop the the Soviet Union has to eventually develop the as does China I think one of the reasons it made a lot of sense to me that he said that was because obviously Engles outlived Marx and it doesn't seem like Engles is maintaining this view as far as the strategy of the Russian Marxist is concerned and his advice to them and stuff Eng Les's research was not necessarily in that area he was focusing um even in the the origins of the family private property in the state he's building a lot from Marx's notes engel's area was in the harder sciences and towards the end of his life in the study of Christianity and in continued political activities but I haven't seen I mean um I haven't seen any evidence that angles um burns on that position and uh I think the last Russian preface to the manifesto that was done when they were alive is the only area where that hypothesis that has been constructed on the basis of unpublished manuscripts where the hypothesis is stated explicitly um and it was published um in a Russian periodical uh has its own thing separated from the The Communist Manifesto but if you have any sources there I I'd love to I I I'm I'd probably have to look and see cuz I either it was a Marxist themselves making that argument rather than actually quoting Marx or it was that but um now okay the trouble's not over yet cuz I have one more um problem he's trouble if that is the I don't change my opinion on it but I I studied I look at it's no just uh this is an area that I've I've it was my project even when I was in undergrad refering to it in I think what I would what I would say um what I would say yeah vul okay angles wrote about Russia in the 1890s the Easter okay we can we can sh that for a second because there's something else I wanted to say um I think it it is important to point out though that Marx didn't finish capital and he he wasn't able to arrive at the the more concrete you know he planned volumes on I forgot the order of it the World Market States I think the World Market was the last one right and I don't remember he does like two or three plans there's an early one from very very ambitious yeah I don't know I I I I get what you're saying I what you're basically saying is that because I think the most convincing argument against my like time travel stuff is that well capitalism would eventually transition not to socialism but imperialism right so the fact that Marx didn't foresee imperialism proves that like capitalism in its totality had not fully developed by that time and that's how the leninist put the the question of social they yeah that's why it's theism but I but I think the stage of socialist Revolution I think I think though I think I would also make the argument though that Lenin's break with the established Marxist tradition was so abrupt and so severe um I mean we talked about this before but like it was like it's it was especially so severe in terms of the effect that it had in terms of like what it meant at the time it was a completely almost completely different take on Marx and Marxism right than than the one that was conventionally established which we would both agree was a betrayal of Marx obviously but revisionism became the dominant View and a distortion of marks into dogmatism became a dominant view but I think the the the point I would disagree with is that you know when lenon said of this Marx and Engles have said nothing right I think there is a grain of Truth to view Lenin's imperialism his specific strategy his specific understanding of how the world had developed as filling a vacuum not just in terms of the blind spot and the failure of the of social democ Ry but perhaps even Marx himself you know I think Marx himself did not fully understand the concrete of capitalism not just because he didn't live long enough to see how it would develop but because perhaps there were errors in the fundamental premises of the project of capital which perhaps might also be related to why he couldn't finish it I imagine if markx finished capital would have been clear how imperialism would have been directly anticipated and all the things Lenin talks about that and and you know when you read imperialism the highest age it's a polemic and the pmic is look at these lousy marxists ignoring these basic developments of reality and meanwhile look at this liberal guy what was his name again it was like what was his name Robert forgot his name but look at this liberal English theorist who's appreciating and understanding all of this stuff and then like where marxists are nowhere to be found right like that the whole rage animating Lenin's but you even you're even in the way that you're describing it you're describing it as a development and I it's it it gets into true but I I think it gets into a form of speculation if if not in the healan but in a more quotidian sense if you say um uh that that Marx didn't see that Marx wouldn't have seen it even if it if he was part of seeing the development I think that there is something to be said because he's not just the capital is not just unfinished in terms of volume two and three throughout his whole life he was working at the end on a third version of the German edition of volume one so he felt like volume one itself though published was unfinished yeah right so there is something to that and it's also the fact I mean the volume gets published in' 67 all of these manuscripts are coming out through the 70s and what's happening in the 70s is I mean lenon traces the development of imperialism to the 1890s I think it starts in the 70s I agree I think I think Duo is right to say and here's where Duo is Right Duo sees the development of modern imperialism in the counterrevolution of 1876 but to briefly interrupt you you know why Lenin has to say it's the 90s right because I think at least because it would have been problematic from a theoretical point of view with them alive to say that Marx and Engles were alive at this time and like totally were impervious to it it's but it's obvious imperialism as Lenin describes it at least was there in the 70s yeah but you know I I I think the the reason I'm saying this and and I guess I think imperialism as a development already is when capitalism as we we know it starts to directly take a political and super structural form and I think that is what's defining the the new strategy Lenin is calling for in the era of imperialism which is the anti-monopoly strategy and the Democratic struggle and so on and the reason it shifts to that is because we're not talking about you know uh the need to wait for development of capitalism anymore we're not talking about you know um some kind of like actual pure uh process of production um being the source of class struggle we're talking about a struggle between increasingly undemocratic dictatorships and the Democratic aspirations of the masses and how the dictatorship is like the so the last Refuge of capital itself not economics anymore right the the pure relations of production as they're being reproduced at the purely economic level that is no longer reproducing capitalism like Lennon's already observing that right oh it's the state it's the state through exact but it's it becomes and and uh I think we agree on this you mentioned earlier that you see capitalism being something that starts uh far back you know well before industrial capitalism and capitalism gets to a stage when it conquers when the capitalist class conquers political power where very quickly it becomes clear that in order to avoid crisis it needs to State this sort of libertarian idea that some marxists hold that you can have capitalism here and then there's know capitalist mode of life that's why I use the term marks the traditional Dogma is mode of production the term I always use is form of life because you not you cannot separate it from the state and from all of the different state institutions that not only allow you to Simply reproduce the the economic base of society but that SA the economic base of society as soon as it comes into contradictions I I think also though that the state is playing this role of this is especially evident after 1929 right of proing up capitalism itself economically yeah like like it's it's not and not even just like how it used to because we all know that even in the days of mercantilism the state was playing a role in capitalism right but I think that the quality ative difference in this case is that relations of production are not being reproduced purely at the level of the form of life they're being reproduced by force politically the the significance of the democratic struggle had always been we have these relations of production that are just pure vestiges of the past if we have formal equality if we have democracy the vestiges of feudalism are Done Right feudalism is not coming from like actual material relations of production economically it's just like these vestiges of the super structure and by the time imperialism starts to develop I think the same can be said of capitalism too right capitalism also is super structural and if we win the Battle of democracy that's the cynical goal of the popular front like McCarthy is like these people are you they're civil rights activists and they're they're fighting for democracy but it's really communism and it's like well the grain of Truth in that is if we do gain basic Democratic rights and fight against the dictatorship of Monopoly Capital socialism is The Logical conclusion like directly it is right because um the institution of private property and its abstract I we're using the words incorrectly but you get what I'm saying and it's like advanced form as this as the institution of Finance Capital won't be able to be maintained without the dictatorial force of the state I think abstract there would be correct because the finance capital is so disconnected from any productive activity that yeah yeah but it's also like yeah yeah yeah I get I get what you're saying but um no I mean like and I I I think my heretical potentially heretical thesis from this though which I'm not certain about I just think it should at least maybe be entertained or thought about is like is it possible that imper and this sounds horrible it sounds horrific to say this especially from a propaganda perspective but isn't Mater isn't imperialism the material victory of the Socialist mode of production to the point where capitalism has to retreat to the super structure because socialism already won materially and I think even Lenin will say that socialism in Russia has to be built off of German State capitalism and he uses the model of the German post office actually as a paradigm of socialism and I think I think it's possible that Marxist may have and and Marx himself I mean you mention his attempts to revise that he he understood the problem definitely like I'm not saying he didn't think there was a problem and he was like naive like he was trying to fix this problem but I I just don't think he he lived long enough to do it right or he got there I agree lenon is definitely the heir of Marx no doubt about that I'm not like trying you know Georgia cell and these kind of like Proto fascists try to make the argument like no lennin break with Marxism finally we can go and like have our fascist orgy and be free of like we can we can be like dunio and just like run around and Frolic in the woods naked or something I don't think that's true at all I think Mar Lenin is still in continuity with something fundamental in Marx and and built by Marx but I guess my view is that uh There Was You know the meme like Marx couldn't account for this you ever see that Meme on Twitter like it'll be like some like human nature or some [ __ ] yeah yeah or like it'll get to ridiculous levels would be like PewDiePie or something like Marx failed to take into account PewDiePie or something and it's like I do think it's may be possible that Lenin was giving recognition to something that Marx may have not taken into account but which he actually could have but who didn't not because he was dogmatic or he was wrong or deficient in character but just because he couldn't he he he did not even think to entertain it you know it's not just Lennon it's angles angles is very clear in his early 1890s letters that not that they [ __ ] up but that they had to focus all their energy on political economy to flesh that out and then the idea would be to get to these other aspects of of the form of life that they weren't able to give the attention um that they gave to political economy they gave very little attention to those and Lenin is the person that I think explicitly gives a lot more attention to those now about the about the the the the heretical thesis um look it depends on how we're understanding socials if you're understanding socialism as as state intervention for the sake of meating the contradictions created by capitalism um I don't even know if I'd put it that way to be honest well that's the that what that's the way that I I think that you know the people like shank yuger or something they're like you love socialism because you love the the post office or something is is that where your line of argument no I just mentioned the post office because it's an example lenon uses I think rather um getting to like the definition of socialism we I'm going to like we're going to like I'm going to walk said I'm I'm going to walk on a mine and like blow up or something but uh to kind of avoid doing that directly I would say I think when I mean socialism in the material sense I mean a mode of production that is based on some kind of um some kind of socially established content and some kind of socially established uh necessity right I don't know the the transition from exchange value to use value but not use value in the immediate sense but use value in the sense of like uh necessary to attend to the necessities of of society of the commons right but every every form of life has had its degree of socially established necessity I mean without it but not not explicit not not necessarily an explicit notion of the common good according to which attending directly to the needs of your population and to the needs of reproducing it is actually the preeminent function of the relations of production themselves although you could maybe make an argument that this is true for even in the concept of property yeah the concept of property that existed in the feudal era was uh not the jendi abut tendi I don't remember the the RO you probably do more as a lawyer you're supposed to you know but uh it's it's not the right to use and abuse which is the the the Roman one that's captured by capitalism it's the right to almost like Shepherd over the right to care for so the the notion of property in the feudal era was like you have a duty very similar today to the Chinese capitalist class like they have a the more capital the more responsibility the bigger Duty they have to society and to the common good I think that was notion of property was one that was centered on hearing for that property no that's that's true but I I think that's not how the property emerges though right how it emerges is is different it emerges as a as a kind of private property where Lords can be they can be um benevolent and they can be malevolent right and they have that right they have that ability because that's where the right begins and ends but when feudalism stabilizes into kind of political order which is I think the exception within feudalism to be honest a larger political order of like you know France or the Holy Roman Empire whatever that's when you have a kind of notion of like okay what actually is the right of property from the perspective of the monarchy you know from the perspective of the Empire and so on how how does it recognize it but but the premises are entirely different this is why feudalism I think was distinct from Asiatic modes of production I know it's not a view held in Marxism leninism usually the view is that the Asiatic mode of production thesis is wrong and that well marks would disagree with the the dogmas that develop after that just try to equate many ways the Asiatic mode of production as just a form of feudalism yeah yeah but that becomes that becomes a kind of Orthodoxy in the OR Marxist leninist countries yeah yeah but uh which I disagree with I I think there's a significance to private property perhaps beginning with ancient Greece you know and through Rome and through feudalism According to which like there is this right of the individual to own this and pretty much do whatever they want want with it whether that's acknowledged or not I even in capitalism you can't do whatever you want with it even in the 19th century L Fair era right but more or less the rights of the property owner are where the state ends more or less right whereas in the Asiatic mode of production it's this isn't the case you have a far more highly integrated Society where Property Owners quote unquote do actually function as like administrators tending to a flaw like actually on behalf of the state almost and I think but but and I was going to say you know you you could make the argument and I've said this before in half inest half in justest but there's a there is a seran dimension to which I do view the Asiatic mode of production as socialism like like that they were so they were forms they weren't modern socialist societies but socialist ism is actually more of the default state of what civilization has always been than we get it give it credit for that the trajectory of Western e of of Western European history which remember Marx angles begin drawing from Hegel more or less regard as history proper like markx basically says Asia falls asleep right Real History is in Western Europe is he saying that cuz he's a white supremacist no he's saying that for a specific reason because the materialist conception of history is about changes in the mode of production based on relations of production well Rel the changes in the relations of production can only be measured in terms of the development of private property and Mark says the key difference between the Asiatic mode of production and the trajectory taken on by Western Europe is that the latter sorry the former Asiatic mode production doesn't have a developed notion of private property whereas in Europe the the institution of private property increasingly becomes developed and actually the the epochs of History the forms of life or modes of production are defined by the the development of private property which never simply doesn't happen but the problem with this view of course is that not withstanding the lack of the development of the institution of private property Asiatic modes of production underwent forms of development in terms of culture politics and Technology still right so when I'm when which far superior which were far superior to exactly Chinese cartography they ma the whole world eight centuries before yeah the printing press a million different things yeah and I think that's I that the the the not just the Asiatic but but even the the Mary Indian yeah I agree yeah civilizational it throws marks for a quandry that's why he tells and this is specifically his engagements with keski he says stop using the categories I employed in Europe to classify these because if I'm reading your research correctly we cannot apply those now I I don't know I wouldn't call it socialism I'd call it perhaps something different more communal civilization it's definitely more communal um I mean there have been arguments that there there was in some of these am Indian civilizations uh the larger ones the ones that come close to being sorts of Empires a form of Socialism a form of uh Indian socialism right um whether that could be applied to the Chinese form of life I don't know I think the Chinese area there's Chinese Scholars who definitely argue that yes yeah yeah yeah there I have seen some research Roland Bor CES it of various Scholars uh in 20th century China that look back even to how some of the earliest yeah how some of the what building on some of the 20th century ones how some of the uh early Confucius talked about the purpose of society and uh in it it's it's basically socialist and there's this uh there's this story that's told by one of them I hate I don't have the I've written about this but I don't have it in front of me there's a story that's told by one of them about confucious and Mark's meeting in heaven it's like a narrative fictional story and uh Confucius describes that form of society that they consider to be that he considered to be ideal and Marx is like oh that's Socialism or that's communism so there is a I think there is something to that and there has been some Chinese scholarship in the uh in the area um I think a lot of it is still in Chinese I think I I I would understand the hesitancy to call it socialism because there is a key distinction here right but I think I the reason I call it socialism is because usually when we use that word we're also implying a substantive basis of like you know concrete social relationships which are recognized as such and which are regarded as the primary ends of production and society and life right and the reproduction of those relationships those communal relationships and I would stress to emphasize that that is already there for the norm as the norm of the civilizations of mankind that the reproduction of societies and communities and forms of coexistence between people and relations between people which are not predicated actually purely outside of the West right outside of the West exactly right which are not actually predicated on The View that like some people are human and others are subhuman but are that are predicated on The View that there is a common reality we share and that is the object of all production and you know all of the land is actually owned in common it's just man the difference has come in terms of How It's managed and so on with bureaucracy and whatever and I think that that is really the norm for nonwestern and the reason I didn't mention nonwestern you know who agrees with you yeah very thoroughly WB de yeah his last area research and and some of some of it hasn't been published uh was on Russia China and some of the Asian civilizations and explaining how socialism is just it's natural to them because there's something within their civilization that is just uh the the relations the forms of intercourse that have dominated their civilizational development naturally tends towards the modern conception of socialism but I but I think and I think when we look at that it's the norm for the majority of mankind in its history we look at that and then you know we say okay but these are concrete forms of sociality right these are specific forms of sociality this is not socialism in the abstract this is not socialism in other words in its modern form so the real distinction is not between socialism and class Society I don't think I think the real operative distinction for most of Mankind's history is socialism and modern socialism and I may go so as far to say is that capitalism is just a detour between the two capitalism is for China and Russia all capitalism was was a detour between socialism and modern socialism in Russia's case that would hinge on the argument that the Roman office were already they had feudalism makes it a little bit different I I I I I understand but the romanovs you would say China was feudal no no no I'm saying Russia had some that's what I was going to mention because it would be predicated on The View that with the romanovs comes the introduction of a already a kind of early early capitalist modernity a feudal Capital yeah yeah that's how I would qu that I was going to qualify but um but um so how do we understand that distinction I think the key to understanding it is that what mad the the the modern element of socialism is actually strangely American actually because uh and I'll qualify that because all the the all it is is a kind of um it's a kind of disclaimer let's say which says we cannot make absolutely certain um assumptions about the concrete content of the sociality before the fact that it it's before the fact of it being expressed in reality in other words modern socialism differs from premodern socialism and that in the case of premodern socialism there is a kind of taking for granted of the concrete content of social relationships to the point where calling it socialism is bizarre because the notion of like sociality in the abstract divorced from its actual concrete instantiation can I say something requires requires a a negation that they that was simply impossible for them and which required Europe's intervention right what's interesting about that is um they weren't not that I know of I'm not a researcher in this area uh but it doesn't seem like they were asking themselves the question what sort of form of life are we exactly precisely that's exactly it right and it's the same like the conditions that lead to that question presuppose a fall a break precis going precisely exactly and that's what happens I I I I think it's it's a fall that leads to the emergence of of of Western philosophy yep um if you look at the conditions in malas it was a war of all against all um you have an explicit Clash of interest between the elite that common uh sort of sit kitee this this ethical life that individuals were naturally connected to it begins to break down um the common bonds begin to break down and you have a a ruling class that in order to salvage those in malas they begin to develop these great monuments for the gods because they assume that if they're able to bring back a form of belief in these Gods the order will restabilize what ended up happening was that in the process of developing those big monuments you have a incredible leap in technological devices that were developed for the sake of being able to accomplish those tasks for The Monuments The Monuments being able to to build The Monuments if uh I have u in my University the the person that has uh carried forth this this study um and that has kind of revolutionized the area of ancient philosophy Robert Han he's someone who I've worked with that was his ta for a year um that's his thesis some of the principal philosophers of medas Aristophanes not Aristophanes Jus um the's uh and the other two with the I forget anaximander not an aximand the names are slipping it's late in the night but they were also um Architects and it was on the basis of these projects that were uh commissioned by the elite in order to recapture the faith the ethical life the sish kite that was uh being destroyed that they're forced to and and it promotes one you have this fall that leads to this origins of philosophy but you also have at the level of the productive forces these technological developments these Revolutions in the forces of production um can you can you by the way send me uh that book that describes that because uh I have really been struggling to find good sources on Greek technology and how that emerges and uh it's Robert Han that's the Robert Han and uh there's also send me or text me yeah on Discord anything cuz um but but you know um I think what we're also talking about with this pattern of the Fall is also this is the most important thing recognition of a fall it's really always a recognition of a fall that plagues Western thinking we used to be pure we used to have a golden age we've somehow descended from that so how do we return to it right the epitome is Christianity you know this sin that connects I me even even the context of the Roman Empire forming was the corruption of the Republic right and the the cycle of kind of degradation and then searching for the kind of golden past to redeem ourselves from that degradation you can even say to an extent like fascism in a lot of ways is is kind of interpreting history in this way right it's like very overt and explicit there like there's an ideal point in the past we've departed from how do we return to that right that's why there's in fascism and this might not be popular to say but I I don't care um it's a form of utopian socialism absolutely yeah it's a form of reactionary utopian I think you know when you say that people need to understand that just proves the stakes of the transition between between capitalism and socialism actually people are like whoa are you saying it's inevitable for Marx no it actually can go wrong and we can be consumed by Madness and have a dysfunctional civilization that kills itself that is 100% possible like the inevitability of socialism isn't NE isn't necessarily going to be a good thing right it can be utopian the utopian kind right so I'm actually my my my qualification would be that uh I mean Marx is clear that you either have a revolution and a new form of life emerge or the dissolution of all classes and I I think uh you know yeah to quote Luxenberg it's it's in our context it would be Socialism or barbarism I wouldn't consider if there's if there's not a scientific understanding of the transition you will Mater it will materially impose itself upon us but how we react to it could quite literally lead to our Extinction annihilation of civilization itself but you know uh going back to the kind of origins of alienation that you're talking about and mentioning it's obviously also there with heraclitus you know I I I not to bring we're not going to discuss Dugan right now because it's too late but he does mention something in political platinised the same thing so I guess we don't have to mention Dugan but when heraclitus his famous phrase all is one like what does he actually mean by that does he mean a return to the kind of concreteness and organic Unity of the preall and it's actually the opposite when heraclitus says all is one he actually means the all as a pure multiplicity of differences that the pure laceration of being into infinitely kind of divisible different components that is one that is actually the truth of being that is one that is what the whole is the whole of reality is actually its division into multiple parts to paraphrase Lenin right heraclitus is describing exactly what you're talking about in the philosophical form he's describing this kind of loss and this fall from I don't know what we would call them organic social relationships organic communal bonds and I mentioned you always because it's a recurring theme in my Outlook and my writings and stuff is just like when heraclitus talks about the dreamer right who awaken from their dream and cannot recall the dream and and is searching to remember and recall the dream it's like searching to recover from the fall is the same thing you're there's a discontinuity between the premise and the conclusion which I think Western Civilization quote unquote because we're not going to get into it too much but it's like it isn't inevitable that Rome turns culminates in neoclassical Britain you know in the 17th century that's not inevitable R also became the Ottoman Empire same thing with Greece Greece also became something that wouldn't necessarily have culminated into Rome it's just that there was this trajectory we can more or less identify as a consistent tragectory defined by these increasing relations based on alienation and abstraction and so on the trajectory the connection is not geographical exactly that's what I mean to say it's it's not it's not actually oh that's that's because of like the European as a unified organic history it's it's it's a specific trajectory defined by a specific kind of um relationship toward uh concrete civilization let's say right different type of sociality exactly but but I I think the essence of a civilization the civilization is not just this yeah biological right exactly and then but I think of intercourse I think I think though what I would say is that when we understand like we can also understand it as a as a recognition of the discontinuity and then an obsession with once we recognize this discontinuity holy [ __ ] we can't forget about it we're burdened with it and we're trying to we're trying to amarate it we're trying to like go back we don't want to go to this direction we're burdened with this discontinuity between the dream and now that I'm awake and I have to recall it let me just go back into the wholesomeness right of where I came from and it's precisely the attempt to do that which digs the deeper hole even further so I think in in this limited extent because a lot of people say like oh I'm anti-white and I'm anti-european and I hate Europeans and I think actually I think this is a part of the dialectic of humanity and were it not in Europe that this process took place it would have happened else I think there's signs that it was it could have Japan could have been a trajectory for this as well if you study how Japan is responding to Mainland China and uh Korea and what's going on in Asia Japan is also kind of having a it seems like a Greek moment of some kind maybe right so there and there's other locations I'm sure where it's similar but it is a it is like a devil's advocate that isn't isn't easy to respond to like it's it's not necessarily true that Europe is like a yakubian ape who like basically [ __ ] up everyone else was getting it right and like Europe were just [ __ ] and they got it wrong I think no there there there this there is something there that was not being addressed by others not because others were deficient or incapable but it's like a division of labor of world history Europe was attending to this specific issue this specific quandry the others were attending to other kinds of issues and quandries right or which weren't actually issues but you get what I'm saying like this is part of the dialectic of universal world history and it's like to this extent it's it's true that I don't know if without the Greek moment there would have been the leap in technology there was that led to the uh that that that corresponded to the helenistic era right ditto for Rome and then ditto for industrial capitalism I agree that Asia in terms of the development ofch technology lapped Europe for the most part for world history but the rapidity of the advance of their productive forces in such a short window of time attested to a different Paradigm of Technology that's happening in Europe what do you mean by who's the they that you're referring to in that last part uh Asia or Europe Europe's rapidity of the development of the productive forces attested to a different Paradigm of technology according to which technology was just this kind of I don't know if I get into it like it's something in abstraction from the concrete it's presumed to be at least in abstraction from the concrete reality of production and social relations and so on and it's highly experimental and it's highly kind of um almost individualistic in in its conception right and the Paradigm of technological development in Asia seems to be less less that and more kind of in harmony with the deeper premises of production and the general kind of ontological Outlook underpinning um people's people's uh way of life you know or does that make sense or no what I'm saying parts of it yeah I like in suspending these like ontological assumptions about reality corresponding to the alienation of trajectory of Europe if we call it Europe right beginning with ancient Greece that opens a window of like accelerated technological development which then of course has to be reapp applied to reality and then you get the business of my my question would be uh if in Asia and not just uh uh you know the Far East right they in the in the near and Middle East and what we would call the the Middle East um West Asia if you had technological developments and developments in intellectual life that were far exceeding those in in in the west um because if if I'm maybe I'm mistaking what what you're saying but it seems like there's something in the fall that is directly connected to uh seeking some sort of response to it that is conjoined with the rapid development that we find in the I think it's more kind of like these more I don't know if I'm using this word correctly these more concrete civilizations or or Asiatic civilizations let's say are where the majority of Mankind's progress is happening but they also you know these civilizations rise and fall they EB and flow and what we call the history of Western Civilization are a series of points in between these es in flows for example ancient Greece emerges where after the Bronze Age collapse right um I'm sure you can make a similar argument about Rome with regard to the either rivaling helenistic powers or maybe Carthage something of that nature um and then you know it's it's clear that industrial Europe early modern Europe really intervenes at the lower point of some of the Asian Civ izations like the Ottoman Empire for example right and that was a window of opportunity and and all the that specific trajectory of history is stitched together by or United by is like being this kind of EX point of historical exceptionality that inserts itself at the decline of these different like Empires and civilizations and so so so I I think basically what I'm trying to say is that the reason for the rapid accelerated um development of the productive forces isn't because of the superiority of one civilization or the other because the only thing that unites Western Civilization on a larger historical level put it this way it were it not for there is it is not necessarily true that Greece had to be part of the trajectory of Western civil ization Greece could have just been a footnote in Persia's history right right yeah Rome could have just been a footnote in like the development of uh the Ottoman Empire right the the the the Empire that's based in Anatolia right in the Levant these could have all just been exceptional footnotes Within These wider civilizations because those civilizations themselves have footnotes those footnotes just weren't um brought into the historical continuity of what we call Western Civilization but they also had these exceptional footnotes of like moments of abstraction and doubt and kind of like similar to the Greek moment I guess but the history of Western Civilization stitches together all of these different moments into one continuity right one continuity of progress uh so I think um well it's it's it's um it's capitalist modernity that does that retrospective yes exactly think purposes and it intensifies how it does because even even at the beginning of modernity capitalist modernity um certain narratives I mean you look at the the basic philosophy textbooks it was understood that philosophy developed in Africa and then uh that the main the the first few Greek philosophers they took a lot of their ideas from Africa they basically stole everything from what I know like literally everything the thesis that eliminates any connection to Africa uh is is one that develops frankly at the end of the 18th century and it doesn't get popularized till the middle of the 19th century so even within modernity itself uh capitalist modernity there was a period of time that it took for it to disconnect itself from these Eastern civilizations and and in the case of Africa Southern civilizations in the realm of philosophy because it was seen as a common project I guess I would ask you bluntly and also I I want to let you know we probably should wrap up soon because I got to go to bed have a family te but to ask you bluntly and I don't actually presume to know this it's some it's a question I've always struggled with actually and i' I've never come to a satisfactory conclusion was European modernity necessary like is there a timeline in which this that never happened we just have China's dynastic existence we just have you know Russia we just have these Middle Eastern Empires the gunpowder Empires take Europe out of the equation like would they have just developed normally because I I've see arguments on both sides surprisingly I have seen convincing arguments that no they would have continued developing technologically and probably wouldn't have dealt with as many calamitous problems but then I've also seen the argument that actually no Europe did awaken these civilizations to something fundamental which they didn't have before the enlightenment is real actually there is a reality of Enlightenment it's pure just what produced what woke up the enlightenment was the Arab world no no I I I agree but I I I think the the pressing question is I understand the premises of Europe are not just Europe it's mainly coming from but once we've established that like was Europe itself something necessary for world history and I do lean although I would say I'm like 6040 on this 60 I do lean yes but there is a huge 40% in me where I'm like maybe it wasn't necessary maybe this is like in is Islam you know the story of el right where like the devil basically [ __ ] up and like he didn't actually have to [ __ ] up but he did anyway and like that's what we're faced with now to overcome so is Europe just El basically and I don't 40 % of me thinks it is but 60% says no that this is actually something fundamentally necessary for world history and exceptional which if it didn't happen in Europe yeah maybe it would have happened elsewhere but it would have been the same thing it would have been the same El like let's say ontological crime committed by Europe and modernity against the traditional CI you know the human existence I think I think posing it in an either or is perhaps not correct right because we could say that it was an embryo that it was a ltic potential throughout these different civilizations but that doesn't make it uh that doesn't make its emerg in something that's necessary you get what I'm saying um so it could it could very well have uh occurred it could have not occurred but um the fact that it was necess NE or not is I I mean that's just not a question I ask myself I think there's positive fruits that are brought about by modernity I think that the enlightenment is good uh the valuing of prog of of historical progress the notion of a universal Humanity that that we all share in I don't think it's new I don't think it's exclusive to the en I I agree and I I have this thesis I think I told you about it maybe or you've heard it or maybe you read it on tter that like that was the subjective articulation of what was objectively created by the Mongols like European Enlightenment is a is a failed attempt at the completion of the Mongol Revolution actually like the one that leads to and and I I I really do insist upon this concept for me of Mongol modernity that there is a lost origin of modernity with because you know civilization had always been based on a on a nomadic sedentary dialectic and the Mongols actually represented the enclosure of this dialectic the final kind of nomadic enclosure of space right of uh Geographic space uh which which kind of eliminates The Outsider Insider distinction finally um and puts an end to that dialectic and it's it's it's fascinating and then tamarlane is like the one who's trying to he's like the Don quot of the Mongols he's trying to return uh this I this I don't know if I'd call it an ideal but this kind of the Mongol Empire more or less he's trying to revive it you know this notion that this is and he's obviously combining with religion but I I I haven't studied Mongol civilization enough to to speak about it uh but all I can say is this without aichen without avaros without the left aristotelians of the Arab world um there could not have been jordano Bruno no yeah I totally agree with that the thinkers that are the conditions for the possibility of the different forms of Enlightenment that Europe goes through yeah I think um but no I I you want if you want to see that as like what they're doing at the realm of thought is trying to realize the civilization that um trying to realize the ends of the civilization out of which which didn't fully recognize itself right didn't fully recognize its own latent reality and the conclusion from it and I I actually agree you know people kind of think I'm like this reactionary who hates modernity but I don't think modernity is avoidable the Europe thing is another the specific way it happened in Europe that's what I think is an open question but no I I do think modernity is is um unavoidable and I agree that the enlightenment is all but I also agree with and I have the full qualification of like what dominic L sudro says like every great thing about the enlightenment was also an equally horrific horrible thing yeah yeah yeah at the same time paradoxical twin birth exactly and I and I don't think you can appreciate the enlightenment without that I feel like you know the whole Steven Pinker like oh it's just like a line going up we got enlightened it's it's really it's stupid right like yeah he's been doing the debates with uh um with merch me I don't know if you've seen those but no no I didn't see the debate but I I understand the contrasting it's so stupid but it's like but I think that's why I when I think of Marxism I I see it as the realization of the rational konel in that tradition while leaving out the I I I kind of agree but I I feel like I take it a step farther and I think this is what gets me in trouble and we can maybe uh maybe leave on this note with a few more if you want to have your own conclusion but I think that it's not just that Marxism recog recognizes something in the enlightenment that wasn't fully fulfilled that the enlightenment failed to live up to and Marxism is going to realize it fin finally and fully I think the the logic is correct but I think the truth is The Enlightenment failed because it didn't appreciate its premises which were outside of the Enlightenment and which were in let's say gask Khan like metaphorically so because the enlightenment didn't pay tribute to genus Khan that's why it forgot itself that's why it forgot it was a spark of brilliance which was forgotten and that Marxism will redeem the European Enlightenment only by returning it to the Cradle the Mongol cradle from which it really did descend and that Marxism actually is what allows us to appreciate this historical discontinuity between a conclusion that has forgotten its premise right as the beginning with heraclitus understood and that the the dialectical and materialist dialectical Outlook or the dialectical materialist Outlook right is precisely what completes this and that's why when I say it is the most advanced Outlook of mankind it sounds like a meme sounds cartoonish sounds like I'm like a fanatic but I actually mean it this is actually the most advanced Outlook achieved by mankind but it's that shouldn't sound Preposterous to anyone within the Marxist tradition that's yeah but I don't think we thought there was a better Outlook why I I think most self-proclaimed marxists don't agree with that I think they say oh no actually Marx you know he made some contributions to Academia but really dialectical materialism is like this well they they hesitate to even call it a world view yeah exactly exactly and you see this in Michael again a value form guy Michael Hinrich and others like they part of their criticism of the Soviets is that supposedly it made Marxism into a world view which is just ridiculous in my Anthology um on on text from the classics of Marxism speaking about dialectical materialism have a whole section in the introduction uh defending why we should be speaking of Marxism as a a worldview um I I I don't know if I can follow you put it nicely to the to the conclusion I see the premises and and they're they're not as as wacky as you know a sense of immediacy with the conclusion would would lead some people to think um there is something uh in the Marxist understanding of history there is a sort of Glorious return to a uh to a past that was much more Rosy but at a higher stage yeah and and that that's something that I have absolutely do agree with socialism is in many ways um the overcoming of this fall that I think as well was was necessary the civilizational fall and that's why um it it almost like restarts history at a higher level that's why Marx is is is very clear that what we're experiencing is a form of prehistory we're not experiencing history y yeah history starts with uh once this this fall is is over and that's almost like uh now is just the era of an accidental existence not a rational if you put it in in like human terms in like individual human terms you can really speak about yourself and how you are after you have a major [ __ ] once you have a major [ __ ] and you're knocked down on your feet and you're forced to figure out how to climb up after that that's when you can really say okay I'm this type of human being um and I think at the macro level that's really what's what's going on it's after that fall and this is this is a straight hegle it's only after that process of mediation of something becoming an other first appearing as uh an other that comes out of nowhere in oppositional other and then once you see it uh in retrospect in light of its development you realize that that other was you all along and was a necessary moment in your development into a higher uh into a higher stage so um you know and I as a final note um I think we'll both agree with is that you know in America America's perceived fall its greatest alien other is communism according to American Consciousness and as American Communists people think how what are you talking about America is the most Anti saying we know even as someone who calls myself a MAA communist using that slogan I don't know if you partake it doesn't matter I'm where but it's like we are committing to a specific dialectic which according to this deeper Outlook of the materialism and dialectics is like fundamental to our ontological Outlook like that specific contradiction the form of that contradiction that we're pursuing is actually allows us to be in proximity with what we consider to be excuse my French kind of metaphysical absolute of reality this process precisely as you describe of the beginning the fall and then the reconciliation and it's interesting is that in the beginning like there's even the connection between the beginning looking uh like a less developed form of the end because modern socialism modern utopian socialism but the embryon IC stage of modern it's born in America yep it's a Utopian community here I live like an hour away from some of them even before the utopian even before then the first religious communities that came here literally were setting up communes and explicitly just like the anabaptist in Germany with muner they were here too and they were saying yeah we're going to just have everything produced in common I mean American that's it's called New Harmony it's called new is called New because it was Harmony before that and it was one of these Christian utop exactly yeah projects but I think that's actually a great note it's also an ominous note it's very we're not going to reveal anything but it's a very foreshadowing note guys tell you that but Carlos I'm not just saying this I think this was probably one of the most fruitful discussions the most enlightening ones I've ever had if you're watching this you congratulations and really you should you should feel honored if you're watching this you should feel glad you're so much content for tonight's stream like even if you're an idiot you walked away from this with something 100% like if you have no knowledge about anything but um no it was really a pleasure talking to you and I even like how we disagree it it's actually productive like how we're actually arriving at productive conclusions and thinking about things in new ways and um you know I think uh people shouldn't be sleeping on you you're a great philosopher you're a great thinker you're extremely knowledgeable um and uh it's very refreshing you know I think yeah I I wasn't planning on streaming this long by the way I was planning on ending it at like 10:30 so yeah but but uh no thank you so much for coming on and really appreciate it and no thank you for for having me on it's been a pleasure um and thank you for for the kind words I I reciprocate them um yeah it's been a a tremendously enjoyable conversation I have a few things to uh to look up when I'm done um and I think uh we'll stay in contact exchanging information I think you'll enjoy the the Han sources if I'm you know familiar at all with some of the stuff you've been developing you'll you'll enjoy those but um yeah thank you for having me on brother and hopefully the the first of of many more similar conversations definitely I mean I didn't know how the conversation would go I don't know if it would be boring or whatever but like it's clear to me this is actually educational stuff like this this is actually exposing people to a lot of I don't even have the words to describe it a lot of ways of thinking they probably didn't have before and thinking about things they weren't thinking about before and like I think as we both continue to research and like work on our respective projects we'll even we'll have even more to discuss and talk about but yeah um I do got to go get to bed but uh yeah again great talking and yeah we'll definitely do this again of course brother thank you
