he diddi Behind Bars and indicted on federal sex trafficking and racketeering allegations tther unr's tweet about Kevin spacy last month triggered all the allegations against him bestselling British author Neil Gaiman has released a statement denying he has ever engaged in non-consensual sex the MEO movement brought about the cancellations criminal convictions and fall of many a male celebrity when thinking of the MEO era while figures like Bill Cosby Harvey Weinstein and R Kelly might be who come to your mind first it's a z and Sari story that should keep you up at night because the Z's story has a lot to do with all of us how did a ziz and Sari go from wearing a times up pin at the Golden Globe Awards at the height of his career to support the MEO movement only to end up outed as a sexual abuser himself well we created him [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] in the year 2025 by this point I think many people have probably heard the term rape culture at some point but I'm not sure many people know what it means it refers to the idea that rape and sexual abuse are common place and normalized in our communities as well as media and entertainment as the result of the community's attitudes and misunderstandings about gender sexuality gender roles and sex and I think Aziz and sari's accuser story perfectly illustrates how our society our cultural understanding or misunderstanding of sex and how we go about teaching boys and men to pursue sex to see sex to see women as well as how we go about teaching girls and women about sex create scenarios where people are casually regularly and most importantly and insidiously unintentionally engaging in sexually inappropriate and coercive conduct I.E rape culture but before we talk about disease and the world that made imp possible let's first take a look at this story about the 4B movement in South Korea more and more women are choosing this lifestyle and protest against South Korean patriarchal society

how rap is the one inexcusable crime that's never accidental that's always clear-cut and black and white those discussions always interest me not just as a criminal defense attorney but more as someone who seeing reasonable Minds disagree and be unable to arrive at a consensus on whether something is raped and how or whether it should be punished because the way we think about and engage in sex in our real lives can often run in conflict with the law and consent I remember being in my criminal law class during my first year of law school when the class erupted into debate and split opinions all over the room over whether different incidents in our casebook were rape what the law should be as a pertaining to rape and how the laws about rape and consent didn't often reflect real life let me explain what I mean rape isn't universally defined different places in the country have different definitions of what rape is what consent is and thus what was legally considered rap and how or if it would be punished for example there was a Baltimore Case be read that stuck with me the state versus Rusk the facts of the case went something like this a woman offered a male acquaintance named Rusk aride home when she arrived at his home and park to let him out the man insisted she'd come inside locked her door and took her keys and turned her car off and demanded she go in the house or she wouldn't get her keys back feeling afraid and like she had no other choice she eventually went in the house with him but she continued to plead with him that she wanted to leave but he told her to stay he eventually began undressing her and kissing her while she cried and she asked him if he would let her go without killing her if she did what he told her and he told her that he would so she proceeded to have sex with him because she was afraid for her life a jury initially convicted the man of rape but a court of appeals reversed the conviction because rape in Baltimore is considered sex by physical force or threat of physical force and that appeals court felt that despite the situational evidence of the man taking her keys forcing her to go inside his home kissing and undressing her while she cried and pleaded to go home and affirmatively recognizing that she fared for her life because she explicitly asked him if he would let her go without killing her if she did what he wanted and him replying yes that there wasn't sufficient evidence that he raped her because he did not actually physically force her or explicitly threaten to physically force her most of my class agreed that this was the wrong decision that the woman had been raped most of the class agreed that a rape law that defined rape as only being raped if there was physical force was a bad one because it leads to outcomes like the one above where people are coerced and scared into sexual acts they do not consent to and what's scary and worth mentioning is that this definition of rape that we're recognizing is problematic sex by physical Force without consent is an upgrade from the old definition of rape which was sex by force without consent and the utmost resistance which basically meant that victims had to physically fight off their attackers for it to be considered rape which of course would expose them to more danger and a greater likelihood of being killed but it is also reflective of an underlying belief by the lawmakers that some level of coercion or cajoling hesitant women women who were resistant into sex was normal which is why it had to be the utmost resistance to count as rape this is rape culture now what was interesting is despite the fact that most people in my class saw that legal definition of rape as problematic because it leads to outcomes like the one above many of those same people saw issues with rape laws designed to avoid those kinds of outcomes like what New Jersey has New Jersey has something called affirmative consent which which means that in New Jersey rape isn't just sex without consent rape is sex without affirmative consent meaning it doesn't make it consensual sex just because the person didn't say no or didn't explicitly not consent they need to explicitly say yes they want to have sex for you to have consent even though this law is designed to make sure there are no gray areas or confusion about whether sex is consensual or not many people in my class pointed out that that's not how most sexual encounters happen in real life people aren't stopping mid whatever they're doing to say see want to have sex many men in the class said that stopping foreplay or whatever they do to ask a woman explicitly whether she wanted to have sex would be a mood killer and likely cause women who wanted to have sex not to want to anymore and both men and women in my class discuss this kind of song and dance that happens in many of our sexual experiences where women don't want to explicitly say they want to have sex and sort of pretend to be cajoled into it don't worry we're going to get back to this so even though there was some consensus about whether it was rape in the state versus R case that consensus was gone by the time we analyzed a Pennsylvania case called The Commonwealth versus berkwitz in Pennsylvania rape is sex by force without consent but Force hair doesn't mean just physical force it means forcible compulsion meaning that there needs to be force or some kind of threat in the burkwitz case their bare bone facts Loosely go something like this burtz and the young woman he was alleged to have raped were call it sophomores at the time the incident took place what the woman alleges happened is that she went to her boyfriend's dorm Lounge to meet him but he wasn't there so she went to his room to find him she said that she knocked on the door several times but no one answered so she wrote a note to her boyfriend then knocked again she still received no answer so this time she tried the doorknob which was unlocked she said she then went into the room and saw someone lying on the bed with a pillow over his head and she said she thought it was her boyfriend but it was actually his roommate Berkowitz she said she then asked burwitz which wrester was her boyfriend's and then she left the note she had rid she said burkwitz then asked her to hang out for a while so she did but then burkwitz started Ed making certain advances at her such as kissing her and lifting up her shirt and bra and fondling her she said she then said no once but they continued making out and that eventually burkowitz got up and locked the door she took her own pants off and they had sex and she never physically tried to stop or resist him but she did say no she then alleged that he came on her and she left the room and went to the lobby where she ran into a boyfriend who she then told that burtz raped her and he called the police now the class got really into the weeds fighting about this case and people truly would ided people saw the facts very differently some people saw burwitz locking the door as similar to Russ taking his victim's Keys While others argued that someone getting up to lock the door before they have sex as typical Behavior especially when you have a roommate and an indicator that she knew they were going to have sex some people saw her continuing to make out with berwitz while saying no but also having taken off her own pants as reflective of the fact that she didn't really mean no but was just doing a song and dance young women and men often do some people argue that the woman only said it was rap because she ran into to her boyfriend some people argue that it was obviously rap because she said no even if she proceeded to make out with him and didn't physically try to stop him there was even some debate about whether the young woman had gone to the room looking for burkwitz in the first place and there was some debate about whether or not they engaged in oral sex meant that it couldn't be raped because people had a hard time wrapping their head around the idea that people could be engaging in oral sex non-consensually and I find that really interesting because there was a case not a case it happened while I was in college at Ohio University I remember there was a girl on Court Street they video recorded a guy going down on her it was viral everywhere and she said that you know she was drunk and she was drunk it was not consensual it was rape the campus was torn over that like there was no ability to process that like because I guess how people perceive oral sex or you're being pleasured or something you know what I mean that it could be raped and I'm mentioning that specifically because I think that's something interesting for us to chew on and unpack in this discussion of rape culture anyway what stood out to me about this debate and has always stuck with me isn't what conclusions people arrived at it's the fact that even many of us who thought it was rape or at least some kind of sexually inappropriate behavior still understood how there could be confusion in the mind of burtz and others because so many of our sexual experiences and practices mirror these kinds of Blurred Lines so much of this is normalized and this is what rape culture actually is because as insane as it should sound to reasonable Minds that we have to debate whether it was raped because of XYZ reason even though a woman said no it's a reflection of so many of our sexual experiences I can think back to so many of my own experiences as a young woman where I wanted to have sex but didn't feel comfortable just exploring my sexuality or Desiring sex in fear of being judged or [ __ ] shamed so it felt necessary for it to seem like the boy's idea or at his request or insistance where it was part of the process for me to be convinced or reasoned with to do anything sexual how many young boys and men are taught that they're basically supposed to talk women into having sex to conjo them to manipulate them to wear them down to run game how many men are taught that this is what game is young boys are basically raised to be on a quest to try to get as many women to sleep with them as possible but sex isn't portrayed as something women want just as much as men or voluntarily engage in because we want to sex virginity it's all taught as something that's taken from girls and women think of men's Coming of Age movies like The American Pie films or even the movies for older men like Wedding Crashers or any of Barney's High Jinks and how I met your mother shoots Barney and Ted or even cartoons like Pula Pew and Johnny Bravo say baby how's about you and I my way Mr it's all about boys and men can trick women into sex and our media mirrors real life where girls are taught to be ashamed of or hide sexual desires where we're taught to play koi and engage in this little song and dance where we don't or can't enthusiastically want or ask for sex even if we want sex so the mixed signals become part of this little song and dance we play and that my friends is the breeding ground for rape this is what we mean when we say we live in a rape culture that our attitudes about sex and gender Foster practices that wittingly create sexual abusers and sexual abuse victims in rape culture our culture the responsibility to protect ourselves from what boys and men are being trained to do is often placed on young girls and women young girls are taught to protect their virginity from boys and men who want to take it girls and women are shamed for being manipulated by men for buying into the game men have been trained to sell them young girls are expected to hide their changing bodies from boys and men who wish to objectify them and they're shamed if they don't they're adultification children particularly black girls is something I believe is underd discussed in the context of rape culture it's the reason more adults spent time criticizing and shaming a 12-year-old Blue Ivy and the appropriateness of her dress because of her changing body then they did discussing her father being accused of raping a 13-year-old girl her age while boys and men are taught to treat the world as a sexual playground where they should accumulate as many partners as possible not even because they truly desire sex or multiple partners but as a means of affirming their masculinity and sense of dominance over weak men as well as women young girls and women are never encouraged to explore their sexuality or sexual needs to enthusiastically intentionally or vocally pursue sex but instead we're taught to treat sex as leverage in a negotiation for some larger kind of commitment we must want because we're women it's never even conceived of that we could or should want to have sex for wanting to have sex sake that we could or should have multiple sex partners it's never conceived of that we should voluntarily be giving away sex if we're not getting something else out of it because surely the sex in and of itself can't be what we get out of it because boys and men aren't even being taught to see pleasing the women they sleep with as a requirement for sex the women are just conquest and I think a perfect illustration of everything I've discussed thus far is a ziz Ansari which is a name you probably haven't heard of in a while because well where is aiz that's the question I recently asked a friend of mine after he crossed my mind out the blue I wasn't sure if he'd actually disappeared from the public or if I just hadn't checked up on him recently so I looked into it and he really has been virtually Mia since his last Netflix comedy special which came after he was accused by a woman of pressuring her into sexual acts although since I decided to look into where he's been he has since announced an upcoming comedy tour of the many many many men in Hollywood to be accused of some form of sexually inappropriate behavior the AAS and sorry allegations are particularly interesting to me because the actual story of what happened between Aziz and sorry and the woman who accused him of assault are so remnant of a lot of people's everyday sexual experiences that we haven't been taught to see is aive including my own I asked earlier how did aiz and Sari go from wearing a times a pin at the Golden Globes to support the me too movement to being outed as a sexual abuser himself well ironically enough him wearing that pen and the apparent contradiction of it is what propelled his accuser to speak up Aziz andara's accuser was a 23-year-old Brooklyn photographer who published her own account of what happened to her in babe.net and her own words this is what happened she met anari at an event and he brushed her off at first but after he realized they both brought the same kind of camera to the event an old model from the'80s he was impressed they flirted a little he took two pictures of her she snapped some of him and then she and her date went back to the dance floor she said it was like one of those things where you're aware of the other person all night we would catch eyes every now and then they ran into each other one last time right as Grace was leaving her real identity is not known to us Grace is an alias use for the story at ansari's suggestion Grace put her number in his phone when her plane landed back in New York the next day she already had a message from him they exchanged flous banter over text for a week or so before he asked her to go out with him on Monday September 25th the date didn't go as planned the night would end with Grayson and Uber hm in tears messaging her friends about how anari behaved she spoke to babe.net where she published a story they spoke to the first friend she told about it and reviewed the messages on her phone the day after the incident she wrote a long text to anari saying quote I just want to take this moment to make you aware of your behavior and how uneasy it made me to that message andari response clearly I misread things in the moment and I am truly sorry the mobile phone number from which his texts to her were sent matches up with his details on a searchable public register they spoke to Grace and she said when we met andar just won best actor for his Netflix show master of none at the Golden Globes where he declared his support for the fight against sexual assault and harassment by wearing a times up pin on the red carpet Grace said it was surreal to be meeting up with Ansari a successful comedian and major celebrity and she was excited for their date before meeting Ansari Grace told friends and co-workers about the date and consulted her go-to group chat about what she should wear to fit the cocktail Chic dress code he gave her she settled on a tank top dress and jeans after arriving at his apartment in Manhattan on Monday evening they exchanged small talk and drank wine it was white she said I didn't get to choose and I prefer red but it was white wine then anari walked her to Grand Banks and Oyster Bar on board a historic wooden shoer on the Hudson River just a few blocks away she said it was a beautiful warm September night they discussed NYU comedy and a new secret project he was working on she said she did most of the talking Grace said she sensed and sorry was eager for them to leave she said when the waiter came over he quickly asked for the check and he said like let's get off this boat she recalls that there was still wine in her glass and more left in the bottle he ordered the abruptness surprised her like he got the check and then it was bada boom bada bang we out of there they walked the two blocks back to his apartment building an exclusive address on tribeca's Franklin Street when they walked back in she complimented his marble countertops according to Grace anari turned the compliment into an invitation he said something along the lines of how but you hop up and take a seat within moments he was kissing her he said in a second his hand was on my breast then he was undressing her then he undressed himself she remembers feeling uncomfortable at how quickly things escalated when sari told her he was going to grab a condom within minutes of their first kiss Grace voiced her hesitation explicitly she said I said something like Whoa let's relax for a second Let's Chill she says he then resumed kissing her briefly performed oral sex on her and asked her to do the same thing to him she did but not for long she said it was really quick everything was pretty much touched and done within 10 minutes of hooking up except for actual sex she says andari began making a move on her that he repeated during their encounter the move he kept doing she says was taking his two fingers in a vshape and putting them in my throat to wet his fingers because the moment he'd stick his fingers in my throat he'd go straight from my vagina and try to finger me Grace called the move the claw Ansari also physically pulled her hand toward his penis multiple times throughout the night from the time he first kissed her on the countert onward he probably moved my hand to his dick five to seven times she said he really kept doing it after I moved it away but the main thing was that he wouldn't let her move away from him she compared the path they cut across his apartment to a football play she said it was 30 minutes of me getting up and moving and him following and sticking his fingers down my throat again it was really repetitive it felt like a game throughout the course of her short time in the apartment she said she used verbal and non-verbal cues to indicate how uncomfortable and distressed she was she said most of my discomfort was expressed in me pulling away and mumbling I know that my hand stopped moving at some point she said I stopped moving my lips and turned cold whether Ansari didn't notice Grace's reticence or knowingly ignored it is impossible for her to say I know I was physically giving off cues that I wasn't interested I don't think that was noticed at all or if it was it was ignored andari wanted to have sex she said she remember him asking again and again where do you want me to you while she was still Seated on the countertop she said she found the question tough to answer because she said she didn't want to him at all I wasn't really even thinking of that I didn't want to be engaged in that with him but he kept asking so I said next time and he goes oh you mean second date and I go oh yeah sure and he goes well if I poured you another glass of wine now would it count as our second date he then poured her a glass and handed it to her she excused herself to the bathroom soon after Grace say she spent around 5 minutes in the bathroom collecting herself in the mirror and splashing herself with water then she went back to ansori he asked her if she was okay and she said I said I don't want to feel forc because then I'll hate you and I'd rather not hate you she told babe that at first she was happy with how he reacted he said oh of course it's only fun if we're both having fun the response was technically very sweet and acknowledging the fact that I was very uncomfortable so verbally in that moment he acknowledged that I needed to take it slow then he said let's just chill over there on the couch this moment is particularly significant for Grace because she thought that would be theend of the sexual encounter her remark about not wanting to feel forced had added a verbal component to the queue she was trying to give him about her discomfort when she sat down on the floor next to Ansari who sat on the couch she thought he might rub her back or play with her hair something to calm her down Ansari instructed her to turn around he sat back and pointed to his penis and motioned for me to go down on him and I did I think I just felt really pressured it was literally the most unexpected thing I thought would happened at that moment because I told him I was uncomfortable soon he pulled her back up onto the couch she would tell her friend via text later that night night he made up with me again and says doesn't look like you hate me halfway into the encounter he led her from the couch to a different part of his apartment he said he had to show her something then he brought her to a large mirror bent her over and asked her again where do you want me to you do you want me to you right here he rammed his penis against her ass while he said it pantomiming intercourse she said I just remember looking in the mirror and seeing him behind me he was very much caught up in the moment and I obviously very much wasn't after he bent me over is when I stood up and said no I don't think I'm ready to do this and he said how about we just chill but this time with our clothes on they got dressed sat side by side on the couch they already chilled on and he turned on an episode of Seinfeld she'd never seen it before she said that's when the reality of what was going on sank in it really hit me that I was violated I felt really emotional all at once when we sat down there that that whole experience was actually horrible while the TV played in the background he kissed her again stuck his fingers down her throat again and moved to undo her pants she turned away she remembers feeling in a different mindset at that point she said I remember saying saying you guys are all the same you guys are all the same and sorryi asked her what she meant and when she turned to answer she says he met her with gross forceful kisses after that last kiss Grace stood up from the couch moved back to the kitchen island where she left her phone and said she would call herself a car he hugged her and kissed her goodbye another aggressive kiss when she pulled away he finally relented and insisted he'd call her the car he said it's coming but just tell them your name is Essence she said a name he has joked about using as a pseudonym in his sitcom she teared up in the hallway outside his place pressing the down button on the elevator the Uber was waiting when she left the building he asked if she was Essen she said yes and then she rode back to her Brooklyn apartment I cried the whole ride home at that point I felt violated that last hour was so out of my hand reading aiz and sar's accusers account of what she experienced really struck me because I've been her I know many women who've been her in fact I've been her many times and I think there's something especially painful startling and even like Panic inducing when you actually realize that you've been her that you've had sexual experiences that weren't so consensual where you felt situationally pressured to do something where someone ignored your quiet protest you're pulling away your gentle excuses to leave so you just got it over with and you tell yourself it was consensual or maybe you repress the memories altogether or you work up the strength like Z and sar's accuser did like I've done to tell a man you didn't like what he did that you didn't want to have sex with him that he ignored your indications that you didn't want to do that I've been Grace and I understand plain as day why what aiz and Sari did was a violation and the trauma that comes with that and I also understand exactly how anari could have somehow believed what he was doing was okay he believed it was okay because it was normal in the rape culture that we live in that constantly affirms that kind of conduct reading Grace's account of the night I understood immediately the disease likely began that night thinking sex was the foregone conclusion that he took her to a bar near his apartment and rushed through the date because it was just a formality in his mind a precursor to the sex he thought was implied I know exactly how he would have seen it as perfectly normal to immediately start trying to rush her into sex the minute they entered his home because he thought it was implied that he wants to have sex and would be getting sex if he took this young woman home in his mind he figured she should know that he wanted to have sex by taking her for drinks and bringing her back there I actually could believe that he somehow believed that her many many many Fain attempts at getting him to slow down was just an act I understand it because those are the Norms that create the rape culture we call Our dating culture those are the Norms I've experienced as a woman dating in New York City but it's not unique to New York City I think just as my class had no trouble convicting Rusk but struggle to convict burkowitz I think there are many people who maybe had a much easier time condemning or seeing his monsters other men who've been accused of sexual assault like the R Kelly's and the Bill Cosby and the Weinstein and the Epstein but might have struggled to see what a z and Sari did the same way because it would change how many of us see and feel about our own sexual experience so many of us would be horrified to realize that we've been either aeas or Grace to realize that the things we thought were consensual or normal trials and tribulations of the dating world are bad in fact I know this because I stumbled on a New York Time oped by a woman refusing to see what aiz did as sexual assault because she said it would mean that we've all been sexually assaulted she was so close to getting it and that's really what I want us to tackle this video is not about trying to convince you AAS and sorry is or isn't a monster quite the opposite really I'm trying to point out how our society unwittingly creates aases even to the shock and dismay of the diseases themselves men who think they're against rape that they support victims because in our society rape sexual assault and rape culture isn't always as clear and openly evil as the monster who physically attacks you or locks your car door it comes in the forms of boys and men who've been taught to believe they're supposed to wear you down for sex that your nose are just a game a song and dance you're doing for them to wear you down because you're not a sex sexual being who can should or will explicitly say you want to have sex it comes in the form of men who think that they're entitled to have sex with you if you go out with them it's necessary that we teach everyone maybe even boys and men in particular but everyone that they need enthusiastic consent and that they should not be trying to manipulate kajo wear down and finesse people into having sex with them it's necessary but it's not enough we must also teach everyone that girls and women are sexual beings who can and should feel empowered to expressly want sex if they want and that they shouldn't have to pretend not to want sex or to be embarrassed or to express that or to feel compelled to do a song and dance they shouldn't have to feel like sex is something that's taken from them or Theirs to give away we have to recognize how our sexist and gendered ideas about sex not only leave people vulnerable to being abused it creates the abusers We Can't Stop rape without understanding what rape culture is how it functions and how we root it out [Music]
