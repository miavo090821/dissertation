        "text": "@destined2bebossy I think this is such an important concept that often feels taboo to discuss! Like people often point to women saying that what happened in an incident wasn't rape as \"proof\" that it isn't, but it's also possible that people convince themselves that this behavior is fine because it would retraumatize them if they allowed themselves to admit that it isn't. That doesn't make any of this ok, it just makes it common! \n\nI think it's also important on the flip side to recognize that there are a lot of people who aren't inherently terrible people but who did a terrible thing because society convinced them it was normal. And that doesn't make them a monster, but it still doesn't make the action ok!",

I remember telling him that we will not have sex because I'm on my period. Because he was a nice guy and started taking my clothes off I didn't resist. We had sex for hours but I didn't enjoy a second of it. I kept on asking him to stop or to at least take a break but he wouldn't stop. He had a hard time to finish and did not quit. Finally I came up with an excuse to go home. While trying to clean myself he picked me up while I kept on saying no no no and he entered me again. I resigned again for a bit but once the pain was unbearable I just got up and strongly said no, put my clothes on and went outside to wait for my Uber. He waited with me and I don't know what possessed me but I kissed him good bye. I felt disgusted at myself the entire way home.",

Or just little things I do as a guy that I don't register as something that would make a girl uncomfortable at the time because I don't have the POV of a woman to realize the reality of experiencing it.  Even just as simple as getting caught up in the moment and rushing but then the girl tells you later or very often does not and you simply realize later on in your life looking back \"man that might have made her uncomfortable even if I had no bad intentions\".  Just things that a guy doesn't inherently understand because they haven't lived as a woman and you have to intuit or reflect on or be told to understand the issue or discomfort.\n\nYou have an obligation to realize you're at least ignorant and be more considerate and thoughtful rather than refuse the guilt and get angry with the women around you because the realization of harm makes you feel bad.  If you understand it and are aware of it and still choose to do it at that point you are in fact someone who perpetuates SA",

        "text": "Appreciate your comment! We do have to be nuanced and both men and women should take accountability for their ability to communicate and facilitate a conversation about consent. \n\nI have always been a woman who is interested and likes sex. When I was in college I was at a party where a cute guy was chatting with me at a table game and very lightly putting his hand on my back. I was shy and insecure so I didn’t give him any signs that I liked his actions and he pretty quickly left me alone. \n\nAfterwards, I felt regret about the situation because I would’ve been down to be freaky lol. Part of me thought, if only he would’ve been more insistent. Looking back 6 years later, I realize I actually have regret for not being able to communicate and show what I wanted. I also know myself at that time would not have the self esteem to be direct like that because I had the idea that I shouldn’t be apparent about my desires or vocalize them because that would make me less demure and therefore less desirable and respectable. \n\nThere was a lot of detangling and self growth to be had, and I am happy to say I have done so much since then. A year after that experience, I started learning about the kink community and got educated on consent, preferences, boundaries, etc. I feel very blessed to not have an experience where I wonder if I was coerced into sex. I’ve had pity sex, lame sex, and unsatisfying sex, but all of it was consensual and taught me a little more about what I did want. \n\nIf we want men to obtain consent, women also need to be able to vocalize what we want instead of hoping a man reads us correctly and makes the “right” choice. The boy in college who backed off when I didn’t give him any positive signs gained a lot of respect from me, and that probably made me regret not hooking up with him even more lol. Men who respect women are the most attractive. \n\nEdit: Oops I realized pity sex could be viewed as coercion, so I want to clarify that the guy did not pressure me. I knew he was into me and I thought he had a great personality but I wasn’t attracted to him. I was horny and thought sex may be enjoyable and it was clear he wanted to have sex if I was down. It was not enjoyable and I regretted not being up front about my lack of attraction cause I led him on and he was excited for a second date that I had to shut down. He was probably confused why I went that far when I wasn’t interested and I would never want someone to do the same to me. No more pity sex, it’s always a mistake.",

    "text": "Please talk about the adultification of black girls.  Me and mom were just talking about this.  I was shocked to see her take on her own lived experiences, I damn near cried.  But it made my childhood make so much sense.  My mama did not play about people touching me and I was NOT ever allowed to be around men outside of my dad.  Even then I vividly remember when I stopped getting full hugs from my dad or male family members.  Side hugs only, that I initiated or a friendly church wave PERIOD. She never made me feel like the problem but it did curve my idea of boys and men in general.  My first thought was it not that deep until my first teen sleep over.  I was hella shocked that boys were there and I had no clue what to do but I knew I was not ready at all (mind you they boys came over at 11pm) I called my mom so fast, I didn’t feel unsafe but it just didn’t feel right.  She came and got me immediately and called the other kids parents.  I was known as a rat after that but come to find out one of the “boys” was a full grown man at 20.  The oldest girl there was 16 and I was 14 🤦🏽‍♀️",

Her older sister was 17 and she invited Hella boys over. Her mom pretty much stayed in her room and never came out. I'm pretty certain her mom knew the boys were coming over. It was a small place and no one was being quiet or sneaking around. They started smoking🍃 and playing loud music in the living room. I just pretended to not feel well so I could go lay down in my friend's room. I was probably looked at as a buzz kill, but I asked my dad to come pick me up the next day even though I was supposed to stay one more night with my friend. I just wasn't cool with being around that many older boys and doing substances.",

He then only used me whatever he felt like, and each time i felt sicker and sicker but since i was still unsure of what it what it made us, i thought this was just what couples did and should leave it alone. He left me high and dry soon after though when his actual gf (of whom he told me they were no longer together) began to bully me and call me all sorts of things, even claiming i was a desperate creep.

Even conventionally attractive people should check in and see if you're on the same page as to where the night is going, because attraction doesn't necessarily mean you want to escalate to sex. Pushing it there leads to the scenario discussed in the video. Being excited for a date with someone you're attracted to only for it to sour because it escalated beyond what you were ready for happens to enough women that's it's considered normal, like the OpEd piece brought up in the video tries to defend",

But for Aziz’s situation specifically, it’s said that she offered to call her own car at first. I can only assume this means she has the option to leave the entire time. Now if Aziz was physically blocking her options to remove herself from that situation, that’s a different story. This story is hollowing and the strength to tell it is so commendable. I just wonder why no one is requesting more be done on her part to change her situation, like removing herself entirely and calling that car sooner.",

Instead, everyone was in a huge reactive hurry to say \"we can't run a legal system on this\" or \"we can't run a morality system based on this situation\", essentially because the woman says the man is clueless - because if he's clueless then how do you assign blame? But that isn't the point. The point Olurin is making is that he operated from an assumption of how women are gendered which said it's normal for her to be resisting and declining him, and discounted her efforts to resist. There is not going to be a legal system which solves this - it has to be a culturally held conversation and understanding. There has to be wisdom. Sadly, we have yet to regularly hold conversations on these incidents and see what wisdom is to be gained.",

I will not speak for Aziz because I honestly can’t and can only say for him it was obvious he wanted to have sex with her for her on the other hand staying after feeling uncomfortable, staying despite being uncomfortable after actions she thought crossed the line is difficult for me to understand. Nobody forced her to his apartment, no one made her stay, if the culture pushes men to be very aggressive when it comes to their sexual escapades, the culture can’t then fault men, if they are aggressive. Yet given the fact that women also have sexual needs and wants, the fact the onus is placed on men to be aggressive sexually is very problematic. It’s easy to say Aziz is a SAs, without consideration for his own interactions with women. When the culture only pushes women to validate successful, rich or powerful or handsome men, someone like Aziz who I am sure given is looks was probably one of the least  attractive in his social group, all of a sudden now having the success, changes what he obviously knows from experience to what he was actually dealing with. The groupie culture for successful males in the entertainment industry from some must likely socially awkward most of his life will be extremely difficult.",

In those situations, sometimes it doesn’t even take a man being threatening or even demanding for a woman to agree to sex. It could be as simple as him asking for them to have sex and she feels afraid of what could happen if she says no and agrees even if she doesn’t want to. Now I know that from the guy's perspective that could feel very frustrating and upsetting to be on the male end of. You've ostensibly done the right things but still caused a girl to be afraid of you. I’d recommend to just try to operate with a high level emotional intelligence. Pay a lot of attention to how she receives and responds to romantic or sexual advancements and try to simulate empathy and imagine what's happening from their perspective. Even more than that though, I would avoid creating situations like that before you actually know each other and have a rapport built up. Im not a woman but what I think a woman wants to make sure is that you’re not going to hurt her, and she can usually figure that out just by going out together and doing recreational things in public two or three times.",

But that doesn't mean I blame them for it, they wouldn't have been in these situations if they could have done any different, and no one should be forced to live constantly with the expectation, that their wishes are ignored either.\nBut who I REALLY do struggle to understand, are the men in these situations, that genuinely think they would never want to have sex with a none consenting woman, but at the same time pull shit like Aziz. How are they even in the mood after they realised they have gone too far, and do not feel the pressing need to clear the situation? Why do they not ask the other person what they would like to do this evening? And if sex is on the table AT ALL, for them not only this evening, that was so clearly not the right one?",

Hell, Brock whatshisfuck assaulted an unconscious woman with actual witnesses and got a slap on the wrist. \nI get what you're trying to say, but it really isn't the life ending disaster it gets portrayed as. If it were, rape culture wouldn't be so pervasive and we wouldn't have this problem to begin with.\nAnd don't get me wrong, I'm grateful that you are coming around to a new way of thinking. That's a wonderful thing. But I do think that when we come around these new ways of thinking, we also need to reflect on and critique our old way of thinking, in order to ensure that we are not still holding onto belief patterns or frameworks that could be contributing to faulty or oppressive worldviews. I genuinely hope this is coming across in the kind and educational spirit that I intend it. Again, I'm super proud of anybody who takes the time to do the work to recognize the patriarchal and oppressive structure that we all live under. Especially because it's not an easy thing to do, these are hard things to examine and to unlearn. However, if the routes are still there, other beliefs can still sprout, no matter how much pruning we do, if that makes sense? I hope this makes sense and is taken in the spirit I intend. 🙏",

So I stared at him blank and asked him „so the fact that women used to not be believed made you feel save?“ also I told him it flat hilarious to me that he as a 6,3 man told this to me, a 5,2 woman walking home alone with him. I told him „guess what I‘d be scared of if I didn’t trust you?“ And in that moment I think it clicked for him that all his life he never had to rely on trust to hope someone would not harm him cause he was always the strong guy.

They weren’t restrained  in any way or threatened with harm.\nAlso, maybe don’t go back to a guy’s place on the first date unless you’re planning to go all the way?  I’m not saying he’s entitled to do whatever he wants in this situation. Of course he’s not. You can be married for 20 years and that doesn’t mean your partner can do whatever they want. But you are making yourself EXTREMELY vulnerable in a situation with a stranger. You don’t know how this person operates behind closed doors. \n\nI will say I do lean more toward victim blaming in a lot of situations. Not necessarily when it comes to this topic but let’s say someone decides to go camping out in the middle of the woods- alone- and they wind up going missing.  Should they be allowed to go camping and return home, just fine?  Or course!  But are there many dangers in such an active?  Yes!  And are you taking enough precautions to ensure your safety if you go camping alone in the middle of the woods, with just a flashlight as your protection?  No!  \n\nSo many things can go wrong in even safe situations. Why risk it in situations that you’ve been constantly told are dicey??  You all just said you’d choose A BEAR over a man. Yet, you’re going to ASSUME a stranger/man is going to respect your consent?  Your boundaries??\n\nThe minute he tries to GAG you when you’re making out, grab your stomach and say you’re going to have diarrhea and GTFO of there!",

The idea of a 14 year old consenting to activities with a 26 year old is bonkers, and only 20-some years later is that a conversation I've started to have, but I know lots of folks who have similar experiences. It's borderline How Quer Men Become Kevin Spacey.\nAnyway, I hope this wasn't too off topic, but I loved how thought provoking and accessible you made some very challenging topics.

My mama was in undergrad living her life as an honors student and a campus socialite. \n\nShe had one man walk up on her and corner her because he wanted to date her and she rejected him. Luckily in that situation she was able to fight him off. People were there but did not say anything and just laughed at the guy that he was “beat up by a girl.”\n\nAnother time, her and her friends all went to a hangout spot (after a party) where she ended up alone in a room with the man who raped her. She was screaming and crying all the while her “friends” were in the other room and could hear what happened. When she busted out of the room frantic they convinced her not to report him because they didn’t want her to “ruin a Black man’s future.” \n\nWe do not take rape serious and when the accused is someone we know we take it personal instead of defending the victim. It causes too much harm and stress on the victims. My mom is in her 50s and still has self image issues because of what happened and how she was treated in these situations. \n\nAnd the sad part is I can pretty much say the same thing for my best friend and my partner who have experienced sexual assaults as children.",

But the point is they want a male partner who initiates sex when the want it without having to ask, but who never initiates sex when they don't. They're asking for mind reading. \n\nNah, this is on women who need to work through their hangups before having sex. It comes from being incredibly risk-averse, conflict-averse, and responsibility-averse. They're looking for a daddy to take responsibility, not a partner, and I'm not interested in that. The reason they find asking for consent to be a turnoff is because by giving it they're taking responsibility for their half of the sex act, if it's unsatisfying for any of the parties involved, if things are awkward, or whatever. Much better to just blast the guy on social media and blame him if the sex is awkward rather than to take responsibility.",

It really made me reflect on times where i've been on the other side of that, not really aware of how the other person may have been feeling, and since then, i've been trying to pay more attention and make sure whoever i'm with really does consent to what we're doing",

    "text": "20-something year old cis male here. My mom told me of an experience she had when her uncle acted toward her in a physically inappropriate way. They were at the dinner table with everyone in the immediate family there and totally aware of what had just happened. No one did anything. I had a girlfriend in high school who broke into tears as we were walking up the stairs to our first class, sobbing that she had been raped. I think at least 2 or 3 other girls i have dated or spoken to have confided in me that they have gone through some form of assault or abuse. It was shocking as a teenager and its horribly, frustratingly, disappointingly mundane now. Neil Gaiman was someone i respected and enjoyed quite a bit, and when the allegations came out, i barely reacted. Its just so normal. This stuff is immensely widespread and one of my greatest fears is that I may, even unintentionally, make a woman feel this way in my lifetime. Support the women and girls in your life. Much love, stay safe. Thanks for this video, Olurinatti!",

Use the FRIES model for consent(freely given, reversible, informed, enthusiastic, sober) and always encourage the women in your life to NEVER put their comfort, dignity or safety at risk for the sake of appearing polite, being liked, or obtaining the approval of others, because we are conditioned from birth to do those things, and not only do they dehumanize us, they reinforce rape culture. We need men helping us by validating us when we exercise and enforce our right to that dignity, safety and comfort and to choose ourselves rather than others. We don't need your permission, but we do need your support; we need you to call on other men to do the same, and to call them out when you see them demanding women make those sacrifices for their ego, convenience or pleasure. Every time. No matter what.\nThank you for doing your best to be a good man. Truly.",

        "text": "@olurinatti This is a really excellent Video, and you should be Proud of yourself. \nI subed. Legit surprised how truly excellent, non dogmartic this was, how you avoided any Buzzwords, and when you did,  you took time time to keep it from being a buzzword and explained clearly ( rape culture ) \n\nFeminism starts with womens rights, moves to rational philosophy, proposes a reform, creates a rally slogan or policy based on it ( ALL the best things !! ) ;\nThen adopting the policy or slogan, refuses to look at contrary evidence or negative side effects ( of adopting the slogan or policy, or reform ) or how that reform is problematic by following it to the letter. and then stigmatizes people for being outcome based, and . What was once a tactic of reform, becomes an identity. \n\nAnd nowhere in this problematic process worse than In managing  rape culture.  \n\nFor example For decades people were taught \"No means No\" yet in Aziz case  we can see a giant gap. \nWhen Men take \"No means No\" literally minded it allows The Bill Cosbys of the world to think someone who Cant say no is fuckbale\n\nThe current way femisnism has been trying to teach sexual consent has Horrifically evil Loopholes. \n\nMost people Do NOT practice \"yes equals Yes\" ( they practice assent with small yeseS, mostly nonverbal. )\n\nThe dominant Feminism paradigm a few years ago was an extreme REIterative  explicit verbal Consent script of every single act. Its a foolish simple simons guide to getting consent: The problem is when carried out by an Aziz Asiri , its deeply coercive. Instead of quroum taking its psychologically manipulative. Getting people to say \"yes\" over and over and over again on small things is  a used car sales technique! Its a studied psychological phenomena. \n\nwhich isnt to say that each sex act shouldnt have consent . explict verba; on;y It marginalizes taking body language . \nUnfortunately some people have TROUBLE saying No! ( IMHO body language should be a VETO, no matter WHAT someone says.  ) \n\nNotice in this example how she Never says \"No\" ! Notice Aziz framing questions of different types of \"Yes\" . This is how you manipulate people  ...into buying Timeshares and Buying Lemon cars. \n\nI was also unable to tell from her story  if her alcohol level made her unable to fully verbalize a No. \n\n( IN my experience people NEED to be able to say no, and they need to be able to say Yes. But either bodylanguage only, ( enthusiastic nonverbal assent  ) or verbal explicit yes isnt enough. \n\nAnoher  Problematic ( fucked up )  Slogan is that \"Rape is always intended Violence\"  and \"Rape was never intended sex\". even though the word \"sexual assault\" exists \nie sex by definition cant be violent  : While many violent rapists . \nThis slogan is actively harmfully and trains men to rape,  while thinking its not. It confuses a tactic ( violence) with intention or outcomes. \n\n AFAIK this slogan exists only for identity forming ,  ( not stopping rape) creating an Us-vs Them mentality, But its why Men like Aziz can look themselves in the mirror and think they are good feminists. \n\nPlus its wrong about Rape and sex. Both rape and sex may contains elements of dominance  and power; and power without full consent may advance to rape even when no violence is used or intended. \n\nThis is literally how Bill Cosbys think. Or aziz. Its why Rapists can think its ok to have sex with unconscious people\n\nDid Aziz Intend violence ? maybe. Or maybe hes a selfish skeevish douchbag of the first order. We should NEVER ever teach people their good intentions pre excuse harmful acts . Worse it appears to be born of a black and white thinking,  a   retroactive Dogma that results prove intentions. ( as if people cant jjst be cruelly selfish, despite overwheling evidence its a primary human failing.) \n\n Men ( and women) HEAR the identity formation, decide they are a good person, or a Nice Guy and therefore they exculpify themselves for being a selfish passive coercive POS,  if it stops before physical violence. Male Feminists can excuse themselves the same way that Chritians can excuse themselves for hating the poor or voting for rapists . Its the Tyranny of THoughts and Prayers over actions, or My identity makes me rights\n\n\nOn the whole of tou are doing a series on this, this is a great beggining, esp to cover gray areas, and nondogmatically confront how people have sex ( or dont) and reforms that meet people where they are at.",

About half of the women Ive had sex with actually had negative responses to me asking explicitly about consent, preferences, etc even after having mentioned that beforehand. It seemed like they either were not interested/comfortable considering what they wanted, lost some degree of interest from considering/analyzing the situation (seemingly something they weren’t used to doing in that context, and annoyed to have to consider it), or enjoyed resisting (something that should be communicated beforehand imo, but something Ive never heard communicated until frustration arises from my apprehension).\n\nImo, easiest solution (although definitely easier said) is to have women at least as comfortable with approaching men as vice versa. Preferences based on past experiences is fine, communication is great, Im much happier to be relaxed and understand what others expect/prefer and what they want to avoid, but time and time again I seem to see interest wane when I try to under this. \n\nI think men need to be more restrained and understanding, women need to learn to communicate better, and both sides contribute to the issues we face as a society",

Unless you are a rock star it’s hard to have perfectly legally defined consent before every encounter. I think a huge part of it is if you feel like you are being used as opposed to having power in the situation. On the one hand being overly aggressive based on how  you read the situation can make a person feel like you are imposing but if you just say “wassup with some copulation” it can also make it seem more transactional as well. Don’t get me started on consent within a relationship because as a partner you can’t only do what you want when you feel like it but you don’t wanna just go along with it if you are disinterested I guess. It may just be a matter of both parties feeling heard so that people don’t walk away feeling they were a door to some desire and not a person.",

The song's about a guy in public and around his friends making it seem like he's not into her or interested, but having a different story later, and her letting him know if he's doesn't step up she won't wait around anymore. Anyone can take lyrics out of context like you did, so here's some of the context you ignored for some reason.\n\nIf you wanna be with me\nYou gotta keep it real\nTell me what's goin' on\nTell me how you feel\nBoy I know you want me just as much as I want you\nSo come and get my love\nIt's all here for you\n\nIf you keep actin' this way\nYou're gonna lose my love\nI ain't got no time to play, better hurry up\n'Cause every time I come around and crews run around your way\nI see you on the corner\nBut you don't know what to say\n\nEverytime I see you with your boys\nYou pretend as if you don't want me\nWhen you get home you call me on the phone\nAnd tell me how much you care\n\n\nAll the girls were between 15-17 years old when that song came out, so I doubt their parents (especially since Beyonce's protective dad was their manager at the time) would allow them to be singing about coercing a guy into sleeping with them, especially when most of their discography back then was about relationships and love not really sex...because, you know, they were young teenage girls.",

That has nothing to do with supporting anything. You said the song was about coercion or grape, and took lyrics out of context to prove that. I don't have to support an \"industry\" to point that out, just have some common sense and media literacy. Again, you were just wrong, there's no need to get up in arms about being incorrect unless you had ulterior motives for spreading misinformation so boldly. Idk how you gathered from that that I do or don't support anything...but I suppose we are living in the age of blatant misinformation, poor media literacy, anti-intellectualism, and feelings over clear facts. Maybe step back and evaluate yourself instead of making baseless assumptions about complete strangers for acknowledging (the same way you did, by posting lyrics) that you were at best wrong/ignorant, and at worse being brazenly disingenuous, and trying to paint a 1998 song from a young teenage girl group as something it obviously isn't. Whether you support the industry or not doesn't change that you took lyrics out of context. So, that's not an indictment of the industry, Blurred Lines by Robin Thicke would have been the example you're looking for.",

I got sloppy drunk for the first time and someone that had been a friend for years found his chance to get what he wanted.

    "text": "I've worked with SA/DV survivors for a decent amount of time now and one of the more heartbreaking thoughts I see come out of MOST survivors is that they \"don't feel like it was 'bad' enough\", like we compare what happened to us so much to things that we were told and shown as sexual violence through media and peers that if a survivor didn't literally get kidnapped and held at gunpoint then their experience isn't valid (even then, had one survivor that was a victim of a serial rapist/murderer and still refused to fully believe that she wasn't in some way *responsible* for what happened to her.). \n\nThe most insidious thing I've learned from my own experiences and being in this field is that there's a trust that is always broken between a survivor and society because we trust, generally speaking, the people around us to NOT sexually abuse us. This sense of trust in society makes survivors feel shame and blame because we are always going over details of what might've happened if we changed this detail or that detail or this phrase or this piece of clothing etc. And I think perpetrators are unfortunately taught that sense of trust too, and, whether we like it or not, oftentimes DONT BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE HURTING SOMEONE. \n\nI think this is one of the things we need to start addressing in SA/DV spheres - that of perpetrators and perhaps not always condemning people immediately based on their actions IF they are willing to take responsibility and learn from their mistakes. I know it's controversial but there is starting to be discussions around it and I highly recommend reading further. Some personal recommendations are:\n\nUnclenching Our Fists: Abusive Men on the Journey to Nonviolence by Sara Acker\nThings We Didn't Talk About When I Was a Girl by Jeannie Vanasco\nKnow My Name by Chanel Miller (the Brock Turner case) \nNo Visible Bruises by Rachel Louise Snyder\n\nBy no means a comprehensive list as I've been taking a break from the field for mental health reasons but I truly appreciate someone using a platform like this to talk about the harder conversations regarding sexual assault.",

When it is the other way around and you‘re active and you find a man who doesn’t feel threatened by you showing him what you want, the sex tends to be a lot better since you’re on the same page. \nSexual shame is responsible for so many harmful ideas and rituals we still engage in.",

I didn't sleep around as much, but I do remember seeing a woman for a few months, and we dated for quite a while before we slept together. She had been assaulted when she was a teenager, and even though we were in our early 30s I think maybe that just never truly leaves you. I asked her a few times if she was okay, and before we even started doing anything I told her we could stop anytime, and that she was safe. Maybe it was my age, but it wasn't hard to ask her if she was okay still, or if she was okay with what I was doing. Pushing someone into sex, and willfully ignoring their very obvious signals that they aren't into it is pretty disgusting, and ignoring someone saying no is just not okay. My dad didn't teach me any of that, he didn't really teach me anything about sex due to how conservative he is. It's just common sense.",

And, we all know men can get even get violent when they don't get their way; I think that also factors into our compliance. I'm sure there's a not a boy so insignificant percentage of women who comply just for it to be off-topic but then hate themselves for betraying their agency, forgetting to give themselves grace for doing something they thought would keep them safe.

He goes away, then she complains that she wanted him & only said \"no\" because she wanted him to try harder, or pursue her, even though \"trying harder\" can literally make you look desperate, like a creep or a (sexual) assaulter. \"No\" means \"no\". Period!\n\n\nIf you have to \"comply\" to have sex with someone, then having a sexual relationship with the person becomes difficult. This is why people are asked to marry those they're sexually attracted to & comfortable with & should also discuss the frequency of intimacy in their relationships. Of course, both your bodies' won't be in sync, but you can let your spouse seduce you & turn you on. Many people start off not being in the mood (even men, especially when they're tired after work), but will eventually come around when their partner touches their erogenous zones - obviously with their consent.\n\nRelationships are like that, sometimes you say \"yes\" & see if you'll enjoy it (your partner better makes sure you do, for his sake!), even with kids - how many times have you come back home tired & your little kids want some of your time, even going as far as asking you to play video games with them by 10pm on weekends 😂",

Because her conviction that she wasn't assaulted was stronger than her belief in this authority figure's authoritative information? \n\nIf she had felt assaulted previously,.she would have already known it and done something about it. Even if she was afraid to report or something, she wouldn't have reacted in this specific way. She would have tearfully confessed in private or public that she was assaulted and ask for help. If she was in denial, it would have been the denial of a deliberately delusional victim trying to protect themselves by denying that the events ever happened. Not the \"denial\" of someone chafing against the ridiculously impossible standards of an RA that condemn as iredeemable a man she knows to be good because she knows such a stringent definition goes against all normal human interaction.\n\nIn the extremely rare event that a woman was so sheltered that she actively denied actual rape was rape- well she'd never have been allowed to attend college in the first place, now would she?",

It absolutely floored me at the time by forcing me to confront the ambiguous intimacy culture that is the norm. I remember spending time reflecting on past encounters recognizing the similarities and how to fix it. It hasn't been perfect and I've been on both sides of this now, but I'm still trying to be better.\n\nThe experience that stands out the most to me now wasn't that period of horror or a guilt of past encounters. What I always remember is a discussion with family--cousins my own age--where we ventured into talking about SA and the then nascent me too movement. I recall bringing up this account about how Aziz's behavior kind of shocked me and was informative about the overall culture, how there was something fundamentally broken. I'll never forget what followed because one of my cousins outright dismissed the encounter and said something to the effect of, \"that doesn't count. it wasn't SA.\" Everyone else agreed with them and I felt stupid, that I didn't actually understand anything about it. Overall, it made me feel that I was just wrong. I doubted my own experiences and feelings.\n\nI'm a bit older now where I can understand I was handling it with the proper care and compassion required. Even still, it took this video to so clearly make sense of what I was trying to grasp back then. Thank you again for this video and all the other work you do.",

It was assault, but one form that was tied to negligence and poor understanding of consent.\n\nBut now it's clear to me that she had done more than enough to explicitly communicate her DISINTEREST ! I don't see any grey area now, just a detailed and clear account of assault.

For people not aware, the US army has had a rampant issue with sexual assault amongst personnel for a long time, even when I was enlisted (2011-2018). Back then the Uniform Code of Military Justice outlined (and this could have changed since I was there at this point) that if someone even drank a single bottle/can of alcohol, legally, they could not consent to ANY sexual activity. \n\nNow for a young 20 something black man who didn't drink alcohol himself, that felt like no issue...until you realized how many soldiers casually or socially drink when off the clock. I got caught with a situation where an associate from my unit and I were flirting with two girls but the one I spoke to had very clearly been drinking and that was a turn off for me so I politely exited the interaction to go and dance, only for the next day to come and I get accused of graping said woman. An investigation was conducted and thankfully the club we were at had cameras showing I was nowhere near the woman when she and her friend and my associate left the club well before I did. The incident scared me so much that too this day, I will not engage with any woman sexually if she's been drinking and doesn't give me enthusiastic verbal consent. IDC how unsexy that might be, I'm not risking prison time because someone wants to play coy or get drunk.",

You laid out so beautifully how we've been socialized to fall into these stereotypical roles of conqueror and conquest. When you were reading the account, I thought back to all of the movies from the 50's- 80's especially that treat conflict and resistance between men and women as attraction and how we were brainwashed into believing that violence and abusive language is a part of physical attraction \"if he pulls your pig tails, he likes you\"   I'll definitely rewatch because you laid out so much of the nuance in our relationships. I'm sure we all saw ourselves in this. ❤",

I think that  telling young women to sheild their body and beauty from the everyone that isnt their husband gives off the idea that a woman's beauty belongs to her husband...what about a woman owning her own beauty?",

The prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for decision-making, doesn’t fully develop until around 25, according to my recollection. Especially at a young age, knowing how boys and young men can be towards women, it’s understandable that he might have acted in a way that was not ideal.  When my sister decided to wear the hijab in her 30’s, one thing she noticed was the immediate respect from other men that came from it. I don’t know what he did wrong or how it affected you, but I want you to know that to ask God cause He is always there for you and cares about your well-being. I pray for your safety and for God to bless you with strength and wisdom. \n\nAs for the gentleman above, it’s important to remember that beauty is not solely the property of the husband. It belongs to both of you, and you’ve chosen to share it with him. He has taken an Islamic oath to lower his gaze and seek your beauty and nurture it. I hope you stay strong and focused on your path, and don’t let anything discourage you. Keep walking on the straight path, siratal mustaqeem, my dear sister. <3",

I would’ve loved if he asked me first, however I didn’t resist because i wanted the kiss (it wasn’t good). If i didn’t want that kiss, then that night would’ve gone on my list of times i was assaulted by my peers. And what makes it worse is that he acted on the guidance of my best girl friends. I was more upset at my friends than the guy i was dating for shoving his tongue down my mouth. It’s sad to think these practices are so ingrained as normal in society that coercion and full on sexual assault is being given as advice.",

And I was right because that's what they said about Grace.\n\nI remember watching my own hand being moved by his to his penis as attempted to get me to jerk him off, but I was too far gone that each time he would let go it would just shrivel back to my body automatically like a bug. I was not in control of my body at that point. I was watching it happen from somewhere else. When Grace describes how Aziz would move her hand to his penis, I remember what that was like.\n\nI tried to stay away from posts about the situation but when I would get into it with people and say that the same thing happened to me at 13 they would say \"that's different, kids can't consent.\" Then when I told them that my perpetrator was only a year older than me, they wouldn't know what to say.",
