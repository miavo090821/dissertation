yeah you can have folks run for office you can have folks be in office but then it's hard because then you have Democratic black Mayors who are making them same folks their enemies I really genuinely believe that the image that Bill Cosby exported to this country as this kind of pathway into the Black Elite she keeps her position she keeps her principles but yet she also has a job it is your job as a city council person to meet with people that you do not like and to me for people who consider themselves radical or Progressive and stop maybe stop talking about people like a politician just does this of their own Val we're always looking for someone to crucify we're looking for a martyr and it's like we don't need Martyrs right now we need leaders y'all [Applause] like Hello beautiful black people I have gathered you all here because hi to me no one ever tells me hi I love it I've gathered yall all here because I've been I've talked to all of you individually either about like some black politician or the state of black politics or like something that is happening like something negative or anti-black that is happening under the watchful eye of some black politician um and like how our communities like feel and received them so I don't have a specific topic I have more of like I want to hear all y'all's thoughts like a town hall and a discourse because I think so much of what we're all like talking about and like working with in our different like areas overlap so yeah I think like I don't even know where to begin Leah has so many Leah's doing like amazing work on like housing and like all the knowledge and how Eric Adams is doing numbers to that like Devon is very involved in what's happening in stop cop City like cherai exper and all the things happening in New York City Nini and Garrison know everything um so I whoever who wants to go I Choose You Leah uh you know I think for me it's interesting seeing all everything with Eric Adams play out because I grew up I was born and raised in Brooklyn uh where you know he came to rise did he Trump is also from New York we don't claim you know a lot of these folks but at the same time it's different because it's interesting because they're all having this Reckoning all at the same time uh and for me Eric Adams followed mayor dinkin who was the first black mayor very closely and uh he's a different type of Mayor and I think that he this is my personal opinion I think that he modeled his mayorship um very much like Cuomo and and the the junior Cuomo and sort of saw how the previous mayor deasio um was treated by cops and also to some degree the press and sort of took on this whole like I'm G to be this Law and Order like I don't I don't give a [ __ ] about the Press um tough you know tough guy this New York quintessential politician and I think that when he was running some a lot of people likeed that obviously was elected but a lot of black folks also liked it one of the things I think has really taken me by surprise I've been a tenance rights attorney is I used to do a lot of my previous work in public housing and nit development and I would constantly have um those tenants say we need La you know we we need more cops we need you know people we need to be able to like go in the elevator and be safe like so you it's you know people wonder how did Eric Adams get elected there a lot of folks who who who believe that just putting a black face onto the system is what it is like Liberation is not challenging the status quo Liberation is not disrupting it it's simply that we have equality we get to have the same thing and um that's I think that's a big chunk of it do you think that's changing at all like CH what do you think I mean I mean I yeah well I just got to say it's it's fascinating to watch this spectacle play out with an Administration that is essentially a lot of folks who are black and brown right I mean even the police commissioner who's not not really an elected position but is a brown person and and so it's kind of facing folks to Grapple with that reality like I don't care what color these folks skin is you know we got to look at the impact that they're having on on you know on on black on the masses of people one thing I would say about about I want I'm really eager to get into and hear from some of the folks who got so much experience in this area including you know like Deon who's who's in the struggle right now you know but we often talk about black elected politicians as like in terms of whether they're a sellout as individuals right whether we're talking about at the federal level with kamla but what's interesting to me is I understand why we do that because we want to think about accountability and because they wield their Humanity against us like they come to us like like individuals oh I'm a human you know what I mean I'm a human who has Glock you know whatever whatever they do but but at the same but I actually think that harms our analysis because the these people are in incentive structures right so the things that I think kamla is doing or any or especially at the local level right the people are doing is not just like their own their own personality it's that they're trying to navigate a set of incentives and to me for people who consider themselves radical or Progressive we should be looking at those structures and what do we need to do to influence those structures and not and stop maybe stop talking about people like a politician just does this of their own Val and this individual does that make any sense what I'm saying yeah uh coming from a city that has had a history of black Mayors um going back to Mayor Jackson we've had black Mayors um longer than I've been alive we've had black Mayors at least since the 60s and 70s in Atlanta um and you know one of the things that I talk about uh you know as I'm connecting with black voters is you know what has that delivered for us right and is that indicative of one black mayor or series of black Mayors or is it indicative of the system in which they operate within right um yes they are the mayor of the capitol city in the state of Georgia but we also know that Georgia politics and Atlanta politics are different but they stay remain intertwined and many of the people who are selected to be mayor who are uh you know kind of propped up as these are the folks that um you know you should be supporting are people that you know the corporate Community have said okay you know we're okay with them um people that you know high up in law enforcement organizations have said okay we're okay with them um and so we haven't really gotten a full roster of what black leadership could look like without the hands of white supremacy and corporate interests really picking the black folks that we are allowed to support um and I think that speaks to that system piece that you brought up earlier about what is the system in which that we are operating within and a lot of times we are focused on you know trying particularly as progressives trying to elect um you know Progressive black folks Progressive elected officials to public office and then we are deeply disappointed when they get there because we recognize that they are going inside of a system that in some ways is set up for them to fail from the jump as a progressive um we've seen this happened with progressives who have gotten elected and we were not happy with necessarily what they were able to accomplish I think aocc is an example of that right where people had all of these expectations around Al um and some of them were legitimate but also you know I was also looking at folks like do you really have realistic expectations around what this one woman is going to be able to achieve in Congress an institution that has historically been um racist an institution that has historically been ineffective um and that has been a rubber stamp for Wall Street what did we really think that one Squad of you know Progressive women of color we going to be able to accomplish and so I think that we have to have realistic expectations for the progressives that we do send to public office um while also still you know holding folks accountable to what they said that they were going to do and help them shape a realistic agenda right like don't sell us this you know that you're going to be get in there and you're going to be the pathway to Liberation you are not um however you might be able to do a lot of harm reduction to ensure that the system um that you are elected to is not harming the communities um as much as it would be if you were not there the stokeley carmichel talked about how we have to send people to these systems diametrically opposed to it and a part of that you know being diametrically opposed is a recognition and an acknowledgement of what the system is that you are being elected to serve in um and leveling people's expectations around what's going to be able to be accomplished as opposed to what's not I I I want to jump in here because I want to take seriously what Leah says when she says like we're talking to to to black folks who are like for cops like we want the police in the elevator we want the police to be on the streets because that's a very very real thing the reason why we've seen like 80 or so cop cities pop up across the country um especially in Black cities like Atlanta and Baltimore and we see that I live in now nville Tennessee we have a progressive mayor and a black police chief and and we have a facility that's coming here and a lot of that is because the folks on the ground if we're being honest are in support of these things it feels a bit counterintuitive because we all know the progressive voices and and the more kind of like radical voices that are against it but when I talk to my grandmother she's like yeah we need cops and I'm like okay okay then don't don't tell everybody don't when they call you and ask you that don't doesn't say that on the phone right and a lot of it is because I think they in many ways we haven't learned the lessons that that these kinds of like these kinds of initiatives these kind of procop more funding for police like we haven't learned the lessons that are are really right right there for us to learn and so I I salute you know even if they're being discredited I think the black lives matter movement for example really raised people's Consciousness around this idea that police don't necessarily prevent crime but they do kind of like maybe help solve crime at times or whatever the case may be but there are limitations here and we can have a cleare ey conversation about those limitations but the problem I think is that the generation of folks who are in leadership right now I think about May Adams and London uh breed and I think about the mayor Philly and Muriel Bowser in DC Andre Di atanta Andre Dickens in Atlanta they're all born in like the same like 10year gap or so right like they're all very specific latch key kid kind of generation with a very specific post- Civil Right Pol post civil rights politic that says like we need to Stamp Out The Bad actors in our community with harsher sentencing and more you know more investment in the carceral state and so I think it's important for us like to have these kind of cleare eye conversations I agree Devin that like we don't know what our communities look like unmolested by white supremacy and I think that's true I think that's very very true at the same time I'm not sure if we're doing the necessary education to help folks see that there's a Better Way Forward that's what I was going to talk about oh Deon you go just really quickly yeah I think you know having been a part of the movement for black lives um an organizer on abolitionist inspired campaigns one of the things that I tell a lot of the folks that when we're doing strategy work around how we are going to convince people to sign these petitions like we did a mass 116,000 signatures for the Stop cop City effort right to put it on the ballot so that people could voice their opinion and say we actually don't want to support this and many of the people who did sign the petition signature were white progresses there were some black folks that signed it as well there was a good amount of black folks this Atlanta right but many of the people who have been some of the most vocal have been white progressives who live in Atlanta many of them who would even be considered gentrifiers right um some of them have self-identify as that right but I think one of the things that is a challenge when we're talking to black folks is that we don't recognize that most black people are not at abolition right most black people are not there and so we are often times coming to people with these very radical concepts that we haven't done the political education that is necessary to really get that level of support and so I think we have to meet people where they are one of the things that I've talked about is um I have coined this term kind of like practical abolition right people got to see what are those Alternative forms of Public Safety and see that they're working right before you say oh we're going to get rid of this thing because also I think we teach abolition wrong abolition is not about the dismantling of something it's the dismantling of something and the building of something new and so I think we often times forget about what's the new piece and one of the challenges and and and things that I encourage folks in the stop cop City movement was we need to if we saying no to this we can't just be like the Republicans and say no we have to also say but what are we yes what is our yes for what are we for and so if we are for training that is centered in deescalation or Mental Health crisis response or conflict resolution then we need to be modeling and developing a center that people can see an alternative vision for what our Public Safety approach is but oftentimes we have been stuck at just we don't want this as opposed to what we do want instead and so I think um one of the programs that we have in Atlanta is called policing Alternatives diversion initiative um which people can call 311 in a case worker shows up as opposed to a police officer and so that's one of the ways that we have been able to show that there are practical ways that we can reimagine the system of Public Safety that doesn't solely rely on police prisons and jails as our main means of keeping people safe so what I think oh I'm sorry no le you go you go I was gonna piggyback off of what you were saying Devin and saying it's also even more nefarious than people don't know it's also that a lot of black establishment Dems have specifically cultivated their platform and their identity as anti-black progressives antiblack leftists so Eric Adams done that okay Parker said his real enemy was the D Democratic social par you know Mega right I I've heard more from Hocking Jeff about AOC and leftist than actual Eric Adams right and so oh yeah you know even even locally I don't even think people know that locally in New York City when tenant protections when you know you had black socialists and PC socialists who were proposing things like good cause eviction which is a tenant protection law you know in in a nutshell it's even if you don't live in rent stabilized housing if you live in private unregulated housing your landlord has to have a reason to evict you it can't just be your leases up and some other protections you know you had some black establishment Dems who were like no this is the reason why we can't have these folks in office this is and they framed it as this and in including when Eric Adams ran for office um they frame this as a threat to Black Power specifically what about black landlords what about if you want to own your home and you rent it out these people are proposing things that are like Lally destructive to the black community this is how it is framed so I think you know it we have to acknowledge that there is education but also the political class that we have right now are specifically part of demonizing these policies they're playing a role it reminds me a lot of like you know when you say to someone oh you you're going to have your first black CEO and black people first wants to be like oh Lord you know because are they going to be firing black people once they get it you know like why did they get that position you know are you here to play that role you're not here to actually fight white supremacy you're not here to fight the system you're here to put me in check that's what you're here to do and I think black CEO first black president first black women president I mean that's that's some of the conversation that's being had around uh VP Harris and I mean that's the real and that's really the reason like Atlanta I think is like the perfect example of it I think it's like examplified in Atlanta um of the fact that you have like this all essentially all black Administration and you regularly have that and you also have like the first cops City and you have all these like Draconian things or what what was it like the red dogs and it's because it's this idea that like okay if we have all these black people and we allow these like these black people are Empower it's because they're there to convince like the white people the powers that be and whatever that they're going to control them and we're going to keep these black people in check you know what I mean like and so we're going to we're going to police them even harder right and and y'all are all speaking of something I've been Reckoning with a lot this year like just that and and and not just just this year like specifically in terms of like the black community this year but like in general I've known for years that people don't agree with us like you know and I think that's something that's really forgotten in our online spaces and especially how the world has become more virtual and we commun and we like I really feel like my audience even like my audiences like when you speak about things I'm like I really feel like we've forgotten that people don't agree with us like sometimes like I'll see us like demanding like as a community like demanding a politician who we know does things in service of us but we want them to say all the leftist things and and save their an abolitionist and save their I'm like do you not want them to be in power I'm like so aage like keep telling ourselves like we keep like and I see especially in election season like this myth that everybody is elst Progressive waiting to get that candidate and it's like that's not true maybe everybody could be atist Progressive if they were educated and knew better yeah like I I could to subscribe to that world but in this world they have been indoctrinated to believe very much so in the system and I'm like are we are we having conversations with a lot like a lot of black people like you know what I mean in real life not just are like you know our political corner but in actuality and something that I found to to what Leah was talking about and like the commitment to like the black power structure the reason they're a like that we that is such a powerful thing that black people are invested in like what I experienced with like even like after my Breakfast Club interview with Eric Adams or even after his indictment is people being like and po people being like well all the uh the white Mayors and the white politicians can do this or whatever and they're only going after our black politicians and D like like we truly and I like we truly so many of us really believe in the idea that we should be able in order like it like it in order we should be able to be powerful and be abusive and be corrupt and be all these things because white people can like that's what equality is so what Leo was saying like not to dismantle the structures but be able to take like an equal role in that even if that equal role is to hurt black people like themselves you know what I mean like I'm often like often times when I see a lot of like the black people that are arguing with me in favor of Eric Adams and this and I'm like you are the most like you are the target you know what I mean I'm looking and I'm just like you know so I think that's something that we we we really have to reckon with like with that which is why I like Focus my energy on education because I believe like I agree with y'all in like resounding like I believe the political education is the most important part because the reality is if we get the we can get all the policies we could we could do all of that but if the public won't support them you know what I mean like the politicians will never do that and so yeah and so I and I just you know like by the way if you a really good sort of film representation of this is this film called the body politic about Brandon Scott in uh Baltimore I encourage everybody to watch it because you literally see this man and trying to kind of Usher forth the best he can do in terms of like not quite abolitionist but you know a public safety program you see everybody attack him from the racist white Governor to the black community right it's not happening fast enough and you see the and I it just dramatizes the struggle in a way that I think makes it real what you're saying also we were talking about Charelle Parker you know I remember when Darnell Clark a black city council member who I'm going to name his name went out and actually said I'm going to bring back stoping Frisk and I remember being like what are you serious this is a policy that was debunked has had so much harm and you're using like that specific language like he didn't even say we gonna check Brothers to see if they got guns he said stop langis and I remember calling a friend of mine who also works in Phillies government and saying brother what is going on and he said yo man there's actually some support for this in the Comm he's saying that knowing that he has so I think that that's really important and by the way one other thing want to bring up is that um we're talking about Eric Adams you know John toel who was a former ccrb investigator made a really interesting point he said part of the reason why both a group of black folks uh you know kind of like black management class whatever you want to call them and white like white liberals supported Eric Adams and overlooked all the telltale signs that you can see uh in Ole's incredible documentary on Eric Adams I mean you watch that documentary right the question that you have to ask is how did anybody ever so get on board with this person right it's such a all the flags I mean it's not even red flags we need something bger than Flags like the reason why they said the reason why they said the reason why they said they that he said that they supported him is because he allowed them to distance themselves from black lives matter right and I think that that's a I was like wow that's a really interesting uh point so and I just want to end by I just want to end this little piece by saying that a lot of black people in my world I don't want to do the thing where we paint black folks as a monolith and all that ain't nobody doing that but a lot of black folks in my world their only model of economic empowerment that they think about is entrepreneurial business kind of stuff so we have work to do when you're trying to make the case to to folks you know what I'm saying it's like they understand that and I think that's actually work that we have to do as you all are saying to kind of like say like yo we got to recognize that folks are facing you know the black politician who wants to push something forward is facing a struggle you know but I think the other thing too is that I mean as somebody who's who has lived now in who lives now in Philly from New York and it lived in Atlanta I've gotten to experience all different types of uh um uh black Executives and how leadership is position but like a big part of it is that black workingclass people are not recruited to run for office you know and my vantage point from act right like we're like you go to the pipeline of you go to and this is no offense to no HBC or NC I didn't go to college so um but like you either go from like the Howard pipeline or you go from the Divine n pipeline or you go from some sort of pipeline that has instit like there is institutional wealth in some way right there's institutional resources in some way and so I think that that's a big problem too like the the fact that I think we are and and I'm saying on an executive level not so much there are there are working class folks who have been elected to city council and I mean in you know in Philadelphia we are you know Working Families party is the minor part party now and we have Kendra Brooks who's from North Philly who was a parent advocate you know we have Nicholas oor who's from Indiana originally who's a PL a pastor right so we've been doing that work and it is like part of what Kendra would say is like she was alone she felt alone not just because of race Dynamics but literally like just like socio economic Dynamic so I do think that part of the when we think about all of these folks they either they either have been in the elite system for a while in some sort of way or another whether it's their social relationships or their or or their college their pedigree whatever um or they were on that pathway and so I think that that's a really big problem when we we can't also expect folks who forgot what it is to be working class to remember and represent the black working class and to also sit down and listen to people and so I think that that's one thing I obviously agree with with like all of the like we can't also expect you know black folk we ain't a monolith um I think in like in a different context like in the Caribbean context like I um as like I'm half West Indian and like our like my family it is a lot about Community Care like it's not necessarily about entrepreneurialship because like coming from immigrant families like my dad was like I ain't never gonna be an entrepreneur so he worked at Seaman for years but he made sure that like his his people were okay he had it he has his groups that he's always talked to and the ballian community here and so but what I do think is just like you know in the in Black Caribbean Community especially in New York they're just kind of like nobody's going to listen to us like why like at least in like you know when I speak to like my aunties and stuff like that they're like yeah these like you can't stand Eric Adams just because of how he just because of how he presents himself it doesn't even have to do with his policies and his issues he just presents himself like that mother and so excuse my language you're like you know that person and so they'd be like n no we don't like him we don't like him they're not even looking at his policies but anyway I say that I'll I say is that I feel yeah I feel like we got to do a real job on like working like actually recruiting workingclass people to feel like they can contest for power and we got to have their back and understand that when they say something like to me I don't care if somebody says you know um I want to pass the coffee act and that actually means they're going to regist wealth into our communities like we're too we're too obsessed with the hashtag culture we're too obsessed if we say something that nobody can say anything other than that even though we got to speak to what in New York you got to speak to eight million people in Philly you got to speak to six million like you know like it is we're too obsessed with this like you can only say this hashtag on the internet yeah and nothing else and that's like a big problem too to expect that from Black Black electives it's it's um do we create the political environment for black progressives to be successful that part um I and I would argue that we we have not fully done that as the left at the prog progressives we have not fully done that I think um I look at the Dynamics of my race and you are you are singing my song right now I have two folks who are you know they've come through the divine nine one was in class with with uh VP Harris at Howard um another one had G went to Spellman and it's no disrespect to those institutions right but like that has been the pedigree for most black city council members and mayors that have come through the city of Atlanta and one of the things that I tell black folks who are workingclass black people is what has that done for you with each black mayor and black city council less black folks have been able to afford to live in the city of Atlanta like trees and black people got something in common in Atlanta they're both disappearing and so the idea that these folks have been I know that was a bar [Music] um from is going to really be representative of the working class black folks in Atlanta we haven't seen any evidence of that where's the proof of concept of that right um and so that has been one of the biggest challenges I think it's ridiculous how Atlanta we stand at this we we we stand at this intersection of these glaring contradictions where we have this history of black leadership we are the Cradle of the Civil Rights Movement but we have consistently been the number one city for racial income inequality in the country only 22% of black third graders in Atlanta public schools are reading on grade level those things just don't that's just Madness to me it's outrageous I just sat with a mother who's from the Virgin Islands her child was Kid killed by an off-duty Atlanta police officer who had had a history of DUI he had been arrested for DUI in 20121 the night that he shot Devon Anderson in a neighboring city of Atlanta he was drunk and the police covered up for him he didn't have to take a breath elizer test they didn't they denied the the black sheriff denied the warrant that they had to draw his blood these are all black people who were complicit right in the murder of a black man man in Atlanta the black Mecca the city too busy to hate the Cradle of the civil rights movement and I you know for me it's offensive because I'm from Atlanta my folks are Caribbean and they did the New York's the New York thing like all the Jamaicans and trinidadians do right and they came down to the South and you know but I went to I went to school I went to school in Atlanta and I I did all the I went to the King Center you know I I met John Lewis multiple times he came and spoke at my school met all of these amazing black people leadership and I actually belied the things that they said and so now here I am at 34 and I'm just like all of this rhetoric is not adding up to what the conditions that my people are living in but now that I'm calling it out I'm oftentimes and others like me are viewed as the problem and I think that is the conversation that we have to have with workingclass black folks because without them these folks can't get elected you know I have so many thoughts right cuz you and Alini like everything yall are saying is 100% correct and then it just makes me think about how much like I don't know like power must corrupt or what what's inherently there because for everything y'all are saying I know the exact like flip side of that where it also is the same way because I like what I'll see a lot is first of all workingclass black people are often like their economic situation prevents them from being able to do service jobs you know what I mean like you can't do unpaid internships you can't go and go be a public defender you can't go choose these routes when you have a family that is struggling when you come from is just entirely [ __ ] different they already they're prevented like all like whenever I've been through school and all of that like my workingclass black friends could not afford to decide to be a public defender I remember them they were barely making it through school so they they were they were literally trying to make it to the end to try to get a job that could help them and take care of their families right so that's already the thing so what often happen is it it that's how like well-to-do or privileged black people end up in those positions and being able to do those jobs and then I think another level like another layer to that is what also happens is when you do see um black people who do have like workingclass backgrounds end up in these positions of power there's this there's this attitude of I got it out the muds I made it things you have to do things to make it like I see black black people are very forgiving to Back stories where you did wrong if you made it cuz this is idea that people who are powerful in order to be powerful in order to be successful somebody got to somebody got to lose somebody got to get hurt and there's an there's an energy to that and I often think too I what I've seen a lot of is black people who come from those communities who come from like struggling communities working-class communities have less sympathy for other black people from those communities they feel well I made it I this I that like and and and what I found often is very like privileged you know what I mean who didn't come from those communities middle class upper middle class black people who are like because you didn't come from those communities you know exactly how hard it you're like you don't know how just how much like how much [ __ ] is stacked against you like just how much more privileged you know what I mean and it'll be those black people like lobbying for Progressive things and then other black people are not who are actually from those communities feel well you shouldn't be the person speaking for me you don't actually understand my experience and they're not wrong and so far as like black people you know and there's been lots of discussions about this like lots of academics and scholarship and stuff about like how I guess like the petty bisi of black people like you don't you don't have the experience to be able to fill the gaps you might have the idea and the theory you know what I mean and like uh you want to take these Progressive and abolitionist ideas that were actually started with these like workingclass people who are actually a part of the struggle and actually on the ground but you don't have the like experience in the community to really put that into application so I think it's a dis it's a massive disconnect of like a on so many different levels like every way you slice it there's so much about the block experience and inherent oppressive structures and like how we survive those things what we come to believe in the wake of that and experience in our community is that even either or you get you somehow end up at the same result where black people are not in a a good position whether it be the working class P like the welltoo all of it it they all seem to end up at the same point yeah I I do want to come back to something that I heard earlier that I thought was really kind of like smart this idea I think Devon actually said it not to constantly pick on what Devon's saying but I think Devon you said this earlier about um kind of like proof of concept this idea that like we don't have who are the people who have come from you know what I'm saying like around the way or whatever it is come from nothing come from the hood come from the dis you know disinvested communities and have made it and are still connected to those communities there are so many like incentive structures that as you rise your network changes the people around you change and it becomes this club that like they get me I get them like we kind of get what it means to be in this privileged class and so you're completely disconnected from the community and I'm wondering like who are those people and a couple people come to mind one I think about Chris Smalls um from you know the Amazon kind of uh union worker kind of push you know I don't know his I don't know all the details of his story you know whatever it is but I know that he represents someone who's organizing people power or organized people power in a way that I think is powerful um I can't wait to watch this body politic film um cherai that you've recommended um but I also think about Ras Baraka in in New Jersey as a leader someone who's like like maintaining this kind of uh you know connected to the people kind of ethic in many ways I think we are living in the world that Bill Cosby uh built and created like he kind of created this image the reason why like Donald Trump is going around and he's so proud to talk about all this money that he invested in HBCU is because of The Cosby Show like that's what I I really genuinely believe that the image that Bill Cosby exported to this country uh really centered Hillman and this kind of HBCU experience as this kind of pathway into the Black Elite and it's not coinci it's not a coincidence in my opinion that within 15 years of The Cosby Show ending we got a Barack Obama who in many ways kind of captured that same Black Elite energy and and that kind of same like black nuclear family kind of vibe and so I think obviously vice president KLA Harris is benefiting from that and and so so this this connects to me for this connects for me to this idea of proof of concept we are going to continue to kind of perpetuate these kinds of standards for what it means to be a leader in the community because that's what we see and I'm thankful for like aqu quenta Brunson and Abid Elementary Janine te needs to get her life together but like she is a working class person is like cool right and like like this kind of image that I think we need more of of like a black person who cares about Community is successful could maybe get some relationship relationship stuff together but but overall a really good example of like the kind of person that I want to see more of coming out of our community and more of those images being produced and so that's kind of what that all kind of triggered for me you know you know that that made me think first of all you're statistically correct right like a different world literally did factually lead to a massive burst in black people attending college like more not just like college more and HBCU more which is you know a good thing right so it's like but I think we we always do things in ABS like black people we be all or nothing like you know what I mean like when I think like I'll see people like like you know our our little critique of of like okay where we could do us doing too much with this and like well go to Med like okay well none of that like I've seen it even when like when you think about insecure right like insecure was something that like it felt to me in my black world like that's my black world you know what I mean and then you would see and and people make valid you know critiques on that is not like the all the black experience and y y y and this is an the next thing or whatever and it's like we never want to have all I don't know why whenever you ever noticed that like whenever we start critiquing one genre of like black representation you know what I mean it's always just like we shouldn't have that that is bad you know what I mean this is we we always say black people are not a monolith but we're constantly trying to decide on a monolithic representation you know what I mean like we never want to have you know insecure different world and Hip Hop all of the things you know AB Elementary we don't want to have all we look at the pie and we be like what must go what is bad you know what I mean I think interesting we're talking a different world and you know that genre in the 90s where we had you know it wasn't just black sitcoms it wasn't just black shows but like Black Arts like creativity you know black authors we had so many of that and I always think like that a lot of that came about because those were the children of the Civil Right the 70s like their parents you know their parents were deep in the civil rights movement and so then we had that you know a a decade full of black empowerment in seeing it on the screen seeing it in the art seeing it in literature but one of the things I want to come back to is how do we open up opportunities for black working-class people to take leadership hi I'm I I grew up you know I grew up in Brownsville um in Brooklyn and for folks don't don't know Brownsville is is a mostly black neighborhood um I I should you know let me just paint this picture I grew up there and only left to go to college and I don't even recall seeing more than two white people at the same time until I went to high school so I remember when I stepped if people don't understand how segregated New York is when I went to high school which was outside of my zone own I was like oh wow like I was like oh my God there's a white person right and I was 14 I was 14 um so I you know then when I went to law school I graduated from law school 15 years ago I think folks should know oh you and I were talking about this you know it was very very known that black people were recruited specifically for prosecutor roles and to work at law firms spef specifically in employment discrimination to represent the company to work at those big law firms even if you were from a middle class background um these were the roles that they were it didn't matter if you had a 4.0 GPA they were like well these These are the roles we want you for and so for me when I said I want to work in social justice you know it was like what you know what how you gonna do that right and it was tough you know you have to now take a lower salary you have to have the money to do that and for a lot of folks who grew up working class once you make your first six figures it doesn't even you you know you're P you're you're also helping relatives right people don't understand that part you're also helping relatives so the money especially if you're in the sandwich generation you know the money is not the same as someone who grew up middle class or wealthy and they're making six figures and that money is just for them so you know I think we need to think about ways of how to make systems more open to have like black workingclass people who are leading so that it's not you know it's not so like you have to take these roles you cannot even afford to take on a leadership role and I'll just say it's it's also you know it's no pretty picture when you end up working in the you know you you also you know it I'm I'm pausing on my words because I'm trying to think of how to say this but the long and short of it is it's not fun when you're also working in environment where it's like we got y'all cuz then you're like one of the few black folks you know and then you're like you're you're working with the clients the clients are black they look like you but then you're sitting alongside and you're having these weird conversations it's a weird it's a weird experience an extremely weird experience and it's very isolating yeah yeah I people don't want to do it you know yeah I mean I would just jump in and say from the standpoint of you know teaching at a university where I see all these Tal ented black folks come through and I kind of see how they folks who have Progressive or even radical instincts wind up getting picked off and groomed and socialized into these other corporate things and of course you know I want folks to succeed I understand the struggle is real I'm here look I hate to say it y'all I done wrote some recommendation letters to for Black Folk to go to some evil places I'm sorry I'm confessing because I'm like because I need you to get that back but you know but on the other side but on the other side you know I think of Kendra Brooks and Philly right and how she kind of got into this position because the first time I met Kendra Brooks it was at a protest in North Philly where where Philly was trying to get re gain control of his of his school City count of his school um school board and she was a you know she's a black mother and organizer at that point and she spoke and I was like wow she's powerful so Kendrick came out of movements in Philly and by that time because there was a coalition that had already been successful you know one of those uneasy complicated coalitions that got Larry Kar elected you know and working with the Working Families party and other folks they were able to strategize and say we can get Kendra in and I and I watched Kendra as this black woman like you say coming work coming from North Philly you know and feeling like North Philly you know what I mean like she you know she she had to like she had to she had to endure all of that you know all those things to get into that position but man when she got in the power I'm talking about she came in she was in during the pandemic I mean she was pushing through you know anti- eviction legislation you know just taking the positions meeting with the meeting with the abolitionists and being like look y'all you know let's we we go to we got to figure this out how we going to do it there's only a couple of us on the council who gonna move it forward and so so that gives me hope to really underscore the point you're making Leah you know what I mean and also though like the thing that I think is really important that I find especially with working helping different people across the country but like not being that National person that's like I don't know anything so I go there and I spend too many months in Arizona and Phoenix and you know all this stuff it's also about how the movement treats folks and I've seen it so many times that like you know in and I'm I'mma go there yes I am I ad beened this this 16 years now and I'm gonna you know lay it down but like the movement be like like with Kendra there is a is a she can have conversations offline so why would you dare dare go online like people would be people would be run out of town and run out of the movement if they started to attack KRA for some choices she's got a made or some meetings she's got to take right like she keeps her position she keeps her like she keeps her principles but yes she's got she also has a job it is your job as a city council person as an elected official and we all have to understand that to meet with people that you do not like agree with and this is something that people don't freaking understand in the movement they're like why did this person it's their job it is on the job application it is it is number one they got that don't mean that they friends with them that don't mean that right like and there's different positionings that you know electing couldn't couldn't do that's on their teams to show how they actually feel about it but they have to meet with people they certain people right they have to meet with their colleagues if you are another city council person you especially on an eight person city council you can't just be like bye you know like you g to see that person every day in an intimate setting so I think that it's also the the the space that we give folks I have seen countless people only serve one term on a city and local level because people said they didn't go far enough my like you know Phoenix is a really good example um like Phoenix got all cops out of schools and they pushed the one guy who was forcing that because he didn't do enough they got all cops out of schools in the city of in one of the largest Public School District in this country and they said that wasn't enough so we also got to understand like I think in especially in movement spaces we got to stop with this whole like I could do it if I if it was better because I couldn't it's why I never run I can't deal with that stuff I just can't Devon bless you I've known you for a long time bless you I'm so glad you're doing it but ain't me you know it ain't me it's just like I know I can't we have unproductive we have not even unrealistic unproductive expectations of people involved in work like we I have seen it time and time and time and time again people more concerned with feeling like you took the you said the right thing you took the right like you know what I mean rather than what is actually being done like they will prevent things from being done because I rather you just like I remember even with my uh uh uh Deb Eric Adams on The Breakfast Club I remember when the picture first came out before the interview came out a [ __ ] ton of people why would you even talk to him platform someone said to me about the mayor why would I platform the mayor why I validate wait wait ol I got to say hold up hold up I I didn't I didn't I didn't go all the way there but I a going to lie when I saw the picture I was like it was just it was just a it wasn't you know what I mean y'all are singing my song right now C me I was like damn right damn right it's absolutely you should absolutely go there and talk to him you should abs abolutely take it to him I think part of the challenge that I have with movement is a couple of things when when it's comes to supporting movement candidates right um one is we don't have realistic expectations like for example I had to all of the candidates in my race were asked to meet with the president of the Atlanta police foundation which is the organization that has kicked off the first cop City I spoke with my wife about it and she and I were like so you going to tell movement and I said no I'm going to have a conversation afterwards because I'm not going to have this ridiculous expectation that I should not even have a conversation with him because what that signals to the traditional black folks which is he can't work with nobody he's he's not agreeable he can't he doesn't know what it's like right and so those are the folks of the grandmas they gonna show up regardless okay whether it's snowing raining they G they gonna put that ballot in the mail they gonna show up and so what they hear that Devin took a protest uh uh uh uh a a position to not meet with the Atlanta police foundation president to in their mind they're going to say he is unfit because he can't even meet with people that he doesn't agree with I think the other thing that sometimes movement does is that we don't recognize where we have the opportunity to build power after a loss power building is essential particularly when you know that you are up against the principalities and the powers that be and so it means you're going to take an L but how do you take a l and remix in that into a win in five years in six years in the next election cycle there are some organizations who were name unnamed who put a lot of work into organizing and passing 116,000 signatures so that people could vote on whether or not we move forward with this facility and because the mayor mayor Dickens has stalled this in court and refuses to drop the lawsuit it's held up in court and so at this point it won't be on the ballot and so for many people they see they saw that as a loss and so they have decided that instead of getting involved in a race that has consequen uh uh uh implications for what will happen with the militarization of police moving forward they have decided to fold their hands and do nothing which is insane to me and so when we have the opportunity to support movement candidates who have been dedicated to the cause if we don't get what we initially wanted then we sometimes we fold up our hands and we say well we're we're we're we're we're we're out and I think that that's a mistake because it's not just me it's other candidates who can talk about how they have felt like movement workingclass candidates who have felt like movement has turned their back on them at the opportunity when they needed it the most and so that is why it is hard to recruit movement candidates that's why because many folks in movement are willing to um you know run but then when they hear the conversations that the people that they want to have the support from and movement have about the folks who are running it's like well damn like y'all going to cannibalize me too and so we cannibalize our own we eat our own we feed our own to the wolves and then when we have the opportunity we look and say well where's the movement candidate why would want someone want to do this why yeah so there's a story in New York about how that H how how that happened um an example a lot of folks know Yousef Salam the exonerated five but there's a backstory to the council member who had that position right before he BR yeah and that was council member Christian Richardson Jordan and she was also one of the movement folks right very powerful speaker speaking up for the folks in Harlem there was a developer who um wanted to build a whole bunch of Apartments put the proposal through um and I'm not a neutral player here because I sit on my City's Planning Commission I'm one of the Commissioners we vote on these things I'm I'm attendant advocate so I have the same reservations that the council member had which was there are not enough affordable apartments and also everybody knows in New York City I don't or everyone might not know but some of these affordable apartments go up to six figures I'm talking $160,000 and sometimes they start at $60,000 so if you at like lowincome you can't even you're not even eligible for these affordable apartments so she was raising a lot of these concerns and what about the true affordability what about the fact there too many studios in one bedrooms Harlem is also F you know we have a lot of families here raising this giving the developer hell because right you know they this is what the commun these are some of the concerns the community had and she caught a lot of flak for that all of these hit pieces the mayor was coming out you know obviously he was standing with the developer and she ended up getting pushed out in large part because of that project because of what happened so it's also you know and again she was backing the community but then you have the mayor and a lot of people don't know how the sauce is made so I'm telling you in New York City you know developers do run shop you don't have Mayors who were sitting there telling them hey hey you can't threaten it like you can't make these threats now that you're gonna have build a truck stop because you don't you're not going to get what you want like you have to actually sit in you don't have Mayors doing that you have Mayors who were telling council members be quiet and just be lucky that we're getting a private developer who's going to do really what we should be doing which is build affordable housing so get in line you have a lot of these get in line conversations so again it goes back to what Devin was saying yeah you can have folks run for office you can have folks be in office but then it's hard because then you have Democratic black Mayors who are making same folks their enemy they're the ones we're not talking about magga folks which we have in New York we're not talking about folks who are fake Dems who who you know we're talking about black establishment Dems who are also making things very difficult and New York City 200,000 black folks have moved out of New York City in the last 20 years New York City is way less black than this is why Jordan neing is with strangled so this probably would not have happened the same way if we're talking about in the 1990s people would have jumped in right see this is this is also a function of New York City being a less black City I tell having been here all of my life an entirely different city right and so it it you can feel it as you live here and the folks again the movement folks that are even fighting it who is shutting them down let's look at who is it Trump is it no it's black establishment Dems I spend more time in Atlanta fighting with my black mayor working with fighting with my working with and fighting with my black sheriff for the conditions of R Street which at this point is more notorious than Rikers um I spend more time having to convince black folks on city council and County Commission to do right by black folks and not just approve whatever corporate developers bring I mean literally we gave $2 billion away to a a a in tax in tax breaks to a developer from Los Angeles to develop over by uh State Farm Arena Mercedes-Benz Stadium $2 billion in tax breaks and we were supposed to and we got the bare minimum on affordable housing and then today we found out that that developer paid an 8.5 million fee to the city so they didn't have to build affordable housing at all right wow that the governor didn't do that I I I hardly ever get a chance to take Brian Kemp to task because I'm spending more time fighting for workingclass people and the people who often times are against workingclass people in Atlanta look like me and are part of and are part of the same political party if you will and that's the conversation that many of us are not ready to have yeah and I yeah and that makes a lot of sense but and I also think that we're not ready to have a conversation about like let's just also be real because I don't want to I don't want to have this sound like we're just like there are actually a lot of working we're like also making working class sound like a monolith and it's not there are a lot of people who do agree with us but they ain't organized with us the places that they're organized in are labor unions or other institutions that are not as moving as their members and I that is a reflection about black movement that we actually have to I think that black movement has also trended toward I mean I remember at a conference to not be named when I went in the room with all the organizers and everybody except me went to college everybody except me had a a certain economic level and I was like and we supposed to be organizing on black folk like we also have to like take Reflections from our movement because there are there are plenty of especially like you know when I grew up because the party raised me I was raised by oh Lord um you know but it was great to be around $1.99 it was great to be around black unions in New York City right ask me dc37 right like really like you know and still this way my auntie who I'm staying with right now in Brooklyn is a you know 1199 retiree but movement doesn't do the work to reach out those people like a lot of them came to Occupy Wall Street because the union said to come but they still didn't necessarily get some of the stuff right A lot of them showed up to some of our marches because the union leadership said to come but they we didn't build those relationships with the rank and fire you have a lot of white organizations building relationships with the rank and fire and actually putting not the best foot forward in like to to what leftism is progressivism socialism whatever you know whatever your bag of leftest is and I think that that is a problem too is like when when I when a lot of people go on these National stages and they're beautiful and I love them and I'm a part of them too and sometimes not like I always are saying like who's your actual base if it is black activists that are already active if it is black folks and and I'm mean a particular kind of activist if it is if it is folks who you are contending and having to deal with like if those conversations were out in public people be trying to cancel you like that's the type of stuff I think that that's what we have to actually interrogate our own movement and and our own people with because I am tired of people being like Oh my base and I'm like your base is like the 17 people that would have came to any other action in Atlanta or in New York anyway like your base is the same and that's like and I think that that's that is an organizing problem that is an organizing problem I I man just really quickly I think one of the as you were saying that I think one of the other challenges is there's often times a purity test that we require for movement C it's all the time you retake it yeah and that we require for movement candidates to pass and the shade of it is is that no one no one would pass his purity test like no one right and so we we have this bar that is so high that movement candidates have to reach and while the bar is in hell for everybody else and we will not uh uh and if our movement candidate doesn't hit that bar we will fold our hands and say well you know you're not really you're not really ready to to do what it is that we we need to do you're not ready to win and it's like jump in help help them meet the bar like don't just sit there and criticize bring your talents bring your ideas bring your resources bring your network so that this person can hit the standard that you think that they're supposed to be hitting but this purity test that we want candidates to be able to pass you know I think it's going to be our undoing and I think like oh excellent point I think like we we're we spend so much time being critical of power as we should be that even when we amass power we become so hypercritical of that power that we we abdicate it and then we become supportive again because something I noticed consistently right I think Jamal Bowman is a is a great example even though Jamal Bowman did not lose so much for lack of support it was because they redistricted and they pretty much drew his entire black vote leg his entire District out in the Bronx so I think look I think Jamal Bowman can win another District like what his district is now and I encourage him to do that but but when leading up to his election I interviewed Jamal Bowman I was putting out about J Jamal Bowman so I was experienced I was getting a lot of the the a you know what I mean what is the the lay of the line and Jamal Bowman and despite the fact fact the Jamal Bowman was saying [ __ ] that I'm like is a they will come for your head like he was saying all of the things doing all of the things we claim one thing and I swear to God I swear to God it was the masses being in my in in my comments like he should have been done it you know what I mean or he's not Progressive enough they were calling a man who was actively laying his L like openly attacking apack speaking out on the genocide seeing all of the things I mean he was speaking more clearly than like creators who have nothing right and they were still like they were still calling him a Zionist saying this this this and the next thing talking [ __ ] about him then the minute he lost they seem to like regive him all of the benefit of the doubt that they had just I swear to God like suddenly they started talking about him crucify we're looking we're always looking for a messiah we're always looking for someone to crucify we're looking for a martyr and it's like we don't need Martyrs right now we need leaders y'all like that's not just because I I I agree I feel like more people I feel like Cory Bush and Jamal Balman got more popular when they lost and I'm just like yes what where are we in our politics where it is cool to see someone uh uh lose in that way who has been who is a part of the political leadership that we say that we that we claim that we want why are we not protecting our own why is it that we would even put out that type of rhetoric about someone like Jamal or and let me let me just say let me just say you know this by the way I'm y'all I'm in school right now I'm learning so much oh my God I just got to say that man I really appreciate this um but also but also um I you know even candidates who won their elections you know in some cases right you know if I'm thinking about summer Lee you know it's like in some cases like APAC ain't done you know what I'm saying they are not done they might not had a chance to mobilize in time so what is the message to some of those folks right now because to your point and again I get I think every you know everybody in here gets that like protest is important holding folks accountable is important we all on that page and I think everybody here has been involved in doing that work so just to knock that one out the box for anybody in the back who's thinking that but my thing is just like yeah no it's it's about that but is our vision of governance that everybody says the right things and then is out and then nobody's available to actually govern right you know in our vision you know I said this on I said this on oh I'm sorry I'll say it really quick I was just going to say I've said this before on oay and friends so the OG's will will will know but like we we need a political change theory and we need people to like really talk about it in those terms I think Angela Davis did the world a service when she made the statement that I think she said electing kamla Harris would create more opportunity for radical organization in the future something to that effect that she's basically saying like it might not be everything she might not be perfect but she would create the conditions where we can still organize and and pursue radical Progressive action whereas maybe under the other guy that kind of organization will be stamped out before we could even make the progress that we need and it speaks to that kind of strategic mind that many of our forbears in the civil rights movement and before had they were thinking in that way and I think when we've add we kind of the good thing is that we have more voices at the table I don't I don't want to sound like that's a bad thing that's a good thing but but the kind of the negative the the the sh kind of side to that is that now we have so many people kind of adding to the conversation in ways that are uninformed and the very least like unst strategic yes yes yes word colle that amazing i' I'm like oh my god I've learned so much this amazing it's great on something you said nelini because I you talking about unions and I wanted to share some tea as someone who um sits on a commission and gets to see like housing proposals come up I was shocked when a bunch of the controversial proposals that would come up you would have tenant organizers on one side like from the community and Union folks on the other and I'm like what is going on and what was happening was tenant organizers were coming to say uh yeah y'all are proposing $3,000 these are literally examples $3,000 Studios as the affordable housing no and then the developer would have already spoken with the unions so they would come to testify yeah but we need this project because it's gonna bring jobs so I'm like what it's what Amazon H hq3 hq3 happened with Amazon I mean may he rest in peace like yeah Hector in peace Hector went with Amazon as opposed to with the arrest of the community members and 3 that's what happened with cops yeah landlords are playing uh Checkers developers are playing chess they you know and I'm so I started digging in I'm like what what what is this and they already like they go they sign these agreements like you're GNA get you know you're G to work with us you're G to give our members like these many jobs so that we could build this building so you know they obviously get something out of it but I think that that's something to keep in mind as well that even when you do have um working class folks and they are on the front lines and they are in unions you still have the power structure that is able to sort of infiltrate and get them push them once again to like be this kind of opposition play that role and be this opposition to the community needs just talk about uh Garrison talked about something about like being strategic right and I want to give an example I had to have a conversation with um again another organization that will remain unnamed for now uh very Progressive left of Left Right and they were like so we need you to like not say that you're going to support Harris for president in order to get our support and I said now let me give you all this political calculus in the lay of the land I am in a race with five people for a city Council seat two of those people are black women one of them sits on the school board do you think that I have a Pathway to Victory in the city of Atlanta if I come out against the first black woman president that we could possibly have in this country where's your political analysis do you want to win or do you want to be right and so we had to have a conversation and eventually I just had to leave the table with I'm okay not having you all support because you know of course they brought up the genocide I'm like I've spoken out about the genocide I'm the only candidate in the race that's willing to commit to introducing a divest from Israel legislation on at the city council just like city council did in the 1980s to divest from South Africa I'm willing to do that I'm right on all the issues but because I'm unwilling to take this position that we must support other candidates for president who at this point don't have a Pathway to Victory I'm Unworthy of your support I think that we have a really off political calculus right now and so we've got to talk about that because for many candidates who are running for office who are movement candidates those are some of the conversations that they have to have in order to be electable to the populace and we are not ready to have that conversation because work that we we have not done the work in the Progressive left to really to really take those positions and expect our candidates for local office to be successful by taking this Ultra Ultra Progressive position that most of the electorate is not at but also like it's like there is is the ultra Ultra left and it's also like taking a position and then making your whole campaign and this is my analysis of what we wrong with Jamal Bowman is that what APAC actually did is that they put ads not about Israel Palestine they put ads about how he did not vote for the infrastructure Bill even though and nobody every Progressive shut their mouth about it even we were outside we were outside saying vote no so we get a better infrastructure Bill and literally but nobody wanted to say that because we wanted to make it about this thing so it's also like people be playing chess when we be like playing checkers and it is really something that I'm like really over it because we have to actually understand that when you when you go to a community i' I've knocked on probably like half of the not half of the counties there's too many counties in this country but a lot of mother counties in this country right like everywhere like Georgia New York uh Michigan Wisconsin like California you know and Arizona and I just time and time again what I see is like two things is it's like there is one thing that the rightwing really beats us at and I think that it's something we really actually have to contest with because as a person who's an internationalist as somebody who's been anti-war as somebody for the first time in my life I got tear gas I was in Bethlehem like I was I was tear gassed by the IDF like I still understand that masses of people right left anywhere in between care about what's happening in this country before they care about across the world they have got in that rightwing um like Tulsi gabard um you know messaging about and this is really real right about we you know we we can't spend money on endless Wars which was an original leftist principle but the way that they see it right is is also be staying out they're like they're apologist for Assad and stuff like that right they be apologizing for Assad and his crimes in rova and stuff like that so like you know when we think about all of this like that but so that's the thing we got to contest for when we have the messaging game and when we thinking about elections and when we thinking about power and in black community particularly I know that like my even my family will be like I care about the world probably more than your average American that's doesn't you know doesn't care about things that happen outside of this country and also what the hell is happening here I came here for a reason yeah yeah we spent we spent an OB it's it's insane the obscene amount of time that is spent trying to tear down the only few like like Outlets that we have right like when you think about it like I I'm always talking about political education and thinking about how and specifically in like media and thinking about how little representation we have we have very little the right has so I mean they they they bulldo like the right has an Obe level of access resources organization godamn they organized the Republic the right will get on a talking point quick yeah meanwhile the left has like the true like the left has like a few like a few a few little Outlets maybe like a couple of Independent Media whatever have you we have a couple of voices and then the rest of the movement spends all this time like all their time not even focusing here the right any of that like how can I find what's wrong with not good enough not left enough how can I tear down these people yeah that's a real thing like to to what Devin was saying like I'm not even a person who can vote but because I have and I've said a million times like K represent my ideals I think it will be a more competent version of uh Biden's Administration I talk about like how I think the symbolism and the what the influence that'll be negative in terms of black people wanting to go out and be prosecutors XYZ but because I recognize that Kamala is much better a democratic Administration is much better for this country than Republicans and and and not just for this country but also for abroad but we don't want to have that like I don't know why you're not allowed to like contend with that reality because I say that the VP at the green party is making videos talking about me and Angela Davis are are being denounced by the ancestors like that's a real thing that's happening so I swear to God I swear to God 10,000 people liked it you know what I mean and I'm like you don't care the amount of times I see people not care about what actually done but tell but tell themselves they that they just believe deep in my soul I'm not a real leftist I'm this that I'm like you care about actually accomplishing anything us being able to reach voices well I mean to me like listen I'm I'm here for and again I think I I think I speak for everybody when I say I'm all for having critical conversations about what black electeds are doing what elected Progressive electeds are doing but to me this is supposed to be in service of building power this is what all these folks are saying we have to build power maybe we need a more precise understanding of what building power means because I think when folks are building sometimes it's social media clout they're building their own sort of signaling about impurity but you are what are you build what are you actually building like what do we get on other side of that that leaves our movements better after between elections so this is the question I have right not about saying nobody can be critiqued but what are these critiques building you know me one of the examples that I gave fol so sorry just just really quickly one of of the examples that I gave to folks I said let's take Georgia for example Georgia Trump lost by what 11,000 700 something votes that's what he was asking Brian km to get him to steal the election in 2020 right correct so ideally uh if Harris is to carry the state she will either carry it around that margin or maybe even less we could be talking about five 6,000 votes right what position does that put prog in in Atlanta to say to the president of the United States if she was elected well actually if you want this Democratic majority you want a reelection well girl we got to talk about what's going on in Israel right now because I can turn out 4,000 vot for you or I can make those people stay home I don't have that leverage point with Donald Trump and so when people are asking me well why are you going to support Harris for me I'm viewing it as I live in a swing state where I know I can mobilize I we just mobilized 116,000 people to sign a petition for a local referendum you don't think that we can apply that same pressure if she's the president that's looking to run for reelection that is trying to have a democratic majority we have the keys but we have no keys we have no leverage with Donald Trump and so that's where the thing I I I really don't understand the calculus and the the political theory of change of some progressives and particularly some that are in leadership around what is your real what is your real theory of change what's your endgame here what is the power that you are actually building because if you're going to say that because she's not Progressive enough that we're not going to vote for her for me that that makes me seem like okay well then make her make her Progressive enough you do that when you're in a place where you have leverage where you can mobilize people or you can say I'm not going to mobilize people right those are the type of conversations that I want people to have when they're thinking about who we are going to support politically like a lot of that has to do of of course with policy and where people stand on these really big issues but we also know that that is nuanced and that we can move people to our position based on how we are able to mobilize people for or against them what were you gonna say Leah I was going to say um you know one of one of the barriers and the challenges I think that we have that I don't think the right faces as much is that the left is often just pigeon hold is grifters so if you get a platform you know a little bit people like oh that's all you wanted to be on MSNBC that's all you want you know as opposed to like okay I'm speaking about the issues right I'm strategic and I think that that's also part of it as well and it ties into the language that um The Right started with this whole like real American like anyone who is mag or anyone who's Republican like they must deeply care about this and that's just what they believe and even though I don't agree but anyone who has this like left oh you know they're just trying to this is why I actually think Angela Davis's Point really RS some people up because I think you know some people saw that as oh PE these people are grifters like they just want to build a whole career out of like writing articles and talking about this as opposed to getting something done um and you know while is it is do some people are some people clout chasing that's everywhere Cloud chasing is everywhere Candace over all like a lot of people are clout chasing right um but at the same time I think that we also need to disrupt this mentality that anyone who is speaking up and has Progressive policies must be like a grifter right bars I think we have an episode y'all what [Music]
