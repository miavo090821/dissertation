do I want to be do I would I want to be on record saying this somebody does it right or if somebody is an activist or an Entertainer that does it they become something to condemn others you know what I mean like everybody has to be this and everybody has to be that I don't value what Beyonce love her down but I don't value what she has to say about certain issues more than I value my own opinion we have to also understand but there is real risk associated with speaking out on these large issues we are not seen as men like period we are not men the biggest mistake that you can make as a black man is to think that you are a man I think that Beyonce you're asking people to engage with your art politically I think it's right that people want her to use her [Applause] platform hello beautiful black people hello hi I will tell you all why I convened you here today but I don't you know we just bought the hang the general air yeah we're just popping [ __ ] it's a general discussion episode no Herby literally messaged me like o I know these are normally real political and I would like to be able to prepare like so you know what's the topic and I'm like I don't know Herby you so cute taking dang seriously I'm like normally I would have something in mind normally I curate the group based on a topic but it was just like Vibes honestly you actually pick the perfect people because all I ever say is I'm just about The Vibes so is wonderful um so I think I want to slander Eminem I think that's the first thing that's the first thing I do and I want to find out if it's an unpopular opinion I know I know I'm gonna get called Everything But A Child of God because I feel like there's too much I hate the way hip-hop is conceded to Eminem like it's like this like they concede so much respect to Eminem like it's just a fact the Eminem is a great and it doesn't get challenged and you know it pisses me off nobody else who's considered the top of hip-hop is is given so much grace like Jay-Z could never put out as many [ __ ] shitty albums as Eminem has put out in like the last 15 years Eminem has been doing [ __ ] [ __ ] musically for like since 2009 I feel like I've been looking at Eminem like this when when was The Slim Shady out that's the marsh was it the Marshall matters he did like one exp his of his recent exploits was okay like in the new era like had had one good project after he put out the really [ __ ] up project where they talk bad about him on everyday's strel he got mad at Joe bu and them and then he put out like the project that bounce back from it like you remember he put out that one that was real American flag like Revival I see it here Revival he had one he has one that's good but it's literally only good cuz it's like seven songs of him being like [ __ ] Y'all who didn't think my last [ __ ] was good I could rap like that's literally the project I'll be honest and say the one Eminem album I can recite most of is the Marshall matters LP but I was also like in the fifth grade um that's that's his truly great album does have great music I'm not saying he don't he has the 90s and the very very early 2000s are his right yeah I I give you that what I don't like though about about Eminem is first and foremost normally when people talk about what the rules are supposed to be or what the bar is supposed to be for like white hip hop artists especially how they treat like new ones right like the amount of critica for Jack Hollow and them you would think their forefather Eminem was some some [ __ ] of virtue someone who all right so let me jump real Qui I did just I mean he is I did and I did just do a video on him and white rappers in general at the end of last year and so I I want to agree and disagree with you oay because yeah I think so Eminem is respected and if we're going to be fair Eminem he is kind of a oh [ __ ] am I do I want to be do I want to be do I I want to be on record saying this I was like think about what you saying think about it B basically what I'm trying to get at is Eminem could not have predict did not understand what he was doing when he became in Eminem he was just like I want to be a rapper I want to make some money I want to make music here I am this some shady I'm the real shady y y all that [ __ ] and so what happens after that is he becomes Eminem and ironically one underlying piece of mm's MLM Eminem's music is that he hates his fans just as much as we do but he can't do anything because he's Eminem he hates that he created Jack Carlo he hates that he created Tom McDonald he hates that created Machine Gun Kelly he hates all of those things but he also can't stop being himself which is also trash in a lot of ways yeah so it's this weird complex um like Schrodinger's [ __ ] situation with him Schrodinger's [ __ ] now hold on you know and and the last thing I'll say is a lot of there is there is a chunk of Eminem's fans especially internet rap fans there's always you know there's a chunk of them that are like annoying and they anything he does is great because he's Eminem whatever but Eminem has definitely gotten his fair share of shade and heat he get critique but your critique with a consistent lifelong invite you know what I mean a like you know what I mean like that that that ain't the same for me what I don't like is right is even the fact that he has Eminem is so big that's my point is like how big he is right and it's not just yes of course Eminem is huge because there's a whole white hip hop and stuff that love him but there's also a lot of [ __ ] like in like in Hip Hop and like the ones who whose opinions you care about that are like swollen the chess fam and M fa and you know what I hate every other artist that like a rapper that is great right that you has a great rapper has made made great music has a cut off in people's mind when a new music no longer is relevant to people especially if it's not up to par if it's not good you don't even talk about it it's the man you know what they supposed to perform this is and the next thing nobody expects their new music to perform at that to get the same amount of coverage but not [ __ ] Eminem Eminem has been putting out shitty projects like more often than not Eminem puts out some [ __ ] like and Eminem is just hugely talked about commercially successful and what he really did to make me decide to say [ __ ] I'm right and mind you I love Stan I love all the old music right and all of that what pissed me off is did you see did y'all see Houdini what he dropped last night I actually Justice TOA that's her Le she you a see it for you see it I mean until you show me that but like I looked at the the lyrics and I was just like ra like this unprovoked misogyny like unprovoked like like [ __ ] the one like what are you talking about like the feet the feet are we talking about the feet the feet that's what he talking about like he just like I mean like he linked to the mogy that's what kill me like I mean like this [ __ ] like came Circle Back Spin the block around go and say actually let me remind you how Mass I am this is start this massagy [ __ ] this the [ __ ] than y [ __ ] forgot yall think 36 mafia in them two short no you're all a ready for my you know I hate though like a lot of these artists like not only and we have to talk about the way like people use mag day literally he used mag name on intentionally because it's the only way that [ __ ] s where it would be something on our we talking about it right um but what I hate is back in my day [ __ ] used to have all their problematic [ __ ] up massage like incredibly misogynistic like like Wicked lyrics and agendas to to songs that made you want to turn against your principles like songs that you like so much you feel like you gota you got a turn Nimble gymnastics to defend it don't even be good no more like they not even like you know what I'm saying I and because I know I know I know based on my own music library that I'm capable of being silent about some [ __ ] [ __ ] if I really really [ __ ] with the music I know this I have a lifelong of doing it what is that what is I went and I said watch the whole thing it's [ __ ] bad like I it's so bad it made me stop caring about the misogyny and the magd ding and be like you know what I think we have have to have a laric conversation about Eminem and why we're still allowing Eminem to be it's like I so I'm I'm playing Madden I'm I don't know what I was doing but I was up later than I usually was and so I see this pop up in my Twitter feed as I'm brushing my teeth I'm like well this been promoted to me enough let me just see let me see what this is and it starts out and I'm interested because I'm like H Eminem from 2002 and mm from 2024 meeting that is a really interesting concept and a and a room for commentary on like the the nature of discourse and art and Hip Hop and even his legacy as he's looking at his old self thinking what would I say to that person that I that that you know maybe don't do drugs like there so many things that could have happened there and then R Kelly likes the black ey peas [Laughter] bars there's so many bad bars I gota find sorry no it is really bad there's this one bar that says the old me would say everything is gay like happy and I would rather be called a [ __ ] because that that was that but I think too I think the issue that like Olay spoke about earlier like this issue of this lifelong invite is ubiquitous inside of hip-hop and outside of hip-hop like you know black people want to invite everybody to the cookout and the bar is is incredibly lower for them to exist in Black spaces Adele was invited to the cookout just because she wore a Jamaican flag over her her white titties and it's very don't get me started and then when she says the way you make me feel the way you make my black friends feel people are like oh why are you in black people's business I'm talking about the 2016 Grammys but y'all continually invite these people yeah y'all continually invite these white people into these proverbial black spaces and the bar is incredibly low or even Vlad who is literally exists just to create space for black people to disparage themselves and for him to engage in that discourse and then different factions of the black community are always upset but it's like y'all keep showing up and allowing him to create this space so I think Eminem is just is continually invited in this it it's a lifelong invitation into this black space and so he feels like he has permission to speak and to speak poorly right um on this Salient issue and obviously folks are upset and they want to silence him rightfully so but I just feel like we have to stop making white people comfortable to Center themselves in spaces that inversely they would never make us feel comfortable in you know what that makes that makes you know what that makes me think of that's an excellent point Herby and also when you said you know black people and my boyfriend squawked from from the bedroom he let at you oh after you say what you was going to say so oh God cause here's the thing a white dude made that mean and he's [ __ ] hilarious right Tony St Tony stovich well I don't think he's white I think he's Albanian or something a white guy made you know black people yes and see and there's the conundrum right oh my God I can't believe this is who I I'm Taho today yeah but that doesn't mean he gets invite to the cookout a broke clock is right twice a day first I'm sorry I'm sorry because people the thing that this song did not surprise me this was every the growth that some of y'all are talking about with Eminem The W no no no no saying all of these men are shaking their clouds at the fist being mad about women taking over hip hop being mad about the fact that gay people are in Hip Hop even though gay people have been in this industry for a while while clearly they just weren't uh out yeah because because where did Eminem where is the like when you think about like where where is the growth where is the change right because like always been like this right hand right like we talking about we having this whole recording in Hip Hop about how [ __ ] like Dr Dre are are revered right and I remember you can go read about it the comments that Emin made about what Dr Dre did to D Barnes yeah he wasn't no [ __ ] Ally I know Dr looking at Diddy like that's [ __ ] up let me chill that's why they're not say Jay JayZ 15 like come on y'all like we wait a minute now how did Jay-Z get in it now how did JayZ I know I know because I don't want to do it to that lady listen K when you a star I I go right to her's her's videos I'm like the only other person who's reasonable like [Laughter] me right girl I'm just like you know what until you know actually I'm going to be silent right now on the matter I was about to speak but I'm going to be silent right actually this isby listen I got heated it's right there the the fan oh well start listen when you and te start this is me see exactly yall y'all are this is this is why I can't trust y'all solidarity because y'all just be looking like this when me and T are over there getting I like look at you look at you well well well I do want to say this about that and then we can and then we can Circle back move on we can swiftly move on and and I'm just I'm trying to think if I want to say this right now but may you know what I'll do it um why not the girls will drag me but it's fine I've been drugged before or dragged before um I feel like I never really fully resonate with this idea or this expectation for beyon or any of these other people to show up in a way cuz you guys mentioned T that's what I'm talking about this um to show up in a way that is real solidarity that's like people are like oh their activism is performative and I'm like well yes she's a performer yes she's a performer so so why are we expecting her to show up as B hooks or or Tony Morrison she's what what she does is well well yeah oh yeah let's let's talk about it again because I have so many thoughts please my trauma um but I'm I'm saying they perform a kind of and they I think they have to maintain a kind of now it is capitalism it she is our hyper billionaire our hyper Capital anti capitalist billionaire Queen that's what I call her right right but I think that they act as like a canvas and so they have to remain as translucent as possible for people as many people as possible to see themselves in their material and then to go and do their own research on whatever it is that they may be alluding to she's never going to or not just Beyonce but Beyonce is she seems to be the one that everybody seems to focus on she's an entry point I brought Taylor Swift up too I wasn't just going anent ass and I do be over it um that's Beyonce's no I want I'm want Beyonce's ass no I mean Beyonce has made explicitly political um you know works of art you know with Renaissance and gay and trans people I think that Beyonce she can't just I mean it doesn't make it you're asking people to engage with your art politically so I I think it's right that people want her to use her platform I so so okay so I have a I have a lot a lot a lot of thoughts um on this because in general I feel like people do a thing where if they do something or if someone does something it's like you want to make them that and make them that for lifelong right like I've always told people I became a I became a public defender I became that kind of lawyer because to me for me as an individual I didn't feel like it was sufficient for me to go become a black lawyer in a in a system where black people are disproportionately incarcerated and I felt like I needed to do something in service of that but under no circumstances do I think black people in general or other black lawyers are obligated to have to to go about their legal career like that and I and I this idea that people have to to not only be activists like um essentially but be activist in all the things because they're activists in one thing like lots of people have Focus areas like they even if they have most people in general don't even are not activists and I don't think most people should be and I think celebrities absolutely shouldn't be for a number of different reasons or who we focus on for so many [ __ ] reasons but I think like sometimes and I see this a lot like people will ask me I get invited to like oh come talk on this thing or come talk on this thing because you saw me talk on this thing it's like I don't know about that [ __ ] thing like I'm not the best person to be your advocate for that like you're asking for something that would even be better like good for you I'm like the reason when you see me be excellent about at being an advocate about something it's because that's what the [ __ ] my heart was in that's what I knew about that's what what what have you and that's where the energy should be focused right so I think like I don't like the idea that if somebody does something they do do something like a meaningful piece of work or or ad or or they speak to something especially like music is going to speak to things people's life and experience anything and everything especially any black experience any marginalized experience anything that has to do with black or marginalized people is going to be political in somebody there's going to be a political analysis and I don't like the idea that if you do that or if you or if you create art or you speak up on on on one thing or something you have to do it on all the things or all the things that people are activated about right now or they discredit how genuine you were about what it is that you did do and what it is that you did offer um so I don't like that I also don't like the idea I'm like celebrities we do this thing where I think we forget that these things are jobs like because we don't see these people in that way right but like especially as I continue like I think about what it is to be a content creator or a public fig or whatever have you right it's like [ __ ] have jobs like they have things it is that they do and when artist when these there are people whose job what it is that they wanted to do was [ __ ] sing and dance and be famous and whatever have shallow thing and whether they Dibble and Dabble or cross over in your minds of these other things that's what it really is that's what they're supposed to be and quite frankly I feel like more often than not more often than you have an example of a celebrity doing right or being good on on the issues or something like that you have way way way more having a catastrophic effect on [ __ ] discourse and what people think and it's so [ __ ] hard to undo the ties of what it is they're doing more often than not I feel like I like when like when people will be like you know when they say something you don't like and [ __ ] be like play like [ __ ] dribble your ball do whatever it is you're supposed to do that's the attitude that people have but then when those people do stick to those things then people are like you need to be using a platform like this and I think it's one thing to to like want or wish for something like oh a world where there are more platforms doing this but I think the way it becomes this like this is the focus we need to we need a celebrity should be doing this or it's a reflection of them and their character and all this other thing it just kind of misdirects to me what the whole conversation should be about and also putting attention on the many people there are that use their platforms for that and their information it's like this hyper fixation on what isn't there you know what I mean on what isn't happening I agree because I have two minds of it because I've talked about this lady a lot I talk about her way too much just my flip flop flippy flip flopping ass feelings all the time but I will say like in one mind I'm like yeah I don't value what beyon say love her down but I don't value what she has to say about certain issues more than I value my own opinion and sometimes that's what I get from people when they want a celebrity to speak about a certain thing right but then I also don't want to play in their faces because we asked Taylor Swift and Beyonce to get people to come out to vote we asked them to use their power to do that we had lizo on a stage with all these activists bringing them out on stage and then they notice an increase in their followers and I think lizo did a good job with that because she was like I'm not this person but here's people that you can follow here's people you should be paying attention to like she used her platform for that so I think sometimes it gets really murky and it's really like uh it's really Tangled when we're asking celebrities to use their platform and their influence to get people to just pay attention to something more for me I think to be an entry point into something but then at the same time you know it's it's it's the art to me as well as a performer is quite selfish it's altruistic to an extent of like I give you this thing you come you experience something you have a good time you have memories and I get to get attention and perform and do the thing that I want I just want to sing I just want to dance blah blah blah blah blah right but it's kind of like you if your thing is to have as many people as possible see you reflected right some of those people are going to be more politically minded activist type people so they're going to have a different expectation VI yeah I I think one thing I want to say it's funny I just made a video that touches on this uh a couple weeks ago on the bsides which is there is something to be said about the normalization of stand culture when it comes to people when it comes to our faves and I personally feel like why don't you do or talk about X is kind of a a mutation of that stand culture I think so too um it's it's not illegitimate and I think we should consistently have discourse if not so much for the celebrity but for the greater population to say hey why isn't blank talking about X Y and Z you know what I'm saying I don't really expect Beyonce and I I think it would be relatively foolish to expect Beyonce to do a a anti- palestin I keep doing that [ __ ] a pro Palestine statement of some sort one time I had to tell you I feel like I feel like it would be I feel like it's relatively naive to expect that but I don't think it's useless to speak on it and demand it on some level so that's I'm of two minds much like kadesia on the other end though the the way that there's like a there's there should be a a upper limit to how in ra outrage you're going to get about your favorite Entertainer not having the not reflecting the politics that you have and what you expect to be done about that because they're they're not a politician they're not there to reflect your politics even if they do on some level through their art do that they're there to entertain you and once you start getting so wrapped up in that Cult of Personality you've actually lost your ability to to critique at a higher level and then you then you actually are like being a bad fan or whatever because now you're not just critiquing you're not just not you're not just critiquing or not critiquing what their what behavior is you're just sucked into either the fandom or the anti-and oh the on here a little while ago consciously was throwing shade at web de Boyce and I [ __ ] love the boys but that [ __ ] has so many Shady things in his past you catch me dead to say something like to try to be fighting people about him right like and that's I think more useful than being like nope I'm a deoy say you can't say nothing negative about him in my presence or I'm an anti- the boy saying all the great things that he's done all the great music Beyonce gives us and I even love me some goddamn two short we got throw it all out the window because insert bad takes bad moments bad politics I just that just seems like a bad way take that actually like a little bit a little bit different and like more personal with it like we have that often with our own audiences and also like to the extent that we have people in certain spaces where they not weaponize audiences but the audiences weaponize themselves against someone that the figure um is is you know antagonizing so like if FD would to say and you've like had like anytime when you have a kafuffle like you have like a cute way I think like there's like a going all the way back um what the girl name kology not even kology um the first long time like this like break bread era long bones oh [ __ ] I forgot about there we go exactly a lot of people did but the thing the reason why is because like with how you did it you just like she's been trying I believe I believe is she um but they've been trying to uh get 100K subscribers or something like that for a long time my favorite shade I've ever given anybody in he say why don't y'all all go follow Jay long bone um I know they really working hard to get that and this is all because they did like a video to you and like it was like a petty but like like benevolent like way of getting it done but you have people that don't do it like that you have people that like would Target or or the audience audiences themselves taking it upon themselves to like Brigade people's comment sections and whatnot and we've I think all here taking the stance just like if we catch anybody inside our communities going out of your way to combat on behalf of us like literally we could pill you like that's not what we do like that's weo Behavior dog you know what listen I think there's is it TJ tj1 or t1j t1j t1j t1j has a video I watched where he talked about um the way like I guess like a consumerism or I don't remember what particular word he he used for it to describe the way that people are looking to their creators or their celebrities or their home whoever to reflect themselves like they and all of their consumption in their product is like you can't have that product because the place there this da da or you can't know this you can't follow this person you can't listen to this song You Can't everything becomes this reflection of I am a bad person I am a good person based on what I consume right and it creates people being [ __ ] hyperfixated on other people and [ __ ] that don't matter as much in like monitoring um others like when I think to myself right like I got messages from people being I swear to God like I could show yall messages people being like Oh you know I love you so much whatever but I've been like I need to know where you stand on insert whatever issue or whatever you or I can't follow you and I just think to myself when I get these mess and I'd be like are you good like like when I like no I swear to God like you know are you good like I like you should not give this much of a [ __ ] what I whether or not I'm not like it's one thing to give a [ __ ] about what you're actively seeing what that person is doing what they're you know how they Harmon but to like be just running around keeping an inventory on whether or not this Creator or this celebrity or this person because that's really what it's about it becomes just like and then you encourage people to be performative you encourage encourage people to to Virtue signal you encourage people to do these things and then you [ __ ] on for it anyway like I've seen you know I've seen it only sparingly so if it's deeper to larger thing I I don't know but I seen like you know the whole celeb block thing I seen people like you know going at lizo on Tik Tok like going at lizo and then when she responds like she responds unlike a lot of the other celebrities that that that they're going at she actually responds felt away about it tried to do something and you just whacking a harder like oh see the fact that you doing any shows you could have done it and you just been performative like the [ __ ] do y'all want from people like and and to me I'm like you're creating an opposite effect you're disincentivizing people to get involved because what happens is if someone talks on one thing and then they're told now if I don't talk about everything else I'm a [ __ ] up person or blah blah blah they say it's a easier life to never acknowledge any of this [ __ ] right and I think like for me personally I understand the arguments especially everything that y'all are saying um especially in terms of people these celebrities coming out to be you know be like oh go vote or do other things but I've always been a person I don't like like celebrity and I feel like maybe because I'm from the Bahamas and for can maybe speak to this there's a celebrity worship that's like the antithesis of Beeman nature like you know what I mean like we be like oh we don't lotion we don't slap up that's not us maybe it's because our prime minister and all our celebrities right there and be is just in you know so when I see this I just think I don't think they should be involved at all like I'm in a I have a work for a nonprofit where we do movements and all these different things and whenever they want to like their focal point there'll be so many people that like want they think the whole movement they think the whole campaign the whole whole thing is going to be getting some celebrity just to cosign or speak to whatever and it nothing NE go so it don't work like that they don't have the impact that you think and I think there also a difference that people never calculate people can have a lot of follow like think about how many celebrities will have a lot of followers because people follow a role they say they're actor people follow a role that they love that they am but then don't go support or look at anything they do in their real like real life or their other things is they're not a fan of the person or invested what they think they're a fan of a character or whatever have you a lot of celebrities don't have the the the the sway and Tate has a lot more of a of an impact on what people think than lizo and that's [ __ ] up and that's sad but it's true you know what I mean in terms of because people it's about what people follow you for like people there are a lot of people who are going to listen to what kadesia says on politics or or or activism whatever have you then before they listen to whatever sing or whoever say it even if more of them follow because they are following you for different reasons so I think there's also this just like this misplaced focus of what numbers and a platform could be and then I see all these people and I think to myself as somebody who was regular nobody I'm literally I came to this country by myself it's me one like I have no status no nothing I don't have no celebrity connections or anything like that but whatever platform I've built or any advocacy that done in real life or being a lawyer is based on the efforts and energies I actively go make and what I care about and when I think of the amount of people that don't put that energy into what it is that they care because they're busy putting it in focusing about whether or not I will speak on something they're already thinking about you're already thinking about it go [ __ ] it you want me to go talk about it for you but qu talk I think I think the only difference is is that when it comes to Palestine or back in the day when it was me too and Harvey Weinstein there was just a culture of silence and people just couldn't say something and we needed somebody to ring the bell you know so people know that it's safe to come out I think a lot of people are afraid of retaliation and blacklisting and it's hard to stand alone you know in an industry that's you know really Zionist and you know was known to you know get people together and take away opportunities you're right sorry yeah harby no you go both sorry um well I just want to say I want to speak to what you just said but then I also want to Circle back to the first thing that you said so I just want to just speak directly to you sister um it's I I reject the notion and I'm saying this because people often critique me in my comments and say that like I'm a Beyonce apologist and well maybe but I want I I reject the notion that Beyonce presents herself as an activist because I see herself I see her as performing and this this is this can be applied to any celebrity I'm just using her as a catalyst for this particular talking point I see her and many celebrities as performing a political perspective or a political or creating political imagery which is not the same right like I said there's an entertainment and performance element and performance is not inherently bad when I think of performance uh when I think of performative activism I think of James Brown who never wanted to sing Say It Loud I'm Black and I'm Proud never wanted to sing that right but he came out and performed that right because that's what people wanted to hear I think his heart wasn't in the right place I think intentionality when we know it because we how are we to know what's going on in these people's minds so when we have access to that information intention is important but I think Beyonce and a lot of these celebrities are a channel for us to really get in line with activism right like she's highlighted chimamanda uh neoi adichi right and she can only do and TS Madison and a bunch of other people she can only do that if she posits this information as cool and popular then then if she fully goes full leftist she loses that element of cool and also I feel like to the last right and to the last thing I'm let you go ahead um I think that people we have to also understand that there is real risk and we understand that but there is real risk associated with speaking out on these large issues think about Earth the kid who spoke out um um fighting for against Vietnam right and how she was she had her her her her cell phone wired by the FBI she was followed you think about Jane Fonda Conor yeah there is real yeah okay Natalie has been like this actually since she was in high school she used to call out [ __ ] as a teenager apparently I know just because you just said it because anytime you bring up like you'll bring up something like that and they're going to be people screaming in in the live chat immediately like yeah see those artists did it right such and such and they'll have a list of people that they only know like generically from the pieces of art that aged well you know that they'll be telling you about in the comments and this this is one thing I don't like I don't like when like one ex like somebody does it right or if somebody is an activist or an Entertainer that does it they become something to condemn others you know what I mean like everybody has to be this and everybody has to be that and I and I resent like the idea that everybody is obligated to be an activist or engage in this life of doing I I don't think so especially people marginalized people who have to live their life in a way that is political and dealing with those burdens whether they want it or not right but more importantly like I do think there's something to to the poit like art or or where you find activism and art or what it does for you like what it does in that it's self being valuable like like beyond the person right cuz people like they love to bring up a Nina Simone when they I have so many [ __ ] Nina Simone comments of people screaming n Simone n Simone n Simone n Simone whenever to like for [ __ ] on be and I'm like Nina Sone was married to a [ __ ] police officer beat the dog [ __ ] out of her child like you don't stop like stop with this [ __ ] deifying the dead and like you know and then like it's it's insane and it's like this idea of there's never going to be this perfect activist or this perfect Advocate or this perfect thinker or this perfect none of them none of them none of us I was telling youall before we started recording I don't agree with perspectives I have [ __ ] put out none is going to be that and it's a waste of of focus like it is a waste of attent and it's not like I'm not going to put it on like our generation or online on the internet this has always been a thing like the black civil rights leaders used to be writing taking shots at each other in essays and books going back and forth this whole like lit lus test and it's just a waste of energy and I think about that all the time because it's like think about how many [ __ ] in the Civil Rights Movement arguing with each other about who's the realest one and who think this and who think that and all the semantics and D Ass diss tracks between uh the boyon Garvey Mal Martin like whole ass long scree like and this [ __ ] [ __ ] like I don't care like like like why why are y'all doing this white wife to the point and to the point qu made right like I do I do understand I understand that like what it must mean especially I think that's a more specific like you in the entertainment industry as an actress like a perspective that we're not hearing or thinking about as much like to the specific of meting these people in the industry that you're in to do that to trying to change the culture of the danger and the backlash it just feel on the industry and I get that that makes that makes a lot a lot of sense but as far as the overall like the culture of Silence around Palestine my entire life this is kind of you know what the way we're responding to to this particular like the culture of Silence around Palestine reminds me a lot of like the people who after like 2020 talk a lot like they just they act like there nothing L's have been taken right Palestine my entire life you could not be Pro Palestine I've never heard a pro Palestine sentiment a [ __ ] place other than hearing somebody was F I swear to my God I would only hear them because I went to uh Islamic school like I grew up Muslim so like that was like the only reason remember learning about 1948 and stuff I had to be in a hush you know what I mean like you didn't even like you didn't even like care about the issue you don't know anything about it like prior to October 7th and this is something that I wish people would take in consideration when they come and you want your faves to talk about something and I saw after you say it too was like part October 7th I don't have any advanced expertise substantive level of knowledge on [ __ ] anything happening over in that area of the world I don't know [ __ ] about it I don't know [ __ ] I don't even know [ __ ] about Nigeria like I don't know [ __ ] about nothing I don't know what's happened to Mom's like I know about what I talk to you about right but I know but I do know this I do know prior to them [ __ ] could not talk about Palestine the only [ __ ] you know that did talk about Palestine is Mark Lamont Hill and exactly we all [ __ ] know it until so no one else did the [ __ ] prior to October 7th there could be no like the way that we are the way the fact that we are stoning people who are not speaking up for Palestine is quite literally a massive change in what has been like the political landscape or whatever our entire life so it's like yes I understand can can I share a little a little moment of Victory so my frat brother came over last night who was just kind of like you're you're very typical moderate person you know what I'm saying he he he's he's good-hearted dude relative you know normal political engagement and you tolerate moderates so much better than me well because you know like I he's my f brother it's my it's my boy you know this be me looking at my friends when they say moderate stuff like like my casual friends when but but but let me tell you though I'm gonna go half half like so we got into politics because you know Trump ass just got uh convicted which is a whole other piece of that's what we need to do next song y anything to get Biden reelected it's wait a minute we we can go there let me finish my point so he he's arguing with another guy who's similarly moderate politics and he's explaining why he's gonna hold his nose while voting for Biden and I was like and even though like there's issues there that in and of itself for normal people is a huge change in like the Dynamics of what is of the Overton window essentially you know what I'm saying I understand that within our comment sections and and our algorithms and our feeds as as the the radical left you know wild people that the that acknowledging that is a win is a faux P but if you're talking about my homeboy from decada who grew up in the church voted for Democrat after Democrat this whole time is just starting is just in the last couple of years unlearning understanding patriarchy you know got his first bill hooks book for me you know saying all that [ __ ] for him to come back and be like yeah it's a genocide going on in Palestine that I'm sorry I know that doesn't satisfy a win I understand win is a win a no see to speak to that point and to bring up something out because earlier you were like you want to talk about the man vers bear thing and I think this is all kind of related because okay I tend to think that a lot of time don't doy every time you tuck behind your I just okay break it down break it way his face just looking so it's because okay here's the thing I understand that a lot of people especially like in leftist spaces for me I've realized it's taken a few years to realize this for me I'm like I feel like a bridge in a leftist space I'm trying to bring people that are Center left of center and radicals together cuz it's a mess over here so to be yes you know and it doesn't seem like because we're not going to agree on everything but let's agree on something goddamn it so for me that's my perspective right I'm like I'm a bridge I feel like that that makes sense to me I've always been this kind of person I can hear a lot of sides and like bring perspectives that people might not want to hear and do it in a funny whatever way right but sometimes I tend to think that on the left we tend to assume people's oppression or people's I don't know how to explain it like people's disenfranchise ment is just a straight line yeah you're at the bottom of the hierarchy and there's no Nuance or anything to your identity there's no there's no way that you could be at this part of this hierarchy and also be causing harm to people and also be we we treat it very laterally in a way and so I hear that when I think about the Celeb thing of like okay we're talking about celebrities but to me yeah I'm interested in them saying things sure but at the end of the day I'm more interested in the people what did Chris Rock say the man who signs o Winfrey's checks is wealthy Oprah's Rich he is wealthy like that is who I'm interested in because we don't know what these people look like and they are the we should have seen through the actor strike through all this stuff most of these actors don't really have money like that right yeah I know actors I know actors that you would have seen in things that you would be like oh maybe it's we're splitting the bill on stuff can can I can I sayat and like timately assuming they know of people you know what hate I hate seeing people just be like this person has nothing to lose D you have no [ __ ] idea what the [ __ ] anybody has to lose or what they have going on in their life and I also hate the like this this this constant um implication that the more you have the less you have to lose I don't know where the internet has come up with that but that is a thought process right um the thing to to what you were saying kadesia about the the bridge building right I understand frustration I understand that like I understand every like people and I think that's people's right to like be angry and or to comment on on feeling like people shouldn't need all these different things to be radicalized or to to get on the right side or I understand that I think you know that commentary is always still valuable what I think is um maybe not the move where I find a little like frustrating is if I had the attitude about like I'm constantly trying to get people on board with like abolition right let's talk abolition I'm way further to the left from the criminal system than most everybody black people include and whatever have you if my attitude was just to [ __ ] beat and I know creators like this and thinkers like this whose attitude is just to be like I know and you don't know so you are a [ __ ] who is not genuine and blah blah blah blah blah and it's just like that even if I feel that way in my heart I find it frustrating that I have to like convince [ __ ] in my mind to to not support a criminal system that is ex like obviously there to hurt us that can be frustrating in my heart and in my private discussions but I know that I am not getting anybody over to that side I'm not bringing anybody if that's the what I publicly put out and I feel like a lot of what I'm seeing especially in the form of the focus on like the celebrity this and d d da it's just like oh you didn't you didn't you weren't radicalized the same moment I was radicalized and I find that very frustrating and disingenuous even from the Pete the loudest voices because again a lot of I know a lot of thinkers a lot of content creators a lot of activists a lot of with people with Pro with platforms who are now beating [ __ ] back in over over uh Palestine who didn't say [ __ ] about pal before it came not not only October 7th before they realized more people were saying it and became more comfortable to talk about it I know this for a fact IAL to these [ __ ] and they wasn't trying to do it and on long before then right and it's like I and I'm not mad at that I understand when people or or the people who just started speaking October 7th because that's when they were radicalized but it's like there are [ __ ] like Mark lonel who been radicalized by Palestine for decades you don't see him being like oh [ __ ] y'all y'all ain't genuine you can't you know what I and I I difference between organizers that follow and people that have just learned about the things because organizers that I follow that been doing this for years have a lot of patience yes patience so grateful they were following it when nobody cared yeah and will be when nobody cares yeah kadesia had the most perfect read in in their response to the man bear stuff at the beginning of it oh here when you were like you were like some of y'all are replacing trying to get sociology to do what therapy needs to do you that up you that right on us but I think she said representation to do what therapy should do but for me I'm saying sociology because you really like this is what I mean I want leftists to adopt not just a theoretical practice but a spiritual mental one too you need to because if you are going around like okay let's just talk about the man vers bear thing because this [ __ ] pisses me off more than anything this is the other problem you have people that claim to be progressives claim to be leftists but don't give a [ __ ] about men at all and are like anytime I say the slight I will drag man all the time oh you put the battery my back the moment I let's go charge let's go oh I'm Ready the minute I try to be even a touch compassionate atten the men that hate it only hear that I'm dragging them and the women that have been hurt by men that I say rightfully have been upset by men we use that as an excuse to go [ __ ] them who cares do y'all not realize little boys and little girls are watching this stuff too little babies are watching this [ __ ] do y'all not care about thank you because I to me it's baffling that I'm like who do you think wins when all y'all are doing is fighting at each other and most of yall are heterosexual real quick real quick I just want to put this last little joke in I knew it was cooked on on femin public publicly facing feminists trying to be in somewhat compassionate for men when oie sunva little 19-year-old uh Canadian Asian oi sunville who was the most polite jiny non-threatening Creator did a video on carsal feminism that eats the video is excellent it's an excellent kind compassionate breakdown of why caral feminism is a problem and they came for her ass like she was Andrew Tay cousin in her comment section I was like y'all gonna do that to y'all they do it they do it to the women and fam of queers of color they really that's why some of them I'm like the white feminism calm it down a lot of you think you're white feminist you need to stop calm it down if you think it's bad if you say something even slightly uh um empathetic about Men Let It Be Black Men Let It Be black men girl I cannot express to you you how sick I am I have had black women in my notifications [ __ ] on black men for like three four weeks they about 100 more comments away from turning me into a red pill [ __ ] like I'm telling you it's in [ __ ] it's like let me just say this there are some there are some there are some black women out there that just [ __ ] despise black men and they're all in my comments okay take it out not just on men but I feel bad for your they hate black men specifically I made a I was on um Tahoe's podcast so Shameless right I have a clip that he posts up where it was like uh I think I was responding to this prompt uh about these black women they're like oh they should date white men white man are the best whatever all this nonsense and I was like or or talking about they she complaining about black men and I was like the problem is with patriarchy is with men in general and what men are men are talk the issue is with men and patriarchy it it's not about black men and specific and like you might you're in community with black men you might be experiencing more that and you're experiencing that from black men but black men are not the main culprits and even worse so black men just oh my God if you the [ __ ] these [ __ ] are saying in my comments go forgive me I'm like black men I'm like white men literally created patriarchy and abuse and this and this and the next thing or whatever like it's white men black men are quite literally the least like the least like of all of these men yo damn my comments I swear I could let me read y'all a comment let me just read it for you because there the only [ __ ] way I have to read and this even one of the wor me I have to just [ __ ] walk someone said to me I look around and I've never seen a mass of black men supporting Progressive things or things that help the black community I said this the most ahistorical [ __ ] I ever seen in my life this is the nuttiest [ __ ] I ever [ __ ] seen in my life this is crazy this is nuts um Let me let me what she said um oh my gosh all right let me read this to y'all I'm sorry I gotta get this because you had a head of sey you gonna be blown away I said oh my God this so this lady she goes white man create black woman white man created the system and benefit from it true but when it comes to dating black women they have cleaned up their act white men there is sorry sorry white men white men white clean up their when it comes to black women it's going to get so [ __ ] crazy Hold On Tight hold on to you see these comments about to get nuts she said they are respectful kind Tre treat us black women very well and they actually marry us I'm not I'm not convinced that's not I'm not convinced real real black woman like like girl that's a white G man that is a white I could see that cuz that happens to me L not what I'm telling you all babes real real black women [ __ ] I have I have like comments literally that says black women that love white men that's the niggaer name in the comment section and they will tell me about how much white men are literally the Sun that signs out like ass like I'm telling you right now I got a keep reading y'all it's so crazy done y'all have not name she loves her white king oh my God that's a white man name she one telling you I let me tell you something as a black woman who a lot of white men have liked and has dated interracially I'd be so blown away seeing these black women who aspire to date white men like romanticize and lie be like oh my God like oh my God heard the [ __ ] from White dat gutter dating experiences of dating white please when when I did the swirl conomics video I was shocked by my research and like I'm go ahead her her was Brave I'm gonna be brave put this oh we're all being brave I love that right you ain't about to say that you internet has uh this thing it does where it collects people and it collects people that probably didn't think they had Community until they got to the internet and then when they get there and they find that Community they have a uh uh an enriching experience that furthers them into whatever their belief system is this could be positive this how my politics evolve foreign I know same experience with him um this is this is this is how I got my homeboy to beat Reed Bill hook so it's a lot of good stuff there but it's also how incels happen it's also how you know January 6 Canadians brought that to you you're welcome didn't even know see but so there but like there there's something that's happening it's a queer woman actually just just just give me all the grace possible here as I say this there's something that's happening with black women and the way the internet is collecting a specific black film experience around the fantasization of white men that is and it's going unchecked and I don't think it's going to destroy the culture or whatever else no but I'm sick of it but it is concerning because when I was doing research wasn't thing like the reason why the reason why all these Tik Tock like every three months have y'all not noticed there's a Tik Tok Trend around black women dating white men every three months y'all give me video ideas hold on challenge shout out to Amanda how do you say Amanda just dropped Amanda Mar just came out with one today and I was like she just did this video three months ago and she said I just did this video months ago hard soft life crazy is statis black women black women and white men are like the least [ __ ] like least least in numbers of interracial couples like white men don't like black women like that is not true and you know what and also this idea of taking white men [ __ ] the occasional black women or dating some black women here and there to mean they like black women or they love or re black some nut [ __ ] I'm like if that's the standard it's crazy for you to act like [ __ ] don't love black women right how come you understand Nuance for all these other reasons why how come the presence of a white man with a black woman is enough for for you to believe a white man suddenly should be like forgiven of all sins all benefits of a doubt oh loves the black woman but not listen I got to read y all the rest of this nut ass comments there's a [ __ ] there a white man that making that comment that like to watch roots for fun tell every is a bot or black fishing I profile if you think I didn't investigate this girl is on Instagram she real like a real black woman looking right at her cish you goofy [ __ ] goober you she said Goofy Goober wait wait wait finish finish finish finish finish she said wait a minute hold on she said they're respectful kind and treat us black women very well and they actually marry us that's my experience my she married that's a lot of black women's experience statistically it's not every white man who I've dated or perused me she meant to say pursued perused me for a date has never asked me what I bring to the table has never called me masculine they call me beautiful compliment compl my eyes my hair one man even complimented my fake nails God but understand what fetishizing means do you understand that so crazy when you watch a you know what I think it's funny to like read black women who hate black men talk about black women from the perspective of a black man that hates black women because it's like only I was just about to say that yes it's only of a brand of black man that'd be like your fake nails yeah this your that's a specific you know what I mean like so why like why interesting phenomenon because it's I've made this comment multiple times in all of my gender-based content the black Manis spere which is a small Niche but very prolific community and a lot of this weird stuff that I'm still trying to figure out that we're talking about now with this ftiz of white men and black women that hate black men they actually have so much Synergy in their politics they have a ton of synergy um they're both antiblack women they're both antiblack men they're both Pro right Supremacy like they they both they tend to be Pro Trump a lot of them um and and and they all hang out here on the internet and argue each other's comment section and they swear that each one of them is the most heinous awful thing to ever exist and they all hate us listen listen you're still trying to read this comment wait I'm gonna listen y'all gonna hear this [ __ ] comment and her reply I I been watching black men fight in my comments for their life for like four weeks against these like and just lose viciously like the comments just lose like I'm telling you so she says every uh she said um but the number one thing they do is they pursue me as a man should I don't have to go chasing after them kicking and screaming like toddler to get their attention by the way it's so crazy this idea she's making that [ __ ] don't pursue GS is so C I'm like girl have you ever been to a gas station I'm like mine will chase you right now white boys are afraid to pursue black women I'm sorry in my experience I have never mind you know what don't get listen don't get me started don't make me tell you about the interracial Chronicles of my early 20s anyway I said I don't have to go chasing after after them kicking and screaming like a toddler to get their attention dating out is good for black women we need to experience this I think it's healthy and wise because diverse options bring Clarity also because we are small people there aren't enough of us to go around so it is in black women's best interest to open our options so a black man responded with one simple question he said um is your husband white do you have a husband she said no stop there all is hat like you have [ __ ] it's a humiliation for white man even have well yes a humiliation go look at go look at the swirl the swirl um video there's a whole community of swirl videos and they're all like Tumblr energy um oh yeah they're the Instagram accounts too you look at one too long bro the way the Instagram was harassing me with those damn videos like D I want a white boyfriend after watching some of these cuz they seem so amazing in these videos crazy like it it's nuts to me because I always wondered like I remember I had a friend who was a [ __ ] right all my 20s I went to law school with him um not not just casually casually a [ __ ] and was like right and like he exclusively dates white man to this day right like and there's a difference between someone who dates white men and someone who exclusiv white right I was someone who was dating white men she exclusively dated white men and the way that [ __ ] saw the world was so crazy to [ __ ] me like when I see these people romanticized and like dating like dating white men or being in interracial relationships you would think that there's nothing that happens in the world like we're just like cartoon characters like you're like a white show where all you do is like go to lunch you know what I mean you have fun you go somewhere and that's it like there's no life like oh they were kind they were good it's like like this nothing you know how much [ __ ] conflict there is in interracial relationships like you know how much conflict there is to navigate how much there is about the world and how many things that happen it's nuts to me when you just keep seeing this like they give these like surface level is just like picture look Tik Tok white man black woman life is good now if I could just in their defense in these women's defense I feel like these black women I feel like these black women lashing out now it's not a onetoone comparison they're lashing out it's it's not a onetoone comparison but me as a as a transom I've been trained to not not even look in a black man's Direction and so have my my like my black Trans like uh friends we all have been trained like these [ __ ] don't [ __ ] with you you know what I mean and so there is like this resentment that that definitely builds up and you have to you know you you have to move past that and move Beyond it but I get it if these women if these CIS women have been you know have been done so wrong that they're lashing out in this way I'm kind of like I I see that here's the thing I want to point out I wantan to I want to say you're absolutely right Quay and that but you know what's interesting I never see any black Trans women being the ones leading these [ __ ] destor hate black women maybe he might have a larger Circle in mind but like that's not who it the majority of who I see doing it and I don't know if you know any of these like diesters mandress types in real life behind the scenes yeah but we're but we're trying like they they are unlearn I've I've unlearned it they are they are unlearning it as well but it's a they unlearn it if they're act actively like online trying to make it popular opinion and leading Comm like as a of course and that's no of course not I get I get it I think there's a different conversation I don't even mean like I don't think black like anybody black woman should be critized for interracial dating or anybody should be criticized for interracial dating like I said I have I think there's a difference between dating interracially like or like being open to date other people and exclusively dating that because your argument is black men are the worst thing to happen like they're never like like the ones who I'm speak I'm speaking about a specific quadrant of women online who are they're not speaking against like patriarchy or misogyny or traditional gender they love that [ __ ] that's one of the main issues with black man is a disgrace unable to embody it like that's what they're like those ones that I'm I'm talking about in specific like and I do think like I want to be careful to make sure to qu's point though I want to make sure it's not coming across like um this is a critique of like black women who date interracially or who might critique black man black man online no no no lots of critiques to be made go critique away crique critique that's not what I mean I just mean these particular CS yeah was the comment was insane [ __ ] like leave these [ __ ] behind a no good Herby okay I'm going to be brave after you what were you going to say um I just feel like [ __ ] Ain't [ __ ] and there's no space here for that to be said like [ __ ] don't be [ __ ] and that's very very important to lead with that because if most black women are dating intra racially and we know not to get too serious but if we know that black women are and native women have some of the highest rates of domestic abuse um obviously there are people who are not experiencing domestic abuse who are experiencing verbal abuse or whatever trauma and toxicity exists in their relationship Dynamic they're more than likely going to experience it at the hands of or the mouth of a black man and so a lot of times well because of patriarchy white supremist capitalist patriarchy and that's that's learned that's a learned behavior right and indoctrinated um ideology however they're experiencing it through a black man so I think this idea of idealizing what you have not experienced in a system where the media is representing these group of people as like hyper romantic and folks who will dot on you right um and because in not just in media in terms of film and television but in terms of marketing and the advertisements that we see of interracial love it always looks like it's done um in in the in the way it's romanticized right and so I think that I I just think that also [ __ ] are not [ __ ] like especially people who are live in urban communities like a lot of times when you're talking about [ __ ] Ain't [ __ ] because they don't have a job or what what you have access to right who it I think it depends on I think we're looking at this from a particular vantage point where we have access to a variety of different people I mean or like of different educational back grounds but I think if you're just if you're experiencing the same kinds of black men and then that imagery and those stereotypes and those archetypes are repeated online and in media then it's just kind of like well yeah the the consensus is I understand how it happens but it's still bad like you know what I'm saying like also I want I want to say you know especially when we talk about like rates abuse and an analysis that I think get left out and should be incorporated especially when we talk about like white men and violence and domestic violences you're always going to see more instances of things with black men because that's what gets criminalized white you know what I mean like white men's rates of domestic violence and abuse of their Partners they do not meet the system the way that we do so that's a really important thing that gets left out of here right so that's one two of course I understand I have all the empathy in the world I am a black woman who is dated black man and i' I've been I've been on the receiv receiving end of domestic violence by black man XYZ right but that being said it becomes a I get it I understand but I think we do still have an obligation to to unpack and make sure that we are you know uh what was ala quote that I'm going to bastardize but you know something to the fact if if your analysis leaves out the oppressors you know what I mean you it'll have you blaming the oppressed for how they respond and that's the thing that I think happens it's like yes I understand that interc communally these are experiences is happening or whatever because that's who we're experienc in it by but if you instead if you continue if our communities continue to like celebrate and reinforce like patriarchy and Hyper masculinity and misogyny and all these different things in general rules and believe in believe in that deeply so you still believe in all the harm you actively want and and are invested in the systems that create the harm that's making you hate the black man but instead of recognizing that it's the system and it's all these different things actually do anything about it you are just now celebrating the people that fed you that system you know and so like while I understand how it happened it's those people who did it so I'm not mad at the black women that are you know or or or black or why how that's happening but it's still bad like it's still it's still bad something to say go ahead Herby s i I also think that white men have access to pering and showing up in a way that ister now we know that we know the structural conditions that make that possible right and that make it so that black men show up in a way that is hyper masculine or or where black women and other people demand that they show up in a way that's hyper masculine right which is restrictive and we need to attack that system and we need to critique that but I also think that in we can do both things at once so we can say that my lived experience is that as a result of these systems because they show up in a way that is toxically masculine and feels harmful to me and white men have a capacity because of their privilege right and because patriarchy is created around them and masculinity moves um at their at their at their or bends at their whim right um I think that both those things are true so when you're when they're idealizing white men who created a structure that is really destructive for all people including black men right um I think they're also speaking to the fact that maybe and I don't know this because I never touched a white man um but maybe they're having a sof experience I've never I don't know about girls but uh so but if if I but here's the thing to kind of so to kind of all right to kind of synthesize let let me let me pull out as as I do this umz somebody some made a comment that I'll be throwing my black wife out on a regular basis to to to ig see CJ every 14 business days like what are you talking about like yes they love to lie on my name but the synthesiz think of where iby and O are kind of meeting and bring it back to kad's recent experience I think one challenge here is this part of the discourse is underdeveloped yes and that's why kadesia got the response they got and that's why Olivia got that response and Olay gets that response and so many uh films specifically so my I I found that as I got more Pro well proman or whatever or empathetic to men's issues I shed maybe about a third of my black my film audience in general right because they wanted me to be a little bit more a little less challenging to the Comfort Zone of how we talk about men and boys yeah um but for and because I'm a male they just kind of quietly left yeah for for films they lash out at y'all because they're so used to not being challenged on that caral mentality on the the the flawed logic behind that and so [ __ ] Ain't [ __ ] I genuinely agree with yes I'm saying it I think I said it in the video I mean I think I say it every other day it's a mantra it might I I think my experien even as a public defender and like especially dealing like representing black men who are in the criminal system and who need to I need to be able to like they need to be able to trust me but I also need to be able to advise look at my dark skinned black family no look at my [ __ ] hair my man got I find that people you can critique people's behavior if you first you first at least acknowledge or validate the validity in their feelings right like I know had a lot man a black man that I have represented that other people have found to be such problem clients or they can't deal with them or they can't or they get rearrested all these different things that I have had a great time with just because the virtue of me understanding like you're feeling like I understand why you were mad I understand why you why you felt this way and D you still can't do do this thing but even the understanding is more than they receive and I think a lot of I'm not speaking for listen I want to be clear [ __ ] get on my [ __ ] nerves too they're all kind of [ __ ] on my comments like mad at me for defending them because patriarchy is good patriarchy is not giv that like so don't don't get me started I never get like it's not like defending a black man ever earns me any black male support it never does online so I'm just getting [ __ ] on by black women and [ __ ] on by black men so I'm not saying I don't understand I know y'all are coming across a lot of ignant [ __ ] online every [ __ ] day so I am not I'm not Tak from that but I'm just trying to speak to an average black man or a black man that I know because not for nothing I hate that it's become this popular opinion or like the popular opinion that black you see expressed by black women online is this idea that like there are no good or Progressive black men or black Mas def like they are this like they're all like more often than not and that's not my life experience I know a lot of black men yes that are problematic and this and this and the next thing but I know a lot who aren't and and the same way the black woman to me isn't I don't I'm not forced to represent black women as their worst selves no one my audience does not expect me to show up and make black women like the black woman in my mind that I speak to and about as the worst example of black women right no one expects me to like treat the black woman archetype that I'm talking about as a dester or a mandress or whatever have you right but I'm expected to treat black men or talk about black men in the worst way or the worst presumption or the worst average and I think I just find that a lot of more people and a lot more black men are receptive to critiques on uh misogyny or critiques on on on on on their behavior patriarch all these different things if you at least first acknowledge the s that that's the system they were forced in or that's the system that they have to navigate or that's what they're there and I think so often everybody wants to like fight past that first point like it's just let's have the critique of [ __ ] but we don't want to have it's usually so divorced from any critique of the system it's the simp that's the thing it's like you're talking about the symptom and not the disease and I'm like it's the same thing of like focusing on the celebrity and not the thing behind it I'm like we can have these conversations and again validate your feelings because the first thing I'm going say to a woman is yeah I get it my earliest memories I used to be scared of walking down the street with a group of black guys because they were the ones that would always make fun of me for being dark skinned and ugly like that was the first thing I never thought that I would ever be attracted or attractive to black men growing up it wasn't until I went to Gambia and had a different experience with that because that's also the thing right Herby I think you were talking about it of like some of us have the advantage of having different experiences I got that experience as a teenager because I was in Canada I was invisible to white people like there were white what no and then also being made fun of hypervisible to black people because they were making fun of me so I just felt like okay well what the [ __ ] am I supposed to be doing and then I go to a place where Blackness is it's a repeated exposure you see black people that look like me all the time so there isn't a oh my God like you're so different looking it's just a oh I can actually be measured now I call it situational pretty privilege right depending on where you live in a certain part of the world and all of a sudden you're beauti but then you go somewhere else and people are not checking for you or they think you're hideous yeah if I do have that experience and then get older and like you have a bit of a blow up and you know was able to like date people of all different types of backgrounds because like for me anytime my friends are like oh what's your type it's like actually you don't have one because I kind of date whoever yeah pansexual all the things right but like being able to date so many different people and I'm talking about in a dating sense because I think a lot of these women are talking about it in a dating sense not that that's the only way that patriarchy has negatively affected them but that's the main way it tends to show up online with dating and romance and stuff it's why those swirl videos are so popular it's why they're leading with well a white man would treat me better first white guy dated for a long time the way he talked about Asian women and how he just thought that they were so submissive and like his Uncle had Asian like they tell you they tell you they tell on themselves every like you know what I hate especially when they say this oh my God like that was like oh they love our here and they love our this like get the [ __ ] out hair they do I oh my God I remember like like dating the white guy and asking him like which of my hairstyles were like his favorite or something like that what he would like or something and he was like he was like oh everything but and he chose two pictures where and one was band to kns and the other was my natural hair I that comes out of your head wait a minute yo like yo I and we don't really talk about the futurism part of it too because I like there if you look at this boo right here right here fear in the black body you will have European white Europeans talking about sagales women being attractive simply more attractive than other African women simply because their features are closer to black to white Europeans it's just their complexion is darker I have had white men like me and then tell me that like oh I'm so like they find me so pretty cuz my features aren't so black like they like my yeah or whatever yeah all these I just thank you that right there yeah both beautiful but a hierarchy and yeah and I know lots of black women in great interracial relationships with unpro problematic white men who love them you know I even have I like so you know it's not everybody it's not things just just this idea that like it's just the romanti that's just so [ __ ] I think I think that I think that people are just to go I don't know where this was in the conversation where this thought popped in my head but I think that a lot of times when black women are saying what they're saying I think a lot of people are just paring feminist Theory and have never engaged with any feminists actually and so what they're talking about they're just reciting talking points they and and attaching that to their emotion but that's not even the point that I really wanted to make I just wanted to say that the point I wanted to make was that I'm not sure you said this and it struck me um Olay and I was I I've been sitting on my hand because I'm not sure that black men are more Progressive in my experience that's anecdotal but are more Progressive in terms of because I just don't think they have the space to be I'm someone who actually believes that someone I mean a lot of you you proba you guys all probably believe it you can't be homophobic and not be a misogynist right um and so you can't be transphobic and not be and and be so I think that a lot of times in my experience um I think that they don't have the space I don't think that they have the space to be because I think that this is a more of a sis hat perspective that you introduced I don't think that they have the space to be Progressive because what does it look like and this again my experience and and I'm not saying Progressive I want to be clear I'm not saying saying they're scathing indictment of men and people just like they miss it because I'm saying that black men aren't the worst right like I'm not like or black men aren't the worst offenders of this like if you look at globally look at the world whatever have you right I do think there's I think multiple things are happening because when I think about like uh kadesia describing their childhood uh or growing up and like how you being received as beautiful or not or color is and all these different things right like in a Bahamas Bahamas is a colorist ass [ __ ] place right so I was dark skinned I'm African as far as they're concerned because my name is African or whatever have you and so not attractive to them right growing up but I guess because I was in a black nation like everybody is black that I never took this or I didn't it didn't register to me as black men you know what I mean or even May or or I'm more so or or a black man or even about the black woman but how black people it was always a a my my mommy's lightskinned and so my mommy kind of was my mommy's lightskinn and and and and woke so she jumped she jumped my mommy told me they were going to do it to me as a little kid before it happened so my mommy was there already telling me and she'd already put it on beh hamans have this this inferiority complex mindset so I always had this knowledge of like colorism and how it affects us and how it thus affects how I'm perceived and beautiful L and the next thing um so I think that kind of shapes it a little different and then going to America I think what is often happening too if you're only like in America or in a country that's a white country right you're dealing with black people in groups or Pockets where they're not normally like the majority they're there you're in a smaller like a subset um black community and so that can become like this is what black people are on you know what I mean and the white people that are usually in your communities are not necessarily as representative I think of all the white people like when I think of like especially like white people I know now I know a lot of progressive new yorky white type white people or like my white nonprofit white people but I think of when I was around just white people like in Florida and West Virginia and Ohio and Kentucky and no how those white people really move yeah not the [ __ ] hipster in Williamsburg that you go out with or whatever and how they think and how they move but Your Average White Bear you know what I mean and how they and that's that's I guess who I'm Who I'm thinking of or how I'm seeing it I think that's um sorry no if I could if I could jump in I think so I think Herby uh is correct is correct um I've heard um what's the sister's name she started this bread sup [ __ ] and this the [ __ ] thing she did Lindsay Ellis no the black one did it no no black one she actually is black the one trans black cat black thank you yeah love um cause she's also said this uh I think iby hits a important point that black men historically have not been allowed to for insert multitude of mechanisms to show up in a certain way when it comes to gender which precludes itself to misogyny homophobia transphobia Etc um and so the I think the the challenge though is the is what Olay is getting at which is the hyper visibility of it which is if we want to present an understanding an imagery of transphobia we do want to find the black man first we want we we want to Frontline Dave Chappelle you know what I'm saying as opposed to to looking at the large scale um completely wh supported Republican platform towards transitions right and that becomes this ebb and flow where we want to be critical of the obvious and directly to people's lived experience challenges that sis head black men specifically present to a multitude of people specifically in this case um uh lgbtq people but we also want to be critical of how that in up becoming this manufactured consent against black men as a whole where we lose track of the classic challenge I often put out there because it's an easy one to prove is this idea that black men are so much in support of the Republican party that I've had to disprove on multiple occasions that has been right and and it's been front lined so much in our media that people think it's true and you look at the data black men are like 30 percentage points Beyond any other group of men in in the country in terms of like not supporting the Republican party but because that is a talking point among that is accepted this the key thing because there a talking point that's accepted within left leaning spaces and is uncritically not challenged um it is uh not challenged or it's uncritically accepted whatever it becomes this way to subterfuge in these antiblack discourses and it's hard to challenge it because to challenge that I then have to challenge the lived experience of Herby Rebels who has EXP erience um homophobia from black men and rejection from black men Etc and so it's just like juggling two bombs from my perspective so so yeah I want to just so just really quickly so um I am uh Haitian Jamaican American my father was born in Haiti my mother was mother was born here but she's uh she's Jamaican um and you don't know what you've done you just alerted a whole Community to be on your ass like don't tell them you have something else they show up every Sunday at 1 p.m. to let me know they hate me because because you're you're not African-American I'm not black I'm not black I grew up in Georgia but I'm not black all it's like a lot it's like a lot I mean literally whatever like girl please but and I saided to say so for like my my like middle school and prior to that was all like predominantly black schools and then for high school and college I went to predominantly white schools so I've been in spaces where there where I went to a school of almost 2,000 students and there's only 30 black kids right um and so and they are all different kinds of white students because it's a Catholic School right so they're conservative right um and this it was public black schools so I feel like I've experienced a myriad of different types of people and in my experience and I think in the experience of many black queer folks and I think that it's very it's really good to use us as maybe like a different because it's beyond just how they respond to queerness black men I'm I'm just I'm discussing it's it's how they also respond or or like what space they're given to do manhood differently it does come in what we're discussing is who has the privilege to show up and repres a kind of progressive politic um whether or not that's how they actually think but maybe that's what they're representing and and and I'm not going to be the person that's like white people have been so kind to me and black people have been bullies cuz that is not the T um that's not my lived experience but I'm saying I'm saying all of you [ __ ] are most of you [ __ ] get on my nerves um white black and indifferent but what I'm saying is I don't subscribe to the notion that black men are more Progressive because in my experience I don't think that I don't think it's because of lack of wanting to I just don't think that have the space to show up in a way that or more did I say progressive um in a way that's more Progressive because they they lose manhood points for um for for supporting career folk or supporting trans folk or supporting women in a way that maybe white men are allowed to do um like defy patriarchy access to economic structures that white is so wow I'm sorry I oh go after you well no like everybody just hit on something that's so wild that I've witnessed that I've even had discussions with other white you know progressives around which is like the patriarchal feminism of white men how like as soon as a white man you know uh post uh you know the Instagram infographic about feminism he gets front lined to the for for of feminism all while doing all the patriarchy behind behind the streets uh Josh Weeden is a perfect example of this Josh Weeden was a um was a not I won't say iconic but he was very much front lined as this Progressive uh icon of of white masculinity and like behind the scenes was was sexually harassing people I call it nice guy feminism yes us the the last thing the the leader of masculinity studies I can't remember his name right now and I've quoted his book on multiple occasions because it's good [ __ ] Curry but he's one of the he literally founded the Journal of masculinity it's Curry not Curry no this is white dude what's I can't remember his name it's a lot of uh but he he a lot of these [ __ ] um he got me toed and he's the leader of male feminism it's like I'm I first of all I fully get that like I understand that like there is there is an experience of qu folk that I just am not going to have you know what I mean like I'm not going to have I could only imagine like I know when I go to Bas the homophobia be [ __ ] killing me and I am a like I a sad person so I can't imagine when you say you Haitian Jamaican H your life is rough that sound rough I I I can't I can't get in that I am sure you're that's [ __ ] ballad I understand that point you're making I ain't got nothing for that I can yeah this is why I say [ __ ] Ain't [ __ ] yeah I get that no I I can't touch on that my my friend who um who is also in I want him in Quad too but I gotta get him uh Prince Shakur has a a YouTube channel and also has a book and he's Jamaican um Jamaican American and he has literally his Memoir is talking about the experience of being a qu man and growing up with a Jamaican family and stuff so anyway that's a trauma I can't speak too I I know I know I understand I the guy's name was Michael Kimmel real quick he was was the literally over the Journal of masculinities until he's founded it in like 2001 it was the biggest thing ever in sociology and then got Meed in 2013 right as I was finishing my goddamn thesis and I had to rewrite half of it to acknowledge um to a I couldn't get rid of it because it was a foundation of my [ __ ] research but I had to rewrite half my damn thesis to account for it to account for it um um yeah so what I was GNA say is I think it's interesting you know you saying like I don't feel like black men have this to be the most Progressive because I don't think black men have the space to be the most to be the the worst offenders of patriarchy they don't like I just or to me like that's what when I think of the worst aspects the larger system and when I think of a global Vis and with patriarchy uh and and the amount of the I guess the outs spray of violence to that misogyny and all the different different things that come from it black people don't I black men don't have to me the mechanics the space to be they're not at the top you know what I mean they're fighting yes you're right there's a way that they show up in our communities and having to try to like fight to embody something that wasn't meant to to incorporate them or that is meant to make them fall short right the idea behind patriarchy and all this the traditional what we are thinking of uh this white system is meant to exclude a black man and that's why all the other systems are set up to make sure that black man cannot reach or attain the things that would allow them to be valuable um or be seen as the true man or whatever in the eyes of patriarchy and that's why for me when I hear the complaint like a lot of what is is a lot of the things that we use to cite why our exper our experiences with black men or why black men are are the worst offenders to us especially because that's who the we live in communities with black men that's what we're dating that's what we're experiencing I cannot for me not know that the reason why and the things and where that comes from and all the Notions when you hear that all directly connects right back to trying to be a player fighting tooth and nail to try to like appease the system and be a player in that and not having the tools to do that and when I think of the worst it's like yeah like to the nice guy feminism all these things it's like yeah black people black people especially I you know because I know black people I'm seeing a lot of overt homophobia or overt things and these things that seem crazy than what I'm seeing from maybe the average white person I'm dealing with but the con the private conversations of white people or the quiet you know what I mean or or what they simply do like they don't they don't got to be uh homophobic towards you to for you to experience their overt homophobia when they kept you out the [ __ ] room all together you know what I mean when they so I think of things like that I have a question then uh for the group uh this might move us into another topic but it's related so that if we're going to talk about you know like okay the amount of down low men in the music industry the way Herby don't Hur me because I looked at you immediately when I said it wait hold on I just watch R video about bust the Rhymes today because the way hold up thank you I have screenshots the way he is commenting on did's post the way Buster rymes comments on everything Diddy has posted from since Cassie father lawsuit before girl somebody needs to look into it right K in mouth already look into anyway but if we're talking about uh overarching system right and the music industry you know if we're gonna talk about Clive Owens because his people need to look into him more he recently a few years ago came out as bisexual but people often speculate that because he was Diddy's men Mentor he was the one who taught Diddy how to be he groomed Diddy allegedly allegedly don't don't do me groomed Diddy and didd he learned a lot of his practices for how to groom other artists in the industry from him if we're gonna talk about this overarching thing of like they don't let you in the space but then lowkey secretly a lot of people are queer or a lot of men are down low I don't really know what my question is more so I just bringing this up because no because on my mind okay I have on a r November look at forign face you just you just introduced me to information that I didn't need to know but now that I know I have once you start going down the rabbit hole bro like that's why some of the stuff that's coming out a lot of like YouTubers have been talking about this for a while now especially talking about the music industry but sorry go ahead so I I will say that hip hop [Music] uniquely is built upon like a black a masculine black aesthetic um like you know there's a lot of other people that contributed to hip-hop and origins of hip-hop but hip-hop as it exists today was built off of [ __ ] exaggerated black SWAT yeah you know what I'm saying um and so the problem with that is that that is not open to queer soft film anything and uh [ __ ] have never not been and [ __ ] in their personal life have never not been so against that other than it's wrong you see what I'm saying so the the do stuff is it's probably a huge thing that just doesn't get discussed because just statistically you even go let's go to football and I remember a couple of years ago there was a football player the black football player that came out as gay I don't remember his name um Sam Sam something you right he did somebody I know he never made it to the league he never made it to the league and he he damn sure could have been in the league but as soon as they caught wind that they [ __ ] rburg and and um rapist right rapistberger and uh D the Browns are both in the league all these other dudes in the league they're not distractions but this one dude could not get in the league the only and the only openly G football player historically was a white dude that came out from the Raiders Sam hbert I think was his name that played for the Raiders a couple of years ago that's the only one and he was a trump voter so that just speaks to like this like the weird dichotomy that black men have toward any form of queerness softness etc etc where to indulge in that is to risk being seen in the way you want to the world to understand you um um and and like the part that like I just want to really quickly touch on before I got to do Dy foreign things is like especially in the case of the fact that we it's not only that like we have to perform this archaic ideology of like patriarchal masculinity but we are not seen as men like period we are not men the biggest mistake that you can make as a black man is to think that you are a man because that has very delerious consequences for you and we see it every time when you lash out against the system you don't have the full range Mo motion if you ever had an injury like you understand like if you get a shoulder injury if your shoulder could go all the way back here after the shoulder injury is right here black men are injured we only got about like right here and anytime like when you see a black man betraying um the the patriarchal masculinity and the embodiment of that he is making a fatal risk upon himself to do such and he will do as o was saying even though like it does not serve us he will do that unself serving thing like harming a black woman even though that's probably your biggest Ally in this game of white supremacy or or more importantly like trying to embody um performances of masculinity that just won't work for you it's almost like willing like wearing like a ill-fitting like suit like it just won't fit for you basically we will still do that if that means but aity of privilege or or patriarchal points because it is the safest thing that we could do which is literally trying to throw one person or one experience under the bus in order to bolster ours and that has historically been and can I say something I just thought of that I'm sure it's G to be is G is going to shake the Room it just occurred to me right to her's um you know I don't think the black man is is the most Progressive you know what I find interesting whenever you bring up black men any argument like that right like people would they don't even allow you to make an argument on based on like how black men Vote or that they majority of black men vote for Democrat or anything like that right and I understand that more in our like leftist baces that don't see democra whatever but this is just in general they dismiss that as a calculus right like the fact that every other Dem racial demographic of men in this country like way less like black men vote like 90 something percent up there right but the but the argument for why black women are progressive is always around voting for Democrats or being Progressive in that sense that's the exact argument and no one [ __ ] dismisses it and what I find interesting is when we're talking about like it's this argument that becomes black men of the worst or because of how black men are are are like embodying this masculinity and his patriarchy and this this but black women go [ __ ] up black women in real life not the black women online not black women no no no black women in real life our black mothers our black teacher our black women teachers black women go up from misogyny and patriarchy and gender roles and all those different things and somehow that's not weaponized against the black women in terms of our perception or us as Progressive or the way that we care and rally for change but it is against the black man and I find that curious because my entire life I know n black communities got a black family Blackness I ain't never been in a room of black man of black people being problematic and black women wasn't present you know what I mean like I it never been never been the case so that's the thing like it yeah well I I think that the Benchmark for Progressive or our Benchmark is different I'm not using voting for Democrats as I know right um I that's not what you're saying but I'm saying I think my Benchmark for Progressive does for me I mean anecdotally and selfishly it starts at queerness but I think queerness tackles as a black queer um non-binary person I think it tackles so many IDE you have to Grapple with so many different ideas um and you have to be you have to be open to so many different ideas of empathy Progressive thought in order to be comfortable or even tolerant of these different human beings experiences and identities that that is my starting point for Progressive but I did want to speak to the D thing um I think that um straight men well straight men if straight men stop fixating and we're talking about black straight men because we're talking about overwhelmingly because we're talking about hip-hop culture if they stopped fixating on gay men's sex life um and were vocal about not giving a [ __ ] about you know gay men's sex life because there is a hyper fixation immediately when I walk into a space it's I'm not a person I'm a sexual object to the men who claim to hate What I Do privately right um and so I think that's a f tool in eradicating DL culture but I think also if CIS women begin to identify and publicly speak that that they see they see trans women as women um then that too also becomes because straight men are already doing it right these these DL straight men are already identifying these women as women they're just not saying it to you right and so if straight women if straight I feel like if CIS women came out more publicly and vocally about well yeah that is my sister I do see her as a woman because you just like you got eyes I got eyes then I think that those two things are really Paramount in terms of moving the needle they roll up let because let's talk about I have a video on my page called how transphobia hurts uh black women right like talking about like a whole y'all don't know how many transphobic black women I have blocked from my comments and social media because I have a lot like I go out of my way to like I have multiple interviews with different pla trans women on my page I have gone up on so many differenta uh uh occasions so I have this fight a lot and you know who who like a dirty dog talk about and to me black women in the comments acting like black like trans women they act like black Trans women came to destroy them I just and I just need us to like not be left out of the like we need to be as we are nailing these black men to the cross for their bigotry and their like homophobia and their transphobia we need to acknowledge that black women are part of the party too there's just a way that black men are allowed to demonstrate their yeah men's men's bigotry can be dangerous physically dangerous and that's what makes it different right like a lot of times we're talking about there are like trans women especially black Trans women are being killed you seeing so and you so you are seeing the violent and often Again by the men or whatever so you are seeing that violence and you're seeing this and you're seeing the way that they talk about and all this and so it's so it's so extreme that you forget to realize that blacks black CIS women are saying the same [ __ ] differently quietly embedding raising to their kids like yeah if I can of course we need you this is your the FL I and I'm not trying to uh vir to signal to anyone or anything I think I've just been really lucky like it maybe because I past I don't know I I haven't had these type of experiences with black women but or black sis women but I guess uh I just create like you know really Progressive and accepting spaces for myself but I mean I hear about it I mean I do hear about it and I see it but it's never my experience like my experience and the and the trans when I know it's the it's it's it's it's our black men that you know we we love and we we want to love but that is that that really is the focus I because I think where we are is like how do we mitigate violence like actual like you know I think violence is breeded by the rationale that justifies it like men are taught to act out violence that V especially in the case of black men like act B Hook talks about this acting out in aggression and violence is the only way that they're allowed to demonstrate masculinity right but like what you deter like what you determined to be violent about has everything to do with what you are being taught what you believe in what you're invested in and so it's like yeah I know I come from a I know I know I have black women friends who every reason would lead you to falsely believe that they are not homophobic or transphobic or bigoted you they have the occasional queer friend you see them there in spaces they blah blah blah talk to them [ __ ] privately boyfriends to the look what they teach their kids what they're teaching in community with they I swear to God what they're teaching their nieces their nephews like you would never see it or hear it or you know what I mean in this larger sense but I know it privately because it's the same way as like I guess it's you know when when when a white person decides they like you they close enough with you and then they tell you um you know what I mean and you find out but like you otherwise don't know it's like I know what sis hat black women are saying when when when trans black women and queer people are not around and it's that to grow up and stomp you out like and there's more there's more Kisha because I spoke about this on my patreon I didn't speak about it publicly because I just didn't want to have to get into the things but there are more Kisha in the world than there are um than there are people who are like like accomplices not just allies but accompli to an ending queer phobia right because I was at the Glad honors when I watched Kisha p through for all of four minutes for all of why did they have her there I amiss hey sorry y' who Kish what what happened young Miami young Miami oh okay I was so sh was I was like did this's daughter that daughter I was so shook I was like did Herby just like call all black woman Kisha are we doing that wait a minute hold on I I forgot now I'm calling black wom kishu on oay in but what what do she do what did she do all on line black women are nowas thank you Herby you coined that go ahead you're welcome it's the gift a g so essentially the reason why the girls are upset with her is because um there was an interview she did years ago on The Breakfast Club where she said if her son was gay she would be him right um and then very recently the usual then very recently she was at glad honors and the Glad Awards which are in celebration right and she doubled down she doubled down so why they bring the Glad Awards right and because because she needed a photo op for her merch is her bestie so she automatically she knows one but glad that it's supposed to represent in this space and I deal with glad a lot they're supposed to you know have great representations of gay and lesbian people in the in the in in the industry they put her on their red carpet and gave her this platform at post all the D pink Powderpuff [ __ ] my issue is not so much that she was there the [ __ ] looked sickening when she walked through she was she looked over and one thing about me and and the girls when when a woman looking over all all sins can be washed away by a sicking silhouette I I just got to be honest however can do both I feel like it's important to do both I am goog right now her and then Googling what she said thank you um well so I mean I think I wouldn't have been upset with that if that was if she came in and she took the mic um and and she publicly apologized and she said that all of the proceeds from this gay merch that she's producing is going to a local um queer um organization in Miami in Florida where they really need it right glad has Bountiful income sources I don't think they need whatever little money she's getting from this gay merch cuz I'm not buying it the the realy is she's just trying to get the girls to save her dying career and one thing about the gays I hat it they will we will fall for it I was going to say we need more standards but it's a Good's I think there's a very there's two things that go on I think one black people I'm I'm gonna give this to you Quay and then set my ass out my my assist off in a second but I was going to say black people have a very because are like a non-apology like in community like think about your parents being wrong to you and then just being like I'm going to go buy you some you want something to eat or whatever have you I think there there and so there's a way that we accept that even from our face that problematic thing but you ain't said nothing and you seem like you're being nice so it's okay and then also like a notion of and also we all know the larger society of acting like you have a friend like it's like white people in a white friend like you have a friend so now you are an ally um and what's your friend's politic what's your gay friend's politic let's wake that up act like queer folks are not problem s real problematic if I'm not mistaken but I will still s Material Girl I'm sorry I'm sorry you see I'm part of the problem no that's no Embrace that Duality it's it I think it's so important not to get us away from the top of the hand but it's so important to to love the thing if that's what it genuinely made you feel yeah you know what I'm saying like if it not the art over the artist I know love the sin hate The Sinner is that what we're do is it the other way is reverse I think that oh my God I I gotta give this to qu because I went y to go back in a b f got me off topic too because I think about this in terms of like let me R Kelly right what made me not listen to R Kelly music is not um was not the original moral condemnation though I had it it was because the the framers of of that movement who let us know like explicitly told me like this nigga's using all the money that he makes from this music to like run this Enterprise like I realized when I was watching survive in R Kelly I was like oh I'm fun I am funding this I was like oh and so like to me that's the thing that made it you know like a thing right but like generally I do think you are able to like appreciate some art or appreciate or whatever if you find it valuable and like still critique the person or not really [ __ ] with just there are levels you know what I mean like I'm like now if I get a whiff if I get a whiff an idea that my money is being going to towards or my support is somehow helping you hem people up or be on some extreme [ __ ] [ __ ] but also your art is not yours then your art is not yours once you create it it's now the Pu hate myb in the public I hate when they start [ __ ] on my [ __ ] that I like your mouth it doesn't belong to you I hate it like when it comes I don't like that background song I really like it I put a lot of work into that score I [ __ ] you're on my nerves I think kind of goe don't go no what I was saying was so unserious kadisha was like once you use your mouth it's not yours and I just like your mouth don't do me I I think that kind of goes back to what you were saying like how you have fans who will like message you and be like where do you stand on this and I know like my one of my uh trans girlfriend's Robin she is really selected with who she follows on YouTube because she doesn't want to follow people who maybe you know harboring transphobia uh or you know just different things like that because she doesn't want to like you know build up their platforms and and be involved in like the the hate that they'll you know disate into the world and that's valid and and and that is really and don't get me wrong I did it too if I if I PE like um I don't really no I think you not really F Nas or whatever d d da or I think it's this I'm not gonna [ __ ] with you either but I'm not gonna message you like hey hey right quick like right I wanted to add quickly though going back to the point I made a video about DL dudes and I asked a question would you a bisexual man because to me I'm sorry but those are those are going to be at the top of my list if I'm going date a CIS man he's got to be bisexual because there's something that happens when you talk to a man that has slept with other men they get it the men that I have that have been like yo that that discover their bisexuality in their 20s and 30s will be like oh my God the way some do they're aggressive I'm like the the arm line like if a guy has only slept with women and then starts sleeping with men the difference he notices as and this is anecdotal anecdotal but for me it it was so obvious I was just like yeah I would much rather date a man that is que a little whatever yeah but still having those conversations comments women would still be like I don't know there's just something that just doesn't feel right there's just so your at least they're being honest what I [ __ ] hate was how an inse to this day [ __ ] is ston in Molly as though the average sis head black woman you know real life [ __ ] cut off her left leg before she dided a bisexual man why you [ __ ] stoning Molly when you know you [ __ ] performative ass [ __ ] like I being honest butong I'm not saying they're right but it's like you liar like you can't even have a real it if y'all are all pretending to believe in the in the right side of History you're not on the right side we're not there yet I know that black women on average s head black women are not there I know it in real life I don't know one of them saying that [ __ ] but online they be there yeah that said I I would I have you know an an excellent point someone once made this point to me what someone was someone was like oh I would never date bisexual men or whatever and someone was someone quot tweeted like how you know you have it you know what I mean and my comment saying that too like a lot of y'all are in here acting like you you are not dating men that just won't tell you something but what Herby was saying of like how women as well and I think Olay you were saying this too how if we keep making it a big deal it's going to keep being a big deal to these CIS men as opposed to it actually doesn't matter why does it matter and that's why it's important to not leave us out of the conversation like when we talk about like how these things happen and what's fuel this and all of that that like it has to be like a totality look let me y'all want to know I did so the man I the first man I dated that was bisexual did not tell me in fact he actively told me not that like lady doth protests too much do like and it was crazy it how he told me he told me twice he told me twice but he didn't tell me the first time he told me enough to know that's obviously what you must be telling me but he didn't tell me I'll tell you exactly how I found out after I want to be clear he explicitly he didn't have to we could have just said he was bisexual for he went out of his way like man on day nap like straight on app straight bio straight convers like going out of his way one day this for my first year of law school I'm in the cafeteria I text him like hey you want to go to the movies to see The Jungle Book movie and he said do you want to have a threesome with a guy with a big [ __ ] okay I'm sorry I'm sorry actually I texted the wrong person ma'am this is this is an AR this is so so was he White well I don't it's is I so tell me if I'm [ __ ] up when I hear [ __ ] I immediately think white men that's what okay it is it was a white man it was a white man and then like so he didn't tell me and then and then we stopped talking I didn't respond not you because I'm because I asked you to see the J you know them a request to go watch The Jungle Book is and you responded with a whoa so I stopped talking and then like months later mon later I'm like he like reaches out to me like we're cool at this point I'm dating someone else and he's dating this girl and so um I can't remember why like why I saw him and he was talking to me but this how he was talking he was like oh he was telling me how he was dating the girl that he was dating when he was dating me but the way he did it he was like he was like yeah after he goes he was like yeah so yeah know when I was dating you I was like dating you like Alyssa Jessica Mark and I was like it was Brenda Leticia Sean like imagine you Just sh cuz a [ __ ] lied to you but you want to you don't want to know one to get the wrong idea about your politics now listen listen hey this piss me the [ __ ] off but not in that specific way so that you don't misunderstand why I stand on these issues however F you though for real this is exactly how it went this exactly how it went so he just says that and he continues on talking and I go Mark and he was like he I was like are you bisexual and he was like he was like yes yes yes I didn't tell you that I was like no you didn't tell me that and he continued talking and I just was like I think but you know what actually that might have been the most uh not heterosexual but heterosexual male thing that he could have done not disclose something important when let me let me be brave as well and I don't think that's important though it's not that important but I mean like not tell not telling you something if he's gonna ask you to have a threesome it's not that's important but it's that you think it is so you conceal it like and he did because and he did like we end up he you actively thought you thought there's a chance I might not date you like with this information or I might not you and so you are not telling me that so I can't make the decision on that information mind you I don't have the problem with it but that was the goal the goal is that he was actively deceitful about and you know what's funny too I want to be clear he for the rest of Eternity like once I think I just didn't want to date him like in life he just started like pretending like it never happened like like I don't know he's bisexual just started like switch to like full sis hat performance and like talking about women that's money I was like to the only time the internet has ever been mad at me I am very like I'm I'm Pro deceit I I I personally call no I personally am you know out and open of course but I totally get it like you know there are so many transom and I know and I've done it you know before as well where it's like I don't you know yeah I'm tell tell a guy I'll I'll tell them if I want to you know I'm I'm I'm mixed on it so I I I I think I'm in a I don't know if I'm mixed I don't know if that's what I I can just tell you from the [ __ ] I've heard just like oay was saying when you when you're in those Pockets the things you hear will tell you the truth about certain people who even their politics might say otherwise y like imagine being in the pockets when [ __ ] already you know they ain't got them politics so like corre I I think I think I'm Pro deceit as well for whatever that's work dece because especi especially for like trans women and like like women in general especially like women in general but like this six foot4 big ass football player body [ __ ] lying to me is crazy like what I was gonna do to you like also maybe it's not lying go ahead I don't maybe it's not lying I just think that um you don't owe anybody that information period like he didn't owe you to not not just you anybody bisexual men or any human being doesn't owe you how they identify whatever that may be like I I don't I don't think anybody is any other human being is owed information about your yeah your your gender orientation your sexual proclivity like that's your body who do enter relationships with people I think you don't owe people out in the world I don't think you owe people out in the world you don't owe people anything but I do think if you go and enter a relationship with people I think you why well I think there's something to knowing your partner why slightly disagree but the reason that I would say that is because I lead with my stuff right and I know for some people it's safer than others right I know for some people it's more safe to lead with that than others but I'm just a very like transparent person in general I'm just like if you trust me for me it's like if you trust me enough to let me see your orices then you should trust me enough to tell me whatever yeah I said it orphosis Oris oh my God that is the dest word I feel I feel stressed right but this is part of the thing that I get upset about when I'm dating people in general is like you don't like you don't know me right so you don't have to trust me immediately especially if it's something sensitive information that is fair like I'm hoping that you trust me enough eventually to tell me whatever blah blah BL blah blah if I'm dating you to know you I want to know you if I want to know your favorite pizza topping I also want to know if you like to sleep with other people like to me that's just where my mind goes to it but I understand like you don't owe people that information but sometimes I think like how do how can you be vulnerable how can you maintain relationships and be vulnerable and open if you're not being that way in them do you know what I mean yeah I don't can can I jump in real quick I need to I need to run in and and uh be fatherly um and parent uh so going back to whether or not pro deceit is a is a good term and it's actually piggybacks off of um something that for said earlier uh so it's it's this weird d it's this weird dichotomy I said ear like juggling um bombs because I have heard men or at least seen in in on like social media in men spaces like openly advocate for murder and violence against trans women for 100% like I've heard they think it's valid they're in my H for review comments right now right completely valid and and like and like had to like be like dude this a that's a human you know all these things right so like on one end um I I want people to be safe and not get murdered but on the other end like [ __ ] these dudes you know what I'm saying like like if that's if that's the attitude you should be resisting that in every in every shape or form even if it don't even serve a a long-term more useful goal um and so on the flip side though um recognizing so I get I get pushed I get a lot of like and I almost feel bad because I'm and this is piggy back what something foreign said earlier because I'm very open with my my accomplice or Ally or whatever terms that are appropriate that you may put upon me because I try not to call myself those things because there's so much baggage to how that works but because of that people think I'm by people think I'm poly people think I'm TR people think I'm all those things because I can't just be a sis head [ __ ] that likes football care about people I can't just be that you know and so the the funniest thing that that forign mentioned is the modom of uh patriarchy or or resources that you get by performing patriarch as black man because the the other thing that is often missing from from my standpoint is that there's there's so little benefit in the in in where I where I stand in my politics there's no incentivization people think there is that the Manis [ __ ] like to say or FD built a whole group of feminists that's why his channel so big and I show them on several occasions my analytics and that my audience is 75% man they be like nah n that don't count there's no there's no benefits to it ackowledge how much bigger You' be if you didn't do that if that that that uh Kevin Samuels had has a milli had a million subscribers in a year with bad audio bad lighting bad content all he did was bash women and it was enough to get him over the top de ass right you know what I'm saying so so so all of that goes into that Ling bombs thing because and this is not this is not equating in uh oppression Olympic stuff but it's really it really is uh difficult sometimes to want to bring up the like nature of the complexity of living in a black male body in ways that we just have extremely underdeveloped discourses around I love me some bell hooks she's all I got in terms of like most generally speaking popular black feminist and gender studies thought in terms of engaging with black men the other major black male figures that I'm like oh I don't like y'all [ __ ] y'all sound stupid y y'all got weird fan bases y'all got you know and then on the flip side completely understanding why that is because as iby said earlier [ __ ] Ain't [ __ ] and so it's like this like was like and that was a complete sentence knowt [ __ ] [ __ ] be rough so like to any to Any Man black men watching I feel your pain but also do better at the same time but also pick up a pick it up you know but also I I do want to say this too um I I don't think so in the space of sexuality activity doesn't equal identification so sometimes when when people are when people have sex with or have same gendered sex um they don't identify as bisexual or pan or what have you they just get placed in conversations where people are like so are you this thing that clearly your sexual activity has has suggested that you are and so if you if you say no you you I don't buy it cuz you just told me you have sex with men if you say yes it's like well why didn't you say that and and not that I'm not talking about you anymore specifically ol I'm talking about um yeah just bisexuality or or like people being trans and then what FD was speaking to about not people being people being transgender um what FD was speaking about um on behalf of like trans women who are who experience Violence by the hands of you know straight men it's like they shouldn't have to first of all first of all these [ __ ] know every time these [ __ ] no stop play like or the vast majority of the time like I just cannot with like this Narrative of like if you if you want to be safe then just say who you are [ __ ] he knew he knew exactly where the girls hang out he know where the girls party he knows where the girls are and he made himself available in that space picked her up brought her home girl what what he say he want to go to library with you he want to take me to the Chanel store and after that he want to [ __ ] me that's exactly what that's exactly so this idea that they don't know or that telling them is going to make them more safe is untrue because one they already are aware and even if they were aware it's not these trans people's responsibility to communicate these things so that these aggressors are not aggressive towards them these aggressors need to control themselves 100% yeah no no one say I think to be clear I think in the in my own personal bias of and sometimes my na of like I just love people and like I you know vulnerable relationships are important and connecting to people is important so like if you have an experience you want to talk about it like I'm a [ __ ] to ask everybody about their sexual experiences because I really do want to be a sexologist eventually like that's a whole other truly I I I've loved talking about that kind of stuff since I was a kid like I even when I wasn't interested in doing the ACT I was always interested in talking about it because I'm fascinated by the ways that we as people in our the most quiet vulnerable places how we show up I think that is very fascinating I think it's very interesting and I think we can learn a lot about it but yes I completely agree that like no one owes you that like that's not especially strangers because a lot of us haven't earned that trust a lot of us haven't earned that honesty and also it doesn't really for a lot of people it doesn't have that much to do with anything for some people it's more their identity for other people it's just yeah sometimes I sleep with people and like it's not that they do I have I have such a um when it comes to lgbtq community in general but in particularly the trans Community but then extra extra in particular like black Trans women I have such um such a level of like oh you need to be protected because I guess like first of all I hate to see like [ __ ] othered [ __ ] othered within the [ __ ] Community I hate that like I hate that like I hate the [ __ ] Community we're coming up with a lot today a lot of terms I hate I just I really hate seeing like people act like they're Pro like it's Pro you could be Pro black and quite literally be anti like even just eras entire of black people right that being said I think the reason why I extra extra extra feel for theb Community but specifically like black Trans women is because as someone who's like everything that I say pisses off a fury of people right like just for like being an abolitionist speaking out on white supremacy this and the next thing I've spoken out on everything and I know how the world responds to it all right like at least like to me and never do I see any like I told you like there's one thing okay like I'm complaining about how I feel like what the response I feel like I get when I say something empathetic towards the black man but if I like a trans person is just on my channel smiling breathing you know what I mean like you just like you say anything I I you could if you could just see the comments the vitri all like I have people who don't watch my iconic interviews all together just because there are interview like like I started out with L and I have trans people that I've done it with and like send me all kind of comments and so upset and this is to the next thing and so I just think so I'm like all right like not for nothing even with all my awareness of like the black experience and or being a black being a black woman all these different things a I don't never see no level of ostra like ostracization like what you see when you talk about black like the black LGBT community but specifically like black Trans people there is this like there isn't even like a like black people will start talking like how white supremacist be talking about [ __ ] who've just been killed by by the police like that's really how they be comment section so there there is that pery you were saying that um you know they guys know most of the times not always and I think the reason I use that term like the dece you know Pro deceit is because I feel like I feel like with guys and like being tricked I feel like it actually starts with them just looking at a trans woman and if you know the way like I show up in the world like guys don't know so they feel like I'm tricking them just and they be mad about it yeah yeah my argued with his boys about that recently because they were like upset that like there's a bunch of black Trans baddies like at a party like bad like cold killing everybody killing all this this pretty like a trans [ __ ] hey no dead ass like I I let's let's you know what I hate when when people pretend they'll be [ __ ] on trans people who don't pass and then pretending like they're like like what they're mad about is that they're not blending in more but you want to see real rage let them feel like they can't clock somebody like let them be attracted to a trans person oh the fury and because because what they're saying is they presented like they're being tricked but really what it is is their their ideas of sexuality and what it's supposed to be in about them and their masculinity it's what they feel like they have to reconcile within themselves because who the [ __ ] are you to make me be attracted and it says so much about what people think about like attraction and sexuality because it's like you're attracted to that person like you know like you know what I you know what I'm saying but you're acting as though you're not technically attracted to them because you want to create this like gender binary and be upset and act like they've done something to you but all this really is is you being upset about internally like something you feel internally based on what you've been told externally is supposed to be you know and correct and Quay I want to say this and then um I don't have kids to rais but you know it's time for me to come I'm G let y be free I feel like it was giving that um we were coming to a consensus that that was what the the vibe was get but I did want to say this um Quay you are [ __ ] right you are very p but I I I do um it must be when we're talking about the people who are unived or um harmed by these um we keep talking the black context are these these black Trans women who are who are harmed by these black men right or any any of these men um usually in from the stories that I'm I'm familiar with it's after they've had several encounters um and now it's become public so how many how many how many black Trans women have access to the capital to get um you know this bottom surgery right um and so I think it becomes abundantly clear or want you so I think it becomes abundantly clear what you're working with and and the ways in which you fell in love over and over again and now that you've been exposed or there is a threat of exposure um that's when the harm comes into play so I do think that there are trans women who move through life and men are none the wiser because they're attracted to women and so this is a type of woman just like there are black women Asian women and they're attracted to you or any other transwoman but most of the time where the harm comes in I think is what that's a great point I think I never I think need still be like articulated explicitly that like how much of this idea that this constant like reinforcing this idea that like trans women are tricking sis hat men is only meant to deflect from the violence of these men that are a lot of these men who are fully in the know and whatever have you and how much is that like rhetoric in general just meant to make sure that people just have this underl justification that they never even get which a justification for the murders that they don't hear about because the media don't cover it in first place when black transs women are K because also even if you were quote unquote tricked why are you so angry that you will kill someone over that clock it it's been clocked yes it's been clocked consider it clocked consider it clocked [Music]
