    "text": "As a white man dating a black women for the past 7 years. The conflict when discussing politics, especially race, is so underplayed in media and in general. In my experience, the first year together we had pretty tough conversations that made us feel divided. I was only a teenager then, so as I cared more about politics I radically changed my views. The thing is, these tik tok trends get so much attention because the WM and BW dynamic is taboo to many and virtue signals racial \"progress\" without actually talking about racial politics and struggle. I definetly believe that the WM and BW couple just isn't possible without immense work both as a couple and more importantly as an individual. Also, loved the video you guys do not miss!",

    "text": "The main thing I wanna say in response is for all the compassion that Khadija and Olay expressed towards Black men generally, I want to send right back to Black nonbinary people and Black women in general too but also to the two of y'all specifically. On a personal note, y'all two have foundationally shaped my understanding of the fundamental nature of the political world which has been so radical that it has pushed me past radicalism, to the precursor to the root itself, the very essence of life: universal love. And compassion is but a true act of love. So love y'all!\n\nBut on a broader note, Herby made an incredibly insightful point that people who haven't been given the space to be progressive end up regressive. It's just like plants having bundled roots once they've outgrown the pot they're in. So too do these oppressive systems constrain the humanity of ALL of us in different ways. The difference between the oppressor and the oppressed is often the latter is more acutely aware of their suffering relating to the other. No one can inflict suffering on another without incurring it within themselves. Nietzsche said as one stares into the abyss, the abyss stares back into you. Herby's observation just crystallized for me beyond the bounds of our egos, that were all just organic vessels channeling whatever greater forces are programming us. None of us fell from coconut trees—we exist within the context of every causal event that preceded this very moment. And we're all existing within the contexts of various overarching systems that condition us into negative, harmful power dynamics based on identity. However what has been learned can be unlearned if one feels like it.\n\nWhich is why I want to tell Herby also that I love him too. I see all the pain that has informed his feelings and I want to express compassion for the suffering he's endured. I've typed so many words already and it's not even scratching a molecule on the tip of the iceberg of why Love, Compassion, and Wisdom are truly the ONLY way forward. As someone who used to think I could fight back the hate of oppression with my own righteous hate, years and years of not moving the needle has shown me otherwise. One compassionate act has done more for me than years of denigrating another through hate and/or ignorance. Everyone deserves that, especially once you realize that the pain one inflicts on others is a condition of the pain they've endured and haven't healed from. Hurt people hurt people. But Love and Compassion heals all. I love all y'all 💜",

        "text": "@rorschachroach  not really. I was referring to the first statement about how nobody expected her to speak to political issues before she put on a black panther outfit and drowned a police car. She’s made political statements that she felt strongly about. That doesn’t mean that anybody should expect her to make a statement about everything. Most people who do activism as a life calling, are focused on one or two areas and tend to not address every single issue that’s happening in the news. It’s weird to expect a celebrity to. I don’t expect Beyoncé to be knowledgeable about Palestine. I actually expect her, like the vast majority of American people to be grossly uninformed. Her being a celebrity doesn’t equate to her being knowledgeable on global politics. \n\nSo no. I don’t need to worry about feeling guilt for listening to Beyonce. If Beyonce was being silent on lgbtq issues constantly, I’d feel guilty defending her and would look at her sideways because of how she’s utilized the community up to this point. I feel guilty because I voted for Joe Biden and he’s handling this shit horribly. Beyoncé is a performer. I expect her to perform and if she wants to speak out about something she feels strongly about that’s her right. And if she only ever uses her platform to speak up for black issues, lgbtq rights and black issues that’s enough. Those aren’t lesser causes. Any person who decides to dedicate their lives to just one of those causes is doing more than enough. \n\nSo I hear what you saying. I just respectfully disagree. I don’t look to celebrities for things like this. I don’t even think she can do anything. She can’t  even get the Grammys to give her album of the year. There are already tens of thousands of people yelling at our leaders every day to get on the right side of this.",

    "text": "Khadija mentioned Sinead O' Connor, who is from my country and lived in my home town for the final years of her short life. Sadly, we've lost Sinead now. And her passing was really felt deeply across the country. The f'd up thing is that, when Sinead was alive and committed to her activism, she was widely attacked in both America and at home, but when she passed suddenly the internet was set on fire with notes of how we had lost a true artist, a hero. Suddenly everyone  was writing think pieces and praising her bravery and claiming her as an exemplary, Irish feminist and anti-establishment icon. \n\nIt was, quite frankly, stomach churning.  Sinead was completely blackballed for her activism when she was alive. When she suffered with extreme mental health issues, she was ridiculed. It got to the point where she was more or less exiled from the world of fame, even though she was still producing great work. She suffered greatly because of her activism and outspokenness. It was a true reflection of who she was. It wasn't performative. She pretty much sacrificed her career for it. That's not to say that every celebrity has an obligation to do this, but it possibly does explain why people get pissed off when performers treat activism as a jacket to put on and take off, rarely risking anything. To stand up when it's safe to do so and then say nothing when things are truly at stake means you should possibly just stick to performing and leave politics out of it.",

    "text": "I’m so glad Khadija spoke on that whole “pro-deception” thing. My biggest pet peeve about the disclosure conversation is how some people act like there is no nuance to it and you are automatically problematic for saying you SHOULD disclose to your partner. \n\nI am 1000% in support of NOT disclosing on the first date. You should never disclose until you feel SAFE with that person, even if it takes months of dating… (although if it takes months for you to feel safe about being honest with your partner, that’s concerning and a reevaluation of the relationship might be warranted).\n\nBut disclosure before you are sexually active with that person is IMO, the safest and the most consensual way to move forward. Informed consent is a thing that always gets ignored in this. If I consent to having sex with you before you disclose all relevant information, KNOWING that the information might lead me to making a different decision… then is that consent?\nThe unfortunate fact of the matter is, it’s risky to disclose AND it’s risky to not disclose. Trans people are being unalived and assaulted for both. \nI get that trans people shouldn’t have to disclose that they’re trans. CisHet people don’t have to disclose that they’re CisHet so why should trans? But until we get to that point where change happens, safety and survival has to be the top priority. Non-disclosure/deception/whatever you want to call it is not safe. \nBlack parents don’t want to have to warn their children about the dangers of the police. They shouldn’t have to! The police shouldn’t be a risk to our lives but they are. And until we get to a point where change happens, safety and survival has to be the top priority.",

    "text": "First of LOVING the panel line up for this one fr!! ☺️ now to touch on the DL topic a little, I’m kind of in the middle between khadija and herby. While yes you should be open to people who you are trying to develop relationships with.I also think that you don’t necessarily have to be explicitly open with your sexuality stance if your partner isn’t directly asking. I know people be good a lying fr and I do feel bad for the women who get deceived by DL men. It makes me wonder how many of these women even asked what that man’s sexuality even is. For me personally as a Bi women I’m always quick to ask about someone’s sexuality because I want to make sure their fine with my personal sexuality and vice versa. That doesn’t mean that even if you ask people will automatically feel comfortable enough to tell you the truth, which is why I’m kinda on the fence. I just feel like if your a women in 2024 and you only want to date straight cis men then start asking these men what their sexuality is directly (respectfully of course). Especially living in ATL with all the queer people here there’s a lot women who will have DL stories and I’m like, you’re valid in your emotional response but like girl they might have told if you put the question out there (most of the stories I’ve personally heard they never say that he said himself they were a straight man). It’s really a slight bit on you for assuming anyone’s sexuality or gender based on just what you momentarily see especially new people in your life. Hopefully my comments not to long and makes sense 😅.",

I know this because I was very close I'm my late teen early 20s to adopting the mindset that draws in Divesters. Fortunately, I had an older Sister to come and collect me real quick: But not every black woman has experienced being pursued (much less pursued in a positive and respectful way) by black men.  And it's easy in that feeling of abandonment and isolation and those experiences of active rejection from black men to let that positively frame relatively neutral interactions with white men, if there's no one in a woman's life there to bring a sense of reason and critical thinking.",

    "text": "I think the critiques of Eminem are warranted. He's a talented wordsmith, but he's always been problematic. The \"shot at a feat\" line was clever, but he has too many puns that reinforce bad stereotypes and feel like punching down. There are much worse lines, too, so I'm surprised that's the one getting the most attention, but I'm glad Megan Thee Stallion is being supported. She deserves acclaim and I'm sick of the shit against her. Of course, dinosaur views are symptomatic of a lot of lingering issues in hip hop.\n\nI like Eminem because I'm a fan of dark and irreverent humor (shocker coming from someone with a JoeKerr profile, I know), but there's a point when we have to be honest about the source of certain jokes. It's also worth mentioning that some of Eminem's best work comes when he drops the persona, i.e. \"When I'm Gone\". I'd like to hear more introspective stuff like that from an older Em. FD has it right when he says he dropped the ball by not taking the chance to air out dirty laundry from his past and grow into an older wiser MC.",

        "text": "I absolutely loved this lineup here! It was wonderful, fun, funny, and all around super insightful and impactful. I think this is the first one where I knew almost everyone here from previous videos and channels I've watched and been to.\n\nWith that said, I do agree with @analogynature8757. Having followed through the video's entirety and taken mental stock of who was speaking and when ('cause I was really invested in this one), I could tell that both Foreign Man in a Foreign Land and Quei did not participate in equivocal measure to the other four participants, particularly Olay. \n\nForeign really only had one, maybe two, moments where the scene focused on him and what he was saying directly. Quei had a few more of those near the latter half of the video, but her moments were a lot briefer than others' were, when she did get them. Foreign did mention elsewhere in this comment section that he actively stayed quiet out of respect for not wanting to talk over any of his fellow participants who were queer and/or fem. For Quei, I could tell that she had wanted to speak and interject a number of times, ending up ultimately opting out of doing so in most of those instances. \n\nThis is kind of tricky to address, because I did notice that Olay was the one who did the most speaking and interjecting during this video. What makes this tricky is because this _is_ Olay's channel; she is the host, after all, the very reason everyone is here in the first place. And even more pertinent, so much of what Olay did speak to was super insightful and awesome to hear. Still, though, I do believe that in a number of the instances that Quei and Foreign wanted to speak, they could not, due in more than an occasional instance because Olay had the floor and held it longer than either Foreign or Quei had the chance to. From a viewing perspective, there was a sense of awkwardness when this occurred, as well as when taking in the video on the whole and realizing that both Quei and Foreign really did not participate relative to everyone else, in fair part due to Olay's presence being the most active.\n\nIn the end, I do hope this doesn't come off the wrong way. I just feel this is something important enough to bring up and be mindful and conscientious of so that future Olay and Friends videos ideally won't have the aforementioned instances that this one did.",

I think the conversation regarding the bi guy that Olay dated not disclosing that information when they were in a relationship, and Herbie's response that no one owes you that information is funny looking back, because *motions to the Lavern Cox situation* That's why.(I think it's much more nuanced than that, but that part of the conversation intersects well with the response to Laverne.)",

However, a BIG difference, is that when a white man is with a black woman, he becomes MORE desirable to the same group of white women that previously wouldn't look twice at him.",
