I’m tired of having to tell my daughter to accept non white peoples shitty behavior and she can’t say things that are simple facts. Certain ppl are loud and rude and aggressive and she just notices it and doesn’t like it. No better example when a small child who doesn’t know what race is comes to certain conclusions all on their own. And that’s only one issue we have today that’s ridiculous.",

Not some Republican, who will cancel their EBT cards and deport their family members. It is literally only a matter of time before those states flip back to “blue” Florida will be first, then Texas.
