Drake's new this beta masculinity performance that he's been involved in go on Aiden Ross xqc I think is the other one like go on these streamer spaces he could have literally been quiet for two seconds come out with an album with no features that was good like sat down for yeah like he if he had taken the time off that he's been blowing it have been cool but every seven business days he decides to do something I'm like why but the thing that really is at the core of the Kendrick Lamar beef is that you are not really black enough he didn't come out on top not only that it changed the way people have perceived him this is an era where Drake does not immediately dominate everything he has to fundamentally shift his whole Sonic structure in order to just randomly just go into the studio punch in and then the hit he's had this fragile ego since he was getting rejected by Rihanna but being rejected by this black whale rapper that he really wants to be like and be in his Club

the link in the description below thank you for sponsoring this video Aura hello beautiful black people hey hey hello hello we We Gather here today to talk about what I actually legitimately think is the worst L ever taken in rap beeve history like I legitimately I really really think that I don't think I'm being hyperbolic at all and I it actually pains me to see Drake so catastrophically mishandle something at every turn like I I cannot believe it like I honestly I want you to know when he did the lawsuit I couldn't even comment on it my was so my mind was so blown I was so hurt and Shattered by Drake why do you I was like you want to leave no stone unturned on on returning from this on coming back from this and then yesterday when they when they reported that he withdrew the lawsuit I was like Jesus Christ you did all that you did all that you know took the L now you have drain it and I thought if you thought that was as bad as it could get then they say oh no he withdrew that lawsuit because he's intending to file a bigger lawsuit for defamation I said oh my God oh my God I'm embarrassed I'm actually like I I feel like continuing to take these L's that's the whole year up for for Strife like I honest I swear to God like I saw people I I genuinely don't know where I turned around and I started really worrying about letting Cat Williams do interviews this year like I was scared and then when Drake I said oh my God you're not even please let the years like let me feel like it's a new year why Drake C Cat Williams interview with Shannon sharp is like the New harambe Meme and that like everything changed and we're in a different timeline based on that it really is weird yeah like Williams was yeah it was a meme how like off Cat Williams was several years ago I haven't enjoyed any of his comedy much and I'm I have like a low like barrier for enjoying stand-up comedy you just got to be funnier than Kevin Hart right don't do Kevin Kevin Kevin early standups would y'all don't do Kevin I'm just saying I've never been a huge I've never been a huge Kevin Hart fan but I could watch his stuff and like be and like finish it so like if you can get above I'm a grown little man like what now laugh about those are funny those are funny you see how far you're going don't matter he did it either way cat has not reached that bar in several years no he has some Sal I also think like everything you're saying O about like Drake's trajectory is like very in with like honestly who he's hanging out with he's hanging out with people who just don't ever take you know it's kind of funny this is like the exact opposite like there was a there was a time like a couple probably like five or six years back where they thought he had dissed Eminem and uh like I think this was like right after like or a little bit right before the Eminem uh sent uh Machine Gun Kelly Into The Ether um but uh he he immediately and was like all like re like now he's on this like I think he he won one really famous beef with Meek Mill and then slightly one against common but then has lost two backto back pun intended and and it's acting like nothing ever happened like like none of that ever happened and like the I I don't get the the the lawsuit part of it is crazy to me because it's it's not only like ad like not only from like a rap perspective is it like really it looks really bad right because a majority of Drake's street cred for battling came from him hanging out with people like disaster and actual battle rappers um and that's what he put on his shoulder like oh I know this culture but not only is it a complete like about face about that it's just a lawsuit that you're not g like from a legal perspective it's just [ __ ] stupid to do that and like from business spot and and and these companies control streaming right now and I understand that like yeah Spotify they're shitty and they screw artists like me and other people like that but you know like the way you're doing it is so so so bad and it's gonna backfire on you it's already backfiring on him you know Ole can you give us a legal perspective somewhat I know that's not your area but like isn't defamation super hard to prove the defamation lawsuit is is definitely garbage like the other one I feel like there were you know like an entertainment law lawyer would have been would have been um better suited to discuss like you know the ins and outs and where like he could had a claim just in terms of the the public perception like what you want like that lawsuit was not worth it even if it had legs legally in terms of what Drake wanted it's just not a good idea but the defamation lawsuit defamation is such an incredibly High bar in general if you're a public figure right like you have to show like um you have to show one that is a lie and that is with malice right and um in this case I'm like what are you first of all you entered this isn't some kind of like oh he's out there lying on you and whatever in the world y'all are engaged in in like what is a part of y'all's career like an act of like y'all are engaging to your profession y'all are doing you know work you are going back and forth with them too and you're also saying whatever have you about him like there's no you can't say and then also the things that that Kendrick is saying about Drake like regard of what you think is personally true or how true you think it is as far as there being a world thousands of people if not millions of people that have heard uh uh about Drake with underage women like at ones we know like celebrities who we know like whether or not how serious you think the offenses we know for a fact or we like at least it's public it's already public perception or public knowledge like already in the public domain that Drake is made out with with with gals like who was 16 17 whatever have you so there's no way you're gonna you're going to make that claim that Kendrick like with malice lied on you and he and he's the one who like damaged your reputation and stuff there have been videos you know what I mean videos video essays tweets stuff all over the Internet for many years about Drake with younger women there have been sizz in them themselves Georgia and them telling their own life story you know what I mean so it's a terrible you're not going to win it you spend a bunch of money you're not going to win it and you're causing irreparable harm to your career like I genuinely think Drake has caused himself irreparable harm like I'm like oh this is like because you he's made everything so like Everything Kendrick has said about him or that you know you lost as an indictment of your character and all of this in in in the rap beef has now made it like oh you're an egregious extreme of what Kendrick is saying like to the people who were just like enjoying the music who didn't really care so much what they saying but they heard the accusations it's like oh damn look at you he said you were this and you are like that you fundamentally you disrespect the culture and this like in this music this you turn around and you sue for you sue in the rap be because you lost you Sue and and to say not like us was was artificially inflated when it was a Bop of Epic Proportion yeah I feel like the the lawsuit really isn't about the it isn't about Kendrick it it really isn't even about umg I think it is like a warning shot that if fox or the NFL allow for Kendrick to sing that song on the stage at the Super Bowl that he's gonna sue them right and so like it's it's I think it's designed to kind of like scare people into compliance say like don't let him sing the song or perform the song otherwise I'm coming after y'all and and that's also the lamest possible thing could do with you fox is not gonna be like Fox is not break Fox is a multi-billion doll corporation uh like yeah now and they and they have Mickey Mouse backing them now so who the [ __ ] is going to about like two bit lawsuit also very quickly oh is he suing because that this is the first I heard about the about after he withdrew the lawsuit about a second lawsuit about defamation wait so is he withd with drwing my vocabulary is he did he is he suing umg or is he suing Kendrick for the defamation no he's not suing Kendrick he he sued everybody but Kendrick like everybody is yeah but no he's he's suing umum so they TMC reports that Drake has filed a new defamation case this morning against Universal Music Group in federal court for spreading the false and malicious narrative that he's a pedophile he start he starts the brief with okay a quote from Lucien and then um talking about how there was a shooting at his house right after the song dropped and trying to complate the two cour case already about this by there's a there's a l like because this is under the same this is how Larry Flint like you guys you guys ever heard that uh movie oh wow pretty much Larry Flynn had this giant lawsuit um where he said that George Jerry F not George Jerry fwell [ __ ] his mother in an out housee and they they put this thing in Hustler and Jerry fwell who was like super litigious and would just burn people to the ground with lawsuits sued him and lost at the Supreme Court level because they were like you can make fun of like it's under Free Speech it's a unanimous decision you can make fun of whoever you want because it's sat like without it satire would not exist right so like th not only is it like a frivolous law this would have irreparable damage on hip hop if this was to ever like get legs because it basically opened up every rapper ever to say something negative about another rapper to be sued for uh my songs weird I saw I saw someone had to take this this is like uh the actor that played Joffrey off of Game of Thrones suing George RR Martin you know what I'm saying and it's like I don't know about them throwing so I can't the thing about tort law like it's like it it you always look at the the reasonable stand like the standard of the industry like this is rap beef like it explicitly is what it's what it is you know what I mean and like Drake is also like throwing back a bunch of things too like Drake was putting out his own songs saying that Kendrick beat his wife and that that's what the case is and that they not together and all shot on that like it's hypocritical and I just think like Drake Drake is making matters so much worse like by specifically honing in on the pedophile thing like Kendrick said a million in 96 indictments of his character like it like they like it wasn't just that and and Kendrick not the first one you know what I mean Kendrick just said it very loud to a very catchy beat right like but Drake I don't know why he keeps drawing more attention to something that there's bad receipts for for him I'm like you should just move on like every other person every other black man every other man in rap to be accused of something like terrible you just you never acknowledge it again you had pretty much take away take the whole Space over for someone hates and you're just you're like no no no no not Diddy me me right now Drake is here Drake Drake is being very very hypocritical from just this whole playoff so it is to me some people want to talk about that it isn't a loss I view it as a big loss because you built your you being Drake have built your whole career off of throwing Jabs and subliminals literally and then I think that this whole idea of giving like you were saying FD the you know hipop some kind of if it gets legs some kind of idea that you can sue your way out of like a rat beef and I feel like that's problematic because we know rap just goes in like that you can literally just disrespect people nasty talk about having sex with your mama all kinds of things in in in a whole rat beef and move forward you know live your life sometimes people kill that live their life marry beautiful women have children and think that it's never going to catch up with them if the if what they're saying and the subliminals are true but Drake for me is just he's just somebody who's very fragile it just shows us that you know his he's always been a character he's always been acting and it's been great love his music Love still listen to it when I work out you know I'm still there with it um but to see him going out this way he thought that this wasn't he didn't think I feel like he underestimated Kendrick um and that was the biggest problem there and now because he thought that this was going to be the biggest year or the end of last year was going to be the biggest year for him that and it turned to be Kendrick's year uh and now we canot understand it it is the black nerd era every time I be like as as a [ __ ] I've said this right I obviously was with y'all and continue to be in kicking Drake's back in when it comes to this beef right but I have maintained like I am a Drake music fan right and always have been and every time I listen to Drake now like like when me and CJ listen to Drake and like love Drake's music like old Drake music right and then I hear FD in the background like in my brain talking [ __ ] like any nigg who really [ __ ] with Drake like you're bad people and I be like yo I would hate this bro bro FD it's like an angel and devil crazy how you know trying to ruin your young people it's like it's like an angel and devil appear on Olay shoulder like uh FD is the Angel and Tahoe is the devil and they're both like trying to influence it's honestly so funny when you know a [ __ ] ton of creators on the internet and like when you think about it like it's a few creators that lead discourses on things right and when you know the creative person you ruining your artist your favorite artist day you be like oh my God shut the f up that that Drake is boring um thing has went viral multiple times um I haven't had I've had big videos but nothing that's like spread like a like a Tik Tok a minute thing that people that have no clue who I am so I've gotten a lot of weird comments from that as well but I wanted to um Rebecca said something that reminds me of a take I got a shout out my brother Matt clear who's literally my brother and a musician um check him out on Spotify he text me during all of this and and you talked about Drake's fragility so and I have a I'm probably gonna end up doing something explicit around this about like Drake's new I hate to use the term but it's the best way I could think of this this beta masculinity performance that he's been involved in ever since this went down in that when you look at who Drake has really aimed himself at for years now but especially post battle at post battle what have we seen Drake do go on Aiden Ross go on is it asmin gold or what's the other one yes xqc I think is the other one like go on these streamer spaces um and you look get like what hurt him the most my brother broke it down he was like there's basically like three groups of in this equation there's people like Kendrick who are not like by by Nature again that this is very this is not please don't get in your uh in your gender scholarship bag as I break this down and call me out too tough I know but so you have Kendrick who's kind of in this like own lane that a lot of men are in where it's like I'm not going to be the top of the food chain as as masculine perform perance is going to be but I'm kind of happy where I am and I Feel Free by the distance between me and this like super high performance of masculinity because I recognize how much pressure and like like you know uh sacrifice that takes and then you have those real people like a LeBron James dudes that are literally just born and built different and like there was no thing in the world that was going to change the fact that a LeBron James or maybe even a diddy or Jay-Z was going to be in the type of positions they're in for better and for worse and then you have like dudes that aspire to that but really don't have what it takes and so all they do is imitate and Court favor from those types of guys so you have people like Drake like uh the Aiden Ross sniffed Ash uh Andrew Tate's um ass or something on stream not ass it was something weird very down that Aiden Ross is a very I remember like when I was working for for uh for Philip I had a bar about Aiden Ross and then they just showed the the guy put a picture of Aiden Ross surrounded by Andrew Tate like it's a casting catch m is not yeah um oh yeah uh yeah and like the the gambling stuff like so it's all this really like marketing have way putting it marketing to losers I I feel like that I was that take has been viral multiple times cuz I was Mother cooking with that [ __ ] Drake is great for marketing to losers because other losers like Drake think that Drake looks like a winner because he's managed to overcome his naturally loser dor ways and be imitated and imitate This truly high performance masculinity which is why he has LeBron James tattoo like Nick when I found that out I'm glad I didn't know that before I made my video I what I I think you're 1,00% right I think you're 1,00% right FD and like and I get even why it's happening right like like why he's choosing to try to court them or why you know because he's always like by nature of Drake's je level of pop artist he's always been trying to like Court white people and care about them and like the kind of groups right so like makes sense on one level but on the other hand for Drake to be as obviously bothered as he is like you feel some type of way about how the black community is feeling about you and what the reception is and you're trying like you're mad as about it you have not stopped you know what I mean on that I don't understand why he's choosing to go about things in a way that's so obviously not going to be helpful to changing that when I don't think black people are that hard to change in this in this particular we're so forgiving of with bad women problems like that's what I'm saying I'm like this is the most fighting to this data listen to they Kelly like you know what I mean like worst things are ignored all the time and Nelly got rape cases celebrating Nelly in a Shanti right now like no people let [ __ ] go all the the whole shade room is just full of not giving a I saw them posting new Trey songs music the other day like they all he had to do is like every time I look I was like I feel like for you to be this bothered he could have literally been quiet for two seconds come out with an album with no features that was that that was good like sat down for year like he if he had taken the time off that he's been blowing it's already been a year essentially since this [ __ ] happened he could have come back out and everything could have been cool but every seven business days he decides to do something I'm like why I knew sheit was gonna get weird when he sung the Beyonce on stage um at at the show a little while ago and I was like this ain't real and I was like oh it Ison yeah he did me myself and I he he did like a speech about he hasn't have friends Aaron go ahead and find that he did a speech on stage about how he doesn't have any real friends and mother didn't have his back and then he said play that he's like play that be play that new song in his Beyonce's me myself and I get the [ __ ] out of but what's what's so [ __ ] up I'm so sorry but what's so what's so [ __ ] up about it too is like it you know what okay the three biggest like again we're going back to the beefs that like in sequ insequential order of that Drake has had leading up to this right like if you go to Meek Mill Meek Mill taking one of the biggest L's in Hip Hop which by the way I thought that beef was like whatever but back toback is a legendary track look Drake beating Meek Mill look at how Meek took that Meek took that L there was an Instagram post of him listening to back to back in his car like you know I'm just gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna take that L and I'm gonna get better and years later Meek had this whole Redemption Arc right right now he's going through it but like he had this whole Redemption Arc right after that because he took his even Drake after he got bodied by push a t he was on the LeBron James uh the the shop saying like you know what uh like push T beat me you know like whatever rap beef game I I lost right okay he took that out how do you not learn like right from those two moments where you've had Redemption arcs after those beefs that maybe double triple maybe quadrupling down and making this story go longer than it needs to be won't like have an irreparable damage on your career like it's so weird to me that that he's making this choice right now he's himothy like you got to think about it like you gotta understand in his mind like in his there's nowhere in Drake's mind that he's comparing himself to me like you like because Kendrick hit him which I do think Kendrick might have hit him just as hard one time but then Kendrick hit him just that hard like four more times right at least at least but I think for Drake's mind it's how far the fall is from like Meek didn't fall from as far as Drake fell Meek wasn't as nowhere near where Drake was Drake is experiencing a fall I don't think I've seen before it's like it's blowing my mind like in a time it's like it's in a world of where are always in trouble and we live in a world of constant fights about Council culture and not Council culture and you always feel as though like no no consequences are really real and really be fine and stuff like that Jesus Christ dr's Drake [ __ ] is looking crazy like I'm like whoa I don't know if I ever seen it look this bad for this long so I think like from from that perspective I don't think he sees him and him and meek and all these other Redemption Arc in the process go I think I think Drake is kind of just like in defense mode and like just all I don't think he's come to that play I don't think if there stages of grief I think Drake is still in like disbelief and like lashing out I don't think he's processed anything other than when you listen to all his like music sense or anything he says it's very clear what he thinks are hating on me for nothing these trifling disloyal turned around and formed like Transformers to take me down that's how he feels like and what's and what's funny in that regard is that like it's very clear that Drake has made amends with Atlanta um and which which is very I think very calculated on his part he he he did I miss something Young Thug he gave Young Thug a million dollars once he got out of court once he got out of jail he like literally paid his legal fees basically and that was a for I know because the fact that I didn't hear that like I didn't hear that like how much how much fure I think yeah you know I'm locked in with the with the dark Triad of Drake haters uh so so I know everything I know a lot of stuff I can't even talk about that I'm I'm actually worried about long termd right there right but uh but Drake did what I can talk about is that Drake gave future I'm not future um Thug a million dollars straight out of jail after the case ended and then like a week later you hear future talking about I didn't even know that was beef like y I know y'all saw that with future was like I didn't know I didn't know Kendrick gonna do all that I'm cool with Drake y y y and so I expect once Drake because because here's the thing and going back to what a couple people said about how forgiving the black community is to men with sex offender adjacent behavior all Drake has to do is drop some good music that's what he did with with the um Pusher C stuff I said this in the video three four months later Kiki do you love me was a Tik Tock dance and it was over and I was sitting there like how was this happening right and so all he has to do is is drop his next track with future and if it's a Bop and it's a hit people will still think it in the back of their heads about how he took this L and whatever else but if it's a booping the h they're not gonna think it when the song is on I like that no face song you know it's I said listen I put a video on my second Channel saying the same thing and wasn't trying to hear it I know put it on the internet though bad place because the thing is like also music Trends have changed so fun like the fact that not like us was so big changed a lot of the trajectory of what is trending in music right like if you look at the biggest songs right now that are first first off the biggest artist in the world in the last like six months who was who's come up out of nowhere the big trending thing is doyi right like DOI is like has has had like a crazy her album has had a crazy run right and it's so crazy to me that like doi's so new to so many [ __ ] like scene but DOI has gone through like different eras of being a popping again I think I think she re she transformed so much for different projects that was her because persuasion and like persuasive all that stuff were B like she was a fresh an XXL Freshman two years before she before she blew up and people were like who's DOI and I was like doi's been killing this game for so long but this was like a perfect but but that's what I'm saying it's a perfect storm of not like us Chang like oh okay we want to listen to this type of music before Drake future and that Atlanta Tri had such a crazy run in dominance over the sound and the sonics and the identity of Hip Hop for so long right and now like again West Coast bangers are back in right you know a lot more old school lyrical rap is back in we're having the whole music industry kind of transitioned 200 Big X is that big X the plug that got that song where he's he's ring over some old Sam Cook or something and I'm like I remember this I remember this all the southern rappers used to sound like this but it's a country from shabzi like like kind of stuff is like this is an era where Drake does not immediately dominate everything right he has to fundamentally shift his whole Sonic structure in order to just drop a like randomly just go into the studio punch in and then a hit right like he has to fundamentally think about his pen game more he has to do all of this stuff that is not necessarily antithetical to what he knows but is not with him at the top of the food chain all of the time and that undercuts his brand that undercuts everything he is like even even if he wasn't being like like a whiny [ __ ] about everything I feel like he would be in a really really bad position coming into this new era of Music we're about to have over the next four years I I feel like Drake um because he's known for his dominance in hip-hop for the last decade or even over that you know it's it's um yeah the dance music he could we already talked about him being a shape shifter going into different cultures going into you know different styles where he's a shooter you know he's a killer you know and then he's a lover okay and then he's Jamaican he's Haitian he's hispanic he's African um you know sometimes he's white he's Jewish you know his Jewish side and sometimes he's Blacky black some kind of gang member we while he's still Canadian and he was right and the whole time he's just Canadian and um the but here we we really see like how because he's been dominated and he knew that stuff may happen but it ain't gonna be nothing I'm gonna come out on top every time this time he just he didn't come out on top not only that it changed the way people have perceived him that every single move that Drake seems to make we're looking at it like oh he weak he doing this because he weak he weak he's he he got an L he ain't G like who does that it's a [ __ ] ass move like that's that's exactly because now we're looking at it more than oh he's lyrical he's great he's a genius he's he's LeBron like you know for for for the music industry for the rap game now we've literally shifted on how we really see him oh he has weaknesses oh he's like he has no protection he has no problem I think he always has been weak he's always been this weak loser who hates rejection because he acted his way whenever all the women in the industry rejected him and he threw Tantrums the difference is now I'm I look at this as just homo rasism he saw these these black rappers who he loved who he thought he was on this same caliber as because I don't think he saw himself as the same caliber as push T even though he dropped that big bomb that he had Adonis and he definitely didn't see himself as weak now he's tried to comp he did this not all start off with like the big three [ __ ] yeah so Kendrick came back and said actually no you loser I will compare yourself to me and he got rejected by this is like the Pinnacle of a man's fragile ego when they get rejected by men they admire he's had this fragile ego since he getting rejected by Rihanna and all these other women that he's like admired that have had that are like huge but being rejected by this black male rapper that he really wants to be like and be in his Club he's a loser like this is what happen I you know what I think it it actually even more like not even like oh he wants to be be like him and be in his Club because I I don't even think that's what it is with Kendrick because I I feel like you know these kind of people you ever like people who resent you not because they're jealous of you but because they like think less of what you are like that thing like Drake clearly doesn't respect what Kendrick is like you hear that in his responses to how he frames the kind of music he is like his Persona is this he resents that and I think what it actually is is that he got a while where he was able to kind of change the culture of what's acceptable or like the largest voices right like there was a there was a moment now like for a while where Drake made it so you couldn't attack him no more for being like a pop of this and all these different things or whatever like he was able to kind of change the tides on what people you know feel like they respect and which you could be and I think what he really resents is feeling like he was King you know what I mean and he had changed that standard and here comes this who to him is everything that he actually kind of looks down on and that's and that's been flipped I think that's what it really is like more so that not that I want to be accepted by you I don't think you should be accepted I don't think you should be what the standard is anymore you should be king and the fact that you are and are like giving me [ __ ] about not being that is what he's M cuz like in dr's responses it it was very clear like I don't respect what you're saying like what you're trying to talk about the culture of it and you know what I mean and all of these things I don't respect that I'm calling it slave music I'm calling it this like I have a i i i fundamentally look down on how you see the world that characterization you know and it and it and it shows in the fact that where he's gone for Solace is these Aiden Ross who streamers who make their whole thing on not respecting that you know what I mean that's why you sitting next to like the and who you know not sitting next to because you know he ain't never met no academics as much as academics the damage ACS has done to Hip Hop cannot be understated like that guy is so like just to music in general because there's so much random [ __ ] that comes out of that guy's stupid face has no like no bearing on reality at all I'm so sorry to interrupt crazy to me yeah that's the internet but I want to go back to like the fact that Drake literally is someone who didn't think that this was he thought this was going to be the same way as Meek Mill and push a te because we haven't heard from Kendrick and Kendrick comes out but so many times he's really about his peace he's really about his family and he's really about his his lyrics you know he's very poetic he's always been that um you know he detached from a lot of the other people that he was um coming up with in the industry um and just went his way and he came out every blue moon and still was respected did his thing now what Drake did was you know fight like you know pick at this man and this man came out and was like you know what you thought I couldn't now I will and I don't think Drake expected for the blowback to be Kendrick becoming taking his place and I like you were just saying he can't take it the Su push it t yeah like yo like I let everybody else that I that that um you know came against me and may have even had a bar off of me you know may had something off of me they we didn't see we didn't hear from them they went back into their caves now Kendrick came from the cave and was like yo give me the stage you know what I'm saying like give me the lights it's all about me and Drake thought oh no he could never and it ended up being Kendrick literally even took Drake fans and converted them people weren't balanced they started choosing a side and they started actually respecting Kendrick uh his lyricism um how he loves his community and a lot of people started uh like feeling more like you know what la music and you know and then kend like hey here's some Bops by the way remember Luther Vanos remember real R&B yall giving us good stuff and people cannot deny it like the like what Drake thought he would be the dominating for forever and ever and ever and um we would always have have respect for Drake and his his Artistry um Here Comes Kendrick who nobody knew was in the running nobody knew was like even that nobody knew where how this was going to turn and boom he came out and we're like oh wow Kendrick is really that not not only that he's bringing community and TR is bringing separation and here is Kendrick bringing community and he love the kids and don't got problem being around the kids okay so you know what I'm saying this is this is it's it I think that's what really is bothering Drake it's it's he's salty about that he cannot take it and he's finding any way that he can legally or he's gonna he's gonna try to get somebody around the corner up the street the neighbor if he can't get the Kendrick directly because somebody's gonna go down for the fact that Kendrick is who he is right now garon you about to jump in yeah I was about to jump in okay I actually FD I'm still stuck on this thing that you said earlier about how if Drake were to be successful in his lawsuit this defamation lawsuit evil fundamentally like in hip-hop as we know it and I'm really stuck on like the implications of Drake specifically you know fundamentally altering Hip Hop's like efficacy like the foundational elements of it right and it kind of really gets to the point that Kendrick was making that he's not like us like he's really not a part of this culture um van lean said this thing on on higher on his on his podcast Higher Learning that like the thing about Drake that he really really really has never gotten no over is like that childhood trauma of never really being black enough right and I think like while push T kind of got at that like for sure in their beef I think Kendrick nailed it in a way that very clearly bothered Drake on on a on just a totally different level like the thing we remember about the push a te kind of beef was that he like had a kid but the thing that really is at the core of the Kendrick Lamar beef is that you are not really black enough and we can debate whether or not that's appropriate whether or not he's a culture vulture whether or not he's really a part of the culture but the the truth is like you know he started that song out by saying like like he start after after Kendrick ended his song saying we don't want to hear you say that word no more right like and Drake starts his song saying the word he says you always rapping like you're trying to get the slaves free like there's something like psychological happening which isane line it's an insane line that that no black person would ever say I'm just gonna put that out there no black it like proved the point beautifully honestly it was such a great comedy and timing yes I don't think he's able to get over that and it's one of those things where it's like the Abus of boyfriend who's like if I can't have you nobody can right it's like if I can't own hip-hop if I can't be the center of the hip-hop world then we're gonna destroy hip-hop entirely and and it's like I'm processing that right now to think like man how how far gone do you actually have to be to like not recognize what you're doing in this moment and the way that it will fundamentally change the art form that you claim you guys you guys know about the gay he doesn't actually love it sorry FD no okay yeah so do you guys know about the gay family like the Marvin Gay's uh like like like kids so they've had this pretty crazy run where they've sued quite a few songwriters and producers over being like oh this is very similar to Marvin Gay songs but here's the thing didn't they get in Robin Thick's they got Robin they beat Robin Fick but I think they lost to like Ed sh maybe Ed but they they beat thi and forel because here's the problem um what they were trying to copyright is groove groove is the when when you have like a song it's like the relationship between the bass and the drum so pretty much everything that you're kind of feeling like the the the way the Rhythm goes like what afro beat versus a hip-hop Groove versus a funk groove like the the key indicative elements indicative elements uh those are what suing on and saying that that's copyrighted to Marvin Gay if you do that music just crumbles right and when they won against forel it really hurt music for like a long time because it limited the kind of songs you could do it limited what was being able what labels would fund at the time because it was still a very label driven industry right um and now since they've lost to a cheeran a lot more stuff has opened up because it has reversed that pre I don't know if it's reversed the previous ruling but it up more Avenues to be able to experiment more with music and you don't have to get you're not worried about being sued into Oblivion every 10 seconds right um again like this kind of stuff like like is so it's it's funny like it's it's cute for people who want to play politics and music but it is detrimental to the art form if you really give a [ __ ] about it like it's very clear who sees music as like hip-hop as this culture and who sees hip-hop as a business right in this whole beef and I think like if you were trying to if if if the if the allegation is who's really like about hip hop who's really like driving this culture forward um and who is just there for like shits and giggles and bailing because that's what also Drake said to kendri he said oh when Taylor Swift needs a song you're there um I think Drake's actions post his beef have kind of confirmed everything it's not it's not only that he's being a salty little [ __ ] it's that he's confirmed every single thing that was said about him even though he like like it was it's and then something about like I think it was like a picture leak like a week or two back from his father uh his Drake's father having a grandaughter also that just doesn't like from an OP rap battle is about Optics right you've completely lost the Optics battle like you fumbled it like it's not like you've you've kind like you've fumbled it it's crazy to me um can I I want to go back to DOI actually yeah cuz Olay says something that I thought I've been percolating a lot about DOI um because I'm one of you know I was talking about my my uh toxic masculine Awakening to Beyonce um way back in when was single lady was that like 20 2009 it had to be because before I got married because I remember my wife was singing it she was my wife at the time um and like DOI was somebody I've been KN DOI for a minute and I've been telling other dudes of my Elder Millennial old school hipop purist type ilk yo DOI and they be like and they'll take one look at what at the time was like gay DOI and be like nah that ain't real hip hop you know whatever and so uh Olay asks why is DOI suddenly popping and it's really simple it's C she did a a a hippity hop boom bap rap song that that's the whole point of what boom bap was and it's so funny because it's so on the nose and still good at the same time and the critique of her own success it's it's it's as it it's really an amazing piece of meta commentary within the song Because doi's been significant for a while and I always have to take take this how you will if if DOI was was light-skinned she'd be Doja cat she'd be way bigger than she is right now 100% um but she was still significant but when uh the Joe Buttons of the world um I don't know that may not be fair to but the Joe Button the I I have such a huge issue with Jo Joe and academics ruined there's like because I don't think say one thing before before like there's a huge issue with like the fact that like because we were talking about hip-hop fans there are hip-hop fans who love boombap and are elst about boombap there are also conversely super gatekeep hip hop fans who only love new current [ __ ] and everything everything else is corny as [ __ ] right like and both of them have no like like like have no care for like really good Innovative stuff when it comes out like there are a lot of people who dismiss DOI you know what it you know what it is is people are onedimensional like people are very onedimensional and they they view things through the one dimension that they saw it out at the time right like so I know that that that's what it is about dogee cuz you could I'm like DOI I've seen how they talk about her because they're seeing her now and they're like oh yeah she's covered up it's not all that Hy cover I'm like all the eras of DOI DOI is definitely like she's all of the things right and and and the funny the interesting thing about what's frustrating about that is it it speaks to like you know what it is you need to do to be approved by certain people but the problem is is then you get stuck in that like it makes me think of my like like when I went on The Breakfast Club and I do my best Olivia Pope in comparison to like what I would typically look like you know what I mean depending on where you see me but then you get this whole audience of black people who now want you to look Olivia popit and that's the standard that they see you by and that's made me nervous for DOI because I'm like I see them praising her because it's the way that they like they'll praise women who like oh raps city is dope cuz her clothes are on Tiara wack is dope cuz the clothes are on you know what I mean and like while they're [ __ ] on all they can't see that and that's what they're doing now with doy and at the same time that it's getting her like the approval of someone those oldheads it gets her hated on by these younger think she's just that like d like her cuz she's that boom b d and I'm like DOI you vote her say what it is you know what I mean her persuasive era she's doing I'm like it's funny the DOI that people are seeing now is so do different than like what I picture doi to be in my brain she's just giving them the era that suits this particular album but they don't see it kind of makes me think of like Tyler the Creator I was watching a bunch of Tyler Creator Clips in interviews last night I couldn't sleep random but Tyler Creator talked about how like how he first got on because liked that boom bity of Yonkers which he said was a joke he was making fun of how New York do that boom bity you know what I mean and then it and then it popped and then you saw him in that lens and it was like he had to keep recreating every TI of Creator project is a new TI of Creator but he had to show them that he was those different things because they just were putting him in that one lens and I feel like that's what they're doing to do now and DOI literally has been if like she has been um documenting her Journey on YouTube four years um she talks about her experiences all of that she talks about where she's um you know she makes goals for herself that's where I kind of came and really loved her before she even popped with the you know what it is with Kodak and um uh the p soace with which was a very big um Instagram Tik Tok um song and so I say this to say like you know she I think shows even before the music though she's always had this type of um personality and characteristic where she doesn't Place herself in one box she will pivot tomorrow she will pivot five minutes ago and she doesn't apologize for that she um sets these goals for herself she's out loud if you ask her a question she will answer it if she don't want to share anything with you she won't sh that's how she's always been she likes to be sexy she likes to from going to sexy sometimes she'll wear Rock her fro some people don't even know her with her her fro they only know her with I know yep that was I remember this look and she wouldn't wear phenomenal know yeah and and that's her right now she's just in her element of let me uh just just tell my story that's where I'm at I don't want people to focus on my sexiness right now it's just telling my story but if she wants to flip it and go back to that DOI or be somebody new this is what I like about her as an artist she is all of the things very unapologetically and authentically because you can be that one that's actually you unfortunately Drake have that got it we haven't seen a real Drake in like a decade and a half you guys are saying that like DOI doi's never like people tried to St like people have tried to put a lot of artists in boxes right doi's like I'm not gonna fit in this one box I'm gonna be in multiple boxes Drake found one box that they stereotyped him in and just for the next 10 years is like yes this is great for me I'm just gonna be here and just make a million dollars every single time not not that because you don't make you make money y'all want to get back to that uh Tik Tock convo we we were having yes please yeah I know we I know we bought to run out of time and I had I had some more heat com um I don't know how to I don't know how we Aon you'll figure it out um going back we talking about Tik to like the the Tik Tok band and what's going to happen for creators and where they're going in the different like course and think pie the bar for entry for content is very low like the for entry but the bar for like success in content whatever much higher you know what I mean so I think we were talking about all the world around that that's enough to dump you off FD yeah thank you thank you and we were getting into specifically like what's GNA work and what's not going to work outside of Tik Tok and something hadn't been said that uh I was was percolating but I didn't get to it and shout out I guess uh Julie talks about this a lot in her Tik Tok which is that there's a there's a group of well let me not say group there's a genre of Tik Tok that works very well that can only work on Tik Tok and that is the conflict rage bait um G and and when I hear when I heard y'all talking about way there's like people fighting about what they are and aren't going to do on Tik Tok and going to red cycle or whatever in China Red Red Zone red beans and rice um but basically like without because Tik Tock one of the reasons why it can bring you an audience is because Tik Tock very effectively like breaks down the human conditions like this was make this this is what makes you Advanced monkeys react you get angry or you get horny and you start commenting sharing and posting so we're gonna make sure that's what most of Tik Tock is and I don't see uh thirsty comment content on YouTube um I don't see I barely well no Instagram's different like I don't know I don't know Instagram be Instagram be catching me I'm like man I wasn't looking for this um but without the algorithm feeding that I'm just I'm just keeping I need people to understand I'm still like I'm 40 about to be 43 and I'm married but I'm not a a monk that's a whole another conversation but you get my point though like without those things to drive content people that think no shade some shade people that think they're talented that think they're creative are going to struggle without being able to like produce well um nurtured drama Cycles on social media because other social media platforms aren't built around drama Cycles I don't know I don't know that's true YouTube is there's an entire Reddit subsection called YouTube yeah there is but there's a not like TI for it there not like how like everybody on Tik Tok it's like if one thing was said or someone don't like something to say then it's the culture of everybody jump on this now because it's trending that's how we're going to get hot who has a person that gets cancelled you know gets trouble like that there all the drama con will do on that one person you know but it's not as you know I'm saying like it also the cycle this the the cycle the the quick cycle of Rage happens really quick on Tik Tok I mean you made a comment about my recap video about what happened with the whole Beyonce stuff that all happened in a matter of like um eight days maybe like it's such a quick turnaround that I've only only seen that be replicated on Twitter that's the only spot that I've seen it be replicated where it's like you wake up the next day and now there's some new beef that had to come from this beef you'll you'll miss the whole season on Twitter and that's because and that's because the comment section from YouTube comes to life on Tik Tok so that one sentence from the YouTube space can't they because they're not going to make a whole video not everybody's gonna do it because you said FD and that you know I can say that everybody ain't got it to do a 30 minute something off of one in of a but people will go to Tik Tok and start up some kind of War something off of that because they know this will this will this is going to get off like this girl that said this about Beyonce oh no let's make sure we go in about it they don't need to do much or say much or make it anything that actually has any significance people would just scream just scream into the the you just hit on Tik Tok made the comment section the content that's what it is and that like it it didn't exist because like right now if me and insert other person here because I feel like every like me and a lot of the the cornbread dudes we're all cool but like every other week it feels like somebody's saying something to get one of them to be mad at me is some weird shady [ __ ] so if me and Lil Bill had beef it wouldn't be possible for that beef to exist with between anybody else but me and him and other folks with a platform but on Tik Tok if you anybody can it can be third Tik Tock and like if it's fiery enough if they got enough heat in those bars then it can be just as prominent and significant as people with much larger platforms I cut off Garrison my I'm just gonna say that the the thing that I that stands out to me about YouTube the big difference is like the Zeitgeist the like the the Hot Topic of the moment is actually like much longer than on on on on on YouTube than it is on Tik Tok on Tik Tok you know you have to jump on the trend today because it might not be the thing that people are talking about tomorrow and so it leads to like this kind of dog piling where like all these people are making videos about this one thing right now and and and like that's the whole algorithm for for this section of the time whereas on YouTube people I just saw like legal eagle posted a video about Matt Gates the the report that came about him he posted a video weeks after that thing happened say big creators can revive what seemed like a dead topic on YouTube because people are still thinking about it I got time sit here and let this run in the bag while I'm exercising like I got time for that I I actually didn't I didn't get much from it from a Tik Tok video because they're rereading things they don't have time to really sit down and give you know but on YouTube I did research I did this is an investigative report okay baby I did my time I even got people who are experts on the matter who are coming in or I've grabbed some some uh um about to call it SS I grabbed some interviews where I actually you probably missed it and this actually gives the whole story like research all that stuff goes into the YouTube and the long forms and this is not no dig because I know people are gonna watch this and be like because this is how they're doing on threads they don't got like Tik Tok really this is how I make my money this is and it's beautiful and I I love that for you because they are making their coin okay people are rich people are living their life people are killing each other over there on Tik Tok over you know over content however he on YouTube I don't think if you don't then this goes into what saying Olay if you don't and I'll take it from you because me and you have conversations about it all the time about how to be better what goes into it what that looks like and if you don't have the patience or the drive to try to learn how to actually give yourself a personality past just sitting and looking at the camera um and letting the song play or stealing somebody else's content dance moves or whatever you you're not going to thrive on YouTube because we we we we're not going to you're just not going to thrive on YouTube like if you want to put the work in and and still do your shorts to get your Tik Tok Vibe you can do that or you GNA be consistent like like you know it's not just like about drama content it has to be content like you have to make some argument some case some video essay I will say this I'll I'll say to the I guess what it the marketplace is different like in the sense when are in trouble on Tik Tok when when are in trouble as in everybody is talking about it or talking [ __ ] about them that's not a a harm to them on Tik Tok I said be getting hot you know what I mean like that is the common market like they [ __ ] on you they all dunk in you and they go about their business but it's not to end you if a is for whatever reason is in so much trouble all YouTube video essays start making cont they're actually in trouble like they're about to lose Advertiser [ __ ] is it like for example Illuminati I remember when like Illuminati I was on a show with Illuminati at the time I to me forgot about Illuminati the greatest cancellation I ever seen in my life I like I I pull it up Illustrated people like it happened it happened when with you guys happened with uh H bomber guy when he dropped some [ __ ] on bro like three times end if you typing Illuminati go go go look it is the entire just over just video essay after video Essay with millions of views and all that like for more than a year it was like two years ago I remember when like that started she fed that up her own self like on Twitter and she took it let me tell you something everything was cool until she took that to YouTube she took it to YouTube She's the she made the video and once they were like oh let me jump in the algorithm and Rel last that was hot it was sh they swallowed her whole advertisers gone this and the next thing like when they're talking [ __ ] about you on on Twitter they're talking [ __ ] about you on Twitter but they don't truly do nothing in your life and that don't leave that app I don't no I would push back on that because the maybe not for MoneyWise as in like social media advertisement because I'm not on YouTube like that but firing I've know a good amount of folks who have lost their jobs from from a Tik Tock from a Tik Tok drama everything you're describ I'm thinking of it I'm thinking when I think drama or like in the people I'm talking about getting in trouble I'm guess I'm talking about people who are they're not in trouble because they're like I'm not talking about the people who you really fcked up you did you were they got you there like you really fcked up you can get in trouble more so like I don't like what you like oh like when um skinny what's her name slim slim some the other day was in trouble like everybody was mad because she made a video want to be skinny like a thing like that like she's not gonna get nothing is GNA happen in her life but they're eating her up all over the place but nothing is gonna happen you know what I mean with that it depends because I've seen people be where it's like I dang this is hard for me as a therapist now I'm calling the board on you and you're losing your license like I I think it right well so that's like the black like the sister the um the sister therapist that got a little spicy talking about black man and she became the the focal point of the black manosphere for a good six months um oh brick girl remember the brick girl and we had the conversation about that was a whole thing and then it was like oh now we believe talking people who had like specific heightened bars of their profession or they involv the law in some way you know what I mean like like that's the thing I have my own Creator friend who got like fired from his legal jobs because of but he actively was saying [ __ ] that you know you're gonna get in trouble for that are carried away we got fired for some [ __ ] I love you that was saying she was saying and then ended up going to we it got to us and then um basically she was working for some nonprofit that was owned by a black company and then next thing you know she thought she was gonna get in the Maga and then Maga saw that she her kids were a little light-skinned so they said we can't even have you in in the group so she got fired from a job that she was temporary at um somebody around here in Dunwoody um uh Atlanta they drove up to somebody at a gas station and was like go back to your country but had the whole Buckhead Landscaping system on the side of the truck lost their job lost their job so sometime Tik Tock was is able to be a quick and you know investigation like they will find everything go on they can be I clearly T to my apologies no no no I think actually I still goad goad think it also like tie into what you're gonna say FD but like everything you guys have described like I think every all of it's true but I think also to an extent like the one thing that isn't true is saying that there's never been a platform like that before there has it's Twitter like this Tik Tok is Twitter with video right it has the same exact Cadence right oh you made this piece of content or this line from this show or this thing that happened let me illuminate on that line and we're all going to quote retweet it and dunk on whoever we quote retweeted Tik Tok is the same you how many times have you been scrolling and you've seen somebody Stitch a vid like five seconds of a video where you don't know the rest of the context and then just make a 10minute takedown on that five seconds of video it's entirely built on like you know building on top of like especially the commentary section specifically on building on top of and dunking on other people that's how the Cadence Works what what makes it different is Twitter has never paid as many people and created and put as many people on is like don't get me wrong if you got put on on Twitter it meant something in terms of you know the lanes of first of all to get put on on Twitter is a specific culture of people it has to be people like you're intelligent you know what I mean it's what you thinking thought leader journalist y yada y these kinds of like [ __ ] like me who got popping on Twitter right um so there's that but also Twitter wasn't earning you no money Twitter was not getting you know what I mean like you had to like do other things and be proactive and figure out how to like make it work to your benefit and do a want to real work to like make it shake to do something but Tik Tok put a not only did Tik Tok put a [ __ ] ton of people on but it put a [ __ ] ton of people on that would not be would not traditionally have been able to get on on other apps because of the waight algorithms are set up because all of this right like Tik Tok I know but there's a lot of people on Twitter there a lot of people on Twitter who are in maybe not in the culture is I think the culture of Tik Tok and Twitter are similar but I think the algorithms are fundamentally different like that's what I've been hearing people talk about it's like the fundamental nature of the Tik Tok algorithm of feeding you a bunch of [ __ ] up of people maybe wouldn't have follow you would have never seen it's it's doing that you know what I mean and keeping you on here forever in a way that I think maybe others aren't I would I would agree with one thing I want the the the I think the the thing especially as we're talking about people transitioning from Tik Tok right sorry I think I got something caught in my throat is because the barrier of Entry is so low and and that is just fundamentally true and the what T what makes you successful on Tik Tok is not necessarily an absence of talent because it takes again I I be making Tik toks and I be like my Tik toks suck [ __ ] why can't I be as quick wited and and shorten to the point as these other people I be watching yeah that's one of the reason why I don't make Tik Tok very often um so like I'm not saying it's not a talent but it's a specific type of talent that is easier to reproduce share spread respond to and creates that culture and going back to what Olay said earlier what YouTube rewards when it it when it does come to conflict and beef and cancelling does have if your career is the content creation far more dire and Lasting circumstances I know a few creators not just video essayist but influ the influencer types you know vloggers Etc that because they were on YouTube and because of the way YouTube manages drama and because of how long it can last no they were out the game yeah it was it like like right everybody that was in this Beyonce if if Tik Tok survives past I guess this weekend or whatever everybody that had a big blowup in this Beyonce Civil War is gonna be fine not a single person that that got drugged for a couple of days is going to lose their career over any specific thing that they did unless there's like a severely concerted effort a couple of them should one dude abusing kids some [ __ ] I don't know but like child I don't know nothing about it I don't want to do no D name but I heard I heard that uh like so everybody will have their career back but I can name off the top of my head four or five video essayists or influencers that make some of them it's just this was a bad video you tried to you tried on this person it didn't work like several that's all it is the uh the impraise the Shadows dude that was a horror he was a horror Creator he made a really bad video and I like dude he made a really bad video calling some people out and it's been over for since he has not gotten his channel back up to health he might get there but the difference is serious I watched you in the company man sparter kick was the dirt in the back oh right some you cancel that was you cancel somebody y listen FD be so casual come up like little bside just a little quick I won't even I'm not even gonna write a video just do a quick little stream your life up I was trying people was mad I was too nice but it did it didn't make it did put the I be forgetting that I got Shooters so as soon as I like put a as soon as I point to a [ __ ] like it becomes currency and that's and it really that's what it is that that same outrage cycle on Tik Tok that's eight days on YouTube is two years like legit two years long if not more yeah I've seen and and I'm sorry and the money because there's a bigger Financial incentive because like Tik Tok I know some people getting paid and getting paid well and there's other opportunities don't nobody pay like YouTube asses it's not even close just letting y'all know if y'all come through come through get this get this get these coins if you can do it like for real don't nobody pay like YouTube content sponsorships I don't know I I for I St so I feel like I've seen on YouTube in the YouTube and I don't and again I have to put this out there because this disclaiming because people be like why well they on YouTube and I'm just now getting my own YouTube channel and getting your YouTube channel from the ground because I used to just do it for the show that I worked on and the one that I had before that that had a lot of numbers my likeliness was owned by the company that I worked for so they deleted it have all my stuff so starting from scratch and doing it it ain't no joke but seeing people you know uh do their work and that YouTube is their space because I've never I never felt look I never just Instagram was for me personally for me to throw ass a couple of times you know go out be sexy do my thing and then YouTube was just my space to actually be I don't care if my Instagram family which is my blood family or whatever from Facebook watch my stuff because people are crying about that on the internet too God my family ising on my videos for them to watch it yeah it's not for them to watch I don't really give a damn I don't want to talk politics with my cousin and them but there are people who actually want to hear from me with politics or my life or the other things that I do yeah I'll go ahead and and and and and do that on on in the YouTube space but when I see like I kind of like I want everybody to go where they feel they can do it or whatever but don't come over here and expect Tik to and expect Tik Tok on YouTube that's the big problem TI I don't want to knock Tik Tok because Tik Tok when I need to find a quick recipe because I just got in the kitchen about four or five years ago I'm Haitian but I just got in the kitchen about four or five years ago and when I need to find a quick recipe and I just attached black people at the end of the recipe search that I'm looking for that's enough for me I need to know how to make this black people and that and I love that Tik Tok will give me all the black hands all the all the the black people cooking and it I've have become a good cook because of it I ain't GNA hold you because going on YouTube and having a scroll like girl get to it okay oh my God now see I can go on Tik Tok and find this person give me the recipe five minutes tops I can go in that kitchen and cook me a good meal and I'm a cook I'm a better cook because of it so Tik Tok ain't all bad and YouTube ain't all bad but no or or whatever if people still on Twitter at this point I don't even give a damn because we have seen from this threads situation with um Mark Zuckerberg attaching himself to Donald Trump uh and and doing an Elon Musk type um uh strategy over there on threads now it it it's like who none of these nowhere is safe if if that's where people are moving and why they're moving we move from Twitter to find a safer space we get over the threads only to find out that the same the same kind of uh um takeover that Elon Musk did at Twitter here goes Mark Zuckerberg who already owned it and who was saying that he wants to save us and give us a space to be able to be protected and all that now he's saying F all that you know I'm no more N word blocking nothing of that no factchecking for real we're gonna have Community notes and Community notes are always better even though fact checking wasn't even doing what they needed to do in the beginning but now this is just getting all bad so if people are moving because they're looking for a safer space I want every time I go to Blue Sky there's an eerie silence it's an eerie silence on Blue Sky and I'm like it's just hello is anybody here're silence and and and but I say that to say like I love blue scy I think blue Scott is really really nerdy though and that might be why yeah blue Scott like I'm all up in blue Scott and all I got is all I have is Anime memes um video game stuff minimal politics anybody on social media like for what people want for platforms like when I see people debating about what where what why they want to go where they want to go or why and most of the conversation is about where they can go viral where they can get the biggest audience for me I'm at a place in my social media career where I I want you to leave me alone on the apps like I really like I want to create my content on YouTube and I actually don't want to talk to people because what I realize is a lot of these apps are built on contention like people are not they're not reading what you say to like take what they find valuable they're reading it to find what they can nitp because that's the culture of the the app that's where that's how they build currency and for me I feel like a lot of the things that I want to talk about or the arguments that I want to say or my opinion on things I know that if I make a long form video on YouTube and you sit down and listen to it more people than not are going to understand what I'm saying and not going to be carrying on but if I try to create the Tic Tac version uh uh of like the short bite bite for Twitter or for Threads or whatever of that point where you can't flesh it out it's just fighting a fight and it's like you're being misunderstood anyway so I don't see the point I will say this about like I feel compelled to make sure I say this about Tik Tok What make the Tik Tok ban is incredibly significant not just like how you feel about Tik Tok or [ __ ] how you feel about Tik Tok creators any of those things what they're effectively trying to do is like allow for American like these American billionaires to have monopolies on apps like to force any it's like it goes Way Beyond Tik Tok What the law is right it's to be able to force any app to be sold or whatever and all this under pretent so it's incredibly significant for a lot more reasons that are being acknowledged in the discourse so I want to say that one two as far as like the app like as a creator for me it's like it's like what do you want out of out of your platforms you're trying to build or your career what you're doing longterm with it like if you're just trying to do for me I think of abs and I'm trying to I'm thinking about longevity like if you something and this is what you want to do and you want to keep doing it in the world that we're in especially as a Creator where you have to like create you have to come up with ideas you have to be this there's a certain level of uncertainty about how long you can do that or stay as relevant or blah blah blah and so I think about where am I creating the most meaningful like audience and community that are invested in me and the reality is there are always on every app there are people who are going to be the biggest people on that app and [ __ ] is different for them what they you know like their opportunities and what it means for them but the average person or average like person who even has like a large a larger platform on a Tik Tok does not have those Tik Tok followers are not worth what a YouTube follower is it just isn't or you know what I mean and it's not just it's the same thing for Instagram Instagram uh subscribers are not the same thing and for me I've seen a [ __ ] ton of uh people who are and I know them [ __ ] ton of people personally who are very big on Tik Tok who cannot get 10,000 people to tune in to what they're doing on YouTube or somewhere else or anything when they try to transfer transfer that because what happens is the nature of how the app is set up it's like yeah they'll follow with scroll everybody's following and clicking like whatever if it's shown to them with ease you know what I mean like that is low but as far as getting them to like invest in that Creator or leave that after that Creator I have seen so many times now in the last several years a Tik Tok creator with millions of followers get arrested for murder multiple and [ __ ] and it's not even like Their audience is like oh yeah I had noticed they posted in a while because they have they might have a million followers but on Tik Tok but they do not have a million people or even 10,000 people who are in them as a person or Creator so for me I'm more concerned like to me 100,000 people watching your video on on Instagram is not the same thing as a 100,000 watching your [ __ ] on YouTube and that's what it is for me I'm trying to think about like that's how I see it like to me I see YouTube yes YouTube is a [ __ ] ton more work the like to be successful on YouTube is very like daunting you know all of this but I find what you're getting for what you're putting in and if you're able to be successful at that is just not comparable nowhere near I think the the the the like I think you hit the nail on the head like it's also like yeah what you said about the culture of Tik Tok it's less about the followers you have and more about what the and also like what the algorithm feeds you the way that the way that Tik Tok calculates views is by who it serve something to right that's why you have thousands of like like thousands of likes and everything like that because and there's plenty of videos with like hundreds of thousands of views and only like a few likes right so I think it's I think I think you hit the nail on the head with all of that I also think that like I I think one thing we should keep in mind is Tik Tok is also a much newer platform than YouTube is YouTube took time to get to this place right and I think that just by that nature it's going to have more money involved in order for that to that to function the one thing that I do think that you're 100% spot on about which I think more people should be thinking about is the fact that you find a platform not longterm sanity like I think that conversation that you were mentioning about how people um are trying to find a platform to go viral on that's not going to make you but the platform is not what makes you viral it's your content in relation to that platform that makes you viral so there are plenty of Tik tokers who can come to YouTube who can learn the platform and make it work I came from Tik Tok I I did a Tik Tok that went viral and then Philip def Franco found me was like no you're going to do YouTube now and I love YouTube I think it's an amazing platform I've always wanted to have this kind of a kind of a platform and understanding it better has made me a much more a better Creator a better uh a better musician a better a better commentator all of those things I think that um th this this deed to go viral or this need for okay well this platform it's very very easy if you really have it and I think a lot of Tik Tok creators do have it they'll be able to function on other platforms this happened with Vine Vine went away King Bach a lot of them did but a lot of them stayed there's a lot of people who who transitioned from Vine to YouTube or to Instagram and stick and stuck around so if but a handful by comparison huh like I say about it like here's the thing right if you look at the rise and fall apps which by the way I'm glad you reminded us that YouTube has been around longer because to me that's another point in the era of like watching the rise and fall of many apps come and go YouTube has shown me that YouTube has the greatest staying power I could feel safest that YouTube is going to be around there's no guantee to anything but there's also that um when it came like Vine is a Franchesca Lee like has a Franchesca Ramsey that's she's chela chesal on on socials but franessa Ramsey talks about this a lot because she's kind of she's a veteran Creator and it's been on all these apps there are many people when YouTu when vine went there were a bunch of creators who were huge on Vine that just went away like fresh like plenty of them and they're a handful of the Su that are that are successful and because they were able you know what I mean they did other things with it like I'm thinking of like my my cousin King Batch King Bat brother King Batch fire Sigma this goes into what I was about to say this goes into what FD had brought up earlier about that some of these skills that are online in online content can stay online and some of them have to be transferable to outside and there's been this blend of like social media content blending in with entertain it's entertainment industry I consider entertainment industry um and just based B off of the people that contact you and the way that you were able to monetize were an Entertainer entertainers and sometimes that entertainment can stay online or be a podcast or be audio video video over here through social media and some of those skills to be transferred into like what you would consider Hollywood or entertainment and like the people that disappear if you're someone who I don't know as a streamer you might not have to know how to write a script or act in a show or public speaking um outside of maybe a couple like comic conventions and stuff but if you're doing skits online and you're funny online or you're doing something that could be transfer transferred to a keynote speech or whatever like that stuff if the app fails and Falls can you do can you speak at public events can you act can you write a script can you make your skit something long form where it's like Franchesca Ramsey is a good example yeah she started on YouTube and then she wants it decoded and then she has written for shows and like she's been able to go back and forth between having the online content and staying with social media apps and she's also had to be within entertainment in the Hollywood Ro yeah and she can tell you um what she has a million times in 50 million ways on social media that um she's failed at times this thing isn't something where you just jump in some people can just jump in but they don't know how to maintain you'll see people jump in and be able to do that because this was a hit moment um this was a Spur the moment time where you actually shined um but like you were saying are your skills transferable now your audience may expect a story from you every other week or now you just show them who you are what you can do or whatever figure that out but like I just feel like it's the space isn't for everyone like you may not be someone who needs to be on social media how can you be somebody who shines on the outside you may be somebody who needs to be on the stage you may be somebody who needs to be that speaker editor or there is you may be like you know we need the mics to stop being sold but that's a story for another day now I just feel like you know people are so upset right now because it's forcing them to think about where they're going to go and the thing I keep seeing like you guys are saying is this focus on my followers my money my my virality people don't care about money they care about visibil bro I keep I've been saying this for years like chasing visibility they're not even chasing money like when you hear them talk about it because honestly where the money and all that stuff comes out isn't like in the work you know what I mean is in how much work you have to put it people are trying oh when you hear them talking when you like tear it apart what they fundamentally everyone is asking is how can I get the most out of doing the least you know what I mean and like the truth is they look at because the bar for entry is so low for create for creation to be a Creator they think that that's where it's going to be but the truth is to be really successful in creation there is no overnight success and there is um uh you have to do a [ __ ] a [ __ ] ton of work and people are not interested in hearing that like can yeah goe one one thing I do think and um that people need to hear though as we talk about the hard work is that this isn't capitalist realism you also got to be lucky like I know a lot of really talented hardworking creators that it just ain't it ain't happening for them just not yeah um or even worse they got a shot they got a look they had a couple of Buzz moments and they couldn't sustain them for whatever reason like reasons out their control reasons we can't even understand it just a happen so also understand that coming to YouTube because YouTube is so fickle um and actually I guess this happened on Tik Tok too because I got people I followed years ago whose videos I never see until I go to my legit following page like oh I forgot about you um so like like be prepared for that struggle both like financially and mentally that you probably are making good stuff you probably are um like you probably aren't untalented but YouTube is very Mercurial in who it puts into its algorithm bloodstream and who it says no not for you and there's ways to like stay there longer that you can understand and learn but getting in there in the first place is so much DUS in the wind it just you know did you I want to piggy back off that I I'll let you go Garrison that that just made me um think because one I think sometimes that's that's also true and something I've realized in my own self is sometimes your [ __ ] is not as good as you thought it was like I can think of like I there are mons times I go in ABS and flows of being discouraged or whatever in terms of creation right some things that you think like should have done better should have done this or whatever some things you work the hardest on often and that they don't get the views and the easiest things you thought like you put the least amount of energy in did well or whatever and all this but in thinking of like when I started YouTube and the amount of like discouragement you might feel or you wanted this video to do this or you thought it was so much better but when I look back at my content or every video I'm trying to improve and you're like oh it wasn't that good like it doesn't deserve all the views that you think it is a lot of times you see people complaining or whatever and stuff like that but it's like you're might your [ __ ] might not be that good like look at what the best really doing right and like constantly you know uh Elevate and also too don't get discouraged so early like I've been seeing this like I've seen this and like even bigger creators like if I think of you know the Joe Buton podcast Don't Shoot Me flip because I I don't know you and I see he get mad when people comment on on stuff but like flip on the Joe Buton Network flip is uh one of the cast members in the Joe Button podcast he has a show called improper improv that he does on the network and like this season you know I guess it he feel like you know it's struggled to get its footing a little bit or something you know um and maybe the views like they had one episode like the last episode where the views like kind of dropped off sign signicantly from where they were and the [ __ ] wrapped the show up like you know what I mean and I was like that kind of mental like I think about that and I'm like you won't have successful things if you expect it to perform like that every time or you think because it went you know there was a dip or something like quit it like I think like my first episode of Olay and friends that made me want to do I think maybe got 70 80 some thousand views which I hadn't been getting on my Channel at the time so I'm like oh let me do this again and my second episode o and friends maybe the time got like 20,000 you know if I had been like ah damn it wasn't those views so let me quit it [ __ ] it you know what I mean you won't get you won't get there so I think that's also something to keep in mind like please don't there's a misconception that blow up overnight because people it's the same way I can see people calling DOI an industry plan because they think she blew up overnight and she' been in the game for years like with projects and stuff like don't mislead yourself to think these other people are doing so well and that just happened like like after you be talking all the time by the time you was in Small creative purgatory and no one was watching them videos a year and a half yeah I was in that mother for a year like do not know I I have like do not scroll to the bottom of my page cuz folks be like you GNA make a video about this I'm like yeah I did it in 2022 yeah I did it in 20120 in 2020 what you mean talk about Hamilton Garrison was to that point though a couple things one I think about what Kobe said rest in peace Kobe was like you got to love practice right like that's the actual point is that you just have to have a love for practicing and that's what leads to Greatness and I think like a lot of people jump into this and Tik Tok definitely facilitated this Vine facilitated this before that where you can just kind of do a couple things and blow up and now you're influencer or content creator and you really didn't love the actual work of coming up with ideas to share online and like I think about Franchesca she's a writer and she probably been a writer and been planning to be a writer for a very very long time and it shows because she loves the work of it all I think about ufd Olay everybody on this call like you love the idea you love the work of sharing ideas in an interesting way for people to consume and I think that's really at the heart of it I tell people all the time like going viral actually kind of sucks it's actually one of the worst things that can happen to you like surprisingly one of the worst things that can happen is going viral it will ruin your life going viral because you would rather and I tell people this all the time I'm like I can't be with Y that sh changed my life if you go viral for doing the thing that you want to do great right at the same time like accident yeah I've made videos that have gone viral in rightwing circles and I have literal death threats on my door right like I have literal people calling my phone leaving my address as the voicemail on my phone you know what I mean like that has happened and so it can end up in the wrong places I think it's better and this is just my opinion I think it's better to gain you know on 20 40 50 60 70,000 view videos over the course of a year get your kind of following up on people who actually want to be there rather than going viral and ending up in in in circles of people who want nothing to do with you who actually just hate you right and and and and so like there are pros and cons I'm not trying to like like you know down going and viral I'm just saying that like there are risks to this right like there are a hazardous occupational kind of risk to going viral into doing content and you have to actually love what you're doing the last thing I'll say is that to that to that point you got to kind of know what it is that you want to do to a degree like I I do feel like there is a discovery process and you have to be willing to experiment but I think a lot of people go into content creation not really having much grounding on why they're making content to begin with and so the discouragement is because it's not blowing up but are you contributing to the conversation are you putting something out there that in a year or two years or three years will still be relevant or you'll still be proud of even if you think the craftsmanship could be better you're proud of the content and I think that's a part of it you have to think about that my biggest video year you actually want to create yeah like my biggest video from 2024 was a video about OJ Simpson and the nword and I'm love that video I made it three years agoo I made it three years ago that joint sat at 785 views for a year and a and then OJ died and then OJ died and it blew up you know what I mean and that's like that's the way it kind of works but I'm so like I look back at the video and I think oh man I should have changed this or I could have done that better I said this kind of weird but like I'm proud of the cont you feel me like I like the content that I made and and it connected with people yeah my most watch video on my channel is the jankiest [ __ ] I I made is my Election Day video that I had to make my myself in the dead of night because Aaron my editor is asleep like it's janky ain't got no nothing like oh okay almost a millionaire all like that but then jumping you um to what you're saying to I think about the the value in creating a back catalog I think maybe FD told me this I either learned this or FD told me this when I first got on YouTube but will be chasing viral or you want everybody to see your channel but like it is a I think I think it's um I think it's not think it's the same way when an artist has one hit blow up but they don't have any other music like they don't have an album or anything out scramble to try to get something out or whatever to capitalize on that it's the same thing it's like it's unfortunate if you have one your video your your one blowup catchup and you don't have a back catalog for those people to stay there on the channel and have other things to watch and I've seen that happen a lot of times like you'll see a video that's super successful you click on the channel there's nothing else like it so the subscribers aren't there they're not coming back for it so you kind of there's a benefit to take to being able to build up your channel and your back catalog so that when people do find it the [ __ ] is there I think I think also like sorry go ahead Rebecca I'm so sorry but um I feel like I get it and and you know what's so funny I just remember because I have this whole different like um placement into um YouTube right this is when uh Donald Trump first got in I just got my grad degree and I was doing politics and I came in as the a journalist and a blackface I would say for this particular company with Benjamin Dixon and so you know we had to do our own spin-off show from what they had because they had us just covering Donald Trump stuff but they owned my likeliness here so I didn't know anything about monetization in the YouTube space I had videos going two million I had all that on these people's space so when it came time for me to figure out know because they was paying me pennies pennies pennies like you guys come on look at me I I mean I'm good work okay I give and and and so they was giving me pennies and um when I found that out they deleted everything that was associated with them I had a Facebook page I was like at 30,000 at the time that that was huge um I used to get millions of views there I used to get million views on YouTube that kind of stuff and I didn't even know that they were making money off of me at the time and um so all of that work I just decided I'm not making a YouTube page the only YouTube page that I had was the one that I made in college for my um my end of the well my graduate project and that was it that was my only YouTube um page it was um my friends and family and then it was this girl here Olay who kept pushing me like do it on your own girl do it on your own girl and I'm like I just and Rebecca if y'all knew how often I be on Rebecca's ass like because I was ready to quit I was like I don't want to do this they took away I worked hard and all I people do was take from me they just take from me and that's how I was and then she was just like no just do it and you know even right now I don't get the most views I've been in a place where I've did but working from the ground up it feels so much better to me because I remember the death threats that came with everything and all that stuff and I'm not even that person that I was working um um for those people at the time the type of content that I want to cover and do um it you know this I'm starting from here I do have an audience that audience comes from the old some of them come from the old place that I was at but I'm at right now I'm okay with building up I know that I again I know my where my gifts are I know where I want to be I know where I don't want to be I know and so I'm okay with building up but a lot of people are for that Viral space and they want to stick to you know that hot moment but are you doing anything and here I'm just gonna go you know about the heart about it I'm are you doing anything that you know feels good for you like you wake up in the morning and you're like yeah this is this is good for me like this I feel like doing I don't feel pressure to do and that's where I'm at with it you know Joe you know I know you don't like Joe button's said but Joe Button once said a thing that like as a Creator it really resonates and sticks with me but Joe Buton was like when he left everyday struggle because he was like complex was [ __ ] around with him not giving what he wants or whatever for this show that he created um and you know and he always said you know he laughed and that allowed academics to be able to to to uh leverage better and get more out of it but what he said in that when people are like you're just going to leave your show or the most successful thing you did or whatever it's like he's like I'm a Creator like I got other IP I will create other shows and it's about like being able to have a confidence in knowing that like I've left a lot of different [ __ ] like people don't even realize it by the time they realize I'm in the next era or chapter like oh yeah you used to know me on Long crime and then you used to know me on Rising and then you used to know left and every time I'm like leaving a different thing somebody makes the like they think oh that's the best thing that you're G to do like even when I would be like with O and friends when I would tell on my Community page like you actually [ __ ] annoy me and I'm gonna stop making this show if y'all don't stop getting on my nerves they'll be like they' be like oh this the most successful of this cats all of you I'm like no it's not like I created other different show I'm like my Productions Do Better my joints do well like I will create and I do it all the time I create different Blue Points blueprints in entirely different kinds of shows so I think I think there's something what people feel is like stressful like they don't like the idea of building this thing Brick by Brick and stuff I find really comforting like I like the idea that I can feel confident that I know I can do this like I have this skill set I know I can create this thing and keep creating and make this transferable so I think that is like that's something to keep in mind you know what I mean as a Creator at least to hone you know what I mean I do want to say one thing I'm sorry my my camera went off because it's very hot and everything like that um 2025 is a struggle for you oh now you're now I'm Jesus back I'm back I'm back I'm back I'm back all right all right I do like like everything you said like about like the virality thing like I do want to share like um I got famous from the fighting game community community and for the longest time the only stuff that would ever get like any play even though I'm Muslim and I want to talk about the things that are going on in the world I would only have to rap about Street Fighter and that's all I could do that's all I was allowed [ __ ] message that's all I was allowed to do um and then uh like years later I did this thing I did freestyle the news for years with a hundred views like two two two years with like 1002 200 views nothing right and then when finally I I got the the Philip def Franco stuff and and freestyle the news went viral now I couldn't do any Street Fighter content that's not allowed any anymore so like you immediately get put in a box and I think what you're saying O especially about like being a Creator like and and especially Garrison what you said was incredibly important the process is the most important part if you don't love the process you're you're not meant for this right A lot of people love having songs like they love having like I have a content I have this video I made this they don't like the process of make you don't like the process of making the thing that you like doing you don't like doing it you like the attention and you like the fact that it exists but it you're going to be miserable because most of the time like 90% of the time you're making the thing 10% of the time is like oh yes this is nice the results here like and I think oh Sor go for it go for it I'm so I'm so sorry that my green ass was like had his camera you're not green anymore you you're not green anymore I think that like in every other type of creative field people understand that people that take a minute to roll out albums they get that we were talking about DOI having different um eras right and artists and singers and rappers and actors having just different eras or taking a minute for them for a project that they're working on to come out like be out there but because this like virality is what people are chasing I think that's what they think concentration is is about chasing the numbers and chasing the verality and it not being the process and the why you're doing it and even understanding the why changing I've gone through so many different types of like eras and seasons of the type of content that I want and the type of content I'm creating and what is fueling me and learning how to I think it's fair to to to acknowledge that that that there is an aspect of meing to have the reality because that is what keeps you kind of relevant but Al but for me what's helped is knowing what I'm creating for for the vi verality and what I'm creating for longevity and what I'm creating to be a Creator and to be a creative and to to have some substance there you have to understand the game and locking into certain things where it's like this is what's viral right now I need to I need to make a comment on this like the inauguration is coming up people wanting to make plans that day I'm like realistically I'm going to have to lock in to see what happens on that day in case I need to respond to something but a longer form format of like okay what do a trump presidency look like that's something that might be of more substance that I want to take time on and that's just like one example of so many different news cycles that happened but I think when people are like oh you just need the numbers and the verality and that's what they're jumping to it's like I see that a lot with like people who have hopped on becoming a Creator when when Tik Tok went viral that's what they think it is versus the folks that have been creating with YouTube or have been creating on Twitter or have to just had some type of getting used to being on a big stage and being viral and getting the death threats and getting the opportunities and feeling the whole spectrum of what it is to actually be a viral content creator and your life changing forever I don't know about y like I can't go outside and not have nobody notice me like it or recognize oh you did this you did that you did that it changes you like forever yeah so that's not not necessarily in the good way either it's very de depersonalizing I love how I love how all of us casually talk about our various death threats let me tell you let me tell you recently I got recognized at a spa and if you know anything about a Korean spa when you go into the into the pools you got to be naked it's a mineral bath while I'm sitting out there in a mineral bath titties out oh my God are you you look so familiar I was like could you not right now could you not could you pretend I'm just a random naked person that you're talking to out the blue you don't actually know me I I need to I need I want to roll but I wanted to what's the call says something real quick since we're kind of in the space of of advice about for YouTube for YouTube YouTube is they want you to hit the exact same spot every time YouTube does not want variety it does not want um it does not want you to change positions it's like this is it right here stay there the whole time don't do nothing else if I if you do something it better be the best thing you've ever did compared to the last thing you did or we will lowkey murder your channel like people's channels have died trying to change you're laughing I'm telling you no I know and I I just realized Ying at me I was like yeah I think I you're absolutely right I think I get away with a lot like in that in that so so what you did Olay is what everybody new to YouTube that's coming through from Tik Tok should do which is confuse the [ __ ] out of YouTube up front do whatever the you want while you're small and while you don't have a large audience why you're still figuring out what works for you your workflow what you're interested in and what there's a audience for from you and then you start to massage that in regularly with other things yeah but if you go viral early for a thing that is that Channel's thing and if you do anything else you should probably just make another channnel yeah real tall um and and like that's just something to understand if you do skits they all better be skits if you do streams they all better be streams if you do commentary it all better be commentary cuz if those people that came and watch you for commentary do not care about your comedy skits they don't give a f i just put out a sports video this morning 10 out of 10 I know every time I put out a sports video that gonna be 10 out of 10 I do it anyway because I just like I'm I'mma Force this situation to into fruition but I know before I I always earn that opportunity so after this gonna be a Drake video to make sure the algorithm knows like every time the algorithm like you put out a video for yourself and you get the 10 out of 10 algorithms like what did I tell you what did I tell you I tell you yeah yeah stop playing with do the thing make another Dr you know my my second channel is the only Channel where it's the inverse for me like for me my main channel is like if I do something that I want to do or a video I create that that that's when they're going to play me or something or something's gonna be a little you know off with my main Channel but my second channel is if I do what the audience wants that isn't successful what they ask for but if I do what I want like I started my urina pop like doing more like uh episodic episodic breakdowns right and the audience like oh they really like that and I was doing that on the house of the dragon and then I did it with Interview with a Vampire and like the boys and that's what the audience keep asking for and that's what they like and that's what they want and these things are barely making 10,000 or whatever and when I said you know what [ __ ] them I'm gonna make what like I'm gonna I'm gonna make on whatever different I'm gonna put this out now every once I'm gonna do a show like make it more like a video essay style like these short ones you know bigger ones whatever on whatever random thing those do way better like the algorithm you know flocks to it so I think I I I think y'all are absolutely right and it also depends but I you know if after you leaving we we go wa well I gotta run what's the what's the set am I uploaded Aaron cuz I need my wife is literally walking out the door she just messes me I'm going outside w [Music]
