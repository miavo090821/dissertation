I never once supported the U.S. government's efforts to be in a constant state of war. Bernie inspired me to research and think in terms of democratic socialism. At some point during the COVID pandemic, my son encouraged me to listen to and read Marxist analyses of our current world situation. It all made perfect sense to me, and there is no going back.\n\nI have always been a socialist at heart, but living in the U.S., I was trained or conditioned (programmed?) to reflexively reject and ignore socialist thoughts.",

    "text": "We as revolutionaries need to reach out to the working class and meet everyday people where they're at. So often we assume that everyone understands critical theory because for those of us who have been studying it for years it's become second nature. Critical theory does and should inform our politics, outreach, morality and pedagogy, but we forget that people are imperfect. Racism, sexism, hatred of the poor, heteronormativism and national and religious chauvinism are baked into our society. It is unrealistic to expect people to unlearn all these things they've been taught their whole lives on day one. As Malcolm X said, “Don't be in a hurry to condemn because he doesn't do what you do or think as you think or as fast. There was a time when you didn't know what you know today.” We need to have more patience with people while at the same time not tolerating bigotry of any kind. That means educating the people. I see people saying \"it's not my job to educate you\" but if you're a revolutionary it IS YOUR JOB!!! As the UK SDF wrote in 1883, \"“The aims and objects of the Democratic Federation are before you. Success can only be achieved by organised effort:\n\nEducate. We shall need all our intelligence.\nAgitate. We shall need all our enthusiasm.\nOrganise. We shall need all our force.”",

I began to believe all the people who said that it just doesn't work and capitalism is the best way, though imperfect, because it matches up with human nature etc etc. I believed that for decades, but more recently have really begun to notice and understand what forms western imperialism takes and how the intelligence services etc in a capitalist country can come to basically curate media information and control what people think. They're experts and I'm astounded at their skill in manufacturing consent (here in the UK, for example, people are so brainwashed by the mainstream media it's hard to describe how disturbing it is to hear them repeat all the propaganda in casual conversations at work etc!) I've gotten to see in my lifetime the words of Lenin proven true, especially what he had to say about imperialism being a sign of capitalism in decay. Once you see what Marx, Lenin etc were talking about in real time, you can't unsee it, and nothing will ever be the same for me politically now - I've come back full circle to socialism again.",

First being assigned to the middle east, I realized we were an empire and became anti imperialist at heart, although I still worked for the military.\n\nI was indoctrinated into a capitalist society like all Americans, but I never was pro capitalism. I grew up lower class and still am; I knew the economy wasn't fair. It wasn't until I was later assigned to spy on Chinese missiles that I wanted to understand marxism. I wanted to understand China and its people so I could be a better analyst, but also because I could see them building cities/infrastructure all over their country and that we had surrounded them with our military. They were in no way a threat to us; we intended to be threatening to them. I understood this when I was confronted by it in the real world. I had never truly considered the geopolitical implications of our military being stationed around the world and around China.\n\nI was sympathetic towards the Chinese, which also spurred me to consume more domestic media and reports vs those from the US and its allies... and to read marx, and then Lenin, Mao... I was always a marxist at heart. Once I actually read theory, I became a marxist. I left the military and intelligence at the first available moment.\n\nI love China. I believe they and the global south will save humanity from capitalism. They're going to turn the tide that forces change around the world.. and they'll do it peacefully, as siblings.",

For now, you have the enthousiasm of somebody who could make things happen. The challenge is to find a concrete problem that needs to be addressed, develop a plan to solve it, and muster the resources, human and material, to overcome it. Changing society starts by changing one's own community. A thousand miles  journey starts with a first step. I am looking forward to your first steps.",

So, To sum this up you pretty much said…”I went to college and learned from a bunch of Leftarians and was indoctrinated due to my weak or nonexistent set of principles or virtues.” This Marxist professor wasn’t bias? Then how did you know he was a Marxist? Him informing you or any of his students of his political leanings indicates his extreme bias. A professor has a duty to remain objective and none of the leftarian teachers and professors ever do. They always wear their opinion on there sleeve and actively push it in their classes. Meanwhile while disparaging other ideas or any critique of their own. You said Bernie’s ideas and policies were “common sense”, but you didn’t name a single one. Gave zero facts, figures, or any arguments about any political concepts. Gave no evidence that those critical of Feminism and BLM are “weird” or why you believe that….yeah, you sound like a political science major. Maybe study history a bit more. Marx called for violent overthrow of institutions based on destroying private property. So revolution based on theft. Just the rambling of a boring person that wants to piss off conservative mommy and daddy.",

I'm not sure why this video got recommended to me, but it's done nothing but reinforce my belief that this is some sort of mind virus that afflicts people who haven't advanced beyond black and white thinking and have a severe lack of understanding of the human condition, of history, and the reality of economics in practice.
