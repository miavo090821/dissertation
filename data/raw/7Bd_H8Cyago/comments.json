It is thoroughly infected by the cartels, and this is partly because of a lack of any policing of them...and a lack of any will to police them on the part of the Mexican government especially; now, the drug war was absolutely a failure and one which destroyed lives more than anything else, but the cartels are something else entirely from some guy who sold 2 grams of weed for five bucks and \"let's hug them\" is a retarded position for any government to have on a problem like Mexican Drug Cartels.\nSo, there's a hypothetical police force between \"do-nothings\" and \"shoot you for looking sideways\" type characters which would maximize your freedom...and such a police force *would* be relatively pro-active, and not passive.\n...The real question is \"In what particular way?\"",

Libertarianism in the US is nowadays used to signify a right wing ideology that is against censorship and wants more civil liberties than traditional conservatism (decriminalization of drugs, etc) but also wants very few or no restraints put on the free market. Also, 'liberal' has no association with the left to someone who is politically aware. Being left wing requires a certain economic philosophy that modern liberals and neoliberal parties like the Democrats do not subscribe to. There is a slight social democrat influence on the party which is the only thing distinguishing it from classical liberalism.\n\nAt the moderate end libertarians are basically conservatives who are more relaxed about things like marijuana and gay marriage (as long as no one has to actually conduct these marriages who feels the slightest discomfort), but at the extreme end you get thought leaders who defend child labour. It's closely associated with Objectivism. The word 'Libertarian' formerly described left-wing anarchism, though, which is why Chomsky identifies as a Libertarian Socialist. Some try to reclaim the older meaning. Anarchism is the only ideology I know of that wants to abolish the police, but not abolish law enforcement, while Libertarians want to keep the police in place but make sure they only intervene in cases of force (the anarchists say they aren't intervening in the interests of the people are the moment anyway, so it would make no difference or improve things if they were replaced with community law enforcement). I make no claim about my own beliefs.",

Her career hasn't recovered. \nBut what I think may be the issue here is that the right doesn't see the left getting cancelled because they don't even know the left exists (because it's been cancelled so thoroughly ever since the first red scare). This becomes clear when they refer to Democratic politicians as \"the left\". I used to think this was a smear, but it seems a lot of people on the right really don't know the left exists. The last time the left appeared in the MSM was the 60's. Those people were thrown in jail and/or assassinated, then history was rewritten on top of their graves to erase their leftism from memory (MLK is the perfect example)\n\nAlso, I don't see why twitter, on any of us, should treat any sh*tposter differently just because they are a powerful politician. That said I didn't want them to ban Trump either, but giant unaccountable corporations are going to have great control over all our speech if the government (us) isn't willing to be a counterweight to unfettered capitalism.

Imagine there is a person in your life that looks, smells and acts like a woman. In fact, in all but their genitals, they are a woman. Do you think it is accurate, or rather, useful, to refer to them as \"he\"? People would be fairly confused and it doesn't really feel true to do that. They are living as a woman socially. \n\nNow how often do you use this social gender, and how often do you use the other descriptors (chromosomes, genitals, etc)? \n\nThis isn't the only argument vs. Your very simple take on gender, but it feels like it's a little more complicated than just a genital check.

It's basially a form of the veil of ignorance but specifically aimed at discriminatory language. (Veil of ignorance is the philosophical approach to assume a law or concept might fall back on you to see if you still would be comfortable with it, say \"would you want to see death penalties used in sentencing based only on DNA evidence if it were you that is awaiting sentencing and you have got a bad DNA result that suggests your guilt\" or \"Would you still argue for the mandatory invasive Ultrasound, Senator, if it were prescribed for a vasectomy and thus applied to YOUR body?\"). The \"Black test\" does not turn it around at you, but by replacing the object of presumed discrimination to something you can easier relate with, it makes the inherent discriminatory intent clearer to the listener... \n\nAnd you probably will agree with me that this rephrasing makes the inherent problem with ben's apologetic wording blatantly obvious and thus unmasks his hypocrisy easily.",

But the virtue signaling just for the sake of it is something I think we should agree is pointless.\" \n\nexcept when Shapiro and most others on the right talk about virtue signalling, they mean everyone who has any opinions left of the centre-right. The right are also chronic virtue signallers, albeit with entirely different virtues. This whole \"the left only pretend to be that way to look good in front of each other\" narrative is one of the main focal points of this culture war and it's absolutely worth tearing into wherever it appears.

They're outraged at the planned upheaval of vulnerable working class black people being replaced by the upper class white people",

If the states are supposed to deal with pandemics, shouldn't they deal with the national emergency Trump made about his border problem? The southern states should be the ones to take care of that, right? The federal government had supplies they could have sent to the states but only sent 4,000 to NY, despite Cuomo's (accurate) prediction that they would need over 15,000, with Trump even asking them to GIVE UP VENTILATORS THAT THEY WERE SAVING FOR THEIR PEAK. Which they didn't, until after the peak. Most new Yorkers took the virus seriously. I'm a New Yorker. I know they did because I saw them. Almost everyone took it seriously, they closed down their businesses or they were forced to by the state. People social distanced and stayed home. Once we had enough masks for the doctors, they were mandated for everyone to wear in EARLY APRIL. So no, we weren't just sitting there doing nothing and then whining about Trump. I don't think you even live in New York if you can say that. Florida doesn't even have a mask mandate yet and that state is doing worse than every state except California, which has only 100,000 more cases despite more than double the population. Look at Michigan, with the lockdowns and mask mandates, which trump attacked mind you, doing great now. Look at Trump praising Florida. Look at Trump saying he took care of the virus.\n\nYou can either leave it to the states entirely and let them do whatever they want, or you can actually take care of it like you should and then take credit for what you've done. \nWhat would I have liked Trump to do? Oh I dunno, maybe recommend a mask at least before the start of may, or preferably mandate it? Mandate social distancing and places that can't to close down temporarily, bar travel to and from anywhere outside of the us early on instead of just China and maybe prevent many cases which came from Europe, maybe a nationwide stay at home order? Maybe buying and sending more ventilators to the states that need then instead of just taking credit for doing it? The list goes on.",

Over time, though, their approval meant less and less. I could eventually make up my own mind without worrying about how my conclusions would be judged. I learned how to admit that I was wrong without feeling like that was some kind of moral failure. Folks like Ben Shapiro, though? They cling to their adolescence. They get older, sure, but their minds are still fixated on the validation they received from winning a couple of debate tournaments when they were sixteen.

Crispy is a good word because it includes all the sounds that makes something sound, well, crispy. But it’s also like water? I think American girls like me just find northern European accents pretty because they’re so different from the sounds we normally hear. \nI’m from Houston so I’m used to Mexican, Tagalog, Hindi, and Urdu accents (along with Texas accents of course). Every other person will speak with one of these accents but I’ve never met someone from Germany before! It’s a whole new kind of sound and that makes it pretty!",

        "text": "@FauxtakuLounge There is a difference between conditioning, conscious racism and acting on your racist beliefs. I often catch myself thinking obviously racist things. I live in a country where Turkish and Arab people are the biggest minority and they experience similar prejudices as black people in the US. When I see an Arab-looking person I often get more cautious in certain situations (at night on the street or in the night club) because I have been conditioned to think of them as dangerous and malicious. However, in my second thought I recognize the unfair prejudice and realize that I don't know this person and just because they look a certain way does not mean that they are inherently dangerous. So you could say that I am conditioned to react in a racist way. Does that mean I am racist? I don't think so. I think it's very important to differentiate between racist conditioning (which is more a systemic problem than an individual one) and actual conscious racism. And I think only those who embrace the latter are actual racists (on an individual level).",

    "text": "There's a precept in criminal law called Blackstone's Ratio, which is basically the idea that it is better to let 10 guilty people roam freely than it is to risk punishing 1 innocent person for a crime which they did not commit.\n\nAs you spoke about stop and frisk and the war on drugs, I was frequently reminded of this quote from John Adams (the U.S. President), which ties into the above idea:\n\n“It is more important to the public that innocence should be protected than it is that guilt should be punished, for guilt and crimes are so frequent in the world that, by definition, not all of them CAN be punished. And oftentimes when they happen, they happen in such a way that it is of little consequence to the public whether they are punished or not. However, when an innocent person is brought before the bar to be condemned, especially to die, then that person will think to himself: ‘it is immaterial to me whether I do good or do evil, for innocence itself is no security.’ And if such a sentiment as that were to take hold in the minds of the citizens, that would be the end of all security whatsoever.”",

For example, they will take credit for the civil rights movement, despite privately resenting it. I suspect this because when I personally was a conservative, I had this mentality.\n\nAnother \"talking point\" I hear all the time is \"If America is so racist, why do so many non-European immigrants want to come here, even breaking the law to get in here?\" Well, they've always been coming here, even during the past days of blatant racism. That's how desperate conditions were in their home countries. The Chinese and Japanese, for example, knew they faced prejudice, but didn't stop coming until U.S. immigration laws outright banned them.",

Oftentimes this is just a false equivalency that allows the right to spread vile propaganda advocating for violence and stripping people of human rights and dignity as long as they do that in a \"polite tone\" Aka without using swear words, colloquials and in an \"indoor voice\". Please take a Moment to think about the fact that those positions can hurt people in real life, and no, not \"just\" their feelings as is sometimes claimed. \nI think you are well-meaning, so I hope you can see my point.\nAlso that very same account basically slandered the entire left wing with some pretty vile insinuations towards specific types of violence towards children. So please take into account that people responding  to him in particular might be pretty upset by this,  especially if they might be survivors of childhood Trauma and or abuse themselves.\nCompared to what they have already written in the comment section of this Video alone the responses they got from people that are more left-leaning than them are...well...nicer than they might even deserve. I don't think they would extent political opponents or any minority they dislike the same courtesy to treat them with basic respect for a fellow human. In fact many of their posts admit to that fact =/\nBest regards",

I don't think it's helpful to title a book 'White Rage' as it seems to paint white people with the same brush, especially because many white people were innocent or didn't agree with what the government was doing and most white people living today are innocent and disagree with the unjust laws. I hate this divide and conquer strategy going on today of pitting groups of people against each other instead of forgiving and trying to constructively move on. Instead all I see is the kindling of hatred between the races, rich and poor, man and woman, gay and straight. Is it possible to just treat everyone as individuals and have a free society and let everyone rise and fall on their own merits instead of constantly playing group politics and judging group performances? Why is equality amongst the groups such an important outcome if individuals are not even equal to each other? I think the more we chase after an illusionary and nebulous phenomenon like equality we will all never stop hating each other. We should be striving for freedom of the individual and fully protecting the rights of the individual instead of seeing it from a group lens.",

There’s a book called “Guys Like Girls Who...” which uses the same sorta tactic, I believe the conclusion it reaches at the end is “Guys like girls who love themselves”. Ostensibly misogynistic title for a book that specifically seeks to aid young girls with self love, confidence, and being themselves rather than moulding themselves to fit men.\n 2 - White people are largely responsible for the discrimination minorities face. A generalisation doesn’t make this wrong. It was white people in power enacting laws that the average white person didn’t disagree with, because it affected the minorities not the white man",

        "text": "@Wyrdangus My God you are mistaken on many levels and I hope you will correct your intolerance, especially as tolerance is a key virtue held by the left but of course as any good little Marxist, intolerance is for the rich. Firstly in a purely capitalist system the only way to get rich is to convince other people to voluntarily give you their money. How the rich do this is by offering a product or service that's of a sufficiently good quality and/or low price or something to attract customers to purchase the product. He who excels at offering the public such a product or service and does so efficiently to maximize production to then sell to customers will be rewarded for this and become rich. If the rich need help in running their business and pays people voluntarily through consent to help them then no immorality has been committed. Don't get me wrong there are some rich people who get their wealth through illicit (predominantly they use the government to gain wealth and/or get the government to pass regulations to hurt their competition so that they have a monopoly). That would be wrong but what about all the rich people who did not do this and obtained their wealth fairly and contributed greatly to the common good (e.g Steve jobs providing iPhones and MacBooks which improve other people's lives as customers voluntarily buy those products thus making Steve jobs rich?). Secondly the rich pay an enormous amount of tax. The bottom 50% of Americans pay only 3% of the taxes whilst the top 1% pay something like 29% of the taxes. Its extremely progressive and disproportionately harsh on the rich. The top 10% pay the vast majority of the taxes. I think it's pretty evil to demonize a group of people and to advocate stealing their property when the majority of them have acquired it through consentual and valid means. As to your point about white people, there definitely has been historical injustices that have been committed but every culture in every part of the world has also committed evils. Islamic society, Mongols even the Aztecs and Incas were killing and enslaving neighbouring tribes. It was really 'white people' that invented enlightenment philosophies and exported these philosophies and even ended slavery to it's bitter end (when other parts of the world were vehemently trying to keep slavery going). You have a bleak view of white people and white history and culture that I think is tragic and will do absolutely no good for the world espousing these views. We must move on.",

UNPAID taxes, at the ridiculously low rates the wealthy pay.  Now if there was a top margin tax... 70% was suggested by folks like AOC, I believe, was paid on top of the unpaid hidden tax, and it was put into society... As I understand it, in the 1950s there was a top margin tax of around 90-ish% and the wealthy stayed wealthy, and that was considered a prosperous time.\nAlso consider exactly how much millions and billions, are. Consider bezo's worth of 142,600,000,000.  If you divide that by 30,000, as in 30, grand a year of income, which is significantly higher than what I have per year, we see 4,753,333+ years of income.   Most of that is NOT going back into civilization. And I don't care how many models anyone shows me about capitalism (which can not work without exploitation, prove me wrong by showing me some pure capitalism that works without exploitation, cuz I ain't seen it), It is unconscionable for one to have that much, while another barely lives, while so much improvement is needed. \nAlso, tolerance is not a key virtue held by the left. Tolerance is that that thing that the right thinks the left thinks is ethical, when to tolerate another is still widely missing the mark, which is, Acceptance and recognition of rights. \nI listed a coupla books i recommend out the prolly thousands that exist that likely equally good, but I haven't the time to list, in another comment. I suggest that before holding too tightly to the idea that white people invented enlightenment philosophies, and ended slavery, you maybe read them. There is NO moving on without acknowledgement and atonement, you know, enlightenment. Without those things made praxis, you have a sweeping under the rug, which, as an example of how that has worked, has led us to the divisiveness that exists now.  Take it from the white rabbit that's been down that hole.",

Or if they've seen it applied to others, have tried to excuse it to themselves with rationalizations.

People like Ben think racism is a KKK member beating to death someone for being black, or Jim Crow laws. He and they don't understand that race-based disparities in things like incarceration rates are a type of racism because they have a bias on racial lines, even if the laws aren't explicitly racist. Conversations about systemic racism between progressives and conservatives rarely acknowledge this. Conservatives don't even know what they're arguing about.

It's a complete bastardization of Jean Baudrillard's idea, to the point where it basically reverses it. He says that what is real and what is not is so difficult to comprehend, even when people use all their efforts to understand, they can still fail or be duped. \nIn other words, you can never be red-pilled. Understanding the world is an ongoing and difficult effort that we will likely fail at. The concept of a red pill in itself is probably a 3rd stage simulacrum according to Baudrillard.",

On the other, his schtick is to easily “defeat” naive college students in debates using rhetorical parlor tricks like gish gallops, straw-manning and logical fallacies that anyone capable of getting a decent LSAT score would realize are weak. \n\nHe’s like an NBA player spending most of his time crushing high school kids in games of HORSE at the YMCA, and using every dirty trick and technical foul to do it, not to coach them, or even to show them how much they still have to learn, but just to pump his own ego and legitimize his own preconceived notions, which ironically, the process of legal education should have drummed out of him.\n\nI wonder: has he burned that many bridges in the legal world that he couldn’t get a real job at a law firm, corporation or law school despite his Ivy League sheepskin? Could he really hold his own in a courtroom or boardroom? As a lawyer myself, I’m very skeptical.",

For example, in my country, Hungary, when you go to vote, you need to show a photo ID both to confirm who you are, and to confirm you are voting in the district you're living in. But, unlike in America, the national ID card is provided free of charge and the offices where you can get them are open five days a week, and also every person is automatically registered to vote in whichever district they reside in, also free of charge. As such, the only way requiring ID to vote would stop anyone from voting is if you lost your ID card, or changed your place of residency without informing the government. Unless the US provides a FEDERAL photo ID for free to every citizen, voter ID will remain fundamentally unconstitutional and racist.",

We're raised to believe that only the bad people are racist, so therefore since we're not a \"bad person\" we cannot be racist and we go to great lengths to prove we're not (see: \"I have friends who are people of color!\" or \"I am not in the (insert group here)!\") \n\nBy pushing the individual = bad / system = good narrative, he's ignoring the very fact that while yes, some people can tick off all the boxes, for these issues, it is impossible at this point to fully separate a person from racism or white supremacy due to the very fact that the foundations of our own government (especially US and UK) are built on the ideas of white supremacy and that some people are \"better than others.\" A SYSTEMIC issue isn't one that we can just go, \"Here's the bad guy!\" and instead we have to look at the systems in place and try to unravel them (which is FAR harder and more time consuming). It also means that we have to self reflect on how WE fit into the picture, especially if we come from a place where we are granted certain privileges due to aspects about ourselves. Even if we never wanted those privileges, even if those very privileges are in fact detrimental to us (see: White fragility), we have to acknowledge them and work to either undo them, or to use them in such a way as to say, give the mic to another group, or to steer conversations in different directions (such as bring attention to the issues on the reservations or MMIW that only seem to gain traction once \"white\" people start speaking up).\n\nIt is literally impossible to point out a single arbiter or racism like he's wanting, and he knows this. It's why he pushes for it and it's why his little parrots repeat it when dealing with others.",

The institution gave white families a huge benefit(rise of the white middle class anyone?) While denying the benefit to blacks. You can't just say, \"fair lending laws will fix it\" since those government loans were way easier to get, and now those who grew up with that benefit are far more likely to be accepted for loans now.

Needless to say, he was also a well loved conservative under Reagan and was his welfare advisor while president.
