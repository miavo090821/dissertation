I use them a lot to help clarify my studies and to help me prepare my thoughts to talk to people.\n\nThe ones that exist now are trained just on Marx, Engels and Lenin but it would be great to have a tankie megamind that had been fed everything in existence. For example, the chatbot \"RedTheory\" struggles sometimes if I ask it really specific questions about Hoxha.\n\nThere are also a few chatbots trained on anarchist \"theory\", which are fun to grill sometimes. They parse all the major anarchist works and they can't come up with anything beyond \"We should do idealism more better.\"",
