After they ate the lotus they would forget their home and loved ones. Those who ate the plant never cared to report, nor return.\n\nFiguratively, 'lotus-eater' denotes \"a person who spends their time indulging in pleasure and luxury rather than dealing with practical concerns\". \"",

    "text": "Not to be contrarian, but there's a saying \"A rose by any other name smells just as sweet\".\n\"Reactionary\" is only a pejorative because of the framing. Both \"Capitalism\" and \"Democracy\" were pejoratives too, but over time, the goodness of these things reclaimed the word. Now they're both (largely) considered compliments.\n\nMeanwhile, labels with positive connotations adopted by the left eventually became pejoratives. People forget, the term \"SJW\" wasn't invented by our side. \"Social Justice\" puts a foul taste in the mouths of even the normies today. Or \"Antifa\". \"Anti-Fascist\" must be good, right? But now the media runs from it, saying \"It doesn't exist\".\n\nIt reminds me of lefty browbeating over words. \"Retarded\" is a word clinicians used to denote the developmentally disabled. Now that's considered mean and they use words like \"Developmentally disabled\" or \"Differently-abled\" or whatever nonsense. Before that, they were called \"Morons\", and before that, \"Idiots\". But... the word is just a vessel for a concept. No matter how they color it, its always going to be an insult, because the word itself is nothing. It will always be an insult to call someone retarded, no matter what term is \"sanctioned\" by the mores of the day.\n\nI've heard that now \"Homosexual\" is insulting. Now \"Gay\" is the accepted word. Not long ago, that was inverted. Because no matter what term you use, it means guys who like to suck other guys dicks, and being accused of that offends people. No matter what you call it, its going to be weird and funny and disreputable, because the act is weird and funny and disreputable.",
