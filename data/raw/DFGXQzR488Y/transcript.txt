do we have time for another topic or yeah yeah all right so this is one of the interesting things like we've cut some of the the stuff of so the equalities minister for the conservatives bassist woman alive in my view so she's uh from i can't remember which african country but let me let me pull up your article about it yeah so she she came out and just said no critical race theory is an evil racist ideology and we're not gonna be you know we don't endorse it we don't think we should be taught all the rest of it now i don't know what action she's taken i think just within the equalities department it's now banned i don't think in the education or or in the parliament in general but that's that's one of the things i find really strange is the equalities minister comes out says all the right things perfectly gets it you know this is someone in the cabinet and yet on a mass governmental level the conservative party don't even seem to know or at least don't signal that there's a problem or that they're going to do anything about it well pete hitchens always complains that the the conservative party is essentially uh without ideology he always complains about this because this leaves them kind of rudderless and unable to properly articulate why they object to things and it's a great way of putting it yeah and no no it is a great way i've been hanging out with them so i go you know conservative activists conservative councillors and things and you go out with them and i remember having a couple of conversations about ideology actually yeah so you consider yourself a liberal classical liberal conservative you know are you a bit of a yeah social liberal nothing nothing from almost stairs yeah the the continual response i got from most of them you know there are some in there who who absolutely get it i mean the candidate we were canvassing for absolutely got it but most of them had the opinion that not really important at all what's important is when i'm in the in the sea just do what works you know do what what works here you know in the terms of monetary uh issues so you know buses or things like this but if you don't have an ideological viewpoint in which to approach these things like yeah don't let it overshadow what's what's true yeah don't be a zealot yeah but but also don't let the the opposition just run away with nonsense and have no way of countering it like you need to know how to counter the stuff well that's the thing if i mean like the the black lives matter founder who said that they're trained uh heavily trained in ideology and then marxism they they they do this for a reason because they this is about subversion and if you don't know what to look out for uh ideologically then you'll be using all of the opponent's language open to attack you're totally open yeah exactly and and the the very framing in the language i mean one of the things we've got to start trying to reject is their language i i hear people that i know and like who are much further right wing than i am um but they they still like use terms like oh we're the neo-reactionaries it's like who made that word up you know why you that was made up by left-wingers the word reactionary yeah the just the use the use of the word reactionary as a political label is made up by the radical left-wingers to describe uh traditionalist forces and so the people on the right should be saying we're traditionalists we're we're interested in health and home and patriotism and the the good things about the country that we've inherited uh no you're a reactionary you know it sounds bad because that's the it's deliberate and yet the conservatives or not even the conservatives are these people are much further right than the conservatives um who are still approaching it with their the left's language and it's like no you you've essentially just stepped into a trap and you're waiting for it to close now you know you can't escape now you've accepted that what their definitions are correct about you so why should their definitions about other things be wrong and we shouldn't give any validity to any of them so that's what the problem is here that you might have say the conservative minister who absolutely gets it she clearly you know understands what she believes and why she believes it but the rest of the ministers are a majority just don't which means that when it comes to a national policy on these kind of things they have no idea it's not just that i mean i mean that's true but also they won't realize why that what they're being asked to do is bad you know if they've got no way of i mean if they're just like well i just want what works well you know what does works mean in this context you know what if gets left-wing activists off your back yeah this will work you know if you just do everything they say they'll stop telling you a racist that's true but what will it do you know there will be other consequences from this and you're you're talking about the the sort of tenor of the civilization in which you live it's be it becomes racialized it becomes uh power politics focused because all of critical race theory the the legitimating factor is power it's not anything else you know it's not moral decency it's not goodness it's not virtue it's not it's not even the results it's not even consequences you know it's it's all about who has the authority to act it doesn't even matter if it gets the goals that they want as long as they're the ones in the seat look at the state of the communities that they claim to care about yeah that's true look at the state of history they they're monster well they're all equally poor well there i guess we've brought about equality all we have to do is make sure the other ones who haven't who vote conservative um which demographics they're in britain the hindus the sikhs and the jews in britain vote conservative overwhelmingly those those guys are gonna have to watch out because the identity politicians are gonna be looking at them going you're not allowed to do that succeed be free vote for the right wing you know well no right wing uh you're not allowed to do that you know uh you know but i like you was saying about the the woman we've i've got the quote up uh she's saying that go and read this and watch the video yeah it's totally worth your time it's fantastic she is the the the video is embedded in the article on the website which says uh it promotes divisive uh or victim narratives that are harmful to british society is a publicly stated desire to abolish or overthrow democracy capitalism or to end free and fair elections well it seems there's a lot of concern about the free and fair elections going on right now uh the use or or endorsement of racist including anti-semitic language or communications and a failure to condemn illegal activities done in their name or in support of their cause particularly violent actions against people and property uh that just i mean salute that was exactly correct uh what was her name sorry oh it's hard to pronounce sorry but um i'm english and it's a foreign name yeah uh kemi baden knock babe knock just say kelly kemmie kelly's a good name uh but kenny bednock uh however that sounds a bit scottish doesn't it yeah um but um yes she she unequivocally she's announced it she's one of the people that gets it you know totally she totally gets it and uh it's it's at least good that there are some people in the conservatives like that but if if the conscientious objectives the critical race theory being the faulty odds that objected or any indication that they're a very small fraction really of the conservative party and that's scary isn't it so actually there's a friend of ours who uh helped us out recently who who is friends like went to school with a guy who's now an mp um with the conservatives who was one of the ones who won his you see in the last election and he's told me about the conversations he's had with him and apparently he's very very black-pilled about the party because he's just like god damn they're all cucks they're all he's endlessly just ranting and raving about the fact that like you know i'm standing up to this and no one else is backing me and when i talk to them about it they just just blanks i don't want to talk about that i want to talk about the economy yeah i want to talk about tax policy it's like oh right where's this country going to be in 20 years if we just talk about tax policy well we're going to be taxed through the roof because whenever we talk about tax policy it's labor's tax policy how we can raise it and redistribute the money to these poor undeserving poor deserving communities that's actually one of the great quotes from kemi there where she just said they're like oh you're not implementing correct diversity and inclusion policy she just turns around and goes no we're just implementing ours you just want us to implement yours and we're not doing that win an election a great quote that's exactly right but that's the point isn't it it's the the assumption is made that the left wing has the correct answers and the conservatives are being slowly dragged towards it this is this is like uh robert conquest's second law of politics like any institution that is not explicitly anti-left-wing will drift leftwards over time because of the assumption that the left has essentially the correct agenda for the current political paradigm and without any kind of ideology or any kind of ideological um sort of positive ideological view how can the conservatives ever resist that no wonder they're being dragged further and further to the left it's like because it's all framed as if it's a moral good everything the left has ever done is a moral good and everything the right has ever done has been evil because human beings are one-dimensional and they need to be given prosperity by the state [Music] you
