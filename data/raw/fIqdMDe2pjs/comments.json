I've seen videos and read articles from leftists, but not from the right, or from centrists or liberals for that matter. The only time I've heard it mentioned outside of leftists trying to bring awareness (and the communities themselves of course), is from people on the right trying to weaponize this issue as a whataboutism but never to address the issue in a sincere way. Doing that doesn't help anyone. It just comes of insincere and minimizes a very serious issue. I'm not accusing you of doing anything intentionally btw. I merely wanted to point out it's an issue with most media unfortunately & pointing it out as a \"leftist\" issue can minimize the very issue you're wanting to bring genuine attention and awareness to. \n(Sorry if my communication is repetitive or off, it's a rough morning lol)",

        "text": "But that’s such an over simplistic explanation and literally the reason why Latinos support conservative ideals. There’s so many other facets as to why this is. Mexicans in Texas don’t see themselves as Mexican due to different histories even though racially they’re exactly the same as most of the migrants. Economic pressures also cause Latinos to be susceptible to Republican talking points of “immigration taking jobs and success away from Americans” which I might add has infiltrated the airwaves of Black media as well seeing as there has been anti Latino/migrant sentiment growing in the black community. Another reason is because Latinos have felt ignored by BOTH parties for decades and only as props to be used every 4 years. Democrats don’t do enough to address issues important to Latino voters which makes it easier for them to switch to the other side. There’s so many different types of Latinos and people over simplify their views to just one or two issues which is why politicians fail to garner their support.",

She is a GODSEND and has been instrumental in literally saving lives through her work! 🙏🏾❤️‍🔥✊🏾 \n\nAnd you are absolutely right, Texas is not a non-voting state, it is a voter suppressed state. Hands down. We HAVE THE NUMBERS to vote every single one of these evil politicians out, but the voter suppression is brutal and insidious. But we will keep pressing and educating our people so that we rise up in the power that we have to overtake this bull crap.",

But the number one thing you can do in addition to voting is tell your friends family co workers and loved ones to vote. It’s called relational organizing. The number one way to get people to the polls is when someone they know live and trusts tells them to go. We can turn this ship around. Then AFTER you vote, your job has only just begun. NOW, you have to GET INVOLVED. And hold the elected officials accountable. STAY ON THEIR ASSES BECAUSE THEY WORK FOR US.

I've witness so many accounts of it from friends, family and it's horrific and SO often when someone was actively seeking help. They can starve you, they call you a pathological liar, misdiagnose you, sedate you, and when all that fails to put you in line they ship you to the \"real jail\". At this point I feel like so many mental hospitals are their own form of mass incarceration, even to the point of high recidivism rates. And it's a symptom of a failure of psychologists to practice humanity, check their biases, fucking even acknowledge capitalism and white supremacy. And that failure is enabled by the DSM. I live in GA but I'm just absolutely rocked to see the parallels in how conservative states ban together to enact their agendas regardless of what federal law is, or what federal mandates exist.",

    "text": "Current Harris county, Tx resident here. Thanks for this! I’ve heard most of this stuff little by little throughout the past several years, but it’s astounding to hear it compressed into an hour and a half deep dive. I’m absolutely here for a part 2! \n\nAlmost my entire family votes republican (many of them here in Texas, including for Greg Abbott). Maybe I can break one or two of them away from their right wing echo chamber long enough to show them some of this video… \n\nThey sometimes bitch about the beltway around Houston, which was sold to them as requiring a toll, but only until its construction was paid for. This happened years ago, yet the tolls persist. They somehow don’t connect the fact that they’ve been electing the same decrepit republicans all this time to the toll road situation.\n\nCould say something similar about the high electricity prices that have resulted from the “free market competition” among utilities… but I digress",

I live in Texas and I see people who consider themselves \"progressive\" talking online about how we deserve everything we get and we should just get cut off, never mind how many margenalized people this would hurt and abandon.

He and his ilk just keep making voting even more difficult... this year they even removed the online maps that show you where the polling places are after closing a bunch; you have to go through and search the list one by one separately so you can try to find where you can go to vote. Any roadblock he can throw up, he will--and thensome.",

    "text": "Latino (first-gen Mexican-American/Chicano with Mexican immigrant parents) here -- I'm not the Latino Lorax and I can only speak for myself, not the whole community 😭 (i WISH we had a meeting amongst ourselves LMFAO) but I do have a tiny bit of insight.\n\nThere are honestly MANY complex and layered reasons for why latinos vote red in many areas. I see people in the comments mentioning colorism, which is obviously one of them. There's also the fact that there's a discrepancy between legal immigrants/naturalized citizens/US-born Latino-Americans and undocumented Latinos -- there's so much prejudice and hatred that many Latino citizens feel towards undocumented migrants which is often times a superiority complex. Along with that there's also racism and fighting among different groups -- I oftentimes hear my Democrat-voting Mexican parents and family members say questionable shit about Central Americans. Becoming a US citizen honestly brainwashes and erases a lot of people's experiences that they had with racism when they first moved here, especially the more time passes between someone's status as undocumented and someone's naturalization. You also have many immigrants from \"socialist\" nations (besides Cuba) who view Democrats as communists and vote accordingly.\n\nWhen it comes to GOP support from Latinos along the border, I think that another layer to it is that there's many ICE agents who themselves are Latinos... which you can honestly apply what James Baldwin said about Black cops to such ICE agents (and any other Latinos in law enforcement, for that matter, who are also extremely racist and anti-Black). You also have the obvious reasons for some groups where they're extremely socially conservative due to the Catholic religion (when funnily enough, the Catholic Church as an institution openly opposes a lot of the GOP's psychotic shit) and that's self-explanatory.\n\nPeople could write a whole dissertation about this, but I'm not an expert haha. Olay, I honestly invite you and encourage you to get into Latinos' business if you feel comfortable to do so. You don't have to speak on it publicly if you want to open that platform to people more knowledgable and outspoken on the subject, but it is probably important knowledge to have going forward since the Latino vote is more complex than people give it for in comparison to how other marginalized groups vote -- it's not as (for a lack of a better term) 'simple' as many Black Americans overwhelmingly supporting Democrats for obvious historic reasons -- and it'll likely be decisive in many elections going forward.",

I am at a critical point in my life healthwise yet I cannot access anything but the most basic emergency care and then cannot pay the hospital anyway. Because Abbott and his ilk just said no to the ACA. I am 1 of millions.\nAnd the public is so numb, there was hardly any outcry!\nThe horror at the borders are hard to speak of. Honestly, it as if we are next door to the camp. \nThank you again for laying it out for people. I already respected you and your work, now I add grateful to that!",
