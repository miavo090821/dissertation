[Music] [Music] whenever anything bad happens in Texas you know what scratch that whenever Texas does anything bad people just kind of dismiss it as ah Texas acting up as Texas Texas kind of has a similar reputation to Florida in that regard but in the same way that I hope people have finally started putting a face to Florida's [ __ ] Rhonda sanz's Face To Be pafic My Hope for this video is that by the time I'm done when you hear the Calamity happening in Texas you'll have a better understanding of what's happening in Texas and why and that the face that pops up in your head when you think of Texas is their all to powerful Governor Greg Abbott so listen I have been meaning to give Republican Texas governor Greg Abbott the Eric Adams treatment for a while because it's what he deserves the man is a demon which don't get me wrong most any standard issue Republican is but Greg Abbott is much much worse than that because one he's a demon who gets a lot of evil [ __ ] done and he's been getting it done a long time he is a relic from the George Bush era first George Bush he is the second longest serving governor in Texas history and two he's exceptionally dangerous because he's not just Texas's problem he's all of ours actually if I'm honest Texas in and of itself is all of our problem the first thing that you should know about Greg Abbott is that he's not new to this he's True to this before he was the governor of Texas Greg Abbott held just about every influential position of power in Texas you can think of he was the state trial judge in Texas before then governor and former President George Bush appointed him to the Texas Supreme Court where he served from 1996 to 2001 when he left the Texas Supreme Court he then became Texas's attorney general which is where he spent most of the time laying the groundwork for everything he's doing now as governor and he did that from 2002 to 2015 he was actually the attorney general for longer than anyone else in Texas history and then immedi imediately after serving as attorney general the [ __ ] ran for governor and he won and he assumed office in 2015 where he's been ever since because this mother is on his third term despite a ly of reasons I'm going to present to you in this video Texas has reelected him not once but twice with the most recent person to have their ass unfortunately handed to them being bet aor and can we just talk about that right quick because people who don't live in the South have a tendency to just write the southern states off as red states where the people people get what they voted for and that's actually a really reductive look at the situation that fails to take into consideration that the southern states have been deep deep deep in their voter suppression abuse of power Jerry mandering bag for longer than you've been alive Jerry mandering refers to how political parties get to gain the system by redrawing the Legislative and congressional districts to favor them Texas has been redrawing and carving up communities to destroy the Black and Latino vote from time specifically the Texas chapter of the ACLU presents some of the primary tactics that they use to suppress the vote in Texas one being not offering online voter registration two in Texas they have some of the strictest voter ID laws in the country and it's not despite of this it's because people of color are more likely not to have the right ID and three they have some of the longest lines to vote in the country especially in bipar neighborhoods and that's intentionally kept that way to disincentivize those voters which is evidenced by the fact that they passed a law to prohibit 24-hour voting which would have come back the problem four they restrict assistance for voters with disabilities and those speaking limited English five they severely limit who can vote by mail to vote by mail in Texas you have to be 65 or older have a disability or illness be incarcerated mind you Texas doesn't allow anyone incarcerated on a felony or on probation or on parole to vote if you'll be outside the country or you're expected to give birth within 3 weeks of election day and of those limited people who can vote by mail they throw out votes for any of the tiniest errors and six they weaponize the criminal system against people for any tiny error or misunderstanding of election law and they do this disproportionately to women of color and speaking of weaponizing criminal penalties I would not be me if I didn't tell you how the criminal system is used to suppress marginalized people in a Marriot of ways including but not limited to the right to vote how felon disenfranchisement felon disenfranchisement is the criminals two for one kill two birds with one stone the state doesn't just get to put its foot to the necks of black brown and poor folk as it dos out criminal convictions incarceration and the trauma and poverty it ensures the system also gets to take your right to vote to ensure you never get the opportunity to remove that foot from your neck and that's why Texas loves it according to the sentencing project Texas has taken away more people's right to vote than 47 States combined Texas deprived 45,1 160 citizens from the right to vote now back to Greg Abbott he's in his third term as Governor and he says he hasn't ruled out running a fourth time and I'm not confused as to why Republicans keep electing him if you want to see hell on Earth which Republicans certainly do this would be the mother root for right here because he's getting it done in fact Greg Abbott has more power than any Texas governor has ever had because he saw to it in 2018 he expanded his powers as Governor without any legal authority to do so he informed all Texas state agencies that they would be required to submit any proposed new rules to him before they could make them available to the public for comment and as far as the Texas legislature itself which has a republican majority in both the house and the Senate even if they wanted to do something even remotely Progressive or in the best interest of Texans good luck doing so because Greg Abbott is going to veto that [ __ ] fact faster than you can get it drafted and there's nothing they can do about it because Texas law would require that Greg Abbott himself call the special session to allow the legislature to override him and he's obviously not going to do that [ __ ] which is precisely why a Texas legislature hasn't overridden a Governor's veto since 1979 and that's why there is nobody in the game using their veto power like Greg Abbott uses his veto power in 2023 he vetoed 76 billion which is the second highest amount a Texas governor has ever vetoed in a single session in the state's history collectively Greg Abbot has vetoed 251 bills since his first term as Governor what I am trying to get across to you is that every regressive thing you've heard about Texas and say the last 30 years this [ __ ] has had a hand in in one shape or another he has been shaping Texas in His image for quite some time so what particular negative association his name has in your mind depends on how you're familiar with him if you know him from the Obama era which there's a high probability you do because his attorney general he sued the Obama Administration 31 times more than any other state so if you remember him from then you probably associate him with trying to destroy the Affordable Care Act if you really go way back with him you probably associate him with fighting against gay marriage and if he first appeared on your radar in this era's national news you probably know him from busting migrants to Washington DC New York City Chicago Philadelphia Denver and Los Angeles and any other Sanctuary city is a big you to who he perceives as the liberal Democrats who are soft on immigration I say perceive because contrary to popular belief just because the city has black people in it and Democrat leaders does not mean they're a friend to immigrants or marginalized people of any variety take Eric Adams war in the migrants for example and how he and NYPD have been spreading all the propaganda in the world to turn people against the migrants like releasing edited foot to make it appear that migrants attacked police officers out of thin air so that people would be outraged see the migrants as criminals and thus be more likely to support mistreating them Adams called to end the right to shelter and has caused regressive calls for deportation meanwhile from the police officer's own body warn camera footage showed that the officers attacked them first but we're getting off topic back to how you might know Greg Abbott you might know him for his wickedness at the border his multiple abortion Bans are all the he has yet to give about about any of the seven mass shootings that Texas has had on his watch but the reasons why you should hate him and why Texas needs to stop reelecting him go so much further beyond that because of not just what he's doing and has been doing to Texas and the migrants entering the us through Texas but because of my second Point that he's no longer just a shining example to point to for why you wouldn't want to move to a republican Le State it's because he's now quite literally driving us towards Civil War and tearing apart the delicate fact fabric keeping this nation together so today we're going to discuss why rag Abbot is one of the worst things not just to happen to Texas but to the United States of America the reason Greg Abbott is everyone's problem is because his actions are quite literally threatening to implode this Union Yes I'm talking Union and two that he's exceptionally dangerous and I am not being hyperbolic I'm sure a lot of you probably clicked on this video because you've seen on the news the fight Greg Abbot and the federal government are having over the border right now the simplified explanation is this the Constitution separates state governments from the federal government certain powers are left to the states While others are left to the federal government when there is conflict between the state and the federal government or power overlaps between purviews the Constitution dictates that the federal government went out the border between Mexico and the United States is in Texas and so Texas does have some legitimate state interest in what happens at the border but still immigration and the Border fall squarely under the federal government's Authority which the Supreme Court has confirmed but hear me and hear me good Greg Abbott couldn't give a less about none of that [ __ ] remember I told you earlier that he is Keen on expanding his own power despite having no legal authority to do so look no further for a better example than everything he does on immigration in December 2023 Greg Abbott actually signed a bill making illegal imig ation a State Crime which is some outright unconstitutional [ __ ] Beyond just the terror and what him doing that should have immediately signal to us that these think they're autonomous all powerful beings the federal government and a check and a balance because states are not allowed to make immigration law the law would let State Police arrest people on suspicion for having crossed the border really think about that [ __ ] state police officers with the freedom to decide any Latino person they see illegally cross the border and arrest them and the judges can decide if they want to drop the charges if the accused migrant agrees to return to Mexico and again states do not have the legal authority to deport people or to demand that a country in this case Mexico accept people it hasn't agreed to take I want to remind y'all not everybody crossing the border is Mexican or from Mexico but Texas is telling you that they want to just be grabbing Latinos off the street and sending them to Mexico and here's the gag that's exactly what's happening and the result are so much worse than you think so under operation lonar we've hijacked the criminal justice system to to address a so-called immigration problem and actually I was looking at the latest data Believe It or Not Over 70% of the people who are being arrested under operation L star are American citizens so so 2021 we actually and we were not going to do bailouts but this was so horrendous that we did not we could not we could not not do something about it there was a there was an American citizen transwoman who was being held with men because at that time there were only two facilities uh and they were only arresting men and so she was being held with men and um it was just horrific um the sexual assaults on her and so we connected with the lgbtq freedom fund from Florida they gave us some money and together we kind of bailed her out um and you know sent her back to her home in Seattle and short enough the case dismissed charges all dropped now we're just waiting for the money to come back let's make sure we understand what's happened there and what's happening they used operation Lone Star and Greg AB to arrest anyone you think cross the border to arrest and jail an American citizen and though the charges would be inevitably dropped that wasn't before they placed a trans woman in Men's prison to be raped and sexually abused and that's just one story but over 70% of the people that they're arresting Under Suspicion of being undocumented immigrants are American citizens or are being jailed and tortured and you want to know what's extra wild about all this Greg Abbot is a perfect example of why I'm not racist I have a black friend isn't an effective argument because what if I I told you that this mother brag Abbott's wife is a whole ass Mexican like like her grandparents were Mexican immigrants dog dog and she's a real my man my man my man ask y okay she going to stick beside him and the only thing crazier than Abbott having a Latino wife who seems blissfully unconcerned with him kicking her people's back in so too does he have a sizable amount of the Latino vote why that is beyond the very real issue of Jerry mandering their communities to dilute their vote I couldn't legitimately say I don't really generally get into the Latino community's business like that I just try to mind my own black ass business but maybe y'all should call a meeting amongst yourselves or something guys just a suggestion but in 2022 to be fair he did lose a little bit of the Latino vote going from 42% to 40% and listen it's not just the Mexicans and anyone he thinks looks like him including his wife for Greg Abbott it's people who look like him too because you would think a disabled man who uses a wheelchair himself would have more compassion for other people with disabilities but that could not be further from the truth Greg Abbott was paralyzed when he was 26 years old after an oak tree fell on him while he was jogging he sued the homeowner whose tree had fallen on him and a tree service company and he got a $400,000 tax-free settlement and monthly payments for life and he's been very open about the fact that he's relied on those medical expenses for about 30 years and yet and yet would you believe that in 2003 when he was attorney general this was the mother who was a big proponent of Texas capping the amount of money people could be awarded in medical malpractice suits at $250,000 ain't that about a [ __ ] but back to the topic at hand allowing police to be able to arrest anybody on suspicion of being an undocumented immigrant who crossed the border is more than just a little akin to requiring free slaves to walk around with freedom papers and it's something Republicans have been trying to make happen they've been trying to make this happen in 2012 the Supreme Court struck down a law that the Arizona Republicans had passed making it a crime for immigrants not to carry their immigration papers at all times and giving police the freedom to investigate anyone they wanted to is immigration status so not only is it some overtly racist Jim Crow ass [ __ ] you know what some overtly racist fascist Jim Crow ass [ __ ] that's very plainly unconstitutional on its face because again immigration is a federal issue the Supreme Court has already ruled on the issue but you're going to find that Texas Republicans and the Confederate States more specifically are big on trying the same arguments and strategies to expand their power and endanger folk all throughout American's history it's the same Playbook and that's a good thing that's actually very valuable for us because it allows us not to be caught by surprise now listen up so Greg Abbott is notorious for being intensely anti-immigration and he's been that way but his efforts to to endanger migrants at the border have Amplified since 2021 with the launch of what he calls operation loone star it's a multi-billion dollar border security program which simply means this since 2021 Abbott has spent billions of dollars installing illegal and dangerous razor wires and barriers in the water that endanger both migrants and the federal agents that have to guard the Border Abbott insists that these razor wires and barriers are necessary to deter people from crossing the border but statistics reveal that has not been the case as one people continue to cross the border because what people like Greg Abbott deliberately choose to ignore is that people who are risking their lives and the lives of their children to migrate are not doing so because they think it's fun because it's easy or because they can't be bothered to do it the right way do it the right way it's because they literally have no choice for one reason or the next and for many Latin American countries their migration has been made necessary by the US's involvement in their countries moreover despite the hysteria made about undocumented immigrants and immigrants crossing the border most immigrants entering America are not coming through the border and most enter lawfully but further most currently undocumented immigrants did not enter the country as undocumented immigrants they came in lawfully and they're simply Visa overstays America's deliberately stringent immigration system simply doesn't provide people the option to remain or work lawfully and side tangent which Donald Trump's wife Melania knows a lot about and no one ever brings up despite the fact that Trump and the Republicans make it their business to talk about doing it the right way Melania Trump has told so many obvious lies lies lies and inconsistencies about an immigration situation that any immigration lawyer or immigrant who has ever had a Visa could see H girl entered America on a short-term travel visa that does not allow you to work on make money but she proceeded to model all over the place very obviously in violation of that tourist visa until she could eventually Nestle up to a withering authoritarian nectarian hellbent on making the immigration system she knows is hard even harder while vilifying immigrants who do half of what she did just with 20 times the scrutiny sorry if it a side tangent but I'm always thinking about this but if you're interested here is a good article from Politico that you can read contrary to popular belief an immigrant cannot just decide that they want to be a citizen or get a work visa and get one you can't just sit a test no matter how many times you see that on American television 85% of all undocumented immigrants in America are Visa overstays I don't want to stray too much off topic although I thought y'all needed a little bit of context so I encourage you to read a book called border and Rule but the conflict happening now that you're seeing in the news is because Greg Abbott hates migrants and wants to prevent them from crossing the border so much that he quite literally will kill them to do so he ordered that the Texas National Guard set up razor wire and floating razor barriers in the water so that the migrants swimming in the water could not cross the border without being mangled or killed and they also can't turn back because of the current or they'll drown and that's exactly what's been happening and that's what finally made the Biden Administration take some semblance of action when in January a woman and her two children drowned in the Rio Grande because not only did Texas officials refuse to help they refused to allow the federal officials access beyond the barriers so that they could help the woman and her 10-year-old old and 8-year-old child so they all drowned last year the Houston Chronicle reported that the public safety Trooper said that he and other officers were told to quote push small children and nursing babies back into the Rio Grande and have been told not to give the water to Asylum Seekers even in extreme heat mind you people have a legal right to seek Asylum you know we are deploying every tool and strategy that we possibly can the only thing that we're we're not doing is we're not uh shooting people who come across the border uh because of course the B Administration would charge us with murder and that's not even the extent of it the extent of the inhumanity Greg Abbott is commanding migrants be on the receiving end of according to AP News Texas trooper Nicholas Windgate wrote an email to his supervisors lamenting about the inhumanity of what he and the other border agents were being required to do he actually went as far as to say that the quote inhumane things they're doing were not right in the eyes of God in his email he said that on June 25th 2023 when he ran into a group of 120 migrants many of whom were little kids and nursing mothers he and the other agent were ordered to push the people back into the water to go to Mexico that's a quote in his email he said that he also witnessed a 4-year-old girl trying to cross the border through the razor wire and that the Texas National Guard pushed the little girl back as they're required to do and she EV passed out from the heat as well as he witnessed a 19-year-old woman having a miscarriage because she'd been cut so badly by the wire the email chain documented 38 different incidents between June 25th and July 1st of 2023 where migrants were desperately in need of medical assistance because of the injuries that they had sustained from Texas's barriers including weakness to lacerations broken Limbs and drownings and of those 38 migrants those 38 different since 12 were babies and not even a year old yet are you hearing the kind of wickedness that they're intentionally bringing about dog and here is where it gets scary yes where it gets where it starts getting scary so the federal government demanded that they remove these illegal and dangerous barriers from the water and these mother said no so the Biden Administration sent a cease and assist letter to the Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and they didn't give a so in a five for decision the Supreme Court of the United States of America ruled for the federal government and said that they can remove the razor barrier and wires because they are preventing the federal government from having access and control of the border now here's where [ __ ] starts getting really crazy Texas said the Supreme Court the federal government and the president of the United States they're not removing [ __ ] and if the federal government takes it down they'll put it right back the up in fact they said they're going to put up more W speaking on behalf of Governor Abby the lieutenant governor Dan Patrick said quote we are putting up wire everywhere we can we will continue we will not stop if they cut it we will replace it you have to understand they're not just putting up razor wire and ignoring whatever the federal government says is it pertains to the Border Texas is also using $1.5 billion of their own money to create their own border near the border between Mexico and Texas what I think is particularly noteworthy about the fact that Abbott is saying [ __ ] the Supreme Court is that this is the most farri Nut Job ass Supreme Court ever the Mickey Mouse operation we call a supreme court right now is stacked with right-wing goo who have explicitly made their intentions of rolling back all of our rights and civil liberties known and those right-wing ghouls have been on a roll steamrolling over our rights with ease because they're the majority of the court from the pre-trump era we've got Chief John Roberts Clarence Thomas Sam whack ass Alo and post Trump we've got Neil Gorsuch Brett you know what he is Kavanaugh and unqualified ass Amy Cony Barrett that's six of nine lifetime appointments the right has on the court and as a result we're down abortion affirmative action and according to the words of justices like Clarence Thomas they believe that they have a duty a quote duty to correct the error that they made by giving us every right that stems from a case called gwal versus Connecticut's right to privacy accept the right to interracial marriage if you're wondering why not interracial marriage okay then okay then more specifically the rights to contraceptives the right to same-sex marriage and the right to same seexual relationships my point is that even that nut ass right-wing court that actively wants to take all of our rights away and has no problem rubber stamping every case the right has deliberately brought to its doorstep which might I add the right would be calling judicial activism if the left did it which is what they spent years calling cases like Brown versus Board of Education and row ironically enough and anything that happened during the New Deal error but back to the point even this right-wing Court disagreed with Texas understand that Greg Abbott's Texas is going too far for even this supreme court and here's the real gag Greg Abbot wants to go much much further the first thing Greg Abbott said in a statement he issued addressing his refusal to remove the borders was that quote the federal government has broken the compact between the United States and the states brg Abbott is going straight Southern Confederacy let's secede from the United States and Civil War this [ __ ] out I mean he explicitly embraced the Confederate theory of secession which is called the compact theory if you've never heard of the compact Theory it was the basis of the secession acts of the 13 Confederate states when South Carolina Miss Missippi Florida Alabama Georgia Louisiana Virginia Arkansas North Carolina Tennessee Missouri Kentucky and Texas seceded in 1860 because they couldn't stand for a world without their slaves in the secession acts which obviously preceded the Civil War the 13 Confederate states declared that they were dissolving the union that was United under the compact that is the Constitution the argument was and is essentially that America was formed through the consent of the states through a compact agreed upon the Constitution the argument is that each state is in and of itself its own independent Sovereign Nation that agreed to a compact under the Constitution and can thus void that contract and thus the federal law and their constitutional obligations that's how in the minds of the Confederacy they were independent nations who were free to void the Constitution and enter into a separate compact the Confederacy just so they could keep their slaves pay close attention listening to the language in this quote that I'm about to read yall yes it's a little long and in Old English but it is necessary listen listen to the [ __ ] that they are saying because we are going to compare in a moment on February 2nd 1861 Texas declared via their Declaration of causes which impel the state of Texas to seced from the Federal Union quote Texas abandoned her separate National existence and consented to become one of the Confederate states to promote her welfare ensure domestic tranquility and secure more substantially the blessings of peace and Liberty to her people she was received into the Confederacy with her own Constitution under the guarantee of the Federal Constitution and the compact of annexation that she should enjoy these blessings she was received as a commonwealth holding maintaining and protecting the institution known as negro slavery the servitude of the African to the white race with within her limits a relation that existed from the first settlement of her Wilderness by the white race and which her people intended should exist in all future time her institutions in geographical position established the strongest ties between her and other slaveholding states of the Confederacy those ties have been strengthened by association but what has been the course of the government of the United States and of the people and authorities of the non-slaveholding States since our connection with them the controlling majority of the federal government under various pretenses and disguises has so administered the same as to exclude the citizens of the southern states unless under odious and unconstitutional restrictions from all the immense territory owned in common by all the states on the Pacific Ocean for the avowed purpose of requiring sufficient power in the common government to use it as a means of destroying the institutions of Texas and her sister slaveholding states by the disloyalty of the northern states and their citizens and the imbecility of the federal government Infamous combinations of incendiaries and outlaws have been permitted in those States and the common territory of Kansas to trample upon the federal laws to war upon the lives and property of Southern citizens in that territory and finally by violence and MOB law to usurp the possession of the same as exclusively the property of the northern states the federal government while but partially under the control of these our unnatural and sectional enemies has for years almost entirely failed to protect the lives and property of the people of Texas against the Indian Savages on our border and more recently against the murderous foray of banditi from the neighboring territory of Mexico and when our state government has expended large amounts for such purpose the federal government has refused reimbursement therefore thus rendering our condition more insecure and harassing than it was during the existence of the Republic of Texas in other words Texas is our own mother place we only agreed to be here if it would benefit us and it needed to benefit us with our slaves that we said we was going to have forever and with all the money given to us to keep these godamn Native Americans and Latinos off our godamn it and if that's not happening the federal government is in breach of what the we agreed to cuz we agreed to Slaves forever keeping these slaves these these Latinos and these Native Americans in their place and because the federal government ain't doing it Texas is overrun with the stress of these godamn migrants stealing from us and being criminals and costing us money so we are going to go secede and kick it with the other Southern States cuz we want our slaves damn it and keep them Mexicans off our line that's what the they said that's what they said now I need you to compare that language comp compare that language from Confederate Texas in 1861 to the statement released by Greg Abbott on January 24th 2024 quote from Greg Abbott the federal government has broken the compact between the United States and the states the executive branch of the United States has a constitutional duty to enforce federal laws protecting States including immigration laws on the books right now President Biden has refused to enforce those laws and has even violated them the result is that he has smashed records for illegal immig migration despite having been put on notice in a series of letters one of which I delivered to him by hand President Biden has ignored Texas's demand that he perform his constitutional duties President Biden has violated his oath to Faithfully execute immigration laws enacted by Congress instead of Prosecuting immigrants for federal crime of illegal entry President Biden has sent his lawyers into federal court to sue Texas for taking action to secure the Border President Biden has instructed his agencies to ignore Federal statutes that mandate the Detention of illegal immigrants the effect is to illegally allow their inass parole into the United States by wasting taxpayer dollars to tear open Texas's border security infrastructure President Biden has enticed illegal immigrants away from the 28 legal entry points along the state Southern border Bridges where nobody drowns into the Dangerous Waters of the Rio Grande under President Biden's Lawless border policies more than 6 million illegal immigrants have crossed our Southern Border in just 3 years that is more than the population of 33 different states in this country this illegal refusal to protect the states has inflicted unprecedented harm on the people all across the United States James Madison Alexander Hamilton and the other Visionaries who wrote the US Constitution foresaw that state should not be left to the mercy of a lawless president who does nothing to stop external threats like cartels smuggling millions of illegal immigrants across the border that is why the framers included both article 4 section 4 which promises that the federal government government shall quote protect each state against invasion in Article 1 Section 10 Clause 3 which acknowledges the state's Sovereign interest in protecting their borders mind you he's quoting a descent he's quoting scalia's descent in Arizona versus the United States the failure of the Biden Administration to fulfill the duties imposed by article 4 section 4 has triggered Article 1 Section 10 Clause 3 which reserves to this state the right of self-defense for these reasons I have already declared an invasion under article section 10 Clause 3 to invoke Texas's constitutional authority to defend and protect itself that Authority is the supreme law of the land and supersedes any federal statutes to the contrary the Texas National Guard the Texas Department of Public Safety and other Texas Personnel are acting on that Authority as well as state law to secure the Texas border both of those letters and declarations should make a few things clear not least of which being that Texan hysteria about migrants we the blacks and Native Americans but mostly the commitment to criminalize Mexicans in specific and using that as a justification for taking power and enacting violence and war is deeply deeply deeply Texas Confederate racist [ __ ] one is in Old English and the other is new but they went from calling Mexicans banditi in 1861 to drug smuggling cartel members in 2024 but most importantly this should make clear that these [ __ ] talking secession and where there is secession there is Civil War and instead instead of just 13 states like we had during the Declaration of secession in 1861 and the subsequent Civil War this time we have 25 States back in Texas against the federal government and they've already signed their joint statement the 25 States eager to see this country's Union crumble are who you'd expect them to be but I'm going to name them because I believe in noning and Shaman Alabama Alaska Arkansas Florida Georgia Idaho Indiana Iowa Louisiana Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Utah Virginia West Virginia and Wyoming and if you're still deluding yourself to believe that Greg Abbott and every other Republican Governor responsible for a state who is backing him means anything other than business please know that after the Supreme Court's ruling the lieutenant governor Patrick not only told us they were going to continue to put up more wire he said that he went to the border to quote thank them support them and also to stand with them just in case the Biden Administration sent border patrol he said that wisely the Biden Administration didn't send the border patrol there he said that we're thankful they didn't cuz we don't want a confrontation but we want this border secure so in other words definitely concerns me a little bit you know what I mean but you know I I packed that thing too so he come around this way you will get caught listen even if you're a demon yourself or just someone who's bought into American propaganda that you should just do it the right way so you could care less about the migrants dying and being maimed at the border you aren't in any less danger by what it means that Abbott is refusing to listen to both the federal government and the Supreme Court the Supreme Court is meant to serve as the final check in our system of checks and balances if States simply disregard the Supreme Court their Authority will become meaningless and so too do the constitutional rights they recognized and are tasked with defending and this isn't just political Theory mumbo jumbo it's very much a real thing you probably remember this from high school but the Supreme Court actually used to be very weak at the beginning of this nation's history the Supreme Court was meant to be the quote least dangerous branch of the government because they had no soldiers or money to make people do what they wanted according to Alexander Hamilton in other words you can make some ruling sure but if we don't want to do it what you going to do about it [ __ ] so scotus was weak as until your boy John Marshall came around in 1803 and established judicial review in the very famous case I know you're remembering now Marbury versus Madison judicial review isn't explicitly said in the Constitution but Marshall believed it was obviously inferred that the Supreme Court had the right to decide whether something was unconstitutional and that's really the beginning of the Court beginning to get some respect around this [ __ ] and when that Authority has been challenged it's posed significant threat to marginalized people for example you remember Brown versus Board of Education when the Supreme Court ruled that separate wasn't equal and thus the laws requiring black and white people to attend segregated schools were unconstitutional which ironically enough is one of the major cases is where the South raised the compact Theory argument in court to justify why they had the right to segregate schools and ignore the court well the South the Confederate States weren't having that they weren't having it so much they literally organized what's known as the massive resistance or the Stanley plan it was a plan used by Senator Harry bird it had a lot of legs on it on how the state would use their funds and they would create discriminatory boards to prevent black students from getting into schools but that was the least of what the governors were willing to do the Arkansas govern sent the National Guard to help the segregation as prevent black children from entering the schools altogether an incident that became known as The Little Rock crisis because President Eisenhower considered using the National Guard as The Little Rock and I had to cross a mob and armed officers just to exercise their rights to enter and go to the school because the southern states had decided that they don't give a last what the Supreme Court had to say the court would go on to have to reaffirm its ruling in a case called Brown versus Board 2 and then finally in a case called Cooper versus Aaron where they had to not just reaffirm Brown and Brown to but to explicitly reject the compact Theory and state that the states had no right to nullify or ignore their decisions in Brown and Brown too you know how they always tell us if you don't know your history you're doomed to repeat it this is why because what's happening now has happened before and we should understand the magnitude of what's to come and how people suffer when States decide to Buck the systems of checks and balances to do the inhuman main things that they want to do but Greg Abbott is not just bad on immigration or the Constitution he is also bad on everything [Music] else there have been at least seven mass shootings in Texas since Greg Abbott became governor in 2015 there was the Southerland Spring Church shooting in 2017 where a 26-year-old white man named Devin Kelly walked into the southernland Springs Church and shot and killed 20 7 people and injured another 22 people and do you know what the Texas Attorney General said quote we've had shootings in churches for you know forever it's it's going to happen again and so we need people in churches Professional Security or at least arming some of the parishioners or the congregation so they can respond when something like this happens again end quote and Greg Abbott topped that off with a good old thoughts and prayers what bro what are you talking about man I'm not even going to act surprised that in 2017 their response to the church getting shot up was well you know our churches stay getting shot up and they will stay getting shut up so get your pastors blii up and get the out our face instead of doing something to stop every Tom Dick and crazy from being able to get a gun because after the southernland spring church shooting there was the Santa Fe High School shooting in 2018 where a 17-year-old white boy went to school with a shotgun and a revolver and shot and killed 10 people what did Greg Abbott do then then moment of silence and school shooter drills but still no gun restrictions then there was the El Paso Walmart shooting August 3rd 2019 where a 21-year-old white boy specifically targeting Mexicans this mother drove all the way from Allen to El Paso walked into a Walmart and killed 22 people and literally just a few weeks later the Midland Odessa Rampage the same month where a 36-year-old white man went on a whole drive by shooting spree where he used an AR-15 to shoot eight people to death and what did Greg Abbott do after having two mass shootings in the space of a month on his watch he signed eight executive orders doing everything but restricting gun access in fact this mother really did his big one because he not only failed to pass any new gun regulations they actually passed the law making it significantly easier to buy and carry guns eliminating permit requirements for handguns Al together in most cases so that people were allowed to carry handguns with no license at all so yeah despite these mass shootings your boy Greg insists on making it easier to get guns not coincidentally as much as Greg and his Republican boys love running their mouth about liberal Democrat cities and their gun violence please let it be known that the prize for Abbott's continued weakening of the gun laws in Texas is that Texas not only has the highest rates of gun deaths in the country gun deaths are the leading cause of deaths for Texans under 18 years old on average 3,996 people die and 5,556 are wounded by guns every year in Texas and that's how we got you waldi I want to just tell you exactly what's going on the nation is ending a week marked by the second worst school shooting ever but we continue to get these new details out of Texas which show mistakes misinformation and in some places lies it shows that the ongoing tragedy has become clearly a full-blown Scandal especially for Texas's Republican Governor Greg Abbott who now says he's quote livid about how he received what was false information about aspects of this attack and response and then how he spread it but he's also using this as a time to take his platform within a crisis to lie about gun safety and gun control now here are the new details that are emerging about the failed police response to this shooter and some of them are just absolutely gut-wrenching we are learning the timeline which has now been updated because of the misinformation I mentioned we're learning that 19 police officers erroneously waited 45 minutes outside the classroom without ever breaking in to confront the Killer Inside we are learning that the killer was able to thus continue to repeatedly fire weapons again while the police were outside the door we are learning that more calls to 911 kept pouring in from inside the classroom from the children inside who'd watched their fellow students murdered and those new calls were begging for police who we now know were just a few feet away and we know those police continue to wait and fail to act experts say this is a total breakdown failure and that it was a quote wrong decision Days Later Texas officials do not even have words to try to explain this response failure personally I knew that Greg Abbott couldn't be stopped when ubaldi didn't end him I wrote an article for Teen Vogue titled ubaldi Shooting a case for defunding the police and disarming teens in that article I said that there had never been a clearer demonstration of police inaptitude dishonesty failure and callous disregard for our lives than what unfolded in Uvaldi Texas the shooting at Rob Elementary School despite the fact that Uvaldi invests nearly 40% of their annual budget in the police department they had a local SWAT team and the school district itself had its own Police Department on May 24th 2022 at least 19 officers allowed the shooter to barricade himself in a classroom room then stood out in the hallway for at least 40 minutes while students hiding in adjoining classrooms called 911 repeatedly at least six times begging begging them to please send help and not only did those police stand outside and allow a fourth grade class to be massacred while they stood outside sometimes with their backs to the school they actually tackled tazed handcuffed and threatened to arrest the parent parents of the children who were begging them to either go inside or let them go inside and save their children and the police were caught in more lives than we can count the police lied so godamn much and Greg Abbott fed those lies to the media and the public so godamn much that he had no choice but to admit it yes I was misled I am liid about what happened I was on this very stage two days ago and I was telling the public information that had been told to me in a room just a few yards behind where we're located right now I wrote down handn notes in detail about what everybody in that room told me in sequential order about what happened and when I came out here on this stage and told the public what happened it was a recitation of what people in that room told me whether it be law enforcement officials or non-law enforcement officials whatever the case may be and as everybody has learned the the information that I was given turned out in part to be inaccurate youal happened because an 18-year-old white boy was able to waltz into a store and just buy two AR-15s which by the way has been the weapon of choice in at least 13 high-profile mass shootings since 2012 and let's stop right quick and look at the identities of all the mass Shooters who've been terrorizing Texas and let's have a moment of silence for what they all have in common interesting how Greg Abbott isn't asking to use the powers he has let alone expand them to stop these white boys from shooting up Texas every chance they get but he don't get tired of telling you what a danger to Texas the Mexicans are okay when it comes to these white yosity Sam ass [ __ ] terrorizing every public place in Texas suddenly he don't stereotype groups Suddenly It's about these individuals struggling with mental health which is interesting because it would suggest that this man who was unwilling to restrict access to guns because he says the problem is mental health not guns would certainly be trying to pour money into mental health and Healthcare right right right right n Texas ranks dead last in mental health care in the United States and 41st for prevalence of Youth mental illness and lack of access to care and that still didn't stop your man Greg from slashing $211 million from the Department that oversees the state's Mental Health Services just a month before the Uvaldi shooting in 2022 worse than that Texas openly calls its prison system the largest provider of mental health care in the state think about that for a second so everybody in the state of Texas now agrees including Sheriff's Association the Texas Association of counties the jail commission everybody is comfortable saying well the county jail system is the largest provider quote unquote provider of mental health care in the state of Texas and I refuse to accept that definition what we say is that the county jail system in Texas is the largest Warehouse of people with mental illness in the state of Texas and Harris County jail haris county where I live is the largest one in the state of Texas over 80% of our population is tagged as psych so like how did we get here right I mean that's the question that that I want answered is how did we get here because we saw this happening in the last 8 10 years slowly we saw this happening because every every session we hear about millions and millions of dollars going into mental health care quote unquote working with Justice involved populations but somehow we still end up seeing people who are the state's clients in the jails and I'll give you an anecdote which is so common in our work that we see like almost every day a family calls the crisis Outreach um line which is a mandatory service that the state has to provide it's called the mobile crisis Outreach team so it's called the mcot so you call this line crisis hotline because your loved one is in crisis they respond and they go well is he actively is he or she actively hurting himself or somebody else if not then we can't engage okay if the response is yes they're actively hurting themselves or somebody else well now it's too late you have to call the cops or we're going to send the cops so when is it like not bad enough and between like not bad enough and bad enough when is the right time for the crisis team to engage seems like never because it's either this like you're waiting for somebody to do something where at that point now they're at a very high risk of incarceration but then on the other hand um when when it gets to that point the the solution is cops and then they go straight to jail so I often say in my interviews I often say when we talk about the Mental Health crisis in jails I say the road to our public mental health system is being forced to go through the jails Mental Health Care is so abhorent in Texas especially with respect to how people struggling with mental health are criminalized that even the officers and the people working within the system find themselves agreeing with The Advocates on at least that much we had a case not one actually several cases this past year where people called the crisis line their families called because they were self Haring they were trying to commit suicide they were taken to the hospital they continued to try committing suicide in the hospital the hospital got mad because the beam broke when they were trying to hang themselves they called the Sheriff's Office and without stabilizing this person they shipped them off to the jail now I can't understand why the sheriff had to book that person in their jail because sure enough within a week that person killed themselves in suicide watch so what this person and this person voluntarily admitted themselves to the hospital even though they were in crisis they understood enough to know that they needed to be admitted so they they signed and then they admitted to the hospital and the hospital shipped them off to the jail without stabilizing them yes and so we see that a lot criminalization of people with behavioral health issues at the place where they went to get care and you see that in all those hospitals there's huge posters that say this type of behavior will not be tolerated there like a whole list of things that will not be tolerated but it's a Behavioral Health Hospital language or shouting or erratic Behavior but this is what they're coming to the he to the hospital for help for right because they have the symptoms of their behavioral health are such that they are going to exhibit those kind of behaviors but you but you're saying you are going to criminalize them for those behaviors so we're seeing a lot of that happen and those people end up sitting in jails and of course when they get to jail they also raack keep racking up more charges in the jail because they can't follow Direction they just don't know how to be we had so many horrendous cases where people with developmental disabilities like you know their brains haven't developed Beyond four years because of either trauma or um or seizure disorders when they were kids or whatever right so now they look like grown-ups and adults but they are kids in their mind and jail uses restraints like fourpoint restraints on them chemical restraints um obviously use of force because they don't know how to follow Direction um and then you see them racking up charges and so we have had to intervene sort of pretty dramatically in some cases you know copy everybody at the legislature and the judicial commission mental health and the Health and Human Services you know like everybody and their grandmother we copy them on these emails and say do you realize this is the kind of person that you've that you're that you've got in your jail and instead of diverting them we tried to put some continuity of care in place after Sandra Bland passed away it's called the Sandra Bland act did lots of things one of the things it did it would have never saved s Bland's life but that's a different story but um what according to S Bland act you have to at intake you have to run a mental health screening on every person that's getting booked in and you have to run their name to the state system to see if they were receiving services from the state for mental health or developmental disabilities in the past 3 years from the date of booking and if their name flags up then your local mental health authority in that county will automatically know they'll get that notification so we did that after that what happens we are not very clear what happens because there is no meaningful continuity of care unless that local mental health authority has a contract with the jail to provide supplemental Services otherwise they don't have to do that unless they have a contract which is bizarre like I was talking to a sheriff and he Tex us and he said chrish I don't understand why do I need a contract with my own mental health authority for them to serve their client who's inside my jail walls what changes between outside my jail walls and inside my jail walls they should still be coming and providing services and he's absolutely right but that's the way it's set up right so now this person is decompensating and there's no meaningful continuity of care then you're going to evaluate them and find them Inc competent to stand trial and then they're going to go wait for the State Hospital bed uh for competency restoration which is about 2 years long now our forensic weight list for people who are found incompetent to stand trial is over 2,200 right now that's a 2 threee long wait for a lot of people now people think oh they're waiting for a bed for State Hospital once they get there they're going to get mental healthare no we all know competency restoration is educating you about your rights and your charges just so we can punish you for your disability right so we have cases now of people waiting to go to the state hospital for competency resistration and dying while they're on the wait list or waiting so long that they've timed out on their charges so then they get kicked out but again not connected to services and remember operation Lan star from earlier well in 2023 rag Abbott cut millions of dollars from mental health care to fund it but not to worry not to worry he replaced the money he cut from Mental Health Care by taking it from the money given to help Texas recover from the co pandemic and speaking of Co Greg Abbott had one of the worst Co responses in the nation which is why his approval ratings with Texas voters dropped at the time if you didn't know it's because he was distracting you with operation loone star Madness on the border over 57,000 people have died from Co in Texas since the pandemic began people are still dying daily from covid in Texas at the height of Co Texas was getting as many as 177,000 new cases a day the hospitals were so overcrowded and their staff was so overworked and so overwhelmed that Greg Abbott had to ask the federal government for help and asked the hospitals to stop performing all elective procedures because at least 53 hospitals had completely run out of hospital beds this is in no small part due to the fact that Greg Abbott banned mask mandates he wouldn't require schools to conduct contact tracing or that the schools informed parents if a student got covid and he allowed parents to send their sick ass children to school but back to yaldi what did Greg Abbott do for the people of Uvaldi nothing thoughts and prayers now here's the reason real gag Not only was Uvaldi not the Reckoning it should have been Abbot got reelected just 5 months later and he won 60% of the vote in Uvaldi ain't that some [ __ ] the families of the children who were killed in Uvaldi shooting supported bador in the election because he was actually trying to do something about the easy access to guns by raising the minimum age required to buy AR-15s and yet the people of Uvaldi did not to which some of the family members commented Business Insider in the Texas Tribune reported that Jasmine cazares the 17-year-old sister of a 9-year-old girl Jaclyn cazares who was killed in the shooting said quote unfortunately 21 people dead doesn't change people's minds Belinda arola the grandmother of a 10-year-old girl who was killed amarie joara said quote the only thing that is going to change people's minds is when it happens to them and a teacher Veronica Mata commented quote everybody has the right to vote for whoever they want we just hoped that they would see where we were coming from and see what we wanted to change you have to be 21 to buy a case of beer but an 18-year-old bought a gun to kill kids that does not make sense to be clear that's a call to raise the age limit to buy an AR15 style weapon from 18 to 21 a republican governor in Florida broke with the NRA to sign this into law after the Parkland mass shooting Mr M uh Governor Abbott you say this can't be done in Texas Mr oror you say it will be done if you're elected can you please explain your positions let's start with you Governor Abbott you have 60 seconds first there's no reason why a little girl like that should ever have to say anything like that there's a reason why these parents are angry and and they're rightfully angry and I can feel their pain no sh no parent should lose a child and we want to do everything we can to make sure that does not happen we want to end school shootings but we cannot do that by making false promises it's a false promise to suggest that we can pass a law that will be upheld uh by the Constitution uh to raise the age and here's why the most recent Federal Court of Appeals decision on this particular issue said that it was unconstitutional for a state to raise the age from 18 to 21 for a person to buy an AR-15 so any attempt to try to to raise the age is going to be met uh with it being overturned so we need get to the bottom of what is really ailing our communities and that is the mental health that is leading people to engage in school shootings and Texas is already addressing that now let's break down all the lies shall we the lies there you go [ __ ] Li first he says there's no reason why a little girl should have to say anything like that but he's the reason no there have been seven school shootings on his watch and many of which like the ones this little girl is talking about were carried out by 18-year-olds Abbott and CIS should be allowed to buy d dangerous weapons like AR-15s he says the parents are rightfully angry and he can feel their pain but he clearly doesn't feel it enough to do anything about it he's saying no parent should lose a child and he wants to do everything in his power to make sure that doesn't happen but clearly not this isn't some kind of mystery the parents and the children that he says his heart goes out to so deeply are explicitly telling him what they want and need to be done raise the age limit stop letting people be able to buy guns like Tic Tacs and he has continuously said no more than no remember this is the man who actually made it easier to get guns after the El Paso and Midland Odessa shootings which brings us to the second point he says he can't raise the age limit because that wouldn't be constitutional first of all it's not unconstitutional at all in fact I want you all to know the Supreme Court has had very little to say on the issue of gun rights throughout American history in general it's actually a pretty sparse doctrinal thread but nowhere in the Constitution nor in any precedent established by the court is anyone guaranteed the right to a gun at 18 years old the state has the ability to decide age restrictions and other restrictions which Greg Abbott obviously knows because Texas regulates guns how they like requiring mostly not requiring not requiring permits and the like when they please but even if the Constitution explicitly said you have a constitutional right to an AR-15 when you turn 18 years old this entire video is about the fact that Greg Abbott could not begin to give the slightest about what the Constitution the federal government or the Supreme Court says if it doesn't align with what he wants to do period because you know what is explicit in the Constitution Andor wellestablished precedent from the Supreme Court checks and balances that where there's conflict between the federal and the state government the federal government wins that immigration in the border is a federal issue and that it's the literal constitutional obligation of the Supreme Court to be the final decision makers on whether something is constitutional and they told him the [ __ ] he's doing at the border is unconstitutional and you know what that said tell Joe Biden and the federal government to conce me I'll be waiting at the border this is the same mother telling anybody who he suspects is Mexican they better have their freedom papers despite the fact that the Supreme Court already told Arizona to cut that [ __ ] out he don't care about nobody's Constitution third he says the real issue is mental health but we've been over this already the man doesn't give a about mental health or providing resources to deal with it and while we're at it despite all that Law and Order of Public Safety tough on crime crime crime crime Andi andite Andi [ __ ] he be talking when he wants to convince us that all migrants are senior members of the cartel when it comes to guns and the real mass shootings actually happening in Texas he won't so much as support red flag laws Governor abbid the the last time you ran for governor we ask you about red flag laws and those are laws which could stop uh an individual with a potential intention to harm others from purchasing a gun and you said about that quote I would not support a red flag law that would take guns away from people without due process now a lot has happened in those four years are you open to implementing red flag laws today you have 30 seconds well let me tell you what I support and I don't support what what I support is uh making it a felony uh for someone to lie on a background check I signed that into law last year uh I uh approve of expanding background checks to include juvenile records also approve of making it a crime for criminal gangs to buy or to possess a gun but I'm still against uh red flag laws for the reason that it would deny a a lawful Texas gun owner their constitutional right to to-do process and let me just break that dog whistle down in case it got by you so he says he's made it illegal for gang members to buy our own guns all together but he can't support raising the age to own guns Beyond 18 years old or to take the guns away from people who've been flagged as a threat to either themselves or others because that would violate their rights to Due Process hm so let's review our note shall we you already know that he's arresting any Latino mostly American citizens and accusing them of being migrants who cross the border illegally so you know how he perceives different groups of people which groups of people do you think he and his police officers are assuming our gang members who are these people that he feels comfortable taking their guns from the right to guns all together H it's somehow totally constitutional and not violating anyone's rights to their guns to completely deny these people the right to buy or own a gun at all but there's something stopping him from doing the much much much much more minor regulation of Simply raising the age or invoking red flag laws why is that well this discussion we're having about raising the age and red flag laws is specifically about stopping the mass shootings in Texas now let's again flash on the screen a photo of the perpetrators of the mass shootings and observe what they have in common so that's whose rights they're talking about when raise the age and red flag laws thbs up because that's who we're trying to stop from carrying out these mass shootings and then and only then does the same Greg Abbott requiring Freedom papers from the Latinos arresting American citizens Under Suspicion of being immigrants and profiling black and brown people as gang members so we can strip them of their gun rights altogether ignoring and threatening the federal government On the Border suddenly become gridlocked by the Constitution okay sure sure buddy if Greg Abbott wanted to do something about guns if he gave a about you or your children he would but he doesn't he cares about the NRA period don't let this man play in your face like he's some champion of the Constitution and it's not just migrants and school children Gregs letting down oh no he's got smoked for women black people and the entire lgbtq Community too but you knew that already listen in Texas it is an allout assault on marginalized groups so let's take a top down approach starting with the things that impacts everyone under the umbrella and moving down to his specific attacks on individual groups so I think the best place to start is with education because that to me is an underrecognized but critical tool in the rights assault on freedoms and the response to the black lives matter movement and the more Progressive shift the society is moving towards speaking of black lives matter a movement that Greg Abbott is no fan of might I add he's actually working on pardoning a man who killed a protester at a black Liv matter rally into 2020 as we speak the man's name was Daniel Perry not to be confused with Daniel Penny who murdered a young black homeless man in New York City Jordan NE on the subway but I do think it's worth mentioning that both of these white men carrying out these hate crimes have military backgrounds Daniel Perry being an army Sergeant and Daniel peny being an ex-marine take that information and do with it what you may it's not a coincidence to me that the rise of black lives matter particularly during the summer of 2020 following George Floyd's murder when there were protests happening every day everywhere across the country making black lives matter arguably the most popular civil rights movement of all time that the rights started to make a concerted effort to ban books ban black history attack education in schools and colleges attacking Tik Tok Twitter and anything that they perceived as responsible for the seismic shift and how the public viewed the bigotry and abuse that are still the status quo but no longer go unchallenged because the reality is when people know better they do better and that's why Republicans don't want people being taught American history notice I didn't say black history I said American history because that's what black history is I want people to start questioning why American history wouldn't include all of America's history everything that's happened in America and everything America's done why would history be cherry-picked information that excludes quite literally everyone that's not white in this country why would the history of black people in this country be removed from that narrative the same goes for Native American history lgbtq history and every other important part of the story that's deliberately left out so that Americans can continue seeing whiteness as default and everyone else and everything pertaining to them as other optional and electives and none of these attacks are new just elevated Republicans have always been attacking education because here's the unpleasant reality that the right doesn't like to hair the more educated you are the least likely you are to identify with and vote Republican it just is what it is when I was in college back in 2011 and before for others Republicans were constantly attacking liberal arts colleges and social sciences as the breeding ground for indoctrinating their children which is why conservatives hated Twitter so much where the users were more likely to be younger college educated and more likely to vote Democrat and that's precisely why right-wing Bandits like Elon Musk took it over and immediately started Banning major leftist accounts stripping articles of their headlines to make it harder to disseminate news which has been the primary use of the site and now they've transferred that hate to Tik Tok which is effectively kind of taking on the role Twitter once filled allowing young progressives to give voice to issues and new is the right prefers to be buried and again when did they start calling for Banning Tik Tok after the 2020 protest it's why Nikki Haley's nut ass was just calling for a Tik Tok band the other day the right has an old Playbook and they don't switch tactics it's the same rebranded tactic every time and it's a simple one keep people from learning period first it was affirmative action then it was liberal arts colleges then it was critical race Theory then it was wokeness then it was the woke mind virus then it was cancel culture then it was the culture wars then it was books there was Tik Tok now it's Dei they are invested in keeping people uninformed and that's why their base is stupid as and they know what they're doing remember when Fox got sued because Tucker Carlson was the faming Karen McDougall and fox argued quote no reasonable viewer takes Tucker Carlson seriously they know they feed people's stupid absolute lies and the court knows it too because they agreed and ruled in their favor because what I'm always trying to explain to people is that right-wing views or the status quo are not so pervasive and prevalent because they are Rock Solid intelligent theories that are hard to debunk in fact the opposite is true they're simply what you hear the most and are constantly being taught and reinforced to believe if you could hear the counterargument or the real facts their house of bigoted bricks comes tumbling down the right's only tactic consists entirely of preventing people from having access to information contrary to what they're feeding us that's why while the left is busy toiling and racking our brains as to how to get specific messages to the public Republicans are never trying to to figure out how to tell us anything they're only ever working to keep the other side from telling people things at all so it should come as no surprise that Greg Abbott banned at least 625 books from Texas schools he told the public he banned sexually explicit books but big surprise that's a lie most of the Books banned have committed no crime other than centering the experience of marginalized communities like black people POC LGBT people Jewish people Muslim people he banned books like Nobel Prize winner Tony Mor's The Bluest Eye that told the story of a little black girl struggling to deal with the effects of racism and abuse during the Great Depression era he banned George Johnson's all boys aren't blue which tells the author's own life story of growing up black and queer he even banned the black friend a book by my friend and author Frederick Joseph but that's not all he's also rolling around and saying things like go woke go broke and signed a law Banning diversity equity and inclusion offices from every Texas college or else he'd strip them of their state funding he's called them anti-whites and claimed Texas will now return to promoting merits because the implication there is that black people and other people of color are not qualified and undeserving Abbot like the whole Republican party will not get off black people in the LGBT community's neck and I mean it deeply when I say he is on the lgbtq community's neck in 2015 he was fighting the legalization of gay marriage in 2017 he signed a law allowing adoption agencies to discriminate against LGBT people and called a special session to try to pass a law regulating what public bathrooms trans people could use in 2019 he jumped down Chick-fil-A's throat for finally deciding to stop funding their anti-lgbt hate groups in 2021 he signed a law Banning trans athletes from school sports uh in in Texas last session we passed a law uh prohibiting biological men from competing and women sports in uh the education level from high school down this next session we will pass a law prohibiting biological men to compete against women in college sports in 2022 this man started real life investigating trans kids families for providing their children with gender affirming care but books aren't all he's Banning let's talk abor [ __ ] because Greg Abbot banned that before The Supreme Court even got around to overturning Row in 2021 Greg Abbott passed a 6we abortion ban which prior to ro being overturned was one of the strictest abortion laws in the country he not only banned abortions in 6 weeks he gave private citizens the ability to sue abortion providers and there was no exception for rape or incest so if that's how he was carrying on before row you just know he couldn't wait to ban abortion all together once roow was overturned and that's exactly what the he did no exceptions for rape he even went as far as to tell survivors of rape to take Plan B and that he'll just eliminate rape oh why didn't we think think of that just get rid of rape this morning growing outrage over Governor Greg Abbott's stunning response to a question about why Texas's new abortion law lacks an exception for rape or incest the Republican Governor's answer his state will eliminate the crime of rape altoe Texas will work tirelessly to make sure that we eliminate all rapists from the streets of Texas by aggressively going out and uh arresting them and Prosecuting them and getting them off the streets so goal number one in the state of Texas is to eliminate rape so that no woman no person will be a victim of rape the reality Abbott has not required the legislature to take up any rape prevention legislation so no exceptions for rape no exceptions for incest and he truly doesn't give a Fu about medical emergencies either life-threatening or not because this happened literally as I was writing this on February 23rd Texas doctors refused to give a woman a medically necessary abortion for an ectopic pregnancy the Biden Administration passed a federal law following called the emergency medical treatment and Labor Act requiring the states to perform life-saving abortions and you know what Texas said QE and go to hell we not doing it and he doesn't plan to stop at abortion Texas governor Greg Abbott is weighing in on Alabama's Landmark Supreme Court decision that Frozen embryos are human beings the court also ruled people who get rid of embryos can be held liable for wrongful death some Alabama fertility clinics have now stopped offering IVF service services this morning on CNN's State of the Union Governor Abbott said Texas will be among many states who will consider the next steps with IVF I what I don't know is the families who may have Frozen embryos what happens if they were done so that a mother could uh have a pregnancy But after those embryos were frozen the mother passes away what happens then we have to understand the real issue and it's not abortion it's Republicans wanting to dismantle women's rights and women's ability to choose that's what the Republicans are trying to sell to white Americans particularly white men that they can go back to the days where they could get a wife they could control leave her barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen treat her however and she could not leave that's why you see them suddenly going after no fault divorce and now IVF and don't even for one second think that any of this is because Greg Abbott or Texas gives a about children babies pregnancy women pregnant people or any of it please get strapped into your see because it's about to get heroin we support the the defense work for uh operation loone star detainees and because of that we hear a lot about the conditions in those in those two facilities um and and we can see you know how absolutely insane it is like now they're arresting women arresting pregnant women yeah so it's just um I wake up every morning cursing Governor rabbit that's all I can say the thing that really triggered me and my other friends to start Texas jail project was this one story that my friend told us this person that she was was locked up with black woman young high-risk pregnancy she was locked up there for a bounce check um obviously couldn't affer an attorney you couldn't afford her baill she had never made it in her pregnancy Beyond 7 months she had health issues she was always highrisk that particular pregnancy she made it Beyond 7 months and then started having problems and when she started asking for help this was Victoria County Jail about 3 hours from Harris County uh on the Gulf Coast she started asking for help and they stuck her in solitary um where she kept pressing the red button for help and of course help never came and she ended up having the baby on top of the toilet and the baby died and then she was never even allowed to go attend the baby's funeral like whatever it was a horrific story but we but we said let's just collect these stories and we'll give them to the people who are uh experts and we'll go back to our lives and so we like set up this little website we shared a few stories and because all we knew at that time were women and pregnant women's issues stuff just started pouring in it was like floodgates open people started sharing their stories so we were like oh this is a bigger problem than we thought this is not like oneoff thing this one woman being stuck in solitary and giving birth and like this is not oneoff okay so now we have all these stories we said okay let's just go to the Commissioner's Court or go to the jail commission and share these stories so he went to the jail commission and the push back was you know all these shut UPS going y'all must be making this [ __ ] up because we don't have that many pregnant women in our jails so we said that's a great question like how many do we have because we don't have we don't we can't seem to find any data on them and they said oh well we don't count them so there was so there was no data being collected on right so they this this so pregnant women literally did not count so that was our first legislative win in 2008 2009 when we said you have to count as soon as you find out that they're pregnant or if you test them and they find out they're pregnant you have to count and have a monthly report so now we know that roughly 400 to 500 pregnant women are booked pregnant people are booked every month in Texas County jails and there's a specific way that the abortion ban is overlapping with the criminal system and I wouldn't be me if I didn't tell y'all what Greg Abbott is doing with Texas jail and incarcerated people who knew it was coming let's talk jails y all know that Riker bail reform and pre-trial jail conditions hair in New York City are my bread and butter so there was no way I was going to let you leave this video without understanding what Greg Abbott is doing to the jails and the people awaiting trial in his state so I went to chrish gundu founder of the Texas jail project because that's her wheelhouse and she delivered by the time Chris and I were done talking I was so overwhelmed with the magnitude of the problem in Texas so I'm going to share some of that coners ation with you hair if you're interested in watching the entire interview with chish let me know and maybe I'll make that available for the people who have paid memberships to my channel so comment and click that button for now take it away chish last year we had uh in the entire State just in county jails right so our County Jail population is about 76,000 roughly uh over 76% is pre- trial in Harris County that that number was about 87% free trial in haris County we had 28 reported custody deaths in 201 2022 in 2023 we had 19 reported but we know there were 21 they shipped people to the hospital and give them a PR Bond and then they don't have to count the death right we know how they shed those deaths so we know we know they were more than they reported so we always talk about the number that was reported which is often much less than the number that's actually true and in the entire State last year we had so we still keep finding debts that are not reported so we send notifications to the Sheriff's Office and say hey do you know it's a Class B misdemeanor not to report the death to the AG's office within 30 days and so this past year in 13 months since January 2023 to January 2024 we got 13 deaths reported Statewide that were previously unreported so as per our numbers last year we've had about 191 deaths City deaths in jail in our jails like wow in the entire state of Texas that's 242 County jails so I let me let me backtrack so two sessions ago we had a passage of a bill called sb6 and sb6 was sold to us as a quote unquote Bill Reform Bill but what it was was it was punishment to Harris County which is where I live the largest county jail in the state um we have about 10,000 people and it was punishment to Harris County for us having passed misdemeanor bail reform which was successful it's keeping thousands of people out of jails because we give them general order bonds now when they are charged with misdemeanors but it was a huge hit for the bail bond industry right like they lost millions and millions of dollars overnight and so this was so sb6 was a move to prevent this good sort of of misdemeanor bail reform from spreading to the other counties in Texas because there were other lawsuits in Dallas and Travis County Austin you know other places where they were trying to do the same thing and so this was a way to stop that from happening and spreading to the rest of Texas so what s sp6 essentially did was that because our misdemeanor Bill reform was a federal consent decree it couldn't really touch it they tried to break it down but it couldn't really touch it it was it was protected but then nobody else could have it in the rest of the state so because of sb6 we've had massive pre-trial detention expansion jails are overcrowded to the point where our jail Harris County Jail we are sending almost 12200 people out of the county at a cost of 50.3 million to the taxpayers and this is going to this is this the part that really kills me 50.3 million to private prison companies and not just in state out of the state so we have four places we're sending our folks to West Texas about 7 hours away running a facility run by MTC um which is a private prison company then we're sending folks to Louisiana with Lal Corrections and then we're sending folks to Mississippi with cor Civic so we have four different facilities in which we are spending 50.3 million per year to send about 1,200 people pre-trial all of them pre-trial right and when people die there which has happened when people when a person died in Louisiana the state of Texas doesn't have to do anything we don't have to count their Deb we don't have to investigate there we don't have to do anything which is like a great way to make people disappear pre-ra right it's to make it right because putting the Das off on other people they don't they don't count they're not the Taxas and custody deaths even though right so it was our Our Community member we paid for their incarceration we paid for the transportation to Lal in Louisiana but once they were dead they didn't count they literally don't count anymore uh but I digress so that's that's that's you know that's the ripple effect of sb6 is the expansion in pre- trial detention so if 3 years ago somebody had said to me you're going to have a jail that's overcrowded and exploding once again I would have laughed them off because we had had just passed m demor bail reform and we were going to keep thousands of people out of jail but I guess one of the unintended consequences of that has been they are so pissed off that they decided oh we're going to overcharge people I guess we're going to charge them with felonies because then you can't get out but also a provision in Sp sp6 was even if you're charged with a misdemeanor now that doesn't matter if you had a felony like 20 years ago you've gone to prison you've taken care of that it's all clear and done that's what we're going to talk but that's what we're going to take into account and not give you a PR B now for your misdemeanor wow so that's the reason why now not in haris County but in all the other counties the explosion in jail population has been a lot of people who are sitting there on misdemeanors who can't get a PR Bond because of ancient history one of the other things that was part of sp6 they were they punished all the bail funds so Community bail funds you know we had a community bail Fund in East Texas we shut it down after sb6 passed because one of the provisions in sb6 was well first of all you have to rep report every month to the sheriff about all your bailouts and secondly you can't bail people out who have felonies so we said well are the bail bond companies going to follow the same rules are you going to have them report on all their bailouts every month no well then why are we being held to a different standard right and so we just shut down our our um Community bail fund unfortunately because we didn't want to go through those extra reporting requirements and we didn't want to be told who we could bail out and not bailout like why why can't we bail out people on felonies right that whole line drawing between misdemeanor and felonies and nonviolent and violent we just just want to call it it just goes to show how the system it has nothing to do with they don't want to honor any pre-trial system or anything that they say it's all just uh smok and mirrors because the minute you set this High bail on people you set High bail on poor people that you know they can't pay so that they have to go to jail pre-trial and something they haven't been convicted of so that they don't actually have their rights and then if other people want to bail them out which is they're right they go and get the money to bail them out you have decided that they can't be bailed out so effectively what you are making sure you do is that you're you're punishing people pre-trial you're making sure that people go to jail for crimes they've not been convicted of so that brings us to the end not the end of all Greg Abbot's wrongdoings but the end of this video because y'all I am tired I am tired do y'all believe that my dumbass decided to do this video thinking oh this is going to be way less work than Eric Adams I thought it would be Greg Abbott is not my personal Archen enemy the way that Eric Adams is so it'll be easy and when what a naive and silly thought cuz imagine thinking you going to compile all the wrongdoings of a who' been Governor three times attorney general and sat on the Supreme Court the clown is me okay I was quickly quickly exhausted but if you did make it to the end I hope that you enjoyed this video I didn't really get to touch on a lot of things in depth like how he handles crime homelessness policing the climate crisis and honestly there's a lot more to discuss in terms of him and voting the black community and the LGBT community but this was already long okay this was long I could have wrapped this up at immigration and him on the border and this would have still been long so if you enjoyed this and you really want me to do a part two of touching on everything I left out
