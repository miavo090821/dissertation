wow my whole family dropped me because I voted for things that directly impact them because you think of this [ __ ] as theoretical he type of people will always show some sort of rich people class solidarity when it really boils down to it whether they do it in front of our faces or not there's only so long people can have sympathy or Grace or understanding for people simultaneously being dumb then also one thing to be EMP power and put their foot on other people our very ideology gets threatened when we do not feel like we're the smartest or we do not feel we understand immediately and that kind of influences how we work through everything I think it's an Integrity issue more than anything and I think it just like showcases that Integrity is political there was a line he said where he was like you know growing up I was taught to respect the office which to me just sounds like one of those white people things that's what he's trying to appeal to are white people who are like well you know the president is the president [Music] hello beautiful black people um honestly it I know exactly where we're beginning which is a funny Place considering that the entire nation has been on fire both literally and proverbially since before but certainly since Donald Trump um has officially become president again he has quite literally signed over 200 evil ass EX executive orders like there's just way too much [ __ ] to cover on that is bad yeah there's way too much bad and honestly I wasted my good time trying to tell everybody everything bad that was gonna happen that's now happening so not doing that anymore let's talk about Nelly and them Nelly Nelly Snoop Dogg soldja Boy Rick Ross all performed at different inauguration related events and I also saw recently that Eddie Griffin was also in attendance at these events I just felt like I shouldn't let that go off the hook but that I I saw it I said enough don't know I'm going to make sure I mention that so yeah are we ashamed I I I'm tired of being shocked by this kind of behavior like it's it's not a surprise I think we've all known that this is about class more than race and it has been that way for a really long time like yeah they're going to do this and when the check goes the other way they'll go that way too a shame but not surprised think like should we really be focused on stuff like this because these type of people will always show some sort of rich people class solidarity when it really boils down to it whether they do it in front of our faces or not but at the same time I'm still disappointed don't get me wrong because that's some clown [ __ ] especially Snoop that's some clown [ __ ] to say what he said and then in the past and do what he's doing now and basically tell us to go uh you know [ __ ] ourselves and whatnot like that's right like there there's different levels of culpability to me end of the day Snoop Dogg is hanging out with Martha Stewart not us I was gonna say like there is something [Music] so my dog drinking water loud as [ __ ] I was like do something break okay sorry I was like did something break open um okay there's something so like cyclical about stuff like this so I wouldn't sh say ashamed because at this point I've dropped all like expectations for celebrities in general or just those who have a particular closeness to power um in any like like if it were a different politician up there I think it's just funny in a way that these people tend to at one point or another were the most vocal um anti-establishment rap ERS or you know you know or people who visibly represented something for a lot of people and at the end of the day to show that they only represented their own interest is not surprising to me I guess disappointing but I don't have very high standards for um I don't have high expectations I should say for people who I've gotten the sense have always put their their acquiring of money over the benefit of what they represent or who they actually come in contact with you done drinking I think it's I was gonna say I think it's an Integrity issue more than anything and I think it just like showcases that Integrity is political and people who lack Integrity typically further to the right if you ask me uh I don't know they just aren't principled I don't even think they're standing on anything as far as class solid I think they're just people who saw a check and they truly don't have any like loyalty to any true cause of community but there is something about appealing to class that is one of the few virtues quote unquote that they can do without having any Integrity so it's like Whoever has the money has my has my backing um that is the one thing that is principal to them that is their one principle um and I think more and more as we see you know our Luigi and are like going against very you know ostentatiously against higher power structures this is looking very like French Revolution to me I I I'm seeing very like early and maybe that's me just being like a dam dramatic person but I'm like it's it's getting Bleak so I think maybe I think maybe the more if there's anything to pay attention to it's how it it it is how the black community is reacting to like um to to to them flipping like to the transgression because the you know I will say I want to put out first that I do think most black people understand that this shit's this is [ __ ] that this is unacceptable and like it's a very easy call to be like why the are you [ __ ] for the white supremacist but there's like a particular type of either fan of Hip Hop or Snoop Dogg or of these artists that kind of connects the ethos of rap to somehow being of rap in Blackness to being basically anti-black or really anti-worker this is to say that Snoop Dogg and people like Rick Ross and Nellie they never said they were committed to the streets they said they were committed to the Grind to the back and like right right and like when you look when you I I I I hear in conversations about this like I wasn't like I regrettably was was watching no jumper react to this and like the way that they saw it was more so of like you know at the end of the day because they are because I do see that these people have of a higher class than me but I still like fantasize about being them one day I'm like oh this must be what the streets look like this must be what the grind looks like to them so it's like you know of course they go they need to get money and not every everybody going to light when you get money even if it hurts the people that you say you you you fight for that you you are in community with and so they're like actually he's a real he's a real mafia boss like he's actually a great businessman because he's willing to harm his own uh and it like it becomes justified in this weird masculinity type of way my my problem is black people only ever seem to take on this Pro capitalist framework to excuse up anti-black behavior when it's black men like that like so for me it's like I don't care I'm not personally outraged or or anything like that but I do think it's worth exposing what is a consistent hypocrisy and how these different things never get talked about like cette Michelle ain't had no they they ain't let us sing a [ __ ] hook since then you know what I mean like you did that I don't want to hear that no one wanted to hear [ __ ] from cette they don't care what the rationale was nobody car how much cette cette did or did not get paid and that's how it would be even if they were some big black women they it could have been much bigger Stars if it had been a bunch of black women who performed for Trump would that would they would nail them to the cross and that would be what the analysis is and I think my problem is is you see and this has been for years now many many years and it's probably since been the dawn of time but I'm talking about since when I've been plugged into caring about the zeit guys and what's happening but black male celebrities and particularly in hip-hop but the celebrities in general very often come out and be some straightup Coons like very often be tap dancing for a trump like we've seen it we've seen all the Kanye we've seen L Wayne and them we've seen all of them be on this and it's just like the way the culture just doesn't care just moves on no one is all no one is going out of their way to try to indite L way and these people of their images with Donald Trump and them and all the different times they said and they and that's what they doing they move on and I think it's very interesting to me or I think worth pointing out that as you've seen over the last like especially you see it in people have taken away of taken of being very antiblack and trying to wrap it up in this like Pro black like it's Pro Blackness but it's antiblack right and we've seen it that person's not black they're not black enough if you're not a full black American if you don't have this many black American grandparents you're not black enough you don't care about black people you're not committed to right like they do that all the time we just had a whole election cycle where was speaking more highly speaking in in better favor of whole white supremacist Donald Trump than they wanted to speak of AA because now they want to question her Blackness her partner ain't black she ain't this she's mix she ain't a whole you know what I mean all of that but meanwhile I could counts I could just start trotting out black men full-throated American black men who have been out here all over in public tap dancing for Donald Trump and like again from the celebrities from the musicians to all these artists straight up to all the politicians all the Byron McDonald's whatever and that never gets like that's never supposed to be reflection of their Blackness on the community as a whole or anything like this but when we want to get anti these particular kind of black women when we want to get antiblack people who are not full-throated Le American all of a sudden we believe in buying all these things so I think I just want to expose a hypocrisy just a hypocrisy or not even just a part of these artists and their integrity but how the community responds how who who the community responds to in a particular kind of way right because I guarantee you if it had been Drake if it had been somebody who is not an American one of these artists or whatever they would be talking about oh they're not tied to the culture and that's why they felt like they could do that Donald Trump blah blah blah they'd be saying all that [ __ ] but when it's a black American Artist tap dancing and doing all this or whatever all of a sudden it's like w let's really think about this you know blah blah blah like we and those artists know it too because they play on different Frameworks I think it's a good time Aon if you play one of those clips from Nelly where he intentionally tried to make it like which is true that black people know we have to historically work with people don't we don't like but he took that and tried to co-op that and twist that to justify why he needed to sing song [ __ ] that that's what JayZ did on that that Twitter [ __ ] that that Twitter spaces where he was just like oh y'all made up the word cap not capitalism whatever he said right that [ __ ] was [ __ ] that's what they do for me the political part is over um he won and um you know growing up I was taught to respect the office so you know Nell's here and you did get a little backlash but you you were like whatever I I don't I don't care I'm doing what I want to do this is this is I'm not gonna put words in your mouth but you you were really cool about it you handled it well you you came forward and you talked about it a lot of people wouldn't do that why why did you come forward and talk about it well because I think it's important that you know we show some people have their own opinions about things you know and sometimes think things can get a little bit hazy and in a way that everybody feels the same way about everything and that's just not it I think certain people have an Outlook and I've always believed that you got to walk through the fire sometimes to get results and regardless of what you feel about it um we as a people and I mean you know my my Heritage as far as being African-American we've always had to work with people that we may not have always agreed with to get things done and I think that struggle continues but at the end of the day if the men and women of this country can put their life on the line for a president that they may not have voted for I can definitely perform for the office let me ask you something what what are black people what is he but what is by performing Nelly's greatest hits by by sucking it up rting his teeth and bearing it performing his Greatest Hits what were black people gonna get like we need to you know you got to sometimes we people to get things done what did Nelly leverage for the black community what did he get what did you get done Nelly what did you do I I went to I went to school for accounting for five years I don't know how the black dollar comes out when it goes into a white room like they didn't teach us that in class and like actually to your point uh Olay about like using a certain type of language that to appear Pro black but it's anti-black like having that click clip up really cements that point because the actual an even better way of thinking I would have maybe accepted a bit more uh is that ultimately when we talk about the two main artists Snoop Dogg and Nelly there's always since the 20 since the bling Bing era right there's always been a tension between the fact that once you get popular enough the the way you're making your Millions is the fact that you made black music that white teenagers can afford to ask their parents to make to to to go tickets to to get merch for and I heard someone bring up that like we have to we have to consider time that like for a lot of these like young Maga heads like the these these people that are like uh in their early 20s late 20s like they grew up uh actually sorry like uh mid to late 30s they grew up uh with with Nelly and and and Snoop Dog I guess on the radio and so like that is actually the audience that he's talking about and my thing is like I think NY knows that I think Nelly totally understands that like for real for real the people that are the people that are buying my records in enough quantities that I can pay for my big house no longer look like me and so when I when I say I gotta take one for the team I mean like I need to perform for my real for who I accept as my fan base uh because like that's yeah I could try to do SN Fest but they paying me you know 50k in crypto so it's like what do you want me to do there was a line he said where he was like you know growing up I was taught to respect the office which to me just sounds like one of those white people things like oh like okay who it doesn't matter that's not real but that's what he's trying to appeal to our white people who are like well you know the president is the president and like Boomers and jenz black people who are going to be like well you know I still got to respect the president it's like no you you don't actually you don't have to take to do [ __ ] I actually don't and the thing is I don't even believe someone someone else made this um point on online that I don't even think the reason that they get these rappers and these particular rappers or whatever except except maybe a Sno dog why they got them has anything to do with them liking them or them wanting to see their performance or anything you could see what the audience looks like stiff as they're performing I think it's purely to piss us off to show we can get these we can we give you all the right dollar amount and you [ __ ] will tap dance for us right that's the real thing for it and I think in an Nellie's case like granted yeah Nelly definitely does have his his little country hits he gave them that they love you know what I mean they they loved him from me put a little boy on the record and I think he might have given them some more that we didn't even carear about right so I think he does have obviously a kind of white pop audience but I really think when it comes to I think it's less that they're the people that are buying his music now and more so that no one's really buying his music so I'm GNA jump at this opportunity big money I might not typically get and I think it's misguided he might think it's going to create cre him a new audience of people are going to do this little Vegas resen but honestly I think if I've looked at how those are played out especially for black artists of the time of a nelly like you look at who's in Usher audience and all these people it's gonna be the black aunties that pay for that thing and I really think youve pissed them off I think Nelly is somebody who definitely needs a BL a black Auntie base who was out voting for their Cara you know what I mean like I don't I don't know if he thought that went out and I also hate that he made the Shany have to catch the L by association like right I hated that I come out and embarass upset us like we we like Ashanti so much we let you have your you know your um your rekindling and we supported it even though you have three Mo like three different lawsuits accusing you of rape and we still let Ashanti have it we like you know what we're not even gonna say nothing Ashanti you have it and now you come out here making it in a way where gota be like Noti you know the thing that really discusted me I just recently saw I don't know if it was I don't know who it was it might have been Charlie Kirk or somebody like that I'm not Twitter so I I don't know I saw a link recently where they're basically using Nelly and Snoop against us yeah and they're they're they're saying like oh here's the The Tide is changing you see what's over here we got the blacks on our team and I'm like you and you know what Jan to your point I I think you started with like should we even be talking about this then because like let's be real like this doesn't even really piss us off that much it's just like like confounding and a bit irritating it's just like I I know you're GNA bring this up to your black hairdresser one day being like you see Trump got Snoop Dog yeah listen we we postracial now like this just a new microaggression that we're gonna have to deal with this year uh but like it's Play N Nelly's other remarks Aaron cuz Nelly just kept making it worse because I because the funny thing the sad thing is again Embrace a pro capitalist framework to defend Doon stuff so they were like okay it's the money it's the money it's the money and now was like no it's not the money I they don't love you like I love you yeah okay this is this is me service this I I respect the office okay God I'm get he did not um I'm get I'm G get it he did not um rent to people what was it in the 70s or the 80s is that what is that what they said and like okay is he written to him now uh let's just talk about why someone who is Black oh pause before you play Man remarks to them now let me just make sure I read the statement that because there there's a whole actual statement before he even came on the video stuttering about you know uh what what racist is Donald Trump done lately so he said and his quote was I'm not doing this for money I'm doing this because it's an honor I respect the office it don't matter who is in office the same way like he so he remix the same the same thing we heard him say but I'm gonna repeat it one more time the same way our men and women our brothers and sisters who protect this country have to go to waren who have to put their line um their life on the line for whoever's in office so if they can put their line their life on the line for whoever's in office I can damn sure perform for whoever is in office I would ask critics to show me where he's ever been a white supremacist oh my oh gosh no no no wait wait wait wait no no before you before you before you press play before you press play I think in them no yeah before you first play er I feel like that's a great time to to point out this part that I think maybe is a not a breakthrough but something that I I guess I tried not to believe for a long time that this Republican party truly is seen as like anti-establishment that makes in in in a really deep road type of way and that reverberated through like every other counterculture because like we just never considered like a lot of the things that tie hipop together that made it I guess let's just say made it commodifiable was the idea of just being anti-establishment anti whoever are I specifically I'm really now the eggs in power like they Respect power they identify power and I feel like the reason for any of these type of rappers to make this shift over and they like in a way that they I guess didn't for George 43 or uh you know you didn't you didn't see them doing this [ __ ] for Romney I I prefer them doing it for Romney um was just like no right it was like they because they they made them feel dumb they were like oh no you you you a clever white racist like this one I get this one he's just he just believes in power like he he he's just gonna pay me he's just gonna get my homies off he basically Works more like a drug lord more than a politician and like that's some how anti-establishment even though that's how streets are as dumb as people like to convince you that they are to to excuse them whenever like in trouble and I mean anybody like you see them doing it now with the Elon Musk stuff oh like oh he's he's he's a genius but he also doesn't know that's a Nazi salute like it's always like ignorance is always defense right and it's like a bunch of powerful well- moneyed well-connected are not are not at home thinking that Donald Trump and them are anti-establishment it makes no [ __ ] sense like I I think what I what frustrates me about America is whenever White supremacists and the powers that be and the right whomever come up with a new excuse like a new pretense to justify what is a massive support for racism I cannot understand For the Love of God why we B like why we pretend that they're genuine like these obviously disingenuine disingenuous [ __ ] reasons they provide you like y We believe We believe the billionaires in them they're anti-establishment what who's already already been president before what the are we talking about it makes no like both things can't be true it cannot be the the the rich billionaire that you love that you think is like okay let me ass let me like align myself with power and money and capitalism but that's also my my anti-establishment Working Man candidate like they don't believe that [ __ ] they just say that and I think it's it's like it's this way that you're always like if you spend all this time if people gas like you when you want to address like a problem racis you never get around to discuss issue it makes me think of the early years of black lives matter when they they did their everything was about pretending they didn't understand the expression black lives matter you're going to be fighting and defending this why is not all lives matter all the time they are playing crazy like they don't understand just so you could never actually make any demands and you could never talk about anything substantive it's always this wait wait I'm not sure I get it the the G if you could explain it but also shut the up like that'd be great is that uh plausible deniability that they and that's what Elon Musk is doing and that's what you see other people doing defending him they're they're doing that big time right that's not really what it looks like no he that's not really what he meant and blah it's Roman get the out here bro y'all just need people just need to say that y'all full of [ __ ] I think it's part of the self-protective mechanisms of like things like white supremacy and patriarchy to be honest because you really think about it it all comes down to like the patriarchy and how like because you mentioned o earlier about how women are held to such a higher standard and like if a black woman were to do this like the the standard is always different and I think systems like white supremacy and patriarchy like rely on manipulative tactics to like maintain power and I think this is what we're describing I just also want to say that Nelly is a [ __ ] and he's just broke um yeah exactly yeah look at [Music] the Donald Trump now Trump will eliminate he says funding for any school this is now this is now any school that promotes racial Equity or confronts the reality of racism in the nation's history Trump has also for all our brothers that grow up in in the neighborhoods promised immunity for police officers accused of police brutality uh the justice 40 initiative which was um a a Biden executive order that aimed to direct 40% of climate Investments to underserved black communities uh Trump has dismissed it said it's a woke overreach gonna get rid of it under the Maga Wing black history is under attack States like South Carolina Florida Arkansas have eliminated funding for AP black history Nelly a P black history the study of Shirley Chisum the study of Tucson the study of the recently pardoned Marcus Garvey the study of X the study of King the study of the Harlem Renaissance the study of the seven Mystic years the study of PBS pinchback the study of Frederick Douglas the study of Denmark VC the study of Nat Turner the study of Ella Baker and Bayer Rustin the study of Maya Angelou the study of all of those people AP black history all aimed at eliminating certain types of curriculum which study and deepen the understanding of the black experience in America out of here mag doesn't want to hear it doesn't want to talk about it right doesn't want to do it also just in case last thing in the Trump era white nationalist hate groups have grown by 55% that's according to the Southern Poverty Law CER all right I'm asking n why do white supremacist hate groups love your guy so much my God I know deep it's exhausting Jesus because like I what I feel more bad about is the same thing that um Ole keeps going back to is like uh van Le is is trying to add value saying like they don't they're not gonna learn about this and this and this and you think I'm care like you think Nelly knew who any of them people was besides Nat Turner Malcolm X and and Nat Turner is powerful like yeah it's like you're just naming names man come on that's the problem is people have this tendency to think it's just like [ __ ] we like [ __ ] that matters but don't matter it's clearly how they think about like curriculums and book Manning and stuff like that what do you really like what I mean first of all man lean did an amazing job with that that that was excellent but I'm like I think people I think I'm I think I'm I'm and or I should really say I hope I would hope people would be more moved by even things like him trying to get rid of like the protections for equal like uh employment he's trying to make it so like they can literally actively discriminate against he's firing people across the board he's getting rid of any initiative any initiative that's designed to help black people in any way like squarely explicitly gone like and I'm not like that's not hyperbolic like if you ask why black people have a problem with him now it's because he signed in a million different executive orders designed to make sure that black people don't have [ __ ] can't get [ __ ] can't go to no schools can't get no jobs can't sue for any of the Discrimination or anything that's happening so it's like when you hear them and I think you know what I hate I hate about the pleading ignorance thing is it makes you feel as people who are in the business of teaching or trying to like share information you think people aren't getting it makes you feel like it's something you have to do you feel like oh [ __ ] do they not know have they not been hearing or something about all the things Donald Trump has done or is planning to do and it's like yes they have like yes they have I wish they would just say I don't give a [ __ ] yeah I think that's a great point with all those executive orders you know whether it's quote unquote Dei related uh you know even one of them was about environmental justice and I and I directly work with that I directly do that so now you're going to have different impacts of the federal government on um community ities and areas that are historically impacted negatively by federal actions whether that's highways or whatever the case may be whatever construction and that's a real deal problem and people are just like pretending that it isn't and you know it's embarrassing that those people you know that we're talking about they they don't give a fck about this [ __ ] so we could just sit here and preach about this [ __ ] all we want to but is really unfortunate that all the different black people that are defending them I hate them I don't know and I'm just sitting here like I really actually hate you [ __ ] maybe I shouldn't maybe I don't hate you I really hate you at this I I I hate what you n are gonna turn into that's really what it is right because like I'm already starting to get these conversations from like the same homeboys that didn't want to talk politics before for or like when I tried to like when I accidentally said like something patriarchal or like something something patriarchy like SL you killing the blunt rotation like now it's like bro yo he he he trying he trying to take away citizenship because hell of my homies is is is is half black half West African half black half asian they got they got they're like yo can they send me back oh now now you wonna know like but that but that's not how we win that's not how we make progress so like I can't really say that I have to take the higher ground but like that's what make it's more about the future because uh to the real point that I want to make is that if there's anything that we can do I think or I think that that we're taxed to do is that we have to make the repercussions personal to people that otherwise don't care right like we can't say oh he's doing a tariff and uh tariffs are attacks on people because people is not specific enough we got to say bro Hennessy is going up 35% simple direct yeah right like yeah like bro like you see Yo Arizona used to be 99 it's on a can though the can the law is basically a f Arizona like T cuz that like it's gonna be when it really hits people that that you know I think we could we could possibly quickly or we get throw to the pot quickly that you know let's be real a lot of black people are small C conservative which I think is is why this right workship is a lot easier but the thing about people that have conservative mindsets is that yeah they they have trouble I won't say they don't have empathy but they have trouble uh expressing empathy for things they have not personally experienced or the things that like are outside of their their area of competence or experience so the more we make it personal probably the easier we can shock them is is this also a symptom or situation in anti-intellectualism because I think we follow deep into the anti-intellectual hell hole that we exist in right now and it's baffling to me because the way that people don't celebrate intellect right they they celebrate false intellect right and everybody's smart everybody this they people don't respect I think that's part of like respecting author Authority and like uh expertise people don't really they don't [ __ ] with none of that no more and everybody know everything because they saw some [ __ ] on the internet saw some [ __ ] on Tik Tok they saw some [ __ ] on YouTube University therefore they know ev Everything better than somebody who went to medical school for the long and so I think we have a deep issue people are using also like things that have really happened to the black community whether that's you know medical racism and all the different things that have happened to us currently and in the past to Shield them from real critiques if that makes sense and and I think that is a huge issue that we're dealing with and it's not just black folks it's everybody and this [ __ ] is ridiculous it's hard to have real conversations with [ __ ] because everybody does not value that real conversation what what do we do about that I I don't got the answer to that of attack on the education system I think it's important to acknowledge that and I think it's also important to acknowledge that Democrats are just as complicit because they've had power so many times over the years to actually do things to create effective change and to allow education to be more accessible and they squandered it every time like they did more insider trading than they did like actually fixing problems and I do also want to note like I agree that we have to like you know meet people with empathy and try to make it personal for them but you is getting jumped once we clean this mess up yeah I'm like I think we are two yeah well we do have to meet the people where they at but once this mess is cleaned up I think hell you [ __ ] need to be I'm keeping receipts like you might you you might get uh uh repaired or whatever like we we we rehab rehabilitated but I'm gon remember like my thing is yeah you're absolutely right like and yes like obviously Democrats are complicit anybody who's in power has had power obviously plays a role but the American people are complicit too and let me and and I and no one ever wants to say that it's always don't blame the voters don't be mad at the people every it's always a reason why the people are not to blame like it's not their reason or they don't have a role in it and I'm going to go ahead and say that's that's [ __ ] as I watch now everybody scramble to act outrage people look like it's like everybody internally running around like Spongebob trying to delete everything but fine dining right and it's like oh my God oh my God they want to end birth right he said this he said that he said this and it's almost like he's doing everything that was outlined and didn't would to hear it and so it's like for people yeah like [ __ ] like no one's supposed to say it's like oh like I told you Souls aren't gonna get us anywhere we're only gonna get this way no they will get get uswhere I disagree like right after the oh sorry go k go k no I was just gonna say like right after the election and there was like it was so like contentious that so many people just stopped talking to the conservative family members and they want to come on a Tik Tock crying and [ __ ] wow my whole family dropped me because I voted for things that directly impact them and they're like wow what happened what happened to just like not letting politics get between us because you think of this [ __ ] as theor IAL and then there was one lady I remember she got on Tik Tok and she was like I hope every Republican that asked for you know your ability to get access to abortions your ability to get access to things to feed your families and your child I hope you have to deal with that directly and when she said that they thought it was a threat why do you think if it's if it's something you voted for why do you think it's a threat so obviously you're cool with it and I hope you get what you asked for and so like you come and boohoo to people about like oh I don't have access to healthcare anymore crazy like I don't know what you want me to say [ __ ] like I'm I'm losing my mind gonna go down which they're not and your insulin is now going to be $ thousand dollars right like and and your egg your eggs is oh no it's the consequence of my action one of the Biden EOS about health care and Affordable Health Care he literally did that and potentially people's medicine is going to get more expensive from Simply doing that and that's just the truth and I'm not lying about that you know delusional about that too I think the critical flaw in I'm not Society like literally American culture I think the the bones on which that like most of people build their ideology in this country is that we are both hyper where we love or uh justan said we're anti- athor we're anti- Authority and yet very pro- fascism somehow I don't know if that's a cause and effect or if those are two separate things but like don't know what them words mean man right I swear they don't know what the words mean but and and it's because also America is founded I I was watching a a video essay on this this this morning like uh that kind of put it in much more clarity for me that like yeah America has from jump since Press Start been founded on anti- uh intellectualism like if we really break it down right like you know Loki since I'm here I got citizenship i f with the Boston Tea Party you know like they they they they did do the one thing there however the way that that came about was literally like the colonist fought a bunch like caused a bunch of damage fought a bunch of wars and then like they knew they were a colony they knew their benefactor was going to be like hey guys y'all gonna need to help pay for this and they were like we don't want to pay for this and actually we don't want you telling us what to do anymore and I resent you telling me what to do so I don't want to do anything that you that you want to do and like that's how that's where our our first identity came from for Better or For Worse because like it still was it still was a was an oppressive Dynamic but like since that combined with the Puritan and proest Protestant worth ethic uh we like we don't believe we get very threatened like our very ideology gets threatened when we do not feel like we're the smartest or we do not feel we understand immediately and that kind of influences how we work through everything like that's why we're always talking about you have to get to the base common denominator you have to be able to speak uh you have to be able to dumb things down enough specifically not for the public it's always for the American public because like America be the one culture that like no we wanted as stupid as possible like I really need you you did like a 10y old I needed like a five-year old while also lording themselves over the rest of the world as a first world notion a superpower that has more access to all this information than everybody else like honestly where I'm at with America right like America and probably I guess Americans but America at large is I've said this I've and I was this was my whole gripe the Entre entire election season is immigrants are most affected by what America decides to do every election season America offers up immigrants like on a plate like everybody that's what we can all unite in is our hatred of [ __ ] immigrants immigrants immigrants and my my issue has always been is that immigrants are the main ones are always fod for American elections and we're the ones who can't vote we can't vote we can't say anything we can't do anything and more importantly like immigrants don't even what people don't realize is immigrants don't even get to speak out in the Casual way that Americans or everybody can like you the way you want to go Express what you upset about on your socials or whatever immigrants can't do that the immigrants who are living the consequences of of of the administrations and the decisions that American Americans make cannot speak out like that even me myself I'm like I limit and I I obviously can speak out way more than the average person period let alone immigrants and I can't speak freely about like immigration or what's happening and all these things because you you live at the mercy of US immigration but I say that to say this Americans decided as as a whole it's not just white Americans or anything like Americans decided they hate each other but they specifically very much so hate other and they hate immigrants andu immigrants right they United around immigrants and other but what I think is funny is you're about to get treated exactly how immigrants get treated because the thing about being an immigrant in America is this the one place where the the president had so much [ __ ] power to do what they want like in the executive n they could do whatever the they want to immigrants no one knows what they're doing to immigrants nobody cares nobody is all all that red tape you normally have is gone and that's gone too when you El a fascist because all these people I see all these people keep trying to like calm Americans down like hey hey don't worry what Donald Trump is doing and signing into an executive order is illegal it's illegal they're going to challenge and to are you dumb honestly I'm actually annoyed by all the organizations that are rushing out say oh they're filing a lawsuit I'm like why are you doing that you jackass they want you to file a fck lawsuit so it could go to the Supreme Court and they can legitimize and make law like why are you acting like y'all didn't already give up the court you bend did that I've been watching American decide [ __ ] doesn't matter enough they all these little ways it doesn't matter it's already like this fascism is already here it's the same and blah blah blah and now you what happened you don't have any checks and balances you have none think about the fact that Donald Trump was not president yet an app that gets banned or whatever Congress decides to to to ban this app the Supreme Court says yeah ban it that app voluntarily chooses to ban itself tells you that the who's not president yet is who saved it and everybody just rock would rocking with that like oh you could use it despite what Cong what what the court says let me tell you something the only thing that should be scarier than a Mickey Mouse karoo court is a court that has no power and you if you don't know American history the Supreme Court did not always have power it used to be a like powerless Court until they established that and you know when it would got when it got real dangerous and real hectic and real sticky in America's history during the Brown versus boor times when Southern States and people decided they weren't going to listen to the court anymore so the court not having any power Congress deciding everybody just deciding whatever the Donald Trump can do and want to do is what's happening you there's no more checks and balances so my friends who decided [ __ ] immigrants you in the same position where you now have one doing whatever the [ __ ] he wants to you and you could think oh the law the Constitution and all that different stuff all you want they firing every right now who even have anything to do with Dei they not gonna let any they tell federal employees they telling federal employees to snitch on their friends if they've ever had Dei thoughts I'm telling you you ain't getting [ __ ] like you're not getting [ __ ] youever been to a diversity and inclusion just panel let us know or talk anything noing for I I don't think people get that whole uh that he can potentially just ignore the Supreme Court thing like like there isn't historical precedent for it then there is there's actually a huge chunk of it actually and that should scare the [ __ ] out of y'all and I I don't know why people thought there was going to be some sort of Refuge for people essentially from all of this [ __ ] and I'm like no if look if they got enough balls to ignore some [ __ ] they just gonna ignore it I mean it's a mix of drain poool it's a mix of drain poool politics and like American exceptionalism right like we get here because we're like you know what just for me not for thee and like it hasn't you know it hasn't affected me yet so I guess that means and I'm being told by the by the powers that I do trust uh that like it should be all it should be all fine and then even when [ __ ] starts to hit the role [ __ ] hits the fan we're like well we're America though you know we have a much more powerful Court than you know Saudi Arabia or you know like we we we would never end up like wear and it's like the reason why that wasn't happening was because we had checks and balances balances you you gave all you gave all the checks yes you put it out of balance I will also add that like I think this is a byproduct of late stage capitalism like at the end of it all fascism is what's at the end of the road for capitalism the economy is so terrible it only makes sense for people to fall for the Trap of the boogeyman or the Immigrant that's gonna come and steal everything from you even though the very the thief is the person who's telling you that you know there is a boogeyman um I think this is a [ __ ] show um and I it is truly it is um and I think a lot of people are about to learn the hard way I frankly anti-intellectualism I think Americans are kind of I hate to say it Americans are a little dumb stupid most on purpose though on purpose we're being trained like but we are being we're incentivized to be we're incentivized as a culture to not take it personally to not think to do to action first and critical thought is is cancerous yeah well actually you're stupid for thinking and you're killing the you're you're stupid for learning learning is stupid that book you're reading all that [ __ ] stupid I'm getting this money yeah it's like across both sides suppos to question you are just supposed to assume oh hey things are going to work out this America we're so great uh I have friends who are teachers in Chicago and California they're being trained here's what you do when ice comes and I see people online who are like they can't do that schools are safe spaces that's in the that's a law they can't do that your school for now so Trump rescinded that yesterday and they're like well just cuz he resented it doesn't mean that they that no they you can't change laws that way and it's like okay yeah I'm sure in Chicago and California that there they're going to be like hey we're stopping this We're not gonna let it happen but in Alabama and Texas and stuff I don't think the schools there are teaching their teachers what to do so that's and they're like well they're gonna sue them about this lawsuits will change it how long okay I'm still waiting for lawsuits to make my student loans go away that didn't happen y y'all watch one episode of Law and Order and then y' got a JD this really makes me think were people paying attention in high school no it was just us because it's such a common like Trend and I'm just sitting here like I was in high school once I remember reading some things and I'm just confused you had to do a DBQ we had to study no no J I love that you bring that up because I literally was talking to my dad about about this like the day before the inauguration uh because I think like Rachel M was on MSNBC with like her whole which like I don't like the black one but like with the whole the whole cast and they were like yeah like what are we gonna do like like how's this happening and someone just said like the real like we did not fail like on Election Day we failed when we didn't make roie way an amendment uh we failed when we didn't enshrine this stuff right and and the first thing I thought was that you know what what sucks and like she was like people didn't tell they Congress people to make stuff an amend amendment I was like I don't think more than 30% of the country understands like the value of an amendment the differ between a bill uh or or or making a committee like they don't even understand the moves you can make on the board so of course the only thing they act for is like hey make it legal and then the government will like okay we'll make it legal through a provision like we'll do an executive action on it and like that is why I'm like I I I do want to blame and give accountability to the American public but I also sometimes I really think back say like no a lot of people you have to do we're nerds we're all nerds here but so we all have to do extra effort into even being as educated we and I still don't really know like all the mechanics of the law I just know enough to know that it's up and there are supposed to be answers like someone else is using them so I think yeah yeah no I have two things to to what you were saying right I think you're you're right and the issue that runs into is is you get what you see with Nelly indoctrinated to believe quote unquote I respect the office and that's what happens with Americans very often is like they'll be like tricked into thinking this the same way when people like they the Democrats should have and they should have they should have expanded the court did something about the court like that's a serious issue and they refused and the way Republicans were playing on on Americans like being indoctrinated to believe this is how things need to go and this is how you devout it's funny like Republicans can simultaneously convince you the court can't be expanded because this is a special number that like that has to be on the court that's meanwhile it's ched there's nothing the constition they could convince you that while at the same time convincing you this is an anti-establishment King who's going to completely erode all of the things that you that you just told you are so important and you need to stick to so I think that's one like Americans really are at a disadvantage of being well everybody is everybody is always being indoctrinated and propagandized by their governments and whatnot right but in this case Americans really have been so I'll give them that so I think the problem with Americans being dumb or that being something like we address right is like stupidity is there's only so long people can have sympathy or Grace or understanding for people simultaneously being dumb then also wanting to be in power and put their foot on other people W to be a superpower that looks down on the rest of the world that says immigrants are are other that has a problem with immigrants taking this this this and the next thing or even within their own country right like Americans if you just think of if we restricted to like now white Americans how even like white Americans want to keep all the other different kind of Americans black Americans everybody else out of the room like you're not smart enough you don't deserve this it's really dii it's really affirmative action like how long are you supposed to have sympathy and Grace for a world superpower that has more more access to education and resources and whatever have you they have more ability to know the things they don't know constantly pleading ignorance while also calling everybody else stupid and unqualified and not deserving of Rights or to be in the room it's like how long before I keep being like people get tired of being like hey I should cudle the dumb Americans who keep harming everybody I mean that's the irony of like the infighting that they've been doing recently right it's like the people that voted explicitly to like disenfranchise even further immigrants and like those who come into quote take American jobs and then those same people in The Establishment that you uh are constantly dick sucking you know Elon Musk and the like of them and they're like yeah y'all are too stupid to do these jobs actually so we're going to Outsource to immigrants that we told you were bad but they're only bad if we can't exploit them as much as possible um and now you're sitting around like surprised Pikachu like oh my God am I also a stupid person being exploited like yes yes yes you are and now you justed over somebody else too but at the end of the day you're just as like you have all this power but no knowledge a dangerous Co dangerous ass cocktail dangerous cocktail it's like a topor it's like I don't know what's going on add to what you're what you're saying is like there's so many different layers of uh contradiction right you have people that say like hey I want lower prices of eggs or I want lower prices all these different items or let's say Goods like uh vegetables fruits and stuff like that and that has directly to do with immigration right and undocumented immigrants and stuff like that so they're just like get them out of here then when they see the prices go up they're gonna lose their mother Minds that that [ __ ] is crazy as to me to like what do you do with that contradiction right there that's a crazy ass contradiction I I don't want to get too dark okay I I'm no no cuz I I I I I've been thinking about this lately especially after like I did get the little red note and like I don't use it obviously but like I be getting the push i' be getting the push notification still and it be all in Chinese and I and I sat in bed last night and I was like H man I can't wait for America to not be a main character anymore like I can't wait for us to get so to crash out so bad some days that like you know what maybe maybe all the all the all people are able to export their culture easier because just like the name of America has been so um so dirted disdained that they're just like no like we actually y'all have proven y'all don't give a f y'all are dumb and y'all are loud like we just simply can't trust you anymore we're now going to listen to Italians or like Koreans or something right now and like we just got to deal with that right CU Italian and Chinese I started taking Chinese that's what I'm saying I almost feel like we've been dominant for too long like I I want my hand held like maybe we should just follow somebody else's Le for a little bit okay I'm Chinese class I'm all about it I'm ready for anybody else to take over and I I got it that's the most fuing thing a little my korean's rusty but if we got to make it work I'll figure it out okay I'm I'm ready main character because I would like to think if we were not the main character then things would get better that that's my that's my thought process uh that might be completely wrong but I would love for us not to be the main character because then once people recognize like they have been recognizing on red note is that like we're not as good as we are we're not number one at every single thing I remember I've literally had arguments conversations with people where they're just like ju okay talk about EVS real quick like uh the the Chinese that they have are way better than ours or or comparable better and a fifth of the price better of the price food watch just watch okay go watch one of the videos go watch one of the videos on hi Shu Wong and I I will use the appropriate name go it's just people grocery shopping and it's like they get all this stuff and they get to the top and they're like so that was $15 and Americans are just like what are you kidding me you just got like I think two maybe that's also a part of it going into like I the average American can't afford to travel enough to see that this [ __ ] is weird yeah like this [ __ ] is weird if you go to Korea I remember the first time I went to Korea this is several this is 10 years ago now oh my God I'm old um so it's probably a little different now but at the time I had to my name like $50 I was able to feed myself for three weeks you C I can't buy a meal for $50 here anymore I don't and I don't think y'all realize that this is not normal things don't have to go up in price like they just arbitrarily than Ken thank you for saying that bro like my just today our insurance is going to go up 48% why because we decide that it's G to go up 48% like that when people have like laws in place that they can't do that then that doesn't happen so like when Netflix is going up $4 on each here and then in the same breath they just said they they went up 60% they went up 60% in profit what I I knew it was going to happen when they start doing football I was like I didn't ask for this [ __ ] I came out here for anime I don't want to watch this [ __ ] know went on Monday Night Raw right I used to like Monday Night Raw but then I realized it was just like white conservative yeah kind of like drag it's a slow no no no it is but but it also we should recogn that I think Monday Night Raw is actually how most Americans think the world ought to work like at least Dynamic dynamically like you got Goods you got your evils you got a prize they're like you know this is how they would rather the entire world work and they filter their entire politics through it so much of like the American outlook on things is very black and white and childish like there is no Nuance there is because yeah because America right I'm like what like I remember as we talk about like lower Casey conservatism right and like particularly with like older black people I've had situations where I'm like talking to like my older relatives and I just say but what about this in their whole View and I can only speak as a person who has like older black parents but I'm sure just older people and just people in general you just put one little Cog in that like black and white thinking and their whole mind is blown so I wouldn't be to the extent that it's scary to even consider that their entire Outlook is not black and white so they go back to black and white because it's comfortable um but I think the the thing with the current Administration is like well this is the black and white you wanted it's pretty it's pretty clear um fascism is quite black and white yeah it's very most times literally it's very like ostentatious but okay like I I I feel so powerless and maybe that's where I'm kind of like okay I've said all I can say I don't know what you want for me that's I'm saying yeah I've said all I can say and I think like I think where're not to be you know a killjoy [ __ ] right because I see like people deeply enjoying their red notes and talking about all that they're learning and what they see from let me tell you my problem with that right like and I do I have right because I see all the like Chinese Americans talking about the problem with that is that this is an app that was for international students this was for mostly for like Chinese International students to keep in touch with their own culture and because Americans have decided they're going to go on the app and Co-op co-opted because they don't like you lost one app when you have a bunch of other apps by the way like like not to say there aren't significant reasons to be upset about the Tik Tok ban there are there are deep deep intellectual reasons but it's just as far as terms of where to go to go get your enjoyment right it's like okay you're going to go jump on this app when you have other apps this app that was other people's app for them to have their to stay connected with home or whatever and now because Americans are on that I mean being on it they say it's more like their Pinterest Instagram for like Rich ladies like and if you're on it it is a lot of like Rich ladies right now of Chinese International literally yeah there are a lot of like like you know sa people and they be rich also like very much like this is like yeah student like rich people thing it's not really our Tik Tok like Tik Tok is a different thing for us I'm not saying I would say there are people who are like yeah you guys are kind of taking this over but maybe learn some Chinese so you know what hashtags to use again that's not what I'm talking about yeah I hear that but I hear what you mean about the settlement energy that we give have S energy at home and now because there are a bunch of Americans on the app the Chinese government does not like that or whatever they're like oh they're posting information that we don't want you to see because for whatever you say like Chinese has it China has its own regulations its own government its own restrictions its own free speech um suppression of it on they're like they don't want them they don't want what Americans are sharing like politically different kinds of things want separate they want to make two separate serers which [ __ ] the the the Chinese the Chinese Americans who live here and were using this app Ren or just released an update in the greater China region um with the function to separate out foreign IPS and they're Now talks of moving all foreign IPS to a separate server and having um a different IP for those who are in the greater China area um I know um through VPN and other um other ways people are still able to access the app but essentially this is going to kill the app for Chinese Americans who actually uses the to um connect with the Chinese content Chinese language Chinese culture is a way for me to feel I don't know all of this just because we wanted to say [ __ ] you to the US government I get it I get it but I just wish I just wish it wasn't at the cost of others yeah don't love that and to say like you know a lot of discuss I've seen um especially like my like white friends white people and creators I've had this conversation with her like oh but we're getting so much benefit out of it and there's all these like racists and conservatives who are like oh I didn't realize this thing it's like which is funny because it's actually it's a very American logic because that was America's Logic the Supreme Court for when they even had affirmative action it was the reason that the compelling interest that the Supreme Court came up with was that diversity benefits white people like Americans and the rest of them that by having a few of us in the room they get to benefit from it and it's always this way that centers what their benefit is and for me I found out frustrating in a country that like America's massive America has a [ __ ] ton of asian-americans that has a [ __ ] ton of Chinese Americans I could go to million a bunch of towns in America that had their own China Town they have their own China population if you wanted to if your true true inherent Joy was to learn about this culture and you wanted to care and you wanted to be exposed you could be but you chose not to and now the way that you want to do it that you think should be the primary way is yucking up these app you know I'm like you know what and when you put it like that it definitely is like a self-report on how the uh the true American Pastime is not uh football nor baseball it's it's consumption it's like one like one like the way the way that we almost almost like look at like two alien species meeting and then one alien species like the way they show like love or Grace is like they just take your things they're just like I like you so much I'll just take that like they just take something right and like and then they get mad when people are like could you stop like stop stealing bases and like like how else would I show you that I I really like you like I I want to take you with me and they don't why everybody so mad about that that uh Instinct right there's so many different levels to this I kind of look at it like the the way I have to look at things like at in the sphere that I work in I work in Environmental Compliance environmental science and stuff like that and there's a lot of different environmental impacts that impact each other and then you have to figure out what is the best scenario or situation for every body and that's really hard to do because some environmental impacts impact other environmental impacts and you know different people and all these different things you have to come to a decision and a lot of times these decisions are going to piss people off yeah and I have to deal with people who are pissed off all the time because of the thing didn't favor them but it might have favored who like the broader collection right and I think this becomes like really really difficult and I think that's a great example of that and um you know to go kind of lowkey go back to the whole you know thing with black folks and oh my God Nelly and Snoop that's what this original right I mean that that that's how deep it goes we will extract value me it's not really about them it's about how regular black folks are like responding to it that really BS me personally seeing black people just excuse their behavior and it's honestly black capitalism capitalism largely that they think they're going to benefit from and become Donald Trump what did Nelly say he had a whole something he wants to be knocking at the door of the uh Donald Trumps and the Bill Gates and said that like 20 some years ago like said that so should we be really surprised not exactly it's still disappointing cu I'm more disappointed in regular black folks that seemingly ain't got no sense it's like a boondoc episode to add to try to add a pitch of optimism uh to try to put a pitch of optimism in there I what I what I think I do see clearly is the fact is the engine of othering that capitalism works on and the fact that as we go into later and later stages like the other ring of race is starting to become redundant and in order to like keep more people out because like the top can never grow that that's like the secret of capitalism right we're all promis we can get to the top but the top has a like strict limit of who they want of who they want in that top 1% top 10 per. so over time you gotta you got to make new distinctions new enemies and event I know I'm I'm this copium right now but like it's the it's the thing I have left that you know we are getting closer and closer very slowly to the biggest thing the biggest antagonism being between owner class and non-owner class and I do think once like the 23 year old white man really un white boy coming out of college really understands he can't get a house no more can't he can't own no businesses that he that he has to that he has to work for the subsidiary subsidiary subsidiary joint venture of Amazon and Walmart then it's like okay I'mma need mine and like then we might have numbers but so is like it's a very passive approach but like capitalism does eat itself from the fact that eventually you will make too many your distinction will make too many enemies and I do think humans in numbers can do very simple things U and we just need some simple things because what I really wanted to say about J Jake Sha's point is that sometimes I feel like this conversation is so hard as someone who's like on the on the um external like Assurance compliance side done es ESG Audits and like looked at how companies like are trying to mediate these different um goals that they have it's it's really hard I'll say like this it's really hard to worry about uh your carbon levels when people don't have universal healthcare yeah it's really hard to pay workers well to pay to pay even the janitor well when uh you know you there there's no Universal based income or there isn't or isn't a right to a job it's really hard to get a person who wants to do the job for love for love when everybody is 500 dollar uh car emergency medical emergency from being homeless but a lot but and uh what what what conser little see conservatives and people that are anti intellectual will get right is that the people that only read Theory will talk very confidently about the solutions they have uh but their their Solutions only work if like a bunch of Base assumptions are already done like if we have if we had equal Playing Fields like not even between races Just Between the owner the owner and the working class maybe some of these things could be alleviated but like we're we're at level zero of like people don't even like America really is one of the few places in the world I I believe where I don't think every citizen themselves believes believes that you have a right to survive as an American like your actual American Birthright is the ability to play the game and somehow you should be proud of that no you're actually right I think and that's the funny thing right like on one hand seeing like people truly believe like if I if I take it at face value and I take it as genuine a bunch of people being like Oh I didn't vote for a white supremacist because he's a white supremacist it's because I thought it would make my eggs cheaper let's say I believe that at least I know your eggs will not be cheaper like if I like you know already like I'm like oh it's about to be like but the sad part is like I know this is what keeps like the two- party system you know going it's like I know it's going to reverberate back like it's going to it's going to bounce back because you're not going to get any of the things you thought how you thought life was going to get better for you it's like I'm realizing that it honestly might not even be that helpful for me or anybody else to like spend the time trying to explain to you all the ways like what's actually happening what's bad and why it is like we tried to right because no one gave a [ __ ] about the facts like last Administration or any Administration they never give a [ __ ] about what the facts are everything is about how they feel their emotions and that trumps everything and if they feel in if the way they feel contradicts the actual facts then that's the fault of the PO they oh it's a politicians and everybody else fault for not you know explaining that to them or making that come clear to them they weren't good at it right so I'm like I know on one hand it'll bounce back because they'll really they were going to feel upset as [ __ ] starts to get terrible even if they don't know why they like they'll they'll feel bad and they'll be like oh okay let me just go to the other option but the problem with that is the minute it don't feel good then you don't you know what I mean no one knows what's going on or why it's going on and you just keep bouncing between two things and we never really get anywhere so you know I don't know I guess that was my lining but I guess it's not that silver well I mean let let's let's if we're trying to be if we trying to be more solution oriented like or more if we're trying to be more forward-looking I the thing that's keeping me on or the thing I'm focus on focusing on even even even in my own content is like we don't need any more investigation or analysis we we need imagination and when I say like we need imagination I mean unfort I guess I say unfortunately as a Creator but I'm trying to have more empathy for this that like not everybody has like a crazy brain like mine and like just thinking about [ __ ] all this time but like people in order to do [ __ ] need to be told a story that is simple and at the end lets them do something right like that that's all that's all the Tea Party did that's all magga did that's all they ever do they just say hey you can yell at brown people make sure you vote for me at the end and they were like well and the other and and the other side was like please don't yell at brown people please stop being racist and they're like okay well I I want to yell at brown people one party said I can do it and the other one was like Hey problem right so it was a story it's a story that allowed participation and like not to go all Bernie Sanders for a second but it's like if we like I truly do believe the thing that is stopping us is us having and not even I like [ __ ] the Democrats I this is this is what a part is supposed to do like what I'm describe is what a what a a billion dollar political project is supposed to be able to do quite easily but like even more on the Progressive side if we could if we could meet one main issue into the fact like I don't care what about anything all I know is that this Choice makes sense and I and part of my identity is that I like this Choice like I right like I uh yeah no hold on let me actually yeah I'm G do my example real quick right we need our propaganda like I I constantly think about this idea I read I read this book called the deficit myth that like uh like radicalize me uh as an economist because it talks about the debt ceiling and about how like it's not really a thing and how basically we do like the America as a country is in a special in a special position of having McDonald's money America always got McDonald's money for America things because everybody else uses a dollar I'm not I'm not gonna bore people with it but what what what what it makes you start thinking is like why can't we give everybody a job I'm not saying Universal basic income I'm not even [ __ ] talking about minimum wage anymore I'm saying why on Earth would you not imagine a system in which in order to survive just in order to survive as a citizen you just have to be given a job for example you you tell you tell the government hey look here are my skills and they say here's a voucher I think your skills are worth 75 figure out like Jo go go somewhere give them this voucher much imagination you're using your brain gonna get I agree with you but your average americ does not have that type of imagination if you ask them why something is the way that it is say because because it is what it is and that's all you get there's a lack of imagination because it's always been that way because my parents did it because IED no not the frers leave them white man they don't like to be told what to do but they do people want to be told what to do for
