And when everybody around you hates you, begging doesn't really seem like an option.\n\n\nIf you compare immigrants or refugees with german citizens on crime rates and compare the same age, sex, and income groups, it even turns out, Germans are far more likely to commit crimes.\nComparing an old, mostly somewhat wealthy residentiary society to a group that is far younger, overproportionally male, and mostly poor and unemployed is statistically stupid if you want to make claims about the tendency to commit crimes of those groups. In criminology there is a statistically proven consensus that being male, being poor, being young and being unemployed are extremely strong indicators for a higher likelihood to commit crimes.\nDeclaring ethnicity, nationality or culture as the causal factors of crime while completely neglecting all those factors above, is completely ignorant or dishonest.

Had Osama bin Laden been Christian, he wouldn’t all of a sudden be chill with “western civilization”. The problem of radicalization is not a problem solely  in Islam and is a lot more complicated than, “their religion is violent”.  Trivializing problems like this defeat the process of addressing it and just proves to fall into the hands of radicals who take advantage of young Muslims who are either bombed or attacked. I’m assuming you have never met a Muslim, so I encourage you to go talk to one and see how much he or she hates western civilization. As with every ethnic, political, racial, or religious groups, Muslims are a huge group of people around the world from all sorts of backgrounds and they all have different views. Don’t generalize 1.6 billion people based on a shared religion that is also very much up to interpretation by imams and scholars",

And you my friend is what is called a far right extremist. I shouldn’t even try to reason with you as you act in bad faith, your comments about how you believe all people following a religion are a murdering hive-mind prove that. Sadly is see your Kind far too often nowadays. You commit more terror attacks in the West than any Islamic extremist could ever dream of. You are the people that need a scapegoat to hate for their problems.\nYou are the people who spread lies and propaganda about Europe, inventing attacks, rapes and so on, while already sharpening your knives for the moment that you no longer have to hide your true intentions.\n\nTrump is a populist. Slovakia is far right populist, using scare tactics to convince idiots and bigots to vote for them. Italy looks like it might fall because it’s system is corrupt and ineffective.\nHungary is a dictatorship in the making. So is poland, and it is getting scary at this point.\nBoth the latter try to stay in power with propaganda to scare the masses into submission.\n\nThe first is an idiot elected by idiots. The latter is a symptom of post soviet countries showing that they still can not be able to be functioning democracies. \nYou are right, something is spreading in Europe.\nOut of the shadows crawls the scourge of europe after it fled into the dirt once. And it is not islam. The people who knew it and fought it mostly died of by now and slowly the bastards who were crushed once try it again.\nLuckily the fuel for your propaganda has run out, the refugee crisis has died down and the only attacks still happening are from you. Slowly the people will wake up when the boogie man is gone or reduced. But the ideology that once tried its hardest to destroy Europe has its first little claws hooked deep in some countries it once ravaged. And it doesn’t look like it is gonna let go easily.\nLuckily although it’s first host was affected it just so managed to fight it off. While one of its biggest victims apparently decided this time it should be the one. Luckily it’s about as dangerous as a fly for the rest of europe and only a danger to itself, which is possibly even worse.\n\nThe part about Germany will never happen.\nWhy? First, Muslims are not a homogenous Block, believe it or not people define themselves by more than their religion.\nSecond, for Islamic descendants of refugees to become a voting majority in Germany, there would have to be constant income of them like it was at the maximum during the refugee crisis, which has died down almost completely and it would take...about four hundred years.\nI for one sure am scared of being ‚replaced‘ in four hundred years.\n\nThus begone, we both know what you really want and it ain’t gonna happen.

Contrary to populist believe most of the refugees are actually able to identify themselves. And they are not only men, we could simply research this from official figures, but I suppose that is fake news or what? The myth arose from the fact that comparatively many of the early refugees were young men, the reason for that being because they were most likely to survive the journey and most families couldn’t afford to flee all at once (or at all. Let’s make a thought experiment. Let’s say you are the head of a family and you life in a country ravaged by civil war, that could sooner or later kill you all. If you know you can probably only send one of your family to relative safety after a dangerous af journey, who would it be? Grandpa who is dependent on you? Your daughter who would probably get raped by human traffickers? You yourself who has to protect the rest of your family? Or your son, who is younger than you and thus more likely to survive the journey and might soon get conscripted by your oppressive dictator to murder other civilians?) The decision is logical and most families hoped that maybe they would be able to make the journey later but wanted to at least one of them to be save. In the latter part of the refugee crisis the new arrivals were thus mostly exactly not young men.\n\n„Pakistani, Iraqi and afghani“\nUm yeah, and that is not because they want to abuse German welfare.\nWhy would a Pakistani flee from his country...could it be the opressive, fundamentalist government there?\n(And those are the only ones you listed that can arguably be counted as not refugees)\n\nWhy would an afhgan flee from his country? Could it be because the tailban is rising again, the foreign troops there seem to be unable to stop them and the last time they were in power it was like IS in charge of a whole country?\nWhy would an Iraqi flee from his country? Could it be because it is breaking apart thanks to the iraq war and IS is still running wild there?\n\nIt is a true mystery, I guess they all came to Europe in order to abuse welfare for lols. \nBecause that’s totally sth people do on a mass scale.\n\n\nAlso yeah, Soros is the closest to a saint I have yet to see from a rich person, he gave huge amounts of his fortune to charity. And I think most people know he is hungarian, he even lived through WW2 as a kid. Orban hates him because Soros doesn’t like his politics, and authoritarians don’t like people who disagree with them, even more so if those are people with money.",

A few examples being, London, UK vs London, Ontario vs London, Ohio.\nFor all I know, there's another Berlin location somewhere and it doesn't take much for me to be specific and type the additional 'Germany' at the end. I dont always do this practice, I wasn't made conscious that I do this until I read these comments. Is it overkill? Does it come across as 'mean' to some readers? Let me know, thanks!",

The trip was wonderful, I wish I could have spent more time there to be a tourist. I spent over 6hrs in the Berlin Story Bunker (by accident!), much to the horror of my partner. I think I'm out of the dog house for that but oh my did I learn so much.\n\nAs for the Muslim question (hmmm don't feel right phrasing it like this but you know what I mean - 'your' question about Muslim assault [sic]) I entered Berlin wondering if I personally would see first hand account of an impact of the 1M Syrian refugees. I did not. What I observed, (which I offer consciously as purely anecdotal), was an established multi-cultural city in harmony showing clear integration of immigrants of probably Turkish origin. Leaving Germany, I had a new hypothesis that it would make sense that perhaps these immigrants/refugees were probably located/settled to less populated rural areas. So I still wonder how things are with their assimilation into a new 'home' given the circumstances they've found themselves in.",

I hadnt really experienced this atmosphere in europe before, it felt very much like there wasnt really much control and it was very tense especially late at night, the stations were very very busy but i diddnt look as if they were going anywhere. I can see it being far worse for women though as they struggled nervously through and i think its sad that seemingly safety cant really be insured for people.\nI dont have any problem with migrants but there doesnt seem to be any plan for these young people. they need something to do and somewhere else to go. and the problem seems almost completely centered at the train stations, as soon as you leave everything seems normal.",

Sinn's demands dominated the press in Germany and they stand in a long row of similar approaches. There was no crisis that fell from the heavens. The escalation in Syria was fueled with ammunitions from Germany. I followed containers with 400t of cal 7.62 that have been sent to Hatay via Hamburg shortly before the Islamic Front took over large parts of the syrian northwest. We are talking real war crimes here and the german government is deeply involved. We are a country of 357,000 square kilometers and 82 million people now averaging at 230 per square kilometer which is more than twice the number we can sustain, twice the average of the EU, nearly five times global average, which is 50. Many of our MPs take money from suborganizations financed by the OIC. Taking in people coming from a federation  of islamic nations controlling 32 million square kilometers which is 1.3 times the size of the largest empire in history and nearly a hundred times the size of my country doesn't make any sense at all. It increases their costs of living, increases our ecological footprint, and it doesn't help the problem of islam fueling a wandering civil war that never ends and went from one spot of the islamic zone to the next since this cult started. The OIC is responsible for this civil war and we have no reason to let them off the hook. By we i mean the people, not our corrupt government.",

When german government noticed that did not work as expected, they even tried to force them in by halting the payments for refugee camps. There was no crisis but policy by german government's will, and this channel here is basically german state propaganda full of bullshit. I said: Lookup \"Gauck in India\" because Joachim Gauck was the head of state in 2014 and you find his invitation easily using google. What i am explaining here isn't some sort of theory but official history. I am german and i strongly opposed Gauck and Merkel in early 2014. I lived through that shit, and this channel here is blatantly lying.",

        "text": "Aksum አክሱም ፣ ንግሥት it’s a little unfair to place all blame on the west for the destabilization of the near east/ North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa, although their is a fair amount of blame to be had. \n\nThe instability in the Middle East and North Africa is largely domestic in origin. The protests of the Arab Spring, which evolved into the civil wars in Syria, Yemen, Libya and the general upheaval in Egypt, were directed at corruption and abuses of domestic governments. The systems of many Arab states, built on corruption/nepotism/patronage were always fragile. It’s hard to blame the west for this. Sure the US has supported many of these regimes, but what other options were available? State building? We’ve seen how that works out. The Iraq War was certainly a mistake and a large contributing factor to regional instability, but in the years preceding the refugee crisis Iraq was relatively stable. The disintegration of Syria reignited the region, and neither the origin of that conflict nor the escalation can be ENTIRELY blamed of the West. Did the West contribute? Yes. Is it solely to blame? Certainly not. Gulf states and Turkey were desperate for regime change in order to bolster their influence, and Iran sought to support the Assad regime to bolster its regional power. Traditional power politics among regional powers is more responsible for the current instability than any direct Western intervention.\nYemen is a similar case. Libya is an example where western interference really screwed things up, yet the country was already in the midst of a rebellion- it’s not like NATO bombers flew into a completely stable country and removed the regime. This is a case of exacerbating instability, but not creating it. \n\nIt’s hard to draw an direct link between any U.S./European government operations in sub-Saharan Africa and the relative instability of their states/society. I suppose one could make the argument that the legacy of colonialism left many of these nations unable to maintain any semblance of stability/economic growth, or that they entered the race so far behind the West. This seems like a fair argument to me, but we shouldn’t ignore the role played by local actors competing for power, using the government as a tool to enrich allies rather than promote the general welfare. Not to mention the problems of geography, climate, demographics that allowed Europe to dominate African territory in the first place",

As far as I know, Germany didn't start any wars which is the reason refugees are coming to Europe. Wouldn't you agree? I am not against sending refugees back to their home country at the same time you have to understand that unfortunately, problems are more complex than they seem. I think the main problem here is war. Refugees are just the consequences. We are focusing on the wrong in my opinion. Instead of combating the cause of the problem we are combating the consequences.

When the regime collapsed after getting stomped by Vietnam, the government was reformed. Anyways, nowadays Cambodia is a third world country with sham elections and a leader that keeps getting reelected every term, kinda like Putin. Nations and their people continue on despite massive upheaval.

It provides much needed criticism.\n\nThe main point of the people that you were criticizing is not to ask who is to blame. They are concerned mainly about their feeling that the problems created by the refugees are not being discussed honestly, and that European hate speech laws are preventing an honest discussion. So they can be forgiven for being more flippant about how much Merkel is actually to blame for it. But it is still important - the narrative that blames Merkel is the path that can lead one to adopting conspiracy theories about globalists, Jews etc.\n\nAnyway, I hope we can have a dialogue in the future. Not so much about this question - I am not a European. But there's lots to talk about.",

They should be proud of having eventually managed to break free nevertheless, of the huge risk they took to tear down the wall.

Are you saying there were more Stasi informants than normal citizens?\n\nLike I said, the education system was good because it was very organised and did lots of excursions and stuff like that. Most people who were kids in the DDR don't remember being \"indoctrinated\" and learning about Marxism-Leninism 24/7 but rather having a nice time, that's what I was trying to say. And while political repression isn't bad in Germany, \"free thinking\" is hardly encouraged if it isn't compliant with capitalist ideology. \n\n\"THEY insisted on it and THEY had a vote on it, the West Germans didn't\"? I'm not sure what you mean by that. The Einigungsvertrag (Reunification Treaty) was negotiated and accepted by both Germanys. And a 1990 survey says that 80% of West Germans wanted the reunification. (source: http://www.cap-lmu.de/aktuell/positionen/2009/deutsche-einheit.php)\n\nAnd fuck Ostalgia shaming. You can appreciate something while also being critical of it. It's also very weird when some people act like East Germans who grew up in the DDR are bad people because they - often even despite having had negative experience with the Stasi - don't agree that their fatherland was a dystopic hellhole.",

I live near Montréal, Québec(Canada) wich is curently ongoing a ''refugee'' ''crisis''' right now. Illegal immigrants from America, fearing deportation under Trump's administration, are fleeing north to cross the Canadian border. That was predictable. The thing is, a large portion of theses ''refugees'' are actually people buying one way plane tikets from there home country ( Most notably Haïti and Niger) to Platthsburg(East America), then they take the taxi right up to the border, where they cross completelly unoposed (They are actualy taken care of by the authorities.)This phenomenon has only been exponantial since the start of the ''crisis'' in 2017.  The oppositions party are blaming our beloved Justin Trudeau (Kinda obviously) since he virtue signaled on twiter that Canada was an open country and was accepting everybody, right after the ''Dreamers'' thing with Trump. The opposition is calling these refugees ''Trudeau's guests''. I find there's quite the ressemblance with your Merkel situation... but overseas, I find myself in accord with the opposition.  Maybe Trudeau is not entirely to blame, but he absolutely is to blame for this ''crisis''. Largely. He never misses an opportunity to signal our country's vertue when Trump is blamed in a race scandal. His policies and tone attract ''refugees''. And who esle than a country's leader is to blame when there's a crisis ongoning? Its not like it's a natural disaster. Our governement is taking a FAR too weak stance on this ''refugee'' crisis, whisch in turn, attract more and more ''refugees'' who leaves everything behind in hope of Trudeau living up to his words. They call this ''THE CANADIAN DREAM''. If this is alowed to continues the way it is, shit will start to go south ( and i mean far right) pretty damn soon let me tell you.

Asylum just means seeking protection. \n\nThe US violated asylum law by not processing asylum claims and sending people back/deporting them without processing their claims so people moved to Canada hoping it would accept them, but then Canada/Trudeau and several Premiers also started to violate UN law as well as send people back without processing their asylum claim so again when you sound very disingenuous when you make Canada's openly anti-asylum seeking government that's breaking UN asylum law seem pro-refugee. It's not in any way. \n\nQuebec is the second richest province in Canada. Quebec was always historically Quebecois supremacist and known for its bigotry towards other ethnic groups. If breaking UN law and being inhumanly tough on refugees is \"too soft\" for Quebecois people to the point that they become racist, then they always were far right and racist to begin with. \n\nIf following basic human rights laws makes you think others are sub-human, you probably thought they were sub-human to begin with. Looking at Quebec history with its English minority or religious minorities like Jewish people and Muslims, that racism was already there.",

    "text": "You are leaving out crucial points. Merkels government failed miserably at addressing rising migration numbers in previous years. 2015 did not come from nowhere, and no significant steps towards avoiding further migration were taken: refugee camps in the middle east stayed underfunded, border protection remained the problem of Greece and Italy, and her actions were widely perceived - especially among potential migrants - to be an unconditional invitation to Germany. It was not, but the state of complete disarray and pseudo-humanitarian \"Willkommenskultur\" could not have proven otherwise. How else do you explain migrants throwing away documents, refusing asylum in many European countries and travelling illegally to Germany and Sweden - and being successful! Cases of migrants registering multiple times to defraud the welfare systems or avoid deportation are well documented. It can very well be argued that - while her actions did not cause the crisis - they aided in prolonging it into 2016 and the following years, and that a more stringent stance on border security would have stopped this, especially combined with a campaign to create local camps and relieve the need for further movement.",

Or about the attack on Borussia Dortmund for something as stupid as betting money? \n\nSee, I have felt insecure a few times in my live...and it was ALWAYS because of some right wing idiot acting out, because they have zero respect for females. What they accuse Muslims of doing, well, there is a lot of projection involved. They are aggressive and they don't care about the opinions of anyone else.",

But if we can go and call a German who does something like this \"mentally disturbed\" (even in cases in which right wing connections are known), then we can just as well call a Muslim who does it \"mentally disturbed\".  There is a double standard there, one you clearly show by refusing to admit that it is even possible that a German would do something like this. Never mind that yes, we Germans are perfectly able to do something like this, and that putting buildings on fire is just another form of terrorism. Hell, you don't even need a reason...you can just as well be depressed and decide to fly a plane into a mountain. \n\nIn short, your general judgement doesn't solve the problem. And despite what you would like to claim, if there is a relation between terrorist attacks and the number of refugees a country takes, then the countries with a lot of refugees actually get LESS terrorist attacks. The UK has closed its door, and yet they got more attacks than anyone else except maybe France. You focus on the one attack which happened in Germany, but are blissfully ignoring the right wing shooting in Munich, various knife attacks, one minor car attack (also committed by a German but barely reported because thankfully nobody died in this case), another car attack in Münster, and a bomb attack on the Borussia Bus. But yeah, let's be all paranoid about a few refugees.",

So I am judging based on evidence and reality unlike you. \"Right wing connections are known\" man you just have to sound like a crazy . CNN and Wikipedia said he has no right wing affiliation or isis affiliation for that matter. It seems that you saw a case where the terrorist wasn't a muslim therefore he's far right wing terrorist. Very interesting. That nuance of yours. \nCountries with very low muslim populations and no communists tend to have close no terror attacks since those two groups are globally number one and number two when it comes to terrorism. Remember when Hamburg was aflame during the G20? What was it then, groups of far right antifa and anarchists oppressing women and minorities no? Or just called them some racial pejorative at least .",

That is the only concrete thing they have . The rest is utter retardation in the most literal sense of the word. The US alt right either wants to create ethnostates in Florida or to create a separate state in the middle of the USA , the European alt right depending on the country either wants all no white people deported or just the Muslims , or ethnicities such as Syrian, Turkish , Pakistani or morrocan. Depending which alt righter  you ask you get a different answer . \n2. The term alt right ha been thrown towards many conservatives in the first worlds, be they in USA , australia and Europe. South Africa is an exception since the majority now wants to create Zimbabwe 2.0 there. \nI must say that during the start of the 2018 after the sargon/Spencer/styx debate, the lines on what the alt right wants are more clear.  Before the alt right did not specifically said they want to create ethnostates in Florida or to deport /hunt non white people from USA. After that debate those stances were reinforced by prominent alt right speakers. Hope this helps",

Like the ‘g’ at the beginning of ‘Germany’. I’m so happy that you make content in English instead of German because my German is nonexistent. Your English is freaking flawless and you speak it better than half of the native English speakers I know. I just thought you might want to know because you talk about politics so much. \nI’m learning Swedish and I get so frustrated when my Swedish friends don’t correct my pronunciation. They say “but it’s so cute when you say words wrong!” I’m just like “girl, no! I need to know when I say things wrong!”",

What about the trade agreements between the EU or European Countries with African Countries devastating latter's economy while europe is not even dependend on these low profits made by these extra-laws?\nsubsidized ultra cheap chicken meat or milk and cheap old and used clothes are brought from europe to africa. And spanish fishing boats overfishing african coasts. automatic rifles build in the west make wars in developing countries cheaper and more possible. resource injustice is a huuuge topic. just to name a few problems explicitly. there are myriads more. And the most recent severe is climate change accelerated by nations that now deny their duty to open their borders. And this is only the present. what about the imperialistic and colonialistic past of europe? Its about the whole historical context. And the sheer blindness of development aid ministry to adress these problems is last but not least part of the problem itself.\n\n\nanyways i like your videos and your style. your focus was actually another than the title suggested but hey, i still could learn something new and thats why im here afterall ;)",

There seems to be a lot of people with a near-obsession with immigration to Sweden, especially focusing on rape. I've lost count of how many times I've had to explain to people that Swedish laws quantify rape cases differently from most other countries (per alleged instance of rape instead of per perpetrator-victim relationship), which causes their number of cases to go a lot higher. That's not to say there aren't problems, of course, but I'd love to see more nuanced information getting out there. Especially since Scandinavian countries in general seem to have this weirdly totemic place in the mind of a lot of racists (some weird racial purity stuff, I guess), and also serve as a kind of bogeyman to a lot of economic-right-wingers (looking for reasons to demonize social-democracy anywhere they can, it seems).\nJust to be clear; I'm not Swedish myself.",

    "text": "Good historical resume of the crisis. Congrats.\n\nI do think you are undervaluing the pull-factors of public news. We had a lot people passing through our country refusing to seek asylum, because they wanted to go to Sweden. Video and interviews of the migrants saying that they were going to Sweden exactly because of higher benefits. How the criminal networks work for the human trafficking of migrants inside Europe would be very interesting to know. Migrants and refugees seem pretty informed on the benefits and official government attitudes were. \n\nThe handling of this crisis was pretty bad. No official line from the EU, states running solo in all directions, little to no coordination between member states about asylum status really left a big and very exploitative hole for those, who were not refugees. Migrants (i.e. people, who are not fleeing from a humanitarian crisis or a conflict) did mix into crowds of genuine asylum seekers (which could  later be classified as refugees). So the problem with migrants is that it is a mixture of people, who wanted to work, flee from justice, exploit benefits and housing, and victims of modern slavery (which is sex-trafficking). Organized crime was flourishing under the breakdown of the asylum systems. \n\nThe what to do now is a far more interesting question than pointing the finger. Easy shots at political opponents is more likely to prolong the problem than solve it. A lot of member states are running into derived problems from the migrant crisis. Sweden for example with their housing bubble, ethnic tensions (Jewish minority has it pretty bad), and local gang problems. Failure of maintaining order is also a very big issue for a country that is not used to headlines as: \"Senior citizen killed by grenade\". There are limits to the amount of crime a society will accept before vigilante groups pop up. We are already seeing lone-wolf \"retaliation\" attacks from anti-immigration movements. It is better to see how we can handle the problems feeding these movements before they get really organized. The cycle of escalation is already beginning to show up. If we are to break the cycle before it spins out of control a better understanding of the mechanics of the vigilante groups and migrant gangs are needed from the authorities.\n\nFixing this will take more and more extreme measures the longer we wait. Do we really want \"Identity Europa\" or other vigilante organizations to take the credit. It will undermine the democratic system as a whole, since then vigilantism would be preferable to a state of law (in which we have a democratic say). It is also very important to have strict guidelines on the policies, since people with good intentions can do the exact thing that would escalate or prolong a crisis. I am pretty sure NGOs for example didn't have an intention of helping human-trafficking networks.\n\nI think you are doing yourself a disservice of not defining refugees, migrants and asylum seekers in your video. This will undoubtedly be an attack vector from your opponents. It is pretty easy for a far right political zealot to label all these groups migrants and point to the worst examples.",
