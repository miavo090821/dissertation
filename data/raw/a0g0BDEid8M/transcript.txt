hello everyone just so you know in this video I might be using the term refugee or migrant or asylum seeker rather interchangeably so don't get confused it's all in the broader context of the European migrant crisis when talking about the European migrant crisis there's one thing that seems to be at the center of the discussion especially when the question on who is actually to blame for the negative consequences of this geopolitical crisis I'm talking about the notion that Angela Merkel and by extension Germany invited the huge number of asylum seekers that came to Europe in 2015 and 2016 most of the time I hear this coming from people on the right and those claiming not to be on the right although they share most opinions with the right but since they're okay with homosexuals and weed they're actually liberals here's an example from Lauren southern Merkel cannot invite millions of these migrants in and then pretend to give a damn about the people of Europe and the little fascist but black pigeon speaks when German Chancellor Angela Merkel opened the gates to the continent and invited the entire developing world to come to the welfare states of Europe and live on government handouts millions of people overwhelmingly young men from sub-saharan Africa and the Arab world have heeded the call and of course our buddy Sargon is also along for the ride but seriously just listen to this Merkel didn't do nothing nothing at all I mean it's not like Merkel is the sole author of the refugee crisis I mean it's not like she was the one who unilaterally decided open the borders I don't care but she would be remembered for her skills as a crisis manager you mean a crisis creator she did not manage the European crisis she created it she is responsible for its existence although he differs from the previous examples in the sense that in his mind Merkel is actually the sole creator of the refugee crisis maybe the Bundeswehr involved in a bombing campaign I'm not aware of and the last example comes from stefan molyneux in his nuanced not at all lurid way of presenting information so hey Germany I've got a great idea how about you find some Aristotelian mean somewhere between exterminating your own minorities and inviting very rapey minorities into your country to destroy Europe just somewhere in the middle might be a great idea what a lovely guy although he is talking about migrants being invited by German welfare benefits but I think you get the idea now I've yet to see coverage of these folks on how this invitation was actually issued but we'll get to that later there are several ways to look at the defining moment for Germany in the European migrant crisis but all of them revolve around a small time window in September 2015 well Angela Merkel made the decision to let the trains and buses sent from Hungary pass through Austria and into Germany and subsequently suspending the Dublin regulation for those of you who don't know the Dublin regulation is the EU s attempt to have a common Asylum policy for all EU members it essentially says that the asylum request by a third country national is to be presented in the first European country the person arisin usually either Italy or Greece and where he or she was identified by local authorities this evidently means that individual preferences that is where people arriving in Europe actually want to go and where they want to live is not to be considered this regulation is very beneficial to countries like Germany because they are surrounded by other EU countries while Greece and Italy bear the burden of having to deal with most of the asylum seekers themselves now let's look at Merkel's decision in late August and early September 2015 the caliche train station in Budapest had more or less become a refugee camp Hungarian authorities prohibited two migrants from travelling further and the migrants who had already bought a trains were escorted off them by the police Hungary was more or less just following the --use rules with his behavior as more and more migrants had to settle at the keleti train station and garyun authorities became overwhelmed not only with the effort to register anyone coming in but also keeping the general peace and providing humanitarian care prior to the 25th of August most of the migrants reaching Hungary had filed their asylum requests in Hungary until Germany's federal agency for migration and refugees made it public that the Dublin procedure for Syrian citizens is at this point in time effectively no longer being adhere to during a press conference and Germany's interior minister Thomas de mazia confirmed that the suspension of the dublin agreement was not as such a legally binding act but more of a guideline for management practice now up until this present day it's not clear how this tweet actually came to be but it wasn't meant as an invitation but a statement of a simple fact at the time the tweet was made the dublin regulation had already collapsed and wasn't throughout enforced partially because the European Court of Justice had suspended deportations to Greece in 2011 since Dublin was not working out and it was put in Greece at a huge disadvantage taken from the University of Oxford Faculty of law according to the European Asylum support office for the period of 2010 to 2014 about 10 percent of the registered Asylum applicants in the EU with the subject of Dublin claims ie the country where they had applied for asylum as another EU Member State to accept responsibility for examining the asylum claim and while 2 percent of all Asylum applicants were subsequently physically transferred to another member state under the scheme so why the tweet was an incentive for Syrian refugees stranded in Hungary or other countries along the Balkan route it's not indicative of a change in approach for the German government this patchwork of responsibility led to extreme confusion for everybody involved combined with the conditions at the station this led the migrants to become more and more impatient some of them had spent their last money for a train ticket to Germany Austria only to be taken off the train again when the pressure reached his boiling point a large group of migrants set to travel to the Hungarian Austrian border by foot when Hungarian authorities became aware of this the Hungarian ambassador and Vienna informed the Austrian foreign ministry that a group of around thousand persons who had entered Hungary illegally were now on their way to Austria and requested advice on what legal basis Hungary should act on this memo was interpreted by the Austrian Chancellor a bit different though he saw this as a question coming straight from the Hungarian Prime Minister or ban as to whether the Hungarians should stop the march or allowed to continue to Austria the Austrian Chancellor and his advisors were also certain that this will lead to violence and wanted to prevent this at all costs so the Austrian Chancellor faiman decided to call Angela Merkel he informed her about the situation and also warned of the possibility of violence and even deaths and said Hungary is pursuing a strategy of escalation something would prove to be true just a couple of minutes later Merkel informed Faymann that she would have to discuss the situation with her advisers half an hour later the Hungarian ambassador Sukhoi informed the German Chancellery that Hungary is no longer able to guarantee the registration of refugees and is thus planning to bust them to the Hungarian Austrian border the total number of refugees will be between 4,000 and 6,000 on board of around 100 buses this was a clever move by Auburn since he was giving the refugees free passage to the West but also shifted the pressure towards Austria and Germany putting them in a position to decide to either stop the migrants at the border in a time of rising political pressure because of the conditions the refugees had to live under or take them in accepting domestic pressure by migration hardliners to understand the political climate this decision had to be made and we have to be wary of the general moved in the West at the time pictures of the conditions in Hungary were in the press everyday and multiple people had died along there Germany over the Balkan route one week earlier the police found the dead bodies of 71 asylum seekers four of whom were children that suffocated inside a truck in Austria attempting to reach Germany through human traffickers three days prior the picture of Alan Kurdi who you may know worse the dead Syrian boy lying on the beach went around the world Western European leaders were under extreme pressure to find a solution to this humanitarian crisis this is the main reason merkel and fame and wanted to prevent pictures of security personnel violently clashing with refugees at all costs so shortly after 9 p.m. Merkel made the decision to let their 4,000 to 6,000 migrants coming from Hungary pass into Germany under the pretense that this would be an exception Germany would not deport Syrian refugees to other EU states and would pursue a European solution something that as we know today proved to be just as difficult as prior to Merkel and famous decision now after this decision ordeal you might say that Germany in Austria would accept the migrants who were bused to the border by the Hungarian government it became very clear that this wasn't an exception on the following weekend alone 20,000 migrants arrived in Munich Central Station essentially because Hungary and no other country was stopping the migrants coming from the balcony out shortly after the German Bundesrat say who had responsibility over the border protection got the order to close the German border to Austria and deny entry to anyone who wanted to apply for asylum the refugees in Austria but before this order was put into practice it was rewritten by the interior ministry Germany reintroduced border checks but that asylum seekers entered the country now why was this decision made and here one can see the futility of looking for a national solution to a European problem again if Germany would have done that this would have just moved the problem from Germany to Austria a country with a much smaller population and ability to care for this large group of people it may have worked if together with Germany every country along the backhand route would have closed its borders but this would also lead to most of the migrants drowning in Greece also a country who was already overwhelmed with the situation and still dealt with the fallout of their financial crisis so they tried a different approach namely pushing for a resettlement with every EU country taking their fair share to release some pressure of Greece and Italy the solution never came into being because of strong opposition's by a couple of Eastern European countries and among them the very politician who bust the migrants to the Austrian border in the first place and who now claims this is what Germany actually wanted after this approach was killed off Germany negotiated a deal with Turkey which would reduce the influx of migrants for Greece from 80,000 a month to 2,000 a month while the countries along the back can write simultaneously closed their borders this is although very condensed what happened in September 2015 now was Merkel's decision to let the migrants from Hungary pass into germany understandable given the circumstances and almost without an alternative considering the pressure from the public and also from Hungary or was it more like sock on foot said I mean it's not like she was the one who unilaterally decided open the borders I don't care whatever you believe to be true we doesn't matter that much though because it's irrelevant to what we will look at next what a different decision by Merkel namely closing the borders and letting the migrants attain Hungary Austria have reduced the overall influx of migrants into Europe now to put it shortly if we look at this graph which is based on numbers by the German federal office for migration refugees it appears that way more refugees arrived in November after mirko's decision this is only half the story though to put this graph into proper context want us to understand how migration movements develop at the beginning only a few people leave for Europe and if it appears that they have been successful more people fear motive to leave their homes behind and go on the journey for a better or at least safer life this is why the people who research migration movements don't look at absolute numbers but rather how growth rates develop month by month this growth rate remains stable even after Markos decision in early September the reason for this can be found if we look at the countries through which the migrants pass to get to Central Europe most refugees that came in 2015 used the so called Balkan route their journey was about 3,000 kilometers or 1864 miles long and led them from Turkey through Greece Macedonia Serbia and Hungary where they were eventually stopped by the Hungarian government prior to the Dublin regulation being suspended if you look at the refugee arrivals in Greece for the same time period which are taken from the International Organization for Migration we see that the migration wave began in March and increased rapidly from there especially from July to August with an increase of 97% now either a large number of migrants making their journey to Europe web psychic or their set up on their own accord rather than waiting on an invitation by Merkel this also becomes clear when looking at a rival data for Hungary the data shows a stock increase from August to September because the people who landed in Greece in August pushed their way further toward central Europe largely by foot in the extremely low amount of arrivals in November and December is due to Hungary closing their border to Serbia in mid-september and also closing the border with Croatia in mid-october I know it's a lot easier to see this as one politician making a colossal mistake out of a spontaneous outbursts of altruism but that's not what happened Germany Austria Hungary and the other countries along the Balkan route essentially lost control and the faith in a mutual solution geopolitical crises are almost always so complex that it's impossible to judge individual decisions of politicians acting in that crisis as isolated actions imagine if someone would try to make the point that it's actually Britain's fault alone that they were at war with Germany in World War one and to since they declared war on Germany it would be ridiculous to make that assertion because there was a lot more going on in the context in which this decision was made it's important to look at the bigger picture especially with such a huge event as the migrant crisis was but this sort of approach doesn't lend itself to YouTube demagoguery as much since it's just so much easier to say this politician did X in screwed everything out and of course the contrary is true as well if someone would Heil Merkel as a great humanitarian who showed determination in the face of this crisis it will also be incorrect since the events developed way more naturally than some people would want you to believe and to some extent Merkel embracing her image as this very Pro refugee politician is partially the reason why so many people on the right have this misconception about her decision in the first place the pictures of her visiting a refugee shelter gave her the image of the Pro refugee politician although she actually never was that she's a conservative after all anyway judging from the earlier data it's clear that Merkel's decision did not increase the general influx of migrants for Europe and we also looked at what this decision actually was and how it was made there are two more things which get brought up sometimes in this discussion the first one is Merkel's in famous sentence via shuffled us or we will do it what rarely gets mentioned though is that this sentence was part of a longest speech I will put it in the description but here are a few sentences surrounding the famous quote for Merkel in the near future we will implement new legislation that increased the speed of processing the applications talking about refugee applications here we need more capacity to house refugees we need to determine quickly who has a good chance to stay and who doesn't we have to make decisions quickly so that we can deport those who have been rejected quickly I will just say Germany is a strong country the mentality that we have to apply to this issue has to be we managed to do so much in the past we will do this we will do this and wherever we meet obstacles in our way we have to work to overcome them the federal government will do all that is in its power to do this now from that small context alone it should be clear that Merkel's we will do it wasn't an invitation to anyone but if you still have your doubts after Merkel gave this speech she answered a few questions from the press and clarified her stance on Syrian refugees Dublin 3 is the regulation that is in force thus I greatly appreciate Hungary registering the refugees something that not all countries are doing one has to say Hungary is doing this very well I think it created a certain amount of confusion when we had an inner debate in Germany where several federal states stated that Syrians have to be granted asylum very quickly as pretty much all of them are genuine refugees fleeing a war zone head of the office for migration Refugees subsequently stated yes Syrians will be identified afterwards they should be accepted as civil war refugees rather quickly this has created the following impression if a Syrian comes to Germany and can identify himself a Syrian he is welcome in Germany this is in fact reality in the same way that someone from Kosovo most likely won't be allowed to stay this has created the wrong assumption that all Syrians should come to Germany this however is not the state of the law and we have already told this to the Hungarian government which has to deal with the phenomenon of Syrians inside its border saying let us go to Germany it is not the case that we could simply diverge from Dublin 3 we don't have any other treaty on the issue but if one country is building fences second country's allowing everyone to transit and a third one isn't registering everybody anymore one has to say if this state is the reality we have to find a better one the state where law and order are in accordance again but the legal basis for us and for the Hungarian government is the one that is enforced today talking about the Dublin regulation here now does this sound like a politician eager to let migrants into the country she explicitly said she does not care about the migrants holding up signs that say let us go to Germany that is the problem of the Hungarian government the second thing that is often mentioned as a pool factor is Germany's welcomed culture which was displayed during the crisis at the Central Station in Munich for instance I would agree that these two things definitely acted as a pull factor for refugees to choose Germany as their country of destination over other EU countries but the assertion that Merkel's sentence and the attitude in Germany motivated significantly more people to leave their homes and set after Europe is just not supported by the numbers we looked at earlier since most migrants had already left their countries of origin when all of this was going on besides all that I don't think anyone would disagree that an economically strong country like Germany was better suited to take in the refugees moving it on the Balkan route then a country like Serbia or Macedonia and for the people cheering at the Central Station in Munich when the refugees arrived I really don't see the problem with this even if you are opposed to taking refugees in at that point in time Germany only gained benefits from giving these people such a warm welcome people who feel safe and welcome in a society are less likely to segregate and have an easier time navigating inside that society which leads to less crime by those groups and overall less social tension there's one more thing that is worth mentioning if it wasn't Merkel supposed invitation what actually led to so many people trying to reach Europe well we could talk for another hour about this one but for now I'll try to give you the short version in the summer of 2015 the war in Syria is significantly worsened in the first half of 2015 Assad found his military under extreme pressure and expanded his bombing campaign in response cities like Aleppo and Goethe faced the strongest attacks upper tool that point alongside other rebel-held areas while all of this was going on the American bombing campaign had not yet been able to halt the expansion of the Islamic state in Syria and Iraq which led to an even bigger Exodus by large parts of the Syrian population many of them landed in refugee camps in Lebanon Turkey or Jordan while a lot of countries offered their financial help to aid the camp residence On June 27 2015 the UN refugee agency warned that it had received only 1 billion dollars of the 4.5 billion needed and said it couldn't guarantee the needed assistance for the coming winter before everything we saw develop over the balcony out the UN refugee agency actually want that many refugees are fleeing to Europe as the only option in June 2015 in addition to the fear of a collapse and a humanitarian catastrophe the countries who gave refuge to most of the Syrians were reaching their boiling point as well the Syrian civil war had lasted for years by this point and Lebanon alongside other countries saw themselves unable to provide shelter or food etc in addition to that refugees were not allowed to work in Lebanon and Turkey something that would only be made possible in Turkey in early 2016 as a result of the eu-turkey deal the second largest group of the migrants reaching Europe aside Syrians come from Afghanistan according to the United Nations assistance mission in Afghanistan more civilians lost their lives in the country in 2015 than in any other year since 2009 Thomas Rohtak of the Afghanistan analysis Network estimated that between 60 and 100 districts were either controlled or threatened by the Taliban in 2015 who had also largely overtaken the Ring Road as the biggest artery of the Afghanistan infrastructure the renewed threat of the Taliban increased the pressure to flee the country particularly among the mostly Shiite Hazara ethnic group at the same time most of the population in Afghanistan was very pessimistic regarding the future of their country in June 2015 the Asia Foundation carried out a survey of around 10,000 Afghans with 57 believing their country was moving in the wrong direction [Music] another question in this survey was would you leave the country if you had the chance which 40 percent of the participants answered in the affirmative at the same time a big chunk of the 3 million African refugees currently in Iran left for Europe they faced strong discrimination in the sense that they weren't allowed to work study at universities or attend school even after staying in the country for years Human Rights Watch also reported that the Iranian government forcibly recruited Afghan refugees in 2015 for pro-government militias in Syria and threatened them with deportations back to Afghanistan the response to this by many of the refugees was to flee to Europe all of these events and more triggered the huge influx of migrants into Europe in the late summer of 2015 and not Merkel's decision to accept the buses from Hungary this instability paired with the fact that Europe had his eyes on the Greek financial crisis and the war in Ukraine led to them being completely unprepared for what was about to happen but just because this wasn't the fault of a single politician doesn't mean everything went okay the affected countries including Germany lost control over the registration of arriving migrants and effectively had no way of knowing who they just let into their countries the attitude in Europe would shift after several terror attacks in instances like the sexual assaults in Cologne on New Year's Eve would cause a deep rift in broader society and Europe as a whole this all belongs to the bigger picture of the refugee crisis alongside how it actually happened and full disclosure I actually don't like Merkel I never voted for her party and I disagree with her on almost everything but to frame Merkel's decision as a trigger for the refugee crisis is not supported by data and frankly laughable in its simplicity now you might be wondering why it seems like the people featured in this video give such a one-sided or simplistic and also incorrect view of the crisis well we can only make guesses about what's going on in their heads but the large part is probably that they have no idea how this crisis actually came to be how it developed or how immigration as a whole works in Germany and Europe here you can see Sargon demonstrate this while trying to find a good argument why Britain should leave the EU freedom of movement is actually fantastic for free trade you but the thing is freedom of movement is not good if you want things like socialized healthcare or a welfare state you end up getting tourism for these things specifically also with the migrant crisis I mean millions of these migrants are being given German passports and becoming German citizens okay now despite the fact that to even apply for German citizenship you have to live here for several years pass a language and citizenship tests have to be employed and neither you nor your family can be dependent on any kind of welfare and have to have a clean criminal record then these supposed millions although I don't know where that nama is coming from we'll head on to Britain to leech off welfare got it tell me more about this hugely complex geopolitical crisis I'm eager to learn but general ignorance isn't the only reason this crisis is spun the way it is by the more sinister types talking about this they're not interested in presenting a nuanced as close to the truth as possible overview of the migrant crisis they're interested in selling you a story and every good story needs a villain and you might think I'm just being pedantic in this video but this puzzle piece is part of a larger story there is a very clear reason that someone like black pigeon speaks only shows you images and clips like this look at these hordes invading our civilized world and why he's never picking images like this firstly seeing an image like this is more likely to make you sad than angry or afraid and that's an emotion which doesn't lend itself good to selling you something secondly it's easier to antagonize the refugees coming to Europe to an audience if you dehumanize them this is why the framing of this crisis so often revolves around an invading army while it's undeniable that extremists hidden a broader groups coming to Europe this was only possible because most of them are regular people like you and me just trying to find a better life and if you had to blame someone for the refugee crisis is it maybe and this is just me the two imperialist powers destabilizing the broader region for decades now or if that doesn't cut it for you a brutal dictator who butchers his own people well in that case we have to be skeptical and dissect if the narrative of the mainstream media and the United Nations and also the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons is actually true and if the version of the Russian state media may actually be more accurate oh but the refugee crisis yeah Breitbart and Daily Express headlines are probably to get a comprehensive picture on that one so before you listen to these folks about the refugee crisis or really any geopolitical crisis taking place outside their own backyards check yourself before you riggidy riggity wreck yourself [Music] thanks for watching everyone and a big thank you to all my patrons some of whom you can see here flying by feel free to follow me on Twitter or subscribe and
