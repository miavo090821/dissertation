So if you go to Papua or Japan and you lived there and gain citizenship, you certainly would be Papuan and or Japanese, at elast legally. And if you mean in a more cultural level, if you lvie there a long time, probably you would acquire some of the local customs and would msot probably speak the language almsot daily, maybe you would retain some of you cultural identity, so you would be aprtly Japanese or papuan. And if you have children they would go to a Japanese or Papuan school and would have Japanese and Papuan Friends and maybe they would marry a Japanese or Papuan person, etc. maybe they still retain some of your previous culture, because they would ahve learned by you, but they would certainly be more Japanese tan you and the same would happen to their grandchildren.",

Also, I'm not being lied to, I don't have a problema with the demographics, because the demographics don't inherently change the culture. I come from a aprt of my country with a different culture tan the rest, with have our language and traditions, you know what I love, seeing an immigrant participate in those (and I was a private tutor, they got easier into the language and culture tan some Galicians or people from other parts of Spain), sometimes with more fervor that people whose families were here for centuries but left our language and traditions, because they don't help you suceed in the global market. And when I see the apathy toward the los of my culture, I sometime think that with a good though out effort, immigration can actually help revitalize our language and culture.",

It's skin.\n\nC) The 'white race' is madeup like every other one. Its loss is as damaging as the loss of blackness that produced whites in the first place.\n\nD) Muslims aren't some kind of hivemind bent on destroying western civilization and imposing fundamentalist Islam. People absorb the cultures they grow up in, especially children, more and more so with each generation. German culture is not going to disappear.\n\nE) If you're going to throw around figures then provide sources. E.g 'Scotland became 64% white in a year and lefties cheered it'. Or saying \"...millions of third world  flooding their lands and raping women and girls...\" if you seriously think that's happening.\n\nMiscellaneous claims\n'2 genders'\nDo you mean sex, or are you referring to the psychological/neurological aspect of a person that makes them e.g male? If sex then intersex people exist. If it's the brain then what makes you think that the brain wouldn't fit the same pattern as sex?\n\nCheers",

        "text": "ThePunisher129 Anarcho-communism will win *eventually* ... complacency of revolutionary activity is the death knell of direct action, however. As it stands we have the capitalist ruling class thinking that they can own and privatize the very wealth of Earth and now they're trying to colonize and privatize the wealth of the Solar system rather that guaranteeing all humanity has an equal inheritance to space and the universe.\n\nWhile it's correct to say without Earth, that can never be a reality--do you really want to wait for the Elon Musks of the world to steal more of humanity's birthright?\n\nSure, fascists will eventually face death. But they ain't going down without that inevitable fight that will require us to *actually fight* ...\n\nMarxism tells us that a society does not alter its structuralist foundations and hierarchies of power while the productive forces of said hierarchy seek to allow it. \n\nFor the same reasons the workers will inevitably win, is the same reason why the workers of the world must fight and sabotage society's productive forces in order to seek and cement actual change to the hierarchy.\n\nMoreover the hierarchies of power is more than just capitalism. While everything is labour, so too is everything social capital and appeals to structuralism. Nietzsche was fundamentally, on some level, correct that while one cannot simply become the ubermensch--one can create the society from which the ubermensch shall be hypothetically born.\n\nCommunism is not an end goal, communism is about perpetual revolution against the solidification of class constructs.\n\nThis is why 'there is no peace under Marxism' ...  appeals to peace are appeals to artificial hierarchies of power. Even if we got rid of the police, the state, the capitalist ruling class--perpetual revolution against the solidification of class consciousness in order to maintain the fight against a new one emerging is key.\n\nDirect action is synonymous with revolution... only the content and unsympathetic seek 'peace'.",

On a funny side note \"Breitbart\" is actually a legit German word meaning \"wide beard\"; we take it as a hint to waht neckbeards might contribute to it.\nAnyway \"Die Welt\" aka \"The World\" is somewhat burgeois conservative, a bit law and order (for Germany that is), pro America and pro EU. Die Welt is also pretty pro Israel.\nThere are smaller publications that are somewhat more subversive and more to the right of it like \"junge Freiheit\" (young freedom) a neoliberal/market radical/libertarian/homo homini lupus est -  mix but its very much a niche. You might still find some positions in that that you will here form some rather business-friendly democrats in the US.\nMore towards the extreme right and a \"worthy\" German attempt at mimicking Breitbart levels of edginess and plain lies would probably be the magazine \"COMPACT\" which's (you should really have the word \"which's\" in English, its useful) main business is in massive fearmongering among a certain demographic. It's pretty marginal though, compared to any mainstream publications.\n(this is my opinion anyway, other German's mileage my vary) For some with a more western german background and a left wing tradition of ideas reaching back to 1968, \"die Welt\" will be what the red cloth is to the bull.

Anecdotal (\"My own experience\" type) evidence doesn't count by the way. And regarding appropriations and alterations of pre-existing memes, well, the Pepe Frog, also known as #FeelsBadMan was initially just a innocuous picture of a humanoid frog either being sad or happy in reaction to a major event or simply a good joke/bad tragedy, until the /pol/acks came along and reappropriated it to fit their political agenda, such as having Pepe endorse Donald Trump, making him the emperor of \"Kekistan\", wearing SS uniforms, repeating /pol/ talking points or caricatures of Jews, etc, and it became EXTREMELY popular, so much so that the original creator had to put his foot down to attempt to \"rip out\" Pepe from the hands of the \"alt-right\" and bring it back to it's originalist roots, so meme reappropriation =/= low quality and stagnation in all cases, *especially when used to point out hypocrisy on either side of the aisle* (See the NPC meme details and how both extremes parrot the same points they are indoctrinated with).",

Has nothing to do with \"triggering\" (Which would look something like this: \"WAAAAAAA, MUH FEELINGS, OH YOU OFFENDED ME YOU LITTLE XYZ! GO AWAY, YE BIGOT/NAZI/RACIST/REACTIONARY REEEEEEEEEEEEEE, YOU DEVALUE OTHERS MEEEEEEEEEEEHHHHH\", assuming we are following the typical example of a angry feminist), as that would by definition make me scream all over the place, hurl ad hominems and personal attacks at the opponent, or simply appeal to emotion or \"clutch pearls\". \n\nAnyways, regarding the whole \"left vs right meme\" debate or whose is better, generally speaking, memes are mostly apolitical and do not focus on any particular ideology, political party, or organization, and are simply there to spread info and comedy in a unorthodox and \"made for internet\" way, point out inconvenient truths in a tragicomic fashion, mock someone else's ridiculous gaffes, or simply use a  memorable soundbyte or scene from a movie and reproduce it to suit particular situations. \n\nThe only \"political\" ones are mostly originating from outlets such as /pol/, /leftypol/, r/The_Donald, etc, and are not yet composing a clear majority of the general netsphere, and Harambe etc too wasn't political or tied to any particular \"wing\". A meme's quality depends on its originality, ability to amuse and be genuinely memorable, persist for a long time on the Internet, have a unique slogan and concrete message, and not \"die off\" within several months (Cough, Ugandan Knuckles, cough hnnng), not it's political agenda or what \"wing\" it belongs to. If it's crappy and political, it is crappy, no matter what wing it is tied to, and if it is good and apolitical or political then it is good, simple as that. Rate according to merit, not ideology or conflict of interest. My opinion and stance.",

        "text": "Luis D. \"Not a meme\" you say? Well, this one points to the contrary, even if Shillary (Never supported her in the first place, not even if it was her vs Trump, for obvious reasons) may never have meant for it to become one:\nhttps://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/hillary-clinton-s-basket-of-deplorables\nAnd the point about word reappropriation still stands. Just like y'all reappropriated the word \"basket of deplorables\", we shall reappropriate and turn the word \"NPC\" around. That's how the free marketplace of ideas operates after all. No one 'owns\" a meme (See the case of Pepe's origin for instance), and anyone with the right wit can quickly flip and weaponize it, for better, or for worse.\n\nEdit 1: Oh and by the way, what exactly do you refer to whenever you say the \"left\"? Because if you refer to the Antifa SJWs and those who believe in transgenderism, IMHO,  these are out of touch identitarians that don't generally represent the interests of the common American man, and are usually propped up by Dem corporatists in order to prevent a real independent from ever taking power, and to hide their immense corruption and inability to tackle the economic issues, and are thus mostly trolls or just those deluded by corporate propaganda spread by Third Way, the Clintons, Neera Tanden, Biden, Donna Brazille, etc.\n\nRemember, not all rightwingers are literal Roy Moore nutjobs (As some might unfortunately dogpile even centre righters with), and neither are all centrists and centre-leftwingers these \"pink-haired feminist granola eater New York Café\"  idiots that generally take the forefront of media attention. Fringes are fringes, and are the loudest minorities within any ideological group and thus naturally receive more attention from the community than those who rather keep silent or are \"moderate\" in their views. That goes for everyone, not just the right/left.",

He was the quintessential conservative of his day, but comparatively his policies and ideas are very much mainstream in the Liberal Party of today and would be far too liberal for our Conservative Republican Party today.\nPolitical shifts like this are common over time.\nIf you wanted to go back further the Republican party was actually founded as a liberal abolitionists party, and became a conservative capitalistic type of organization a generation later.\nI'll in the history lesson with that, but I would point out the discrepancy that you complain people view you as racist and then go on to have a racially charged epithet. Again I don't know what nation you find yourself in, but throughout Europe and North America it is a foregone conclusion that white people like myself tend to have an easier life than most others. There are of course exceptions as poverty afflicts people of all Races and nationalities.\nSo you would seem to be chanting against a discrimination that is all in your head while prolificating a discrimination that is all too clear in reality.",

By this logic, we may call YOU a apologist for rightwing extremism as you say \"BPS and Iconoclast had nothing to do with it in any WAEEE neither their ideology or dogwhistling, meeeeeeh\", because while BPS and Iconoclast may not DIRECTLY have told the Synagogue mass murderer to shoot it up, they certainly contributed to his radicalization by subtly repeating alt-right talking points and acting as guides leading him further down in the Anti-SJW rabbit hole, eventually guiding him to outlets like Red Ice TV, Stormfront, Daily Stormer, Gab.ai, and Voat (In which he was a avid user mind you, on Gab), which are hotbeds of radical right activity and antisemitic rhetoric.",

They didn’t want a repeat of a monarch claiming to be ordained by god so they also limited powers and split them across multiple branches of government. \n\nThey also upon becoming their own country cast off their skin figuratively and legally as a way of saying they were now Americans instead of from the countries they were born in.",

What you are referring to happend years later when it became restrictive. At that point only german and british were considdered white.\n\nAs far as countries being for the ethnicity they are named that is no longer true with all the mixed backgrounds most of the world has now. The world is so diveres at this point in time that it would be nonsenseical and regregressive to attempt to send people back to countries they have never been too and it would also enable me to travel to almost any country anyway because of how diverse my ethnic background is. Also americ would therefore go back to the native americans because they were the first people here and white people would in your model go back to the countries from which their ethnic background is from. You are literally advocating for deporting yourself. This simply does not make sense.\n\nCorrection why would black people accept to be a group only to be attacked since white people have nonstop targetted black communities over the entire course of history in the US. Black people fighting back is only more recent compared to the actual history of how long white people have done it to them. Black people make up such a small percent of the community and yet their numbers percentage wise are getting decimated more.\n\nThe point about me talking about what counts as whites is because of you talking about the laws. Only two ethnic groups counted as white but you were missusing the term to say everyone thats counted as white nowadays. Either way the argument is pointless because you are not going to be able to strip away everyones rights anyway.\n\nwhite people all throughout US history have made organizations based on race so what if a black group does it a few times at this point.\n\nAlso i don't get the point in using other countries in your argument when many of the ones you mentioned have taken in many muslims/arabs/refugees/etc.\nThey are not all white anymore nor do they care to be.\n\nAlso the progeny argument now applies to everyone so...\n\nI don't know what you are talking about when you say \"america is for americans\". America is filled with americans. Americans are anyone born in america and most of the population are american. Your racist views don't change the fact that the law sees these people as american no matter how much you may dislike that.\n\nAlso the founding fathers would actually love america as it is now adays. Its far mroe advanced and refined than it was back then by far, we have plumbing and bathrooms  better food preservation, airplanes. There are so many things they never had.",

Say you were to theoretically get what you want and all white people somehow got everyone else out of america. Genetics wise when certain alleles that become too common in gene pools and get constantly bred into each other it screws up a persons genetics and more birth defects occurr and this was provenin history by a royal family that kept interbreeding with distant relatives. Their bloodline thinned most of them didn't live long and then the last person left ruling the kingdom was literally mentally disabled. He was too inept to run the kingdom and ended up dieing young. This could also be the same reason why male pattern baldness and other illnesses that pass from father to son generationally. I would not be surprised if it is somehow related to the alleles because of thinning bloodlines.\n\nEven without genetics entering play, if we say you got what you had wanted hypothetically you would be adovcating for sending many people back to countries they have never been just based on ethnicity. You would be splitting their families up. You would be sending massive populations of people back to a country that doesn't have enough landmass to hold them all in some cases because of how some populations have exploded since they have had that room to grow in other countries such as the US which makes it physically impossible to send them back and would only contribute to even more immigration back into the US because those countries could collapse economically under the unmaintainable population burden.\n\n We should discuss how to move foward with everyone, not how to divide people more. Dividing people is what created all these splits to begin with and we should try actual acceptance for a change. Now adays most of america has mixed families with parents that have lineage from many different countries all around the world. People are extremely diverse except for a select few pockets scattered in different cities around the US.\n\n Also in a few more years some landmasses are going to lose land to rising tides so we have to learn to get along wit other people now because we will be seeing a lot of them later.",

        "text": "Hahaha, are you a friend of Iconoclast? You seem awfully emotional over his shortcomings being pointed out. \nLet's look at a couple of examples of his sources backfiring on him.\n\n1. The most obvious one would be the graph he uses at 38:32. A graph he thought backed his idea that the increase of emigration of Germans was due to the migrants, when it literally indicates below the graph that it was due to the change in the method for gathering data. \n\n2. 26:29. Here he uses a Breitbart article. Which also unsurprisingly, took something Frank-Walter Steinmeier said out of context. And what a surprise, as we can see at 28:26, what he said wasn't anything like what Iconoclast and Breitbart suggested he said. \n\n3. 20:15. The Dali Lama's comments about Europe being for Europeans when that exact sentiment was shared by Kalergi, the man who Iconoclast claims doesn't think this. Also how claims on the \"Globalist Left\" were enraged by these comments when it clearly says in the article, \"users on social media\". \n\nSo there, three solid examples of sources that Iconoclast used which actually hindered him more than helped. So Iconoclast either has a problem properly examining his sources, which is a bit of an issue if he's going to create this sort of content. Or he simply doesn't care and has no problem in manipulating his sources in order to make it look as though it fits in with his narrative. As we clearly seem him do at 42:04 when he takes things Kalergi said at different parts in his book and sticks them together in order to create some sort of quote that echoes what Iconoclast has been trying to say. Like a child in arts and crafts class. Either way, it's not exactly good. At least Three Arrows has the guts to actually list his sources so people can check what he said, unlike Iconoclast. Another reason I like this guy. \n\nSo, if your previous comment is anything to go by, I look forward to reading your equally mature response. You seem like the sort of person who doesn't let their emotions get the better of them.",

Eitherway, if you want to find any alt-right content, you'll either have to go on Bitchute or some forum, which proves my point? \nAnd we're talking about Iconoclast, (hope my comment doesn't get removed, lmao the irony again), a channel that was pretty much just conservative?

It's because you fuckers have invaded my entire country with tanks and armed soldiers only there to kill and destroy infrastructure and completely try to subvert a movement towards even marginal democratic socialism and a syndicalist market cooperative economy, as was proposed in the Prague Spring by Alexander Dubček, thus leading to the stamping out of any sort of economical or cultural innovation and forcing us to follow an era of stagnation until the Revolutions of 1989. which led to the Velvet Uprising in which we overthrown the hardline regime and switched towards democracy, although since nearly all enterprises were rigidly planned to a tin by the government and there wad barely any entrepeneurial spirit to speak of, they quickly became overshadowed by competition in the global market and couldn't keep up, thus most of em went bankrupt and our economy went to shit after shock therapy was forced on us, leading to stark corruption (As MANY politicians here are Husák's children and former communist party officials), massive stagnation of infrastructure and technology, a drastic lowering of average wages (60% of Slovaks here live on 500 euros a month or even less, depending on if you have any congenital disease or pre existing condition that bars you from working, such as Glaucoma or paraplegia), rise in homelessness, radicalism, almost zero trust in the judiciary and police, and of course, the mafia getting high level seats in the government by SMER-SD and killing journalists in cold blood just to keep it hidden. \n\nThanks a lot, Tiglath, for supporting a ideology that ruined my country and haunts our generation to this day!",

It takes a very big brain to unironically think calling someone “belligerent” and “jingoist” somehow refutes an entire ideology with hundreds of years of philosophy supporting it. “Being a fascist” oh please, you lefties constantly play non white identity politics and justify the moral imperative of “diversity”. The moral imperative on “diversity” is just a euphemism for artificially replacing white people, in the name of “equality” removing them their privileged status in society. Ya white people are Constantly reminded of our privilege, and in a way are told to be shamed of it, and to endlessly accept non white tribalism and celebrate while condemning white identity politics. Eventually there is going to be a backlash, even big brained intellectuals like yourself should be able to understand that calling someone a “fascist” isn’t going to work for very much longer.",

What keeps nationalism somewhat in check instead is mostly accurate portrayals of WW2 and Nazi Germany in school, Holocaust Denial being illegal and using Nazi symbolism such as the Hitler salute being both political suicide as well as also illegal all combined with nationalism being strongly and rightfully associated with Nazi ideology.",

(A similar thing happened to \"Jedem das Seine\" which is also a much older quote that doesn't have any inherently \"bad\" meaning but got tainted by Nazi association.) Now, it certainly makes sense to criticise the thought behind the \"essen\" quote - but on its own, not because it may vaguely sound like something the Nazis could have said.",

        "text": "@olitomceliet2245 Dude, get off those \"red pills\" sometime and actually take the time to reasonably compare reproduction rates globally. The UN conducts studies and makes it findings available on their site. What you will see is that it is an natural phenomenon connected to wealth and general wellbeing to have fewer kids as we have every expectation now that they survive childhood which is not the \"natural\" norm as well as general security. This is a trend that manifests in all humans. Birth rates in Hong Kong, South Korea or Japan for example are following the same trends as in the West. Balkan countries with growing stability also began showing this trend. It has stopped growing in the Maghreb region especially in middle-class families. Just wait for the new Malaria vaccine to be implimented and see how the rate slows in African countries if one of the biggest child killers in the world is brought under controll. Globally, the birthrate is only exploding in perpetual crisis regions like  Subsaharan Africa and South America as well as South East Asia and India, all states without the inhibiting factors like state supported birth control without social and religious clamp-downs\n\nIm kidding.\nIf you had any respectable knowledge about interpreting demographic studies you wouldnt espouse overdramatised bullshit by extrapolating a single datapoint into a trend, that is unscientific. Especially considering that in Europe the general birth-rate is stagnating, not shrinking, so yeah while we have to carry the overgrown baby-boomer generation growing old now the population generally is stagnating.\nThat is far from any extinction claims. Germany as one of the richest states in Europe and therefore weakest in reproduction f.e. is squarely at a boundary of healthy reproduction rate of 1.6 children per couple. We are just not growing, and will have lots of old people to pay and feed by a smaller younger generation, thats it. A fallout from overgrowth (which is why we call them baby-boomers after all).\n\n Far from the fact btw. that there isnt an scientifically recognised category what constitutes white- and blackness as a race (we only deal in perceptions) and where the boundaries between those categories are. Is people intermarrying genocide? Do you count mixed-race looking offspring as black? \nMaking your perceived results rather sketchy... And shows where you place value in this discussion. You change the datapoints to fit your worldview, not the other way around \n\nFace it.\nYou fell for scaremongering, nothing more.",

There is nothing wrong with being proud of your own heritage, especially if you have contributed towards it.  What is happening now is that we are being made to feel responsible for the deeds of our 'leaders' and therefore we must somehow 'pay' by being displaced and then ridiculed by people who probably have no concept or appreciation of the sacrifices and hard work of our ancestors and of the current generations.  Until I hear people on the Left calling for greater diversity in Africa, Japan and China, I remain unconvinced that we should simply roll over and accept that we, as Western Europeans, should have to accept the demographic shift we are experiencing.",

        "text": "Donald Trump Sry, but just a few thoughts. Because this culture identity talk makes me angry.\n\nWaht if we are all indiviuals and your \"racial consciousness\" is made up bullshit?\nWhat if the identity of states like Germany isnt based around genes or ethnicties but around constitutional ideas and ethics? Isnt that what the US and its melting pot is about? And maybe, just maybe, we Europeans are sick of some f*cking insecure US cunts who tell us we should stay their little ethnic history theme parks for them to point their ancestry to- while in actuality our constitutions state that anyone can be a citizen if he adheres by them? That calling yourself a \"nationalistic patriot\" is the last resort of anyone who has no real argument? That a lot of Germans might take pride that while our country was destroyed time and time again it is still so prosperous that people want to live constructive lives here? That our countries ethnical makeup has a complicated history like anyone elses, and that what our identity is is our choice and our choice alone?\n\nThat the homogenisation you cry about is born from humans adopting the cultures, ethics and traits that benefit themselves the most, not the ones they were forced upon by their ancestors? That it is madness to force yourself to live like your ancestors if it is your life and yours alone?\nThat without \"globalisation\" aka a higher pace commerce and information exchange you'd probably be still sittig in a cave on the other side of the planet? If you would know anything about cultures you would be aware they arent monoliths. They are in flow. They adapt. People fulfill the needs they have. The globe adapts to a global reality. \"Globalisation\" in itself is just a reality like the flow of time. It isnt fair, and exploitation of \"the third world\" is a reality, but singular national approaches wont change this. \n\nSo please spare us from this identity bullshit, the only one trying to force identity on people are those who speak of forcefully preserving them. I am confident enough to say my identity isnt based on the country I am from and who I am is not dependend on who my ancestors were, those fuckers are dead and have no right to demand anything of how I live my life, I'd rather go with what is most effective and provides the most joy for me individually and my peers, so thank you.

I think it went back three generation or so, and counted every German who has at least one relative which immigrated to Germany - and that study counted Germans who moved from former German territory to \"new\" Germany after WWII. So basically everyone who had a Silesian ancestor suddenly had \"immigration background\". You can imagine how hilariously high the percentage was.",

        "text": "Feon83 Africa isn’t as extreme as your saying, only a few countries are torn apart by ethnicity, most violent countries have a history of first world countries meddling with their politics and extracting resources while the country falls to pieces. One of the most notable examples is the Rwandan genocide but the two major ethnic groups had been separated as the superior and the lowly by the Belgian colonists not the peoples themselves. This created the conflict that would later result in the genocide. Han Chinese do make over 90% of China’s ethnic make up, however the other ethnic groups are subject to forced integration (uyghrs are a current example) so this might be skewed somewhat. Anyways as a Ghanaian and has been there many times, ethnicities virtually only matter to the older folks (the people who lived when the country wasn’t even founded) and Ghana had the benefit of little western meddling at the beginning of the actual nation (besides the cia funded coup that was thankfully later peacefully resolved) so they are relatively doing okay. Most states aren’t failed simply because of ethnicity and religion, it’s due to a combination of western powers fucking over the various groups in Africa sometimes by turning them against each other so they won’t prohibit the western powers from getting raw material. It’s like the largest most fucked up “look over there! (Steals something)” instance in the world.",

If history tells us anything it is that different ethnicities don't live together all too well if they differ too much and/or if the unification went without their consent. \n\nMulticulturalism of the kind we see today is wrong, because it creates conflict in otherwise stable societies. Is this conflict justified? More often than not, no. But does that mean we should push through multiculturalism anyway and breed this conflict? No, it's a destructive force in our societies and never was anything but a bad idea. \n\nMulticultural societies are supposed to form NATURALLY (yes, they historically worked like this, for example Rome becoming a multicultural hub because of its grandure, fine. There are many examples of influential cities and places becoming multicultural, this is natural), not by actively importing people. ESPECIALLY not when most of the citizens are against this. This is asking for trouble. And you can create the conflict and afterwards argue that the conflict is not justified, but it's still your policies that created the conflicts. Like how we can blame certain African countries for their illogical ethnic disputes ravaging their countries... but it really was just us Europeans shoving them into one country within their consent. This is how humans work, accept that and stop this dumb idea of artificially created multiculturalism. It creates nothing but trouble.",

        "text": "@MK-qb7nj first lets start with some statistics. Germany has 83.02 million inhabitants of wich 11.23 million are \"non germans\". I put non germans in quotation marks because people with only a migrational backround also count in this statistic. That means someone half german and half french is counted as non german. \nSo we see 13.53% of people living in germany are per definition non germans. \nNow lets look at these 13.53%:\n13.21% of these 11.23 million are of Turkish origin. 7.72% are of Polish origin and 6.22% are of Syrian origin. The rest are f.e. from Italy, Irak, Geeece...\nSo the largest group of non germans makes up 1.79% of the total population (these are just my calculations, the highest number I found was 4.2%). The second largest group comes from one of the most cristian countries possible. \nIf you use the \"worst\" predictions possible still 72.29% of germans are ethnic germans with no migrational backround. That looks like the majority to me. (And a big part of non germans are still from european countrys like Poland and France).\nBut you still have a point. Ethnic germans have less children than people f.e. from Turkey. But this is only on the case in the first generation. The longer they live in germany the closer they get to the average german. \nNow to the cultural aspect. It is fascinating to see how Muslims celebrate cristian traditions like Fastnacht. In fact religion is becoming less important in germany and all over the world. I'm not saying that I like that this is happening, but you have to see the good sides. Due to this german traditions are celebrated no matter what religion you are. And due to the Denkmalschutz old cathedrals and churches will be cared for and our traditions will live on. \n\nSo what policies or laws would be useful? Motivation of Mothers to get more children. Thats the only one that could \"help\". Do you know who also motivated mothers to have as many children as possible to protect the german ethnicity? I hope you do. \n\nI hope you now see that we have no crisis here in germany. You are right germany is a very special place and many who want to move here soon find out that it might not be the country for them. \nWe live our culture and the imigrants do not change us, we change them (in a cultural sense).",

But even if it doesn't (what is highly unlikely) it would take roghly  a 100 years of no change to reacg 50% non german population. And at that point germans are still the majority. \nYour dystopian fantasies are just that: dystopian. There is no great conspiracy to overrun the western world with refugees. There was a refugee crisis and germany took most of them in. And still at the worst 75% of us are german. \n\nAnd another question. How do you distinguish between a french and a german. Or a polish and a german. Or if you couldn't see his skin colour, how would you distinguish between a refugee that lived in the north for years and speaks perfect Norddeutsch from a german. You couldn't because these people change when they live in germany. Mob mentality. If the majority celebrates a culture the rest will start to. And this is exactly what you see in germany. \n\nDo you know which people are most afraid of refugees in germany. Those that live in regions with the fewest. \n\n\"There are too many of them\".

It really depends; I guess there would be people who self-identify as Germans, but only in round about the fitst two generations after the country desolves. Most people, I bet, would regress to the state of the late 18th century, where nobody in their right minds identified as German, but as, for example, Bavarian or Hassian (it was like this for the majority of European history).\nBest example is Austria. Austria is what you'd call culturally German, Austrians speak German, they're white, Austria used to be a part of the Großdeutsche Lösung. Still, neither is Austria part of Germany nor do any Austrians identify as German; just as I'd say about the people of a split-up Germany.\nNow, that's not the answer you'd want; you'd like me to just say \"of course there still are Germans\", and in fact you could just continue to call the people of the German states Germans; that is an empty signifier though. It's as if I started to call the French people Gauls. Sure, there is historic precedent to do so, but isn't it silly to call someone something they themselves wouldn't call themselves?\n\nI want to clarify to you: I don't believe in your batshit insane racist ideas of Volk. Why would I, or anyone else? Especially in regards to Germany, where historic precedent shows to what your way of thinking leads.\nWhy does the populace need to be bonded by blood?

Nothing. The blood flowing through them is still the same. Names, cultures, traditions - they all change in time but the blood remains. Maybe not in the same place but it does remain\n\nIf people of Catalonia believed in what you believe then they would not even exist as no one would consider them \"Catalonians\" distinct from the Spaniards in Madrid (nor would they \"call\" themselves Catalonians)\n\nWithout blood how can we ensure our people survive once they are conquered? Once they are oppressed, their language forbidden to use, their traditions stamped on and their lands subjected to (insert country name)ization?\nWhen all this happens, your blood - your ethnicity - is all you have left to unite behind, to live behind \n\nIf we go by your example then Latvians wouldn't exist\nThey would just be Russians, distinct people in the past who gave themselves over to the russification forced upon them because they don't actually exist if their nation doesn't\n\nWhat separates the Austrians from the Germans? Besides some slight genetic varieties on the borders of Hungary and the Slavic nations nothing. They are the same. They can call themselves Austrian all they want but even they know the truth: they are Germans \nAfter all it is why they were considered to be a part of the German homeland up until the entire fiasco (to put it mildly) that was ww2\n\nYou say my ideas of Volk (which had been used for centuries) are crazy but the truth is that creating some global conglomeration of vastly different people is a recipe for disaster \nBesides, the Volk is supposed to be exclusive \nIt is supposed to be for Germans and Germans only, for that is the only thing they have to call theirs, just as the Poles have their own Volk, the Swedes etc\nIt is this Volk that has kept Germans alive when faced with occupation of their lands after all \n\nUltimately though, this entire convo with everyone here is pointless\nOur beliefs are set and nothing any one says can change them",

Also the official numbers by the German government regarding the immigration after the infamous \"border opening\" in 2015 show that of those ~1 Million immigrants ~300.000 stayed in Germany and this after just 2 years.

The Book of Revelations clearly states that there will be no peace in that area until the Second Coming of Christ, but the other historic thing to remember is that Britain and France were the ones who divided up the region after World War 2.  All of Europe and the Western world agreed to recognize Israel, while practically all of the Middle Eastern world agreed to deny their existence for decades; some still do, like Syria. Then, they all waged their own wars against this new nation of Israel, and every few years its borders change a little bit. I would highly recommend watching Knowing Better's video about the Middle East and the many conflicts there, in his video \"Constantinople (Not Byzantium)... and the Rest of the Middle East\".",

The author of the Forward article notes that other 'white\" people have been excluded from \"whiteness\" and treated as second-class citizens in the past, like the Irish and the Italians. The GlobalGrind piece actually says that whatever identity Gal Gadot chooses, that is her place to say and no one else's, and that however she thinks of herself, it should not affect the quality of the Wonder Woman movie as a good feminist milestone. Also, you are projecting a label onto me because I am not a \"self-destructive radical left-winger\". I am an independent, and I vote mixed ballot every year. From the looks of it though, I bet you believe in the \"cultural marxism\" conspiracy.",

        "text": "Ragnell123 I would argue that the ones who see race as the only thing that matters in America are minorities. White people have the lowest in group preference of any race in the country. Diversity isn’t a strength either. Look at any city in America, or even anywhere in the world, with high diversity. The quality of living is substantially lower, and there is more crime. When people are from radically different backgrounds, they are less trusting of each other, and because we let so many immigrants into the country each year, there is no reason for a lot of them to assimilate. Even most black Americans, who have been on this continent just as long as whites, haven’t assimilated into typical American culture. This is very divisive, and an America that consists of different groups of people fighting for power will not be sustainable. No country has historically be successful when there isn’t one group of common people in charge. I don’t hate anyone or any group. I think it would be great if everyone could get along, but historically it has never worked, and as the last 2 months have showed us it probably won’t work here either. \n\nAs for why America becoming less white is bad, it’s because of what I stated before. When people aren’t assimilating, it changes the framework of this country. Most immigrants don’t even support the founding fathers, as you can see by the tearing down of statues. They typically vote against core American principles such as freedom of speech, right to bear arms, etc. The Democrats support immigration for this reason, while Republicans support it because of the cheap labor they provide. You can’t expect non westerners to uphold western values. And yes, white people are the true Americans. Yes, Native Americans were here, but it was European settlers who built the country.\n\nWhite people are already being persecuted. They are the only group that it is socially acceptable to mock and ridicule. A white person can have their entire life ruined for saying something slightly offensive on the internet, when at the same time, racism against white people is allowed no problem. The BLM movement likes to act as though they are fighting “systemic racism”, while at the same time they are backed by every major, institution, company, and politician imaginable. Systemic racism exists in America, but it definitely doesn’t apply to minorities,",

If you actually look more closely at these areas, they are not spread evenly, rather there are black neighborhoods due to redlining for example. This is what happens when you look at stats and demographics without any sort of context to them. All your claims are completely baseless. How have blacks not assimilated into american culture? How do you define “american culture”? It’s clearly just down to being white or not being white. You’re gaslighting trying to make it seem like diversity is the cause and innately humans cannot get along due to cultural differences, which is completely ridiculous. The only reason this is the case in some areas is due to systemic oppression and persecution in the past and in the present day of these minority groups. Your argument basically boils down to, “Well if these non-white people would stop living here, then there wouldn’t be as much crime because there wouldn’t be any minorities to attack and persecute.” Your thinking is honestly revolting",

The amount of questions they get correct generally remains similar, or is predictable, no matter what set of 100 questions is chosen out of the 10,000. IQ scores are also the best predictor out of all available methods of predicting lifetime success of an individual, however it may be defined.\n\nYou say you don't have a survival difference if we assume your intelligence to be higher.

I wish I could testify that it was a uninformed and xenophobic minority but it appears to be the prevailing notion (though not overwhelmingly so) among the white working class. As frustrating as it is to endure this level of willful ignorance, it is a powerful political weapon, silently assented to if not endorsed by lower management, and exploited with increasing subtlety and sophistication as you move up the management hierarchy.  It is important to ridicule bad reasoning especially when adopted to reach a preordained conclusion, but it is important to recognize that narratives not constrained by reality are cheaper and most easily edited for the passions of the moment than carefully constructed evidence based arguments.\nAs inconceivable as a Trump presidency seemed in the fall of 2016 (even from the cynical point of view that the plutocracy would never entrust their fortunes and futures to a narcissistic simpleton), fear, straw man barbarians at the gate, and the promise of return to a gentler time when everyone knew their place has been the successful formula to threaten the world and the planet.",

However, it is entirely reasonable to expect and assume that living millions of immigrants from places where clan identity is strong, won't fully integrate and assimilate. That, I think, is a prerequisite. Germany is not an Anglosphere country where integration and assimilation is seamless. Turks on average have not become Germans, they live in their own communities, often separate from the majority - in a poll conducted few years ago majority of Turks said that they do not feel affinity or connection with the German identity. So projecting in to the future, I expect ethnic(religious) minorities to thrive separate from the overall German social and culture sphere. Is that a genocide? No. Is that good? No.",

It is beneficial for people belonging to a group with higher intelligence and certain phenotype to only marry those people belonging to a similar group, not a distant group. This is especially the case when the results of race-mixing are easily observed. Race-mixing should be societally shunned, or at least heavily regulated.",

But that would be, by my estimates, about 3 million people compared to about 37 million living here so yeah... no.\nWell, I just looked it up and it turns out even if you count all the Polish diaspora, there are only about 20 million people of Polish descent around the world outside of Poland.\nAll that being said - I hope we drop the inherently racist and classist categories of natonality and ethnicity in the future and get back to the idea of a stateless world where all people are free and there is no more expoitation.",

To the first standard, all countries in the world are diverse. But in regards to the second definition, many countries have issues with racism and discrimination. In Nigeria, things fall apart (reference intended ^^) when one population feel completely left out in their own home country (Igbo christians in the south, Muslim Fulani in the north). This usually happens when one group is privileged but acts as if it isn't.",

She is currently studying in Sachsen-Anhalt, a more right-wing part of the country. She isn't dark-skinned, and so is often 'mistaken for a German' by people who know her first name only. She recently had a group project with two people who have been German for many generations, Markus and Lisa, and one who was born here but his parents weren't, Ahmad. Markus had only seen the names on the paper, first names only, and decided he would not work with Ahmad, despite never having met him. He was fine with the two girls, but not Ahmad. Until they wrote their full names and he saw Lina's last name. He then refused to work with her as well and turned very rude, and only reluctantly worked with them under threat of failing class.\nLina also works in elderly care to pay for her expenses. Many elderly are racist there and she had people tell her that there are 'too many immigrants' working there (they should be happy anyone is willing to help and wash them and change their diapers imo) to which she only nods and when she's finished smiles and says \"If you like me to do more, just ask for Miss Arabic\" which usually shuts them up.\nThey also have one woman who knows Lina's not born here and still always complains about 'those dirty immigrants' to her and especially about one coworker, who is, as per my friend, 'an angel and as German as it can get', who has been German since at least 3 generations, but has a dark skin. The old woman calls her the 'black devil'. She loves my friend, though, because 'even though she's an immigrant, she's not one of *those*'.\nCharming people, really.",

Far be it from me to tell anyone how to feel or what to believe but personally while I understand the feeling of belonging one might get from identifying with a certain group the shear amount of overinflated importance it is put on it is just ridiculous. Nationalism is bad in my view but it does not worry me as it can be easily countered. What does wory me however, is the religious groups because often times the most fundamental members are impossible to talk to at all and tend to have violent tendencies which are only held back by law of the land and if a party that does not share ther views is in power or even if it is still has a strong opposition. \n\nTake Monte Negro as an example. They had an election recently and the people that won are pretty much absolute Orthodox Church loyalists. They are not officially in office yet and they already started threatening minorities with violence if they don't leave the country. In general my main worry is the tendency of such groups to simply act like no laws or boundaries exist at all and that their faith gives them the absolute right to do whatever they like without consequence.",

The elite can fund any ideas for the future with the false promises of humanitarian reason and no race, religion, culture or tradition can stop them from imposing their wills. Just like how today not a single billionaires, philanthropist can be easily accused or jailed. Elites are ones to be considered as out of the matrix of the society. If people can be denied on their identity wither it's race or nationalism, then nobody will nor nobody deserved to be called by such things, this is just low key erasure of heritage and past through hatred and guilt.

In Qatar for instance the immigrants outnumber by far the Qatari. Of course this doesn't mean that immigrants are treated well, on the contrary, and this is a huge issue, but according to white supremacists the natives have been 'replaced'.\n\n- South Africa has a black majority population with also white and asian minorities, being one of the african countries with the most immigrants.\n\n- Many sub-saharian migrants come to Maghreb, and unfortunately they face discriminations. I even saw a morrocan guy fearing of being 'replaced' by sub-saharian population as most north african countries are close to achieve their demographic transition whilst sub-saharian countries aren't. Their own version of this stupid conspiracy theory of great replacement, I guess.\n\n- By the past, Turkey welcomed many immigrants from the Balkans, and many arabic, kurds and blacks live in this country as well.\n\n- Even Japan, which is an homogeneous country, decided to welcome recently more immigrants due to its ageing population.\n\n- Technically speaking, South America is a very diverse continent with more 'mixed-race' than any other part of the world. Less than half of Brazilians identify themselves as \"white\", yet I never saw complaints about 'great replacement'. Perhaps this is just a matter of time before we finally accept it in Europe, I hope...\n\nFurthermore, describing Europe as only 'white' and 'christian' is kinda reductive. What about Albanians, Bosnians and Chechenians for instance, being mainly muslims? And I can guarantee that without non-European immigrants, other European immigrants will receive prejudices instead of them. In the past (and still now) Eastern and Southern europeans suffered from discrimination. Irish and italians immigrations in the USA were considered as 'white niggers'...

As for non-anecdotal evidence, I don't have any, but the burden's on them, right? And I have yet to see some evidence that supports their claim that campuses are extremely left, or dominated by SJWism, or that a PC culture is present on them. They only present single incidents as evidence. It seems more and more likely to me that they're making this much bigger than it actually is (much like the things in the video).\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm against PC-culture as well, it's bad. But I'm less and less convinced that such a culture exists on campuses. And the claims and arguments that they do exist start to become oddly similar to the claims that rape culture supposedly exists on college campuses. Which I would also despise, but I don't see either really happening.",

        "text": "@swordofdamocles5846 I understand, and I disagree with the content of that kind of speech. But it's important to notice that this is what free speech means, especially on campuses. A degree in sociology need to tackle those issues, regardless of their truthfulness. It doesn't necessarily mean that they defend those issues. Much like I, a capitalist, if talking about capitalism, will also mention its flaws, while also mentioning the advantages of communism. It doesn't mean that I am in favour of communism, or that I think it's great. And it's important that I allow communists to speak out and make their point, so I have more ammo to tell them how stupid they are, wink wink.\n\nAs for quotas, I'm am against them personally (at least in the long term), but I also think that people oversimplify things. There are pragmatic reasons for companies to use those quotas, going well beyond SJW talking points. Just because SJWs are also in favour of quotas, it doesn't make someone who is favour of quotas an SJW. Much like the Nazis privatising many sectors of the economy does not mean that anyone who's in favour of privatising some of those sectors is necessarily a Nazi. Someone who's in favour of universal healthcare might still be a capitalist, someone who cares about environmental politics is not necessarily left-wing, and someone who is for closed borders is not necessarily right-wing.\n\nIt seems obvious to me that feminists would be pushing those quotas, but it's not obvious that those quotas being implemented means that feminism was the reason for it. For almost any action and policy, you will find a group supporting that action or policy. But that action or policy being implemented does not mean that it's been done in response to that group's activism, or that it was the main driving force behind it.\n\nBut let me just say that I'm just as worried about SJWism as I assume you are. But I'm just not sure I'm seeing it as this massive problem that many people keep claiming exists. I see it occasionally, sometimes there's a bigger impact here or there, much like with racism. But I don't see any huge impact on our culture, and I think that most people who you rationally explain why SJWism or racism is bad, will agree rather quickly.",

What I meant is that I don't see PC culture the way, as you precisely pointed out, the Anti-SJW crowd is presenting it. The sort of group that would participate in some mass hysteria and have huge influence over politics and culture. Not to say that they don't have any, but I don't see the larger impact. That is, again, how I perceive it.\n\nI would add to that that if there is a culture I'm more worried about, it's what I'd describe as the bandwagon culture, or maybe the outrage culture.

I'm not an advocate of cultural politics since politics should be about straight-up things like education, economic welfare, workforce organization and such things, but reducing German culture to some foods and customs is only possible if you ignore a lot of stuff going on in this country, just like everywhere else. One cannot over-estimate the impact of German philosophers on the world, for example, dating to this day and age. If there is one thing I've noticed in the last couple of years it's the sheer amount of impact folks like Nietzsche, Hegel, Marx, Heidegger, Habermas, Adorno etc. have on the political discourse in the entire west and beyond. And this is only about philosophy. I'm far from being a cultural supremacist but there are some interesting things going on in Germany intellectually.",

        "text": "thesatanic6 Not interested in getting into a \"debate\" so you can have the last say in this. Many of the things said by our friend the Iconoclast were pretty questionable from the start, and Three Arrows refutes most of his unfounded claims. I don't know what you mean by \"evidence of racism\" but (I'm making a generalization here, but given your antagonistic response to my comment I'm going to assume you fall into this boat, forgive me if I'm wrong) it seems like a lot of you far-right folk think that nothing is racist, hell, I get the impression that even if a black man was lynched by a gang of neo-Nazis today you fellas would start talking about black crime statistics. I take issue with first of all the almost baseless claims the Iconoclast makes to fear-monger and his comments throughout implying (and sometimes downright pretty much stating) that to be German you have to be white and Christian. So he cares more about (in Three Arrows words) \"some weird blood purity\" (keeping Germany white) than preserving German culture. If the culture is preserved, who gives a fuck about race? And also I doubt the Iconoclast would be able to tell the difference between a native German and some Frenchman that immigrated to Berlin to \"\"\"leech off hardworking Germans\"\"\"\". So yeah, it's a race thing. And the constant \"Jews rule the world\" implication is pretty bigoted (and a bit frightening I'm honest) to say the least. Also, if \"real\" Germans are white, then almost no one in America is a \"real American.\" But I guess we're not talking about real ethnic genocides here.\nI'm not saying there are some assimilation problems facing Europe. But look at America for an example, most of it's older immigrants (Asian, Indians, Europeans) are a benefit to it's society. It's unrealistic to think immigrants will suddenly become culturally German the minute they get there.",

House and apartment pricing have been radically manipulated by foreign investors that have no desire whatsoever to live in the country, but eagerly purchase dozens of empty units to inflate the price and sell later. Church Street looks like it's been hit by a zombie apocalypse every time the Pride Parade finishes up, because nothing is ever taken care of by the participants. Toronto, officially, has a worse commute time than Los Angeles. If you don't speak Cantonese or Mandarin, don't even bother trying to get services in North York. If you don't speak Pashtun or Farsi, you're going to have difficulty in Brampton. Toronto is a fucking waste-case. People are dropping dead on the streets from Fentanyl overdoses. Toronto, and its voters, have assisted in destroying the province of Ontario as well as its rural communities- believing its flourishing and doing well, while assisting greatly in making Ontario the most debt-ridden province in the entire world- even California, the most broke state in the USA, has less debt than Ontario. California, whose population is quite close to that of the entire country of Canada. Toronto barely ranks as an international city. While crime across the country has been steadily falling since the 1990's, Toronto's crime rates aren't nearly as safe as you'd like people to believe.",
