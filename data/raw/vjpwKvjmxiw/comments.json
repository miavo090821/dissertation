What they are looking for is another Bill Clinton, someone who belongs to the democrats, but can embrace policies that are popular on the right and sell them to the center.  \n\nIf history repeats itself, they'll find their standard bearer, and go back to being anti-war and pro-liberty, while the republicans take power and fail to appease the center-right, leading to another democrat that appeals to more leftward sentiments like Obama.  And then the cycle begins anew.\n\nI really don't want this to happen, it's not the worst possible outcome but it would be extremely disappointing for the Republicans to take back power and start behaving like its 2000 again.",

My problem with the upper echelon of the Dem party is the cover-up that went into this for years that the debate just exposed. Related to this, I think the biggest risk that Democrats have from a strategic perspective is disgruntled voters. People who will never vote for Trump under any circumstances, but lack the motivation to vote for Biden considering his condition. I think that this debate and the continued media debacle surrounding the will they or won't they replace Biden is it is creating apathy among the party and especially among the young bloc of the party that already felt alienated due to Biden's support for Israel and his original campaign promise to support the younger party members which has been broken.",
