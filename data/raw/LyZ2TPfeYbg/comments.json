The shoe gets a lot of air time in the docs because that’s evidence the police had, among many of the salacious details of the crime scenes, and the police will be most of the talking heads. The police in this particular case have the audacity to disparage what actually lead to the capture of the guy they were trying to catch, which kind of makes the story perfect to me.",

        "text": "There was a good Rebecca Watson video on this. She's a science communicator, and she had noticed that in research, DV is often a prelude to shootings. Much like most people, she made the mistake of assuming that that arresting these abusers would would help prevent more attacks. (Much like you said, the average person doesn't have any idea of how we can protect ourselves without cops because that's the only system we know in America.）\n\nShe did more research though, and it turns out policing/imprisonment only led to repeat offenses once they were out again, on top of the issue of the rampant rates of DV from police officers.  So she looked at other forms of community dv reform. There was the Duluth Model, where DV perpetrators were taught that their DV was the result of feeling entitled to power and control as a result of societal messaging, which wasn't very effective at actually creating change in the person. You can know that your actions are wrong and controlling but still struggle not to do them, as anyone with an eating disorder will tell you. And changing a mindset you've been taught by society your whole life is really hard.\n\nA method that did help with reducing physical DV was a method called ACT, which is based on the therapy technique of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. The idea is teaching people to recognize the links between their thoughts/emotions and behavior, and then how they can acknowledge the thoughts that lead to negative behaviors while still choosing to do the better action. You don't need to change your entire worldview, just learn how not to be controlled by it if it's hurting your life. Therapy and rehabilitation, while not feeling like \"justice,\" pretty consistently is shown to reduce recidivism.",

If police didn’t have this power the position would attract a different kind of person and there would be less killers among them, no?",

That being said such individuals are propably much rarer than the media portrays.

    "text": "I used to be into True Crime serial killer stuff, mainly since my late wife was into it.  One thing that really struck me about pretty much all of them is just how useless the police were.  So many of these shows, as well as interviews with the real-live investigators, try make it all look it's a battle of wills, dedicated super-smart detectives tracking down a genius super-villain.  Fictional programs like _Criminal Minds_ , or dramatizations and book about real life like _Mindhunter_ .  But when you watch the actual, real documentaries and read about what really went on, the thing that really characterizes these investigations from is Incompetence and Indifference, from top to bottom.\r\n\r\nRecently tried to re-watch a documentary on the Yorkshire Ripper, and that was the perfect example.  The police did not care at all about the murders of prostitutes; it wasn't until Suttcliffe started killing so-called \"respectable\" women that they finally put serious effort into tracking him down.  Along with that, the detectives very quickly decided they knew why he was killing, and how they could stop him, and refused to change their minds despite mountains of evidence they were wrong.\r\n\r\nIt's also really disturbing how many times they catch the killers and let them go, because they don't see the bleeding obvious right in front of their eyes.  Or when it's painfully obvious that the killer is actually working with a partner, and they just stop looking after catching the \"one perpetrator responsible\".  And, of course, there's the problem of police departments across jurisdictional boundaries refusing to work together or share information.\n\nFrom what I've seen, the only serial killer I can think of who truly appeared to be somewhat clever was Zodiac; and the reason his killings stopped is probably because the police busted him for something else, somewhere else, and never noticed who he was.",

It's why I rarely chime in on serious topics like abolition, because I just don't have the expertise or life experience to have an opinion on either which way, despite me being anti-cop broadly speaking.\n\nThere are people out there who outright believe, for example, we need religion because then \"where do our morals come from?\" As if to say, without the looming threat of eternal damnation or some other retributive punishment, people will commit acts of cruelty for the sake of it. Not everyone has a sob story that turns them to crime, some people are just that broken and will never seek help through their own volition, even in a hypothetical world where mental health care is free.\n\nNevermind that people can commit crime anyway even if they may technically be a believer, which is part of the crux of the abolition argument that the prison complex isn't as effective a deterrent as much as it is another avenue of exploitation.\n\nThe answer is seemingly that we just need to take our defense and security into our own hands? Because functionally, that's what many Americans have to do since they cannot rely on the police anyway.

        "text": "Most people are fundamentally good, and most crime is a direct consequence of the environment that \"criminals\" are forced to live in.  It requires money to survive in this dystopian hellscape, but our wise rulers do nothing to ensure that safe, meaningful, well-paid work is available to everyone.  They still need to survive, though, so we get drug dealers and robbers out of that contradiction.  \n\nFor the people who are \"lucky\" enough to make enough money to barely survive, they exist in a situation of constant stress over finances.  If those people have children, they will not have the time or patience to be good parents.  Abusive or neglectful parents, which can describe parents of any socioeconomic background - see Elon Musk and his father, are more commonly impoverished people who lack the time to properly raise their children, a very fundamental part of being a human or most any mammal.  Childhood abuse or neglect is one of the most powerful predictors for whether an adult will have a cluster B personality disorder - Narcissists, borderline, and antisocial (psychopaths, colloquially.) \n\nThe way to effectively address crime would be by making sure that everyone has enough money to survive comfortably, not criminalizing mental health problems like substance abuse, and providing support to parents to make sure they are providing for the emotional needs of their children.  That will never happen under a capitalist economy because capitalists need extreme poverty to force people to work terrible jobs for inadequate pay, which means more profits and returns for shareholders.  In the USSR, crime rates were much lower than in the United States.  Corporate media would tell you that is because they had an authoritarian government, while they had a much smaller prison population both in absolute numbers and as a percentage of the population.   The reason their crime rates were lower is because the people of that federation fought a civil war to install a government that prioritized human life and wellbeing over the financial interests of a small percentage of parasites.   Just look at how crime, addiction, and suicide exploded in Russia after the US was able to successfully overthrow the Soviet Union. Eastern Europe became the world capital for prostitution and pornography (both adult and child) in the 90s because they had a massive, new population of people who were desperate to survive after having the rug yanked out from under them.",

Ironically, that would put us somewhere around the average amount of work being done by Medieval peasants, who had to give a smaller fraction of what they produced to the aristocracy than what is kept by business owners.  For every dollar your employer pays you, they keep between one and four dollars of the value your labor produced.  The reason von Mises and \"Austrian economists\" are so fetishized by dipshits like Ayn Rand and Libertarians is because von Mises, an Austrian aristocrat who thought that the lower classes needed to be paternalistically guided by their betters, gave intellectual-soumding rationalizations for their greed.",

If you put energy and effort into another plan, but give up on or change the plan that already did not correct the problem, that is not \"giving up\" or nihilism. However, refusing to acknowledge consistet results over time and associating them with a planned state: policing is planned, not a static concept, we police in a way or another, it is engeneered to address a problem and produce a result. Do we have a system that perpetuates and increases inequality consistently over time? If so, its a result of its design. A design that can be changed.",
