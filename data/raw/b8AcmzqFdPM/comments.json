        "text": "Know whats even more hilarious?: leftists getting frustrated for never managing to properly, through any substantive means, articulate the claim that JP is in any way morally, prescriptively or pragmatically the equivalent, or the adjacent, of the far right or the National Socialists. Seems like they can only beg the question or point out ridiculous non sequitur such as what other people asked him about half a dozen times in his hundreds of lectures and interviews that spam for more than a decade, even before he got famous.\n\n\nAnd in that regard, 3 Arrows' entire attempt at doing exactly that, at the end, is absolute evidence of his limitless stupidity: \"Peterson criticizes an ideology that is ruining society. The Nazis criticised an ideology that they thought ruined society. Ergo Peterson Nazi\". Its nothing short of that low IQ mental gymnastic.\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nIts propagandistic. Nazis criticized an entire demographic, and tied to it a false ideological premise (something the wokes do all the time against certain demographics, but someone like Peterson never does that, as he explicitly denounces \"identity politics\", he criticizes positions, not tying them to identities of demographics).\n\n\r\n\r\nAlso, lets not forget that communists and progressives like 3 arrows also have their equivalent of the \"jews\" = the rich (but if we go to cultural marxism territory, then it can be the whites, the males, the cis, the colonizer, etc.). 3 Arrow's criticism is empty and can be applied to himself or pretty much to any ideological position that stands to have any opposition to any other ideological group. Its actually worse since wokeism notoriously presupposes biases and malice to people based on gender, race, etc. (CRT is a clear example of this). \n\nAnother cardinal difference being ignored is how Peterson can demonstrate how what he criticizes 1) exists and 2) is wrong. The Nazis never managed to demonstrate the existance of anything they called \"jewish bolshevism\". \n\n\r\n\r\nAnd lets not forget: 3 arrows' greatest dishonesty here in equating Peterson to \"nazi\" is in that Peterson's approach to solving societal issues is through debate, dialogue, scientific enquiry, and a fair treatment, without coercion, for all involved. This was not the Nazi way. 3 Arrows' side however is very quick (and intellectually weak) to proptly call for the use of force or a means of cancellation against their ideological opponents, much like the Nazis. 3 Arrows is closer to the Nazis than Peterson could ever be, his cherrypicking notwithstanding.",

        "text": "⁠@KyussTheWalkingWorm- Peterson is even a pretty bad source for info on Jung.\n\nHe does with Jung what he does with everything: he cherry-picks the bits he imagines support his diatribe-du-jour (bearing in mind that, as an opportunist, Peterson contradicts himself frequently, depending on what drugs he’s consumed for breakfast and who he has beef with that day), then he pounds those bits beyond recognition into a shape suiting his ends, and then he discards the big bits contradicting him.\n\nBut despite Peterson, Jung’s writing has proven useful to us, both in social science and in psychology … albeit, in heavily-modified form. (It has after all been over 100 years since Jung first set pen to paper.)\n\nArchetypes may have no literal, palpable reality (a fact to which Peterson seems oblivious), but they’re a useful early conceptualization of what we might now call cultural tropes, personal narratives anchored in cultural tropes, socially-constructed identities, and so much more. Today we still employ these notions in untangling people’s behavior, whether individually or as a group.\n\nIt would be wrong to take Jung as the final authority on anything without first reading all that’s been written about his work in the intervening decades, but it would also be wrong to discount him entirely just on account of some quack taking a shine to him. So please don’t let Peterson sour you on Jung.\n\nJung is deeply problematic — he was deeply anti-Semitic, for one thing — and he got most of the details and even some of the fundamentals catastrophically wrong … but, like the equally-problematic Freud, in the broad strokes he was onto something, and there is a lot which can be salvaged from his work and put to use today.",

They didnt wanna waste resources on them and instead divert them to the military since they were literaly being fucked from every side\nAnd people love to bring up the eastern front well news flash they were enemy populations yet they still managed to recruit the baltic peoples into the waffen ss, enlist some ukrainians into policing. But all that wouldnt help much because the soviets almost burned everything important, rural villages wont help shit, and then theres the whole youll be shot if youre a commie by nazis or by your own government if you defect so the citizend were fucked either way\n\nPeople love to bring up these pseudo-facts to make the nazis appear stupid as if theg were complete idiots to feel intellegant or to try prove a point, no they had thought out plans it just happened that the allies out-resourced and out-witted them, to the axis ww2 was a war of resources extermination: all or nothing",

Two central points that Peterson argued are missing, namely Peterson's psycological review of the Hitler's belief in cleansing and the fact that Hitler was manning the army with old men and young teenagers, without considering requesting any form of peace when they were clearly losing the war for more than two years.  \n\nTrump scares me, his art of the deal shows a brinkmanship that could readily go all in on a whim.

They acquired tons of that by forcibly relocating civilians from all over their occupied territories into the industrial areas of Germany. Their problem was a lack of resources (oil and oil products being the most prominent, but not by any means only). This severely limited the production capacity of Germany even after it tried a total mobilization of all labour after 1943. I mean even though they in  theory controlled the industrial and human assets of most of continental Europe Germany was outproduced not only by the USSR and the USA but even Great Britain! So even if the Nazis had considered exploiting the concentration camp population primarily for production (and not seen hard labour as yet another means of extermination) it wouldn't really have yielded significant results.

This is the issue, it is the core of the illogic being highlighted. Why is this something I need to point out more than once? How many people were exterminated do you think? There are many figures to source on this, but let's just go with a nice and tidy \"lot's\". How productive do you think those millions were after being murdered? I'd wager not very. It's a very simple scenario, and just pointing out that SOME of that resource was put to use doesn't even approach a satisfactory response to the observation that the majority was purposefully wasted, during wartime no less, and even in the face of abject military failure. To focus on irrelevant details like \"yes, but he did use SOME of the undesirables\" is missing the point entirely, and strikes me as a red herring. Hitler was losing, he had a virtually limitless supply of slave labour, and he killed off the majority because ultimately he saw them as vermin.\n\nStrategically, it was an indisputably ILLOGICAL waste of resources IF one's goal is exclusively martial victory. I don't agree with Petersons claim that Hitler's goal was therefore chaos, I think that's a skin deep interpretation he's using to bolster his lecture points, but the fundamentals are here for anyone to see. Corpses do not work, and Hitler wastefully created many when he _could_ have made workers. The fact that he did make _some_ is irrelevant.",

Those of us in the centre can disagree with each other but we don’t want to eliminate each other, in fact we see value in having those with opposing views around to offer other points of view that we might learn from.  The far left and right are black and white thinkers, conspiracy believers, attributing malice and manevolence to the “opposition”.  And when you do that, self defense demands you attack and eliminate the danger from the other side (who are all “liars, traitors, cucks, elites, Nazis, socialists, bigots, misogynists” anyway so not worthy of consideration).  You demonise the opposition and then you “rise up and defend what’s right” and try to silence and eliminate them.  Far Left and Right feel the same way and do the same thing.  It’s something in their brains.  You NEVER want to let the far left or the far right get in charge of your country.

        "text": "@Niko0902 No, it was widely used. Adam Tooze makes this point in his book, The Wages of Destruction, which is considered the currently foremost work on the Nazis economy both before and during war. He showed, for example, that Speer's supposed \"armaments miracle\" was not driven by some magical rationalization of previous inefficiency, but by robbing the necessary coal to massively ramp up steel production from other sectors of the German economy... a process which included drafting millions of foreign workers to slave (and die) in the coal mines. A key factor in the German war effort which was utterly evil policies towards the conquered people that were very much rooted in Nazi racism. Slave labor allowed the Nazis to go well beyond what they would otherwise have been capable of through the ruthless expenditure of human life. This conclusion is unsettling to us, since we like to have what is evil also be what is ineffective, but the unfortunate fact is that foreign slave labor allowed significant increases in Nazi productivity at a time what the Germans simply had no other viable labor source. Their women were out farming, and their men were off fighting. Although foreign labor was never as efficient as German workers, the Nazis literally worked them to death for nothing.\n\n\nSimilarly, the death camps served a disturbingly practical purpose. The Reich faced very real food crisis after 1942, which could have crippled it had it not settled on the solution of killing large numbers of conquered peoples. The extermination of the Polish Jewry for example was not just an ideological insanity - it also had the practical effect of freeing up large amounts of food for the German war machine, which would have otherwise been faced with famine. Had Germany ACTUALLY tried to feed all its conquered citizens, it would have collapsed years earlier.\n\n\nSimilarly, the butchery of Slavic people was also not some unfortunate by-product but a necessity in order to make the invasion logistically feasible. The Germans simply didn't have the transport to transport the necessary foodstuffs to their troops while also maintaining the shipments of ammo and fuel necessary to fight the Soviet Union, so the Nazis resorted to the obvious solution: have the soldiers descend upon the civilian population like a horde of locusts to strip all food from the Slavic locals, dooming them to starvation. Since this would naturally inspire a lot of resistance, the application of terror in the form of mass slaughter then became a necessity as part of this requisition of food resources.\n\nThe brutality of the Nazi policies often hides the threadbare shoestring Germany waged WWII on. Germany was in terrible economic shape at the start of the war, and carried it through only by exporting much of the hardships onto its victims. This doesn't render it any less evil mind you, rather I find the opposite: the fact that Nazis chose to embark upon a war fully knowing and okay with undertaking these measures is horrifying from a moral standpoint, but it does demolish the argument advanced by Peterson that the Nazis being \"nicer\" (or, in his case, supposedly \"more pragmatic\") would have been able to get more out of Germany's resources in the same situation.",

We're talking guns that didn't look broken, but when taken to testing they would fire one shot and then it would be clear that it was a waste of steel.\n\nThe slave labour turned out not to be that useful especially during a time of material shortage. Many of the guns made by slave labour were entirely unusable as a result they cost more than they were worth.\nA chilling amount of WW2 is purely economics.",

The Fars at both ends of the spectrum USE authoritarianism to control the masses to achieve their aims.  The Centres of both use argument, debate, appeals to reason, requests for cooperation to achieve their aims.  The aims of the left and right are the same; a better world.  They disagree on methods.  But the Far extremes will use coercion and force to achieve those aims.  “The workers seizing” is a description of force.  In that you are probably correct that it’s an aim of the Far Left.  The centre left would say something like “the aim is workers achieving control of the means of production peacefully through the consent of the people”.",

This process is not antithetical to reason or logic. In many cases, such responses are very rational. For example, if someone beats your child in front of you, a rational response is distress, anger, or rage. The mind dives into a panic and causes your heart to race, adrenaline to spike, and brain to launch into a fight or flight instinct. There is reason and logic behind you becoming very emotional. My point is, rationality and emotionality are not mutually exclusive.",

As for your example, I wouldn't call the behavior you described rational. It would be an emotional and completely justified response. And please don't get the wrong idea, I'm not saying either is better than the other. Emotions are there for exactly the kind of situation that you described, because they, for example, make us protect our offspring, a very important thing hardwired in our brains.

But that still doesn’t prove such actions or emotions as irrational. You’re assuming any base animalistic response is irrational. They are not. In fact, many animals make decisions strictly on the determination that such actions will improve their chances of survival; Which is very rational. Some male animals will even consume their offspring because they are hungry. Some female animals will fight predators to the death to protect their offspring. Both actions can be construed as rational. Humans have evolved from animal like states and developed the power to think and comprehend complex emotions. That doesn’t mean we have excluded our ability to act rationally from our ability to feel emotions.\n\nYour first point argues that feelings and emotions are opposite in nature because of how ancient societies determined them to be.

Even the idea to privatize it would have made no sense in the mindset of the 30s as they were in power and so as it was a public program, they were de facto providing it.\nIt was the prime idea of Bismarck when he created it in the 19th century, he did it to take voters away from the Socialists and so reduce their influence nevertheless Bismarck cared for his class (aristocrat land owners) and its survival, not the lower class.\nWe are talking about Ideologies but also political parties and taking in account political gain by just letting in place a popular program didn't bother that much a populist party and this whatever they truly believed in that program or not.\nActually that's similar with the infrastructure (autobahn) program, Nazi propaganda boasted it helped to put back people at work, forgetting the 150.000 people at maximum who worked in a program which started in 1933 were not fully paid until 1938, the conditions of work were awful, the economy was recovering even without this autobahn program and full employment was reached thank to armament and heavy industries.\nSo I don't where you see I am trying to paint you as a Nazi apologist or that the Nazis were a bunch of nonsensical people.\nFinally in a broader sense, this discussion revolves around the idea about what a state should do or not. In the 30s the idea of a a state providing services was popular in the majority of the western world. Whatever you or me agree with the role of a state is not the point, today after years of quasi propaganda, neoliberal, libertarian, etc. the trend can be reduced to a mantra, the smaller the state the better.",

You can't.\nBy the way, you brought up the post second world war issue of public vs private healthcare \"they kept the healthcare system already in place which in my book reads as if they are in favor of it rather than privatizing healthcare.\". \nSo if I were you, I would be careful to put blame on me for something I did not say or topic you raised first.",

But they can use the \"small government\" thing to justify cuts to education, welfare, consumer and environmental protections and so on.\n  \nBut \"small government\" isn't historically a right-wing or a conservative position. So being in favour of the government doing stuff it isn't currently doing doesn't make an ideology not-right-wing, nevermind left-wing. There are right-wing ideologies that favour strong or weak state power, and leftist ideologies that favour strong or weak state power. It's an independent axis.\n \nAnd anyway -- the Nazis were in favour of healthcare only for people who met their eugenic standards of racial purity and fitness, and in favour of death for everyone else. Nazi medicine was an arm of their eugenics programme, not public healthcare. It's an entirely different proposition from \"anyone who needs healthcare should get it\", which is what the left supports.",

There isn't diminishing returns on police spending, it actually seems to be positive(COPS program lowered crime in cities that got funding).  it's the aggressiveness of police that's the problem. Being anti-war is the most uncontroversial take that spans the entire US political spectrum. Selective service, who gives a fuck?

When you betray your wife, that should be a bad thing, we've always had that in our society. It's not really a \"system\" per see, but it's more like a culture, or a common monogomous behavior.\n\nHe was arguing that people are becoming less and less monogomous and more polyamorous with time in the last decades, which would cause women to be even moe hypergamous than they already are(I don't fully agree with him here, but whatevere).\n\nSecond, women ARE usually hypergamous, this is a FACT! Knowing this doesn't make you an incel. They are usually into high status/popular/richer men. Most men simply cannot keep up with their highest standards(This doesn't mean they can't find a partner though, of course, but they probably won't be able to attract super high quality women). It's no wonder woman usually say that 80% of men are not very attractive.\n\nWhat MAKES YOU an incel: hating women, blaming them for your loneliness, or somehow believing that they should change for you.\n\nObviousy, no woman will ever get close to you if you have the above attitude, and JP does not spread this belief, and he condemns any hatred towards woman.\n\nJP's ACTUAL advice: Stop blaming others, take responsibility for your problems, became a man, and only then you'll be able to find a woman.\n\nIf you read all of this and still somehow think that JP likes incels, I don't know what else to tell you...",

I think it's more about preference instead of shoulds and don'ts, meaning: we as a society should prefer monogamous relationships in the long run, especially because it's better for children(I believe that's what JP means with the word \"enforced\", not a very good word though).\n\n\"I don’t think one necessarily has to hate women in order to be involuntarily celibate.\"\n\nWell, yes, but I believe resentment and incels are usually very close to one another. It's not hard to find a girlfriend, so if you're REALLY having difficulties, then you're probably doing something wrong... resentment might be it.\n\nI think the biggest problem with incels is that they won't settle down with any girl that isn't a 10/10, they are very entitled.",

It was and still is in its majority the church of not only the WASP but the elite of the WASP population in America, which explains its high IQ, on the same argument of Jordan Peterson - which to a certain extent I am ready to grant - their high IQ is a product and what produces their status as elite: they are the best of the WASP selected all throughout the 19th and early 20th century into being the \"top WASPs\". Of course, in this day and age, with the ever decreasing role of religious denomination in social life the elite WASP is no longer necessarily a member of the Episcopal Church. That means that \"episcopal\" is a dog whistle for \"elite anglo saxon whites\", and they ARE in higher numbers than jews in America, and even if they were not, let's say they were the same population as the american jewry, 60% of graduate students in Harvard are jews. Jews occupy, in the top, spaces that are way way way disproportional to their population, REGARDLESS of IQ",

Next he'll probably be on about how the Nazis never actually murdered a single person, and it was really the Allies' fault that people imprisoned in mass-execution camps starved to death. Then probably something about Jews putting fluoride in vaccines to turn frogs gay. I wouldn't pay too much attention to people like this. They're mostly just easy marks for a political movement whose leaders are habitually lying charlatans, because they're too uninformed to spot obvious lies and fictions. \n\nAs far as other points here, the video is not saying that Peterson is an anti-semite or a Nazi apologist. \n\nHe's just saying Peterson doesn't understand what the Nazis' true motivation was. \n\nPeterson is trying to make some weird religious argument about Original Sin or whatever, even though it's plainly evident to anyone who has ever actually studied the history that the Nazis did what they did simply because it was what their ideology told them to do. \n\nI.e. if you're the kind of person dumb enough to believe that \"race-mixing\" is some horrible thing capable of destroying entire civilizations, genocide is just the logical outcome of believing that. \n\nThe Nazis murdered people just for being members of \"inferior races\" because the Nazis were a bunch of racists. It's really not very complicated, and it's not some kind of mystery either, because the Nazis said that this was exactly what they were doing and why they were doing it, in explicit statements to the public, and books and newspapers they published, over and over and over again. \n\nThe Holocaust is simply what happens when a bunch of racists are able to gain control over the institutions of government in a large modern industrial nation-state with a powerful military. \n\nPeterson is trying to psycho-analyze them using old, outdated Freudian theories combined with his own religious beliefs, as though there was some big mystery about why they did all this, but he's severely missing the point because there was never any mystery about it at all. \n\nHe's guilty of ignoring the obvious simple facts of the matter because he's more interested in pushing some convoluted esoteric personal theory about it, even though his theory makes far less sense than what the simple facts clearly show to be the answer to the question he's asking. \n\nSo, no, Jordan Peterson is not a Nazi, nor do you have to be a Nazi to be a fan of his lectures. \n\n\nYou just probably shouldn't be giving any credence to anything he says about history, though, because he seems to have a habit of pontificating about it without even having a basic understanding of what he's talking about. \n\n(For instance, there's another video on Youtube by someone else called \"Jordan Peterson Doesn't Understand Post-Modernism\" that I think explains another case of Peterson's grievous historical ignorance pretty clearly.)",

        "text": "Shara Manasgael Then do your own homework. Show how his argument is wrong. Or, do you have skin in the game? Peterson is a performing seal who likes being centre stage and being paid for his performance. He loves it so much that he will comment on stuff he really hasn't got a full grip on, and his favourite psychoanalyst, Jung is one of them. I went and researched Jung and Nazism. Guess what I found? Jung is problematic where Nazism was concerned because of his adherence to racial psychology. He actually admired Nazism during the 1930s because their pseudo-mystical mythology behind their concept of the racial inferiority of the Jews matched his own theoretical model. He thought the Nazis could bring about a reinvigoration of the spirit of the Aryan people in general, and in Germany in particular by repudiating the 'Jewish' psychology of Freud. He characterised Jewish psychology as being problematic because it focussed on the psyche being instrumental to individual agency. Meta influences were less important. Jung took the opposition position.\n He saw individual psychic behaviours were determined by race. He then lionised the Aryan psychology of being strong, noble and proud. Even though he repudiated Hitler at the end of the decade by calling him psychotic, he never gave up on the idea that race was determinative. He criticised Jews for their \"unchristianess\", and thought their individuality and lack of national identity at that time, made them pathological as a race. He claimed to be bemused that speaking of a \"Jewish\" psychology would be considered unacceptable. In these terms, appeased Hitler and was an anti-Semite. Peterson talking about Nazism and not mentioning Jung's role in legitimising Nazism is interesting. He didn't mention it, because it would have perhaps undermined his thesis. But I think his thesis about Nazism is bit obvious and doesn't explain why it gained traction. If his goal was to explain why Nazism was evil from a psychoanalytic view, he would only get a C- from me. Moreover, his \"order and balance\" thesis is putting the cart before the horse politically. Order and balance comes after the decision how resources in a community are to be divided. Yes, a strong man offering order and safety can influence that decision, but he doesn't explain clearly how the masses come to accept the decision and it's consequences. You may agree or you may not, but I wouldn't rely on one perspective to do my thinking for me.",

And he clearly said, *all* organisms in which serotonine exists  were biologically determined to form simple hierarchies based on violence. He claimed that to be inherited from lobsters and said, that lobsters were our ancestors. I don't think there was ever an idiot in academia as stupid as Jordan Peterson. Here is the transcript (comments inserted by me):\n\na) \"The reason that i write about lobsters is there's this idea that hierarchical structures are a sociological construct\"\nThat's not an idea but a fact. The latter is the definition of the former. \n\nb) \"of the western patriarchy\"\nWhat has the west to do with this? Nothing. Noone ever said that patriarchalic structures were invented by the west.\n\nc) \"and that is so untrue,\"\nHis own strawman is untrue. The rest is a fact.\n\nd) \"that it's almost unbelievable.\"\nCry me a river!\n\ne) \"And i use the lobster as an example\"\nLobsters (being territorial) aren't even examples of typical decapoda, which is the family they belong to. They aren't examples of anything in the vertebrate branch.\n\nf) \"we devulged from lobsters in evolutionary history about 350 million years ago. Common ancestor.\"\nWe didn't. In that context \"devulged\" isn't even a term. Lobsters aren't our ancestors. Lobsters didn't exist 350 million years ago. Lobsters ancestors 350 million years ago weren't our ancestors, and 350 million years ago there were no common ancestors of humans and lobsters.\n\ng) \"And lobsters exist in hierarchies.\"\nThey don't. Lobsters are solitaires who don't engage in cooperative tasks. They have neither parental investment nor bite impediments. The term \"hierarchies\" in scientific papers about lobsters refers to size(=age) related probabilities of observed behavioral choices in conflict.\n\nh) \"They have a nervous system attuned to the hierarchy.\"\nBullshit. Due to their bad eyesight lobsters can't even identify specimen of their own species correctly. They identify risk, not status.\n\ni) \"And that nervous system runs on serotonin just like our nervous systems do.\"\nBullshit. Serotonin is one of many components and it doesn't work in lobsters like it does in our nervous system. Serotonin controls status defined as state of mind, not status defined as social standing.  \n\nj) \"And the nervous system of the lobster and the nervous system of the human being is so similar\"\nRidiculous bullshit. Neither is the biochemical setup similar, nor are the neuronal structures similar. \n\nk) \"that anti-depressants work on lobsters.\"\nBullshit. Working means manipulating the amount of serotonin present. That doesn't mean this had the same effect on lobster behavior, and even if it did, that doesn't constitute similarities between lobster colonies and human societies which there aren't any.\n\nl) \"And it's part of my attempt to demonstrate that the idea of hierarchy has absolutely nothing to do with socio-cultural construction\"\nLol... Jordan Peterson completely retarded? To this point none of his claims is true, and none is in any way related to human societies.\n\nm) \"which it doesn't.\"\nNothing to do which it doesn't? That happens when acting and posture occupies a brain so completely that there isn't enough oxygene left for the language sector and/or the logic sector. \n \nn) \"I'm saying that it's inevitable that there will be continuity in the way that animals and human beings organise their structures.\"\nWuhahaha... Read that multiple times! Do it! Read that retarded shit! Since when organize all animals the same way, since when do they organize like we do, and since when are all human cultures the same? Is that idiot totally retarded to deny the differences in human societies over time and/or over distance?\n\no) \"It's absolutely inevitable.\"\nWhat?\n\np) \"And there is one third of a billion years of evolutionary history behind that.\"\nBehind what? Lobsters evolved at least half a billion years from the last common ancestor which was sort of a roundworm. That means: THEY CHANGED A LOT! That doesn't mean, they stayed the same, and his stupid \"third of a billion years\" is just an arbitrary number and not even related with any fact at all. You know what: We evolved over half a billion years from that same ancestor too. Makes a difference of a billion years between us and lobsters. Jordan Peterson and his uneducated fanbase are the only idiots on this planet who didn't get it.\n\nq) \"That's so long that a third of a billion years ago, there weren't even trees.\"\nSo long. Sooo long. Just like the genital he dreams about. What does this idiot think he is talking about? Nothing in humans is that old. We changed just like lobsters changed, and countless other species did.\n\nr) \"It's a long time.\"\nYou don't say... Has anybody ever seen an idiot in an interview bragging about how long an unrelated timespan is he made up?\n\ns) \"You have a mechanism in your brain that runs on serotonin\"\nYou don't say...\n\nt) \"that's similar to the lobster mechanism\"\nNot the case.\n\nu) \"that tracks your status.\"\nNot the case. Status isn't a perception at all, and biochemical mechanisms aren't related to status (in terms of social standing), neuronal connections are. Those are variable and in charge of biochemical stimuli. He must have an extremely bad education (maybe homeschooled) and a tendency to make up extraordinarily childish fantasies about the brain and how it works.\n\nv) \"And the higher your status the better your emotions are regulated.\"\nBullshit. There is no difference in serotonin levels correlated with whatever this canadian quack thinks status is or status means. However his own favorite human examples (Hitler, Mao, Stalin) represented highest status (in hierarchical terms) and we know how well their emotions were regulated. \n\nw) \"So as your serotonin levels increase, you feel more positive emotion, and less negative emotion.\"\nYou don't say... what the fuck has this to do with lobsters or the different types of structures of human societies? Nothing. However state of mind means feelings, not hierarchical position. He failed at comprehending his own mother tongue when he tried to quotemine abstracts on serotonin and lobsters.\n\nAnd all that delivered in that ridiculous posture as if it wasn't just a collection of stupid sentences pulled out of his own arse... What Jordan Peterson delivered in this interview is the stupidest bullshit ever recorded in human history. Thanks to Cathy Newman who did a fine job of leading this impostor to the point where he destroyed the rest of his reputation once and for all times.",

        "text": "> \"What makes it a \"fact\" what all hierarchies are sociological constructions?\"\nThe semiotics of both terms make it a fact. Sociological means processed by means of mass communications and construction means artificially ordered by one or more subjects.\n\n> \"Where are you getting this information?\"\nLiving with some hundred decapoda for years. And ofc. studying them. That includes to get familiar with scientific papers about them. \n\n> Also, none of the absent characteristics you listed in lobsters (if this even is true) would indicate that they don't live in hierarchies.\nLol. It doesn't seem you have the slightest clue waht you are talking about. A hierarchy is in all cases a type of social order organized by behavioral patterns specific to a species and in effect maintaining its survival by at least maintaining one factor infolved,  i. e. collective hunting or at least food distribution, care for youngsters or collective defense. None of that exists in lobster colonies. Lobsters confronted with swimming objects, predatory or non predatory fish or other lobsters behave the same. Vectors of movement, object size and distance determine their behavior. There are chemical modifiers though but such do not exist for primates. \n\n> \"There have been multiple studies confirming that injecting lobsters with serotonin aids their ascent in a dominance hierarchy.\"\nYou're regurgitating Peterson's wrong claims. There are no lobster hierarchies beyond the paperwork of the observers who counted confrontations and retreats in lobster tanks. Laymen  like you and Peterson don't understand scientific terminology. If you measure the height of some mountains and sort them by height in a table on paper that doesn't make them live in social hierarchies!\n\n> \" it's important to note that serotonin correlates with the social standing of lobsters\"\nIt doesn't. There is no social standing. There is no known sort of group behavior. Lobsters don't organize in groups. You don't even understand what Serotonine does. It reflects the ratio of drive and resistance dynamically, and that means: it isn't linked to social aspects at all. Serotonine reflects when you try to start your car's engine or when a child pushes against a desk with its head. That doesn't make the desk and the car dominant or subdominant social entities. Peterson is an idiot of epic proportions who doesn't even known the most simple of facts about Serotonine.\n\n> \"Humans and lobsters do have common ancestors.\"\n\nThat's not the point. Peterson claimed that we and them  diverged 350 million years ago, which isn't the case. 350 million years ago our ancestors already were fully developed vertebrates with four limbs and the same basically blueprint we share with all vertebrates, while crustaceans don't share anything with vertebrates. Their ancestors didn't even have the same traits lobsters and other decapoda share today. None of their attributes is present in vertebrates. The last common ancestor was a roundworm 550 million years ago who had nothing in common with us or with lobsters. We did not diverge from that branch lobsters represent today. \n\n> \"'I've never heard of lobsters having bad eyesight.\"\nLobsters (like all crustaceans and insects) have compound eyes, and due to their principle construction all compound eyes have poor image resolution and no focal control. The visual cortex of a lobster is basically a simple integrator capable of determining sizes and distance of objects aswell as their movements. Morphological analyze not included. Some decapoda have quite sensitive eyes but that doesn't compensate their low resolution or their missing brain complexity.\n\n> \"They may have been brutal, genocidal dictators, but that doesn't mean they didn't know how to regulate their emotions.\"\nIt is what we know about their lack of self control from their relatives, their buddies, their medical personal and others. Their behavior in certain historical situations is extremely telling. Hitler was a nervous wreck and Stalin was a paranoid pussy mostly hiding in his Dacia and praying for help from above. When the Wehrnacht invaded he went nearly catatonic for a week.",

        "text": "On what I said about Petersons argument? After reading a bit about him and watching some of his debate, it's kinda like his trademark when it comes to political discussion: simply put he cannot have one unless the person he is talking to, has the same opinion. This is especially showcased when it comes down to LGBT rights and specifically to trans and non-binary people and his straight up refusal to accept them. His argument on this stance - and I assume the clip shown here was also one from a debate about LGBT, feminism and so on, since he throws in the word patriarchy a lot, in a sort of buzz word sense here - is simple refusal. He tries to hide it behind some free speech sort of thing, but in reality the clip where he just sort of yells in frustration \"I'm not gonna do this\" is exactly what he means: Ressentiment. And especially when it comes down to these topics he portrays the left as an enemy of his, it's like the left would be some hive mind sort of thing and totalitarian in the stance, which might be true for some individuals, like you will find people with authoritarian personalities (Adorno) everywhere, the left is of course no exception, but first of all that doesn't invalidate anything and second, if you really think that they are wrong you could still debate them if you have better arguments at hand, which he ofc doesn't do as explained previously why. So instead he twists his argument around, that if you talk to the hive-minded left, you're essentially courting them and agreeing to their assumptions, that's what he means by playing the game. It's kinda like debating a 9/11-inside-job-conspiracy-theorist under the assumption, that 9/11 was an inside job, in his perspective, which implies, that this patriarchal society thing is for him nothing more then a hoax and probably a lot of other things that come from social sciences. So debating the left is for him, the same thing as giving into their arguments, which is kind of silly really, because this is not a internet conspiracy here we're talking about, but actually academics, unless you have the Thunderf00t syndrome and resent anything but natural sciences as a form of science, although I don't really believe that Peterson would say that.\nHowever his inability to discuss such matters, while hiding behind twisted arguments and straw-manning kinda discredits him as a discussion partner rather then the left, as he portrays that to be the case.",

Although either side may think that they hold the truth, with current politics there generally isn't an objective truth, so none can be had. After that a productive dialogue can begin. I think he criticizes both sides for being unable to let that guard down and open themselves up that what they hold to be true, may not be. \n\nFrom my observation, it seems that the left  in the United States is largely against dialogue. My initial inclination is due them being ill-informed. Also, the rise is tribalism in American politics is rife. Too much identity is attached to political views that the argument against one is an attack on one's personal identity, ergo a personal attack.

And while I agree that a objective truth in political discussions might be hard to find, if at all, politics don't function through what we perceive as objective truth and they never have. Politics were, are and always will be about finding a consensus. And my point here under your representation of Petersons thought would be, that he is refusing to take part in the process of finding a consensus, because of his personal ideological disposition. No matter what you think about Marx, he was right when he said, that everything is politics, because every person does have a political opinion, that you can categorize.\nIf Peterson now really thinks, that a dialogue is only then a true dialogue, when both parties enter it, with the assumption, that neither of them might hold the truth, then he is just a bad discussion partner when it comes down to politics. And not only that, he is unintentionally doing exactly what he doesn't want to happen: he is entering a political debate with a certain state of mind, that prevents him from being critical towards his own political opinions (\"I just simply refuse to do it\"). And ultimately what this leads to is him shutting down to anything that would go beyond the status quo, simply because he fails to understand one fundamental thing about political debate: and that is that there is no objective truth as in Newtons laws for example, but rather that it's a consensual narrative that the majority of the society (at least in democratic states) agrees with.\nThe challenging thin about this is of course not to be on the side that completely shuts down mentally and goes on about how much better the things were 20 years ago or so, but about being able to reflect upon yourself, to consider your line of thought being fundamentally wrong or at least asking yourself the question: \"Why does it bother so many people? Why are they thinking in the way they're thinking?\". And for me it seems that Peterson is just not able to do that or at least not able to do that very well, which just leads to silly argumentations and twisting around things and straw-manning. This is essentially what he says in the last bit, and if I think about it, you interpretation of his line of thought, makes perfect sense: He cannot handle the idea, that there is some academic evidence, in a lot of our understanding of how our societies work, that might cause a change in the status-quo and he feels like there is a political agenda printed on to that. But you know, this is nothing unusual and it has never been, John Stuart Mill was arguing about equal right for everyone in the early 19th century, that's what shapes our cultures, societies and traditions, it's nothing we're born in and can't get away from or that or that has been there for ages without a change. And yes, I mean, if you argue, that every person should have the same rights, in times of western slavery, then you're challenging politics, in the same sense various academic fields have found out, that yes, our societies are patriarchal and it has this and that effect on a individual, then yes, of course you're triggering a political debate, and if Peterson is not able to handle that, then again, it's his own inability that's holding him back and it doesn't make a good excuse, why he should not engage in a dialogue, with people, he disagrees with.\n\nWell, I can't really tell much about the leftists in the US, since I live in Germany, but I would certainly agree, that not a very small percentage of the left is very self-centered and kinda unwilling to deal with the reality of the average Joe and, yes a lot is definitely about identity.",

I have an example for this, from a debate I once had with an alt-righter on the subject of the equality of women and men. His point was: he brought up a study that talks about men and women being unequal in terms of physiology. This is mostly chemistry and Biology stuff, right. And that's completely true. That's why you have male soccer teams and female soccer teams for example. Now however this person, concluded, that because males and females aren't equal in terms of physiology, they are of course not equal in any sense at all, which is again wrong, because physiology doesn't mean that women can't drive a car, or vote or go to a university or do whatever else they want to do really. They are not inept to any of the things that men can do, just because they have to exercise in a different way then men, for example and even this is situational. And all of this, because this person didn't understand, that there are multiple definitions of equality, physiological equality is not the same as legal equality for example. And that's what I mean, natural sciences and social sciences don't conflict each other at all. No philosopher will ever debate that gravity does not exist and no historian will ever claim that H2O is something else then water. They just simply ask different questions. And if you as a natural scientist are unable to understand this, then you have a severe case of Thunderfoot syndrome.",

If you enter a debate with the foreknowledge that the beliefs you hold are not facts and objectively true, you going into that debate with a more open mind then if you going into said debate with the foreknowledge that the beliefs you hold are absolutely true, and nothing can convince you otherwise. The former would absolutely be a characteristic of an open debate and not the shutting down of a debate. You have made no argument to the latter, and I believe you actually proved my point. \n\n\nSecond I think you have misunderstood what Peterson was saying about debate. Jordan Peterson is criticizing the left for its refusal to engage in debate. Debate which Jordan Peterson is not only willing to do, but actively tries to do. What he is saying is that the left refuses such debate because in their eye, even starting a debate would mean that the left has already lost due to a belief in a patriarchal hierarchy. This idea, which can be argued false, is also inherently dangerous. As of right now in America there are a lot of people on the left that call anyone a Nazi and or racist if they are not in agreement with Left politics without prior knowledge of that person. Attempts to engage such people in debate become fruitless because the Left is not interested in debate, but rather a dangerous game of tribalism and identity politics. No matter how much evidence you have in a debate with said person, according to the left, all that is rendered moot because that person is a racist. This a character attack, based on false pretenses, which is not productive dialogue in any stretch of the means. This leads to lack of dialogue, a lack of understanding ideals, and therefore a lack of concession. So the result is an ever-so-widening of the political divide. \n\n\nAnd yes, John Stuart Mill argues that freedom and liberty should lie within the individual and not groups and social control, which is exactly, almost to a tee, what Jordan Peterson was saying in the last clip. Peterson is criticizing the tribalistic/identity politic nature of the West for not only trying to move away from Enlightenment philosophy, i.e. Mill as you mentioned, but trying to destroy said philosophy in which our entire modern culture is built on. I don't think I have to expound on such dangerous ways of thinking, I discussed it a little in the previous paragraph. \n\n\nI highly suggest you go back and not only watch this video again, but you watch a little bit of what Peterson has to say and his core beliefs. With all deference, I do not think you have quite the grasped it.",

(Sorry I've been watching hockey all day)\n\nWhen I say the left doesn't have a propensity for dialogue, I am referring to the masses, for clarification purposes. I think this because I have been witness, not only in person, but from the news, to campus protests when conservative speakers come onto their university. I think there is a misunderstanding of the first amendment by a lot of people who are unwilling to talk about their beliefs. That's not the only reason I think that many are not willing for dialogue. There are a couple youtube channels that go around to the many marches put on by the left. They interview, or attempt, to interview the participants and the dialogue is either shut down when a hint of bias is senses from the interviewer or dialogue is not even started by the march participant. To get a better idea of this, I highly suggest you watch NuanceBro's channel. He tends to stay pretty neutral and tries to work the march participants through the beliefs. It will give you a sense of the masses on the left.",

He actually said quite clearly: _\"If I even engage in the dialogue, I'm playing your game, you win\"_\nIf you were to read this sentence without knowing the speaker, you could not determine whether he's radical left or radical right. So there is no mention of \"playing the LEFT'S game\". Therefore the meaning of that sentence is completely determined on who the \"I\" is. \nThe question is how do I know that the he is impersonating the radical leftists? Good question.\nThe reason I know, is because I have watched a lot of Peterson's actual lectures, and in these lectures, he uses impersonation ALL THE TIME to help get his point across.\nHere's an example at 4:00 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGrCBM9903I\nNot to mention, it literally makes NO SENSE for him to say that he can't talk to radicals, when he's done interviews with many of them (e.g. Cathy Newman)\n\n2) If I claimed JP was wrong would he admit it? What the hell? Obviously no! You don't just \"claim\" people are wrong?! You have to explain why they're wrong, make them understand. The real question is; \"would JP admit he's wrong if he watched this video?\" The answer to that of course, depends on whether he has anything else to say/rebuttal against the claims in the video. For example, is it really true that gassing the Jews actually was cheaper than keeping them alive because of food costs? \nBut if you think JP just can't admit he's wrong on anything, you're probably the most ignorant idiot on the planet. Look up his apology to MGTOW, he DIRECTLY states how he was wrong to call MGTOW \"pathetic weasels\".\n\nYou're clearly someone who has spent no time whatsoever actually watching Peterson's actual lectures, you've just watched secondary accounts on him like this video and thought you had a good idea of what kind of a person he is based on that.

When someone already views you as a Nazi, or a white supremacist, or \"alt-right\" which are all in the same basket for the radical leftists (in the media) you can no longer hold a productive conversation. A productive conversation is an interaction that will settle both party's wants and needs through negotiation. \n\nAs Peterson often analogise, you can't \"win\" when you're married to your spouse. Who knows who started it but conservatives in the US used to \"win\" against their political opponents, but that is no excuse for liberals to do the same. Unlike a marriage you can't divorce half the population and be done with interacting with them. \nUnlike a divorce if you try to \"win\" against people, you will HAVE TO live with them in the broader society. \"That game doesn't work\" as JBP says. Identity politics isn't feasible in the long-term, it might very well destroy the society.\nSo when Peterson says you can't have a productive conversation against radical leftists (people who think you're Nazi, alt-right etc.) that is what he means.\n\nTo the radical leftists (who are often dominating western media) anyone who talks with Peterson is already alt-right. The radical leftists religiously view those who don't follow their thoughts a corruption. It is getting really bad and I don't know what else we can do other than try to convince those in the left-centre that they can't enslave themselves to the radical leftist ideas.",

        "text": "Patently and factually incorrect. Bill C-16 extends a provision to the Federal Government to penalize anyone who engages in \"Hate Propaganda\" based on sexual identity or gender expression.\n\nWhat does the Canadian government define as Hate Propaganda?\n\n2.2.1 Hate Propaganda\nCriminal offences related to hate promotion are set out in sections 318 to 320.1 of the Criminal Code. Section 318 makes it an offence for anyone to advocate or promote genocide, which is defined as acts committed with an intent to destroy in whole or in part an identifiable group by either killing its members or inflicting on them such conditions as to deliberately bring about their physical destruction. Those found guilty may be punished by up to five years’ imprisonment.\n\nSection 319(1) makes it a criminal offence to incite hatred against any identifiable group where this is likely to result in a breach of the peace. Section 319(2) makes it an offence to communicate, except in private conversation, statements that wilfully promote hatred against an identifiable group, whether by telephone, broadcasting or other audible or visible means.\n\nNow, Section 318 I take no issue with.\n\nSection 319 subsection 1, however, is of note. \n\nIt is a criminal offence to incite hatred against any identifiable group where this is likely to result in a breach of the peace.\n\nWhat does this mean? \n\nIt is up to a court of law if your speech is an incitement of hatred against a group that would result in a breach of the peace.\n\nWhat constitutes a breach of the peace?\n\nAccording to section 175.\n\nsection 175. (1) Every one who \n(a) not being in a dwelling-house, causes a disturbance in or near a public place, \n(i) by fighting, screaming, shouting, swearing, singing or using insulting or obscene language, \n(ii) by being drunk, or \n(iii) by impeding or molesting other persons, \n(b) openly exposes or exhibits an indecent exhibition in a public place, \n(c) loiters in a public place and in any way obstructs persons who are in that place, or \n(d) disturbs the peace and quiet of the occupants of a dwelling-house by discharging firearms or by other disorderly conduct in a public place or who, not being an occupant of a dwelling-house comprised in a particular building or structure, disturbs the peace and quiet of the occupants of a dwelling-house comprised in the building or structure by discharging firearms or by other disorderly conduct in any part of a building or structure to which, at the time of such conduct, the occupants of two or more dwelling-houses comprised in the building or structure have access as of right or by invitation, express or implied, \nis guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction. \n\nIt can therefore be inferred that by saying something deemed hateful to a person of a protected gender identity, such as would lead them to potentially start an altercation, I have committed a criminal offence. That is the extent and limit that the law describes within its purview. Whether or not it is actively enforced in such a way is up to the people enforcing it, but that is the limit of the law, to the letter.\n\nNow, arguably, the root of this issue lies with 319 (1) and not C-16 in general, but as the two are inherently linked, they both are problems for the Canadian public in general. The only way I would support C-16 would be after the repeal of 319 (1) and replacement of a more reasonable standard by which criminal offense can be judged, or else a re-branding of C-16 to exclude the vague term \"Hate Propaganda\", which apparently just means saying something about X protected quality of a person that might piss that person off enough to make them scream, swear sing, use insulting or obscene language.",

        "text": "Most Psychologists don't write self-help books.\n\nHow do you know what he believes? All of this is an assumption you're taking based off of one definition of the word rule and implying that because he suggests that as the title of his book, that means he is using it as a deterministic interpretation of his worldview becoming law. You could just as easily say that the reason he uses the word Rule is because a Rule requires discipline to be enforced, and all of his suggestions require great amounts of self-discipline and self-policing in order to achieve. It is not an easy thing to build new habits. It is not an easy thing to be productive and to make time to schedule among a busy day full of distractions. Doing these things however is much more likely to see you make productive use of your time and to be successful as a result. \n\nMoreover, nowhere does Peterson say you are compelled to follow what he says. He offers up his wisdom as a way to live a more ordered, structured life, in order to better achieve success. He draws upon a lot of wisdom from all of the people he has worked with, the great volume of reading he has done, and the  colleagues he has discussed with as well as hos own personal experience to make these \"rules\". He makes the suggestion you do so, because to not do so is to live a life that is chaotic and will likely involve a lot of suffering as a consequence, and as someone personally who HAS lived a life that runs largely contrary to Peterson's ideas, I can't disagree with the man.\n\nI don't know that his rules will remedy my personal situation, but they have given me a personal jumping off point to start setting my life in order and making something of myself. Out of all of that, you are the ONLY person who I have ever met who takes a completely literal interpretation of Peterson's rules. You take it more literally than even he does, by all accounts, because you seem to be the only one claiming that to be the case.\n\nI finding ridiculous, bordering on conspiracy theory levels of lunacy for you to be suggesting that it is his intent to force the public by law to follow his self-help book, and to compare it to Mein Kampf of all fucking things. The fundamental difference you seem to be forgetting is that Hitler advocated using chlorine gas on the Jewry, and Peterson advocates using Clorox on your bed sheets. You'll forgive me for missing the page where Peterson claims that the Dragon you need to slay is the Jew, and the Princess is Europe.",

        "text": "Of course he takes what he writes literally, he's a clinical psychologist who has spent years of his life helping people get their lives in better shape. That does not mean a set of general ideas that he has passed down in the form of a self-help book necessarily means that he intends those values to become a one-size fits all solution to absolutely everyone's life that he would see instilled as law if given the chance, which seems to be what you are implying he desires, based off of nothing more than the ill-fitting definition of a word you are slapping onto the title of said book.\n\nYou are actively engaged in implying that he is an autocrat on the scale of Hitler because he has offered up a self-help book for people to help get their lives in order in order to be more successful, and are using your own interpretation of the word rule to try to prove that's what he intends, because according to you, there can be no other interpretation of what he intends by it. Do you not fucking comprehend how ludicrous that sounds to literally everyone? Do you not actually realize that you are trying to force your own interpretation of that word as being the only possible interpretation of it as the basis of this argument you're making? Does that not come off to you as autocratic?\n\nBut since you're clearly busy sperging out over the word rule and what it means, I went ahead and got something for you, since you seem to be a little busy trying to paint JP as the next Hitler.\n\nhttps://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rule\n\nGo ahead and read off Definitions 1a, then 1c, then 2a 1 and 2, and then 2c for me. Ask me if any of those definitions wouldn't also suit Peterson's 12 Rules For Life, and if any of them do or could fit in place of the assumption you've made, then ask yourself why NECESSARILY that your assumption that he must be implying an autocratic demand over everyone MUST be the only possible scenario. \n\nAnd when you're done that, maybe you take some time and consider why Albert Einstein, a man who had to live with a handler for the majority of his life in order to get anything done, shouldn't serve as de facto proof that messy people can be successful. But just in case you're still too busy hunting secret Nazis, I'll do you the favor of filling out this train of logic for you.\n\nFor one, Einstein occupied the top 5% of the bell curve for human intelligence, and secondly, he made his career successful BECAUSE he was so overwhelmingly intelligent, IN SPITE of his disorganized life. 95% of people don't approach being anywhere NEARLY as gifted as that man. Therefore, how can you honestly advocate a lifestyle for the majority that only a very gifted minority who CARRY THEMSELVES on those gifts are likely capable of accomplishing, and even then only with help?\n\nAnd no, despite you continuing to strawman him, Peterson has never claimed anywhere that cleaning your room PREVENTS failure. He has said that being orderly and organized, and making better use of your time and space makes you MORE LIKELY to succeed. The most likely strategy to succeed can still fail, and he has never once acted or claimed otherwise. He has stated several times that he casts no aspersions on how absolutely miserable life can be for a lot of people and states clearly that his advice is no perfect panacea to live a gilded life. If anything, he has said that, at best, his rules and self-help advice will maybe be able to help you keep things together during the worst times in your life, like a funeral, and to perhaps help you to be the rock that your family can rely on when something awful happens in life, and that, if nothing else, that seems to him like an admirable and reasonable goal to aspire to.\n\nSo in closing, how about you quit putting words in his mouth that he never said, quit attributing things to him that he has never implied, stop pretending he's some secret Nazi-esque figure planning to force people to \"clean your room, bucko, or else\", and stop being a massive hypocrite. That you have the gall to accuse me of strawmanning you when not only are you actively doing exactly that, but you cannot even demonstrate how I have strawmanned you at all is laughable. If you can even provide one place where I've taken something you've said out of context in order to build an argument you aren't making and use that as the basis to try to refute your argument, I will eat my sock.\n\nGo ahead, I'll wait.",

        "text": "I never said to ignore the others, YOU'RE THE ONE POSITING THAT YOUR DEFINITION MUST BE CORRECT, USING YOUR DEFINITION AS PROOF.\n\nI'm done arguing your little tautological loop. You haven't asked Peterson for his thoughts on this matter, you'd rather sit here and imply that he is as bad as Hitler. And if it was your intention to simply use Adolf Hitler, the most hated and reviled figure in all of human history to date as a convenient example of a man who prescribes a worldview to others, absent of the connotations or connections to Nazism, then you are either incredibly naive or incredibly disingenuous. You cannot sit there and say \"Well, I only meant to compare him to Hitler because Hitler also wrote a book that told people what they should do.\"\n\nYou're completely ignoring the contents of both books to make such a vague generalization and the only reason anyone would ASSUME you are using Hitler for an example instead of, I don't know, maybe a John Edwards, or some other quack peddling nonsensical self-help advice to prove your point, is because YOU WANT PEOPLE TO MAKE THAT ASSOCIATION. Don't sit here and play coy like you don't know what you're doing by invoking that name.\n\nDon't sit here and try to downplay the parallels you're attempting to link to the man after the fact. Nowhere, not even once, has Peterson EVER advocated for the rights of others to be impugned upon. Mein Kampf was literally a book calling for the end of the international Jewry. The two are NOTHING alike.\n\nIf you simply want to challenge the rise of a cult of personality, then where the hell were you to critique Obama when he was the media's darling? Or do you only go after authors who don't posit progressiveness as the highest moral order to achieve towards?\n\n\"He's made it very clear that if you don't follow these rules, you'd get no where in life whatever that really means. You will also suffer negative consequences.\"\n\nAnd you know what, I\"m more wont to believe him, a man who has spent his life working with people to improve their lives as HIS JOB, then to listen to you, a nobody critiquing his worldview as a part of someone else's youtube video.\n\nObviously his statements are generalizations. This is not to say that there aren't people who can't live outside of the standard and make due, and maybe there are several people whom that works for just fine. Does he say anywhere that they have to stop what they're doing if it works for them and abide only by what he prescribes? Anywhere at all?\n\nHe wrote his book as a means for people who didn't get a solid explanation of life from the people around them in order to help them find a way to sort things out, to find some meaning in their lives, and to work towards goals that will hopefully make them happier with their situation than they already are, I.E. the majority of the kinds of people that clinical psychologists regularly deal with on a day to day basis. You know who doesn't tend to pick up a self-help book? People who don't need help figuring their lives out.\n\nIf someone already has everything sorted, why the hell should they care what Peterson says? It's not as though his advice is aimed at them. I can't imagine he would expect someone who is already successful to need an antidote to chaos. \n\nAnd yes, of course chaos will exist regardless of how much work you put into sorting things out. His book is labelled as an antidote, not a cure or \"the solution\". Life is inherently chaotic. Existence is chaos, fundamentally. We, however, as human beings have a knack and general tendency for making order OUT of chaos in order to live our lives in a more beneficial, less stressful way. \n\nThat doesn't mean there aren't people who have different ways of looking at order, and that doesn't mean there aren't nihilists who give into the chaotic meaninglessness of everything and simply act as agents of chaos in their own lives and the lives of others. Generally speaking though, these people tend to be in the minority of people, so why is the idea of a general guide offered to help the majority so inherently offensive to you? The way you seem so desperate to tie Peterson to Hitler, you'd swear the man said something foul about your mother.",

Indeed, I've had it hurled at me many times even though I own a mortgage and work 50 hour work weeks. \n\nEvery political tendency has some devotees that are unemployed and whose lives seem stalled out in various ways. I guarantee you that many such people--unemployed and adrift--hold views far closer to yours than mine. \n\nIn any case, the evidence that you present to support your \"argument\" that antifa is comprised of people living in disorganized rooms in their parents' basements is totally braindead and revealing of your total lack of understanding of the political tendency that you're attempting to criticize: \n\n\"This is based in fact that there are many more young democrats....\" \n\nDude, antifa are NOT Democrats. Left radicals despise the Democratic Party and rightly see it as a graveyard for social movements against the capitalist status quo. If you are a centrist as you suggest, I can guarantee you that your politics are far, far closer to those held by Democrats like Bill Clinton and Barack Obama--both of whom as president carried water for Wall Street, the Pentagon, and the national security apparatus their entire presidencies--than are those held by left radicals who participate in or support antifa. \n\nBut even putting aside the fact that you think wrongly that antifa are Democrats, your argument still is weak. You say that: \n\n\"there are many more young Democrats on welfare programs, without jobs, and often on housing or living in parent's basement.\" \n\nThis is such a confused and confusing statement I have a hard time knowing where to begin. \n\nYou say there are more young Democrats of the type you describe but don't specify more than *what*. More young Democrats than young Republicans? Dude, most young people don't identify with or belong to either shitty corporate political party, ut their estrangement from the Republican Party is more severe than from the Democratic Party. A very small percentage of young Americans--let's say younger than 30--belong to or identify with the Republican Party. For this reason most statements that begin with something along the lines of \"There are more young Democrats than young Republicans who\" will be true. Let's try that on: There are more young Democrats than young Republicans who work as teachers, computer programmers, delivery drivers, child care workers, bike messengers, lawyers...all true. \n\nIf you want to talk about percentages of each group, you're going to have to pony up with some evidence to support your claim(s), which you have not done.",

They were socialist but not to the degree of communism. they didn't agree with the state seizing all the means of production. However they did in key areas or heavily regulated them.\n\nThe comparison of any form of right wing or conservatism in the west is just a clever thing done by propagandists on the left. Similar to the whole democrats were associated with slavery and kkk but somehow they got rid of all their racism and the republican party took it on. Problem is blacks and whites switched parties in the south years apart for different reasons. US politics has always been right of where the nazi party was except up into recently. the democrats have shifted so far left they are getting near that territory.\nNazis even made similar propaganda films and posters about german workers etc.\nThe authoritarianism or facism shouldn't be looked at as left or right. But right wing tends to be non interventionlist and small government which is not the mindset of facists or dictators. Because they can only get control of what the government controls.",

Don't get me wrong, he is definitely left leaning on these issues, I just find he lacks the more nuanced understanding of them that I do find in other's peoples' videos. He has the basics down but that's it. Like, of course crusty old white Republicans don't know shit about female reproductive organs and they should not determine whether a woman can get an abortion or not. I already knew that. But can we talk about why exactly the right is so set on controlling womens' reproductive organs? That is the real interesting debate for me. I also don't always agree with him on free speech for example. ST is different from the other channels mentioned in this thread because he talks less about the Alt-Right and the dog whistles and strategies they use. He has more of a Political Sciences angle than a Social Sciences angle. That being said, Kyle will always have a special place in my heart because he got me into politics in the first place when I discovered his channel 5 years ago.",

I'm a biologist and have a healthy working knowledge of most major Stem fields and so when I then heard him talking about climate change I was like ... wow, if he is this horribly wrong on a subject I do understand - not just with his conclusions, but also displaying a clear lack of competence when interpreting basic research data - then how wrong is he, when it comes to subjects I don't know enough about and would just take him at his word. The next thing I saw of him was the video you were addressing and I was like ... holy shit, this is embarrassing. You don't need to be a university student in a history undergrad class, to see how little he actually knows and how grossly he misrepresents Nazi ideology, but just a basic German high school education which makes it even sadder. I paused the video and found yours in the recommendations and it was a cathartic experience. Thanks for doing what you do. \nI don't think, I was never in any real danger of going down the Alt-Right pipeline, but I'm nevertheless happy that I realized their bullshit before they got a real opportunity to hook me in.

You can read the story of Cain and Abel to see that Peterson is wrong about the text strongt implying that Cain's heart was not in his sacrifices. \nYou can hear him claim that quitting smoking requires supernatural experiences and then talk with any person who have managed without such nonsense. \nThen of course, you can listen to his rambling about depictions of twin snakes being about DNA after which you real up on the mating behavior of snakes. \nIf you still find him mote trustworthy than a psychologist actually discussing his references in some depth, because of his H value, that is a bit worrying.",

Secondary sources look people writing about said event, usually with the support of primary sources. These two types of source, combined together, help build our historical understanding and in the absence of the said two types of sources, we can infer and know nothing. Furthermore, to infer the motivation of a historical figure via the outcome of their actions is very weak methodology for historical understanding. For one, it requires that we assume a historical figure has more control over the outcome of a historical event. In reality, very few exercise such control and even those who do have such control lose it eventually. In most cases, historical figures are not just acting on the world, but also reacting to it and sometimes events happen that they can't predict nor control. It also creates an absurd opportunity for subjective speculation to mix with fact and call itself objective. People are subjective creatures and if they simply infer the motivation via the outcome, they will think not as the historical figure's did within their respective times, but within the confines of their own modern interpretation. Thus, history and historical accuracy is lost. Jordan Peterson may be an excellent psychologist, but he is terrible at history.",

This concerns a small clip from a psychology lecture over an hour long, and is also the 13th lecture in the series. To anyone that had followed the entire series (which Peterson obviously assumes) it would be abundantly clear that his remarks are in no way at odds with the history as written (or as correctly given in this video). At this point he is summarising his views that were fleshed out over multiple hours in the previous lectures. This was never an argument that was meant to stand on its own.\n\nThe only misinforming that's going on is to imply that the clip as linked convey Peterson's views in full. They simply aren't and as someone that has seen all his lectures I can tell you that his views are definitely not at odds with the history as detailed in this video. He actually references many of the same sources in the course of his lectures.\n\nThis is the whole lecture from 2015 if you're actually interested (I can really recommend starting from the first one though): https://youtu.be/XY7a1RXMbHI",

It’s the precursor to those right wing movements just like we see precursors to leftist communist movements about. \n\nThis video quite clearly tried to paint Peterson as a figurehead of the proto fascist movement. That’s just not true. And you can ask the alt right this. They don’t really support him and he doesn’t support them. Peterson’s number one main point he is always on about is the importance of individuals. He’s like a modern disciple of Nietzsche and Jung. And that’s quite clear when you see his works in his field of psychology. Most of what he does is psychology and self help, he was practicing for a while. And to see every single detractor of his only characterize him by his political points is why this is shit. Because he gives his opinions on politics for fun basically. His main life’s achievement is his psychological work.",

You are simply paranoid about your guru receiving fair criticism of his material.\n\nWhen these kinds of criticisms pop up, the most devoted Peterson fans always come forward with the \"read all his books and listen to all his lectures\" argument. What they don´t realize however is that most Peterson fans don´t actually know that much about him. And if you are a member of the alt-right, and you only see the lecture that is being commented on here, you might leave with the impression that Peterson does indeed support alt-right ideas. \n\nWhen you then watch his conversation with Bret Weinstein on the JRE, he explains himself much more clearly, but the alt-righter might not have seen that one. There are many members of the alt-right who are fans of Peterson. You can tell, because every time he says something remotely supportive about the Jews, the comment section is full of people saying \"Well, I like you Jordan, but you really missed the point here.\" and other similar things. That is not a normal reaction if your fanbase is normal.",

Three Arrows makes a claim that Peterson makes it impossible to understand Hitler and the nazi perpetrators, based on the short clip, while in the same lecture Peterson continued to develop the topic up to the point where he describes the possibility of every student in the classroom becoming one and the mechanisms that will be in play. Then, in later lectures of this course he explains why it is crucial to understand this and how this affects the psyche of the individual. Have Three Arrows put those clips, his whole argument would be impossible, even though he had a strong point there, about the Third Reich reasoning, it is now impossible to take the debate seriously, since he framed the argument in a non communicative way, and basically called Peterson an idiot/nazi/take your pick. Just like Peterson described in the clip in this video, ironically.\nAnd just to frame your possible answer: I myself isn't a Jordan fan, though I respect him. I have strong critique of him, particularly his inconsistent opinion on morality, that he claims in different interviews/lectures/QnAs, have different roots in humans and rats.

Petersons basic point is valid, that people often don't do things for completely rational reasons, even when they themselves thinks so and/or publicly claim so. We are a lot more driven by our emotions and subconscious than we like to think. Of course, I agree that he is overstating the case in the case of the Nazis.

A The Ontario Human Rights Commission can commence a complaint before a Tribunal, intervene in any existing complaint before the Tribunal on behalf of any complainant, conduct its own inquiries into real or purported breaches of the Code and issue recommendations, and it develops legally binding policies. With the introduction of Bill C-16, the OHRC has the authority to require you to use the words demanded by the bill. To reiterate, OHRC policy requires that persons must use the pronouns required by the portion of transgendered individuals, making that demand effectively constitutes compelled speech. Those not wishing to use those pronouns or not able to use those pronouns due to their beliefs, faith and religion, are afforded no ability to abstain. People can be summoned to a human rights Tribunal if they use the wrong words. Wilfed Laurier University was proof of that.

That's what I mean when I say he is out of his expertise area. I'm pretty sure he knows history, but I'm not sure he is proficient enough to draw conclusions the way he does. And that is the reason this video criquite exists in the first place.",

It actually takes resources to prevent revolts.\nThey were also getting killed because the official believe in Nazi Germany is that we are in a racial war. If you kill as many jews as possible you give the biggest chance of your \"race\" survival. They were the same people that we have now. It's not \"chaos\" what motivates them. They suffered from the toxic disease of nationalism. They believed they were in a team competing with the other teams. To them it made sense ideologically AND economically.",

They (the narratives) are useful and helpful to humans to emit \"judgements\" and make decisions based on them.\n         For example fascism and nazism, could be \"reduced\" to their basic narratives which would be \" if you don't mess with us its all good\" vs\"we will kill you regardless\". It IS an oversimplification, but they are true, and accurately represent their true nature and relation towards the human condition.\n  The greatest achievement of the Reformation, could be regarded that it took the Bible (information) out of the hand of the Catholic church and made it accessible to large portions of humanity, effectively ending its monopol (i.e power), also leading to the ending of the tie between the church and the state( aristocracy)\n  Actually marxism is both a teaching and a philosophy and that makes it dangerous( i.e the same danger which lead to the separation of the state and the church) among many many other reasons.\n \n      Btw it is erroneous the assertion that Christianity is responsible for any of that( ideology). Humans did that, yes they were christians, but that's actually a testament to our( as humans) inability to really comprehend complex \"teachings\" and also our ability to twist \"teachings\" Actually our whole history is a testament in that regard.\n   \n        Peterson does not have an ideology. He simply,in a human way cautions against dangers, which he perceives as dangers.\nThink about a Remarque who is actually taking active steps to prevent the dangers what he described so brilliantly in his books.",

Btw the reprehensibility of nazism lies not \"just in the inhumane ideology, but equally the inhumane practices as well, right?\n\n\nVery much so.

For your information, I was baptised in a a catholic church, but while I do believe in God, I regard faith as independent from religion.

        "text": "@jamiehardt3061 Christianity is based on a set of beliefs( I.e personal truth's).  Comparing marxism to christianity is completely wrong. \n     I really don't get it, are you trying to present marxism as a religion? Marx didn't proposed a belief system, he proposed a \"scientific\" dialectical materialist way to look upon history and implicitly humanity.That's the usual  argument made by its proponents/followers. Are you deviating from it? One have to \"believe\" in Marx, now? Really? Well...interesting.\n  One of (if not the main ) the reasons, why dissidents and dissenters were put into mental institutions, in the USSR was that it \"was scientifically proven\" that a marxist society is\" superior\" to any other form of society( which is bullshit), so if one questions\nit, must be mentally insane. Are you playing the same game? That's the modern inquisition? Well your deeds certainly reinforce my opposition towards neomarxists and neomarxisms in general and actually underlines the actual necessity of opposing it.\nThe Left is really incapable to learn from past mistakes? Sigh.\n\n      \n    Again, why is it that you put words in my mouth and depict me in all sort of colours?  I'm fully aware ( as I was educated on it, how to use it etc.) that's a marxist tactic, stemming from the belief of  \"beholding the ultimate truth\", but it is ...yes exactly. Bullshit. Do I really have to quote every passage of you where you accused me, having no notion of history to prove it?  Really? That kind of zealotism is from where my opposition to Marx and his proponents are stemming. \n\n\n      Btw those \"reductions\" presented by me as examples  are mine, NOT Peterson's. What he brilliantly see is the importance of meanings, as an essential tool for understanding each other. As a human to another human. Because we ARE humans. not dogs barking  each at other. You didn't even bother to ask me anything( I.e what I meant) , you already knew who I am, what I knew, literally everything about me. What are you a prophet, who sees \"everything\"? Well, you do but, completely and utterly wrong :)   \n\n\n  Again, on the importance of meanings if I told you that \"I saw a red cabrio today\" you will know instantly what I meant by that.\nBut if I say that \" I saw a marxist today\" things rapidly will became completely different. \n   I'll stick with the historically correct definition, which is a radical revolutionary socialist movement/ideology. Because everything else he (Marx) wrote, he wrote as \"justification\" toward his cause. MUCH in the same WAY, that racial studies were used by the nazi's for \"legitimacy\". For wildly different goals, yes, but again, MUCH in the same WAY.",

        "text": "@jamiehardt3061 Well, you still doing that( i.e you attribute \"roles, \"places\" as where I belong and adjectives to me) although this time in a much milder form:) Having discussions over the internet, especially in the \"youtyube\" comment section admittedly could have that, let's say, side effect. But still, please don't do that.\n    While I don't know everything, about the Holocaust and let's say the nazi's deeds(who could actually, or willing to do that even if it is VERY important), you didn't say ANYTHING new to me. While I'm not a scholar on history, I'm very passionate about it. But you still assume ( quite wrongly I could say) that I'm in the definitive need of more \"reading\" ( well, there is certainly no such thing as enough, ONLY if one decides that for himself). What you have to understand about me is that my mind works in \" big jumps\" I'm not excelling in linear thinking, so to speak.I can accurately understand wide and deep concepts , along  with their implications in a second.\n    \n   \n You mentioned scary things, but the really scary thing is the emergence of today's \"safe spaces\".Yes, it is very close to the aforementioned ideology.I'm sure that I don't have to translate for you their quest for what \" spaces\"? Yes you are correct, it IS the same thing. We can argue about the apparently wildly different motivations and 'justifications\" for the \"need\" of them, but in its effect only muddies the water and actually preclude the correct conclusions. \n    On top of that, NONE in the academia actually explained the poor idiots, what they were doing.(even if they could be regarded as a byproduct of the capitalist system). I know that Marx and implicitly marxism advocates exactly that( the necessity of the presence of disgruntled, uneducated masses AND the necessity of sitting tight and waiting for that) , but again it denotes the dangerous,profoundly  inhumane nature of this ideology. Not to mention the fact that marxism along  with its other derivatives behaving, EXACTLY in the way you described that other ideology.\r\n   But I'm stoked about the fact that you as a scholar you are protesting Peterson and not actually understanding what he is doing and more importantly why. So if there is a chance to stop the next Hitler or Stalin, we should NOT do that? Any way its possible?\r\nThink again. It is actually a human \"thing\" not liking someone, but that's a very different thing.\r\n   I\"m NOT advocating fascist measures, again I advocate the need for human centric education, because the current system clearly failed.\r Marx works still should be taught about, but with the MANDATORY cautioning and explanation about its pitfalls and all the wrongness\r\n\r\n   Again discussing various concepts philosophies and teachings by their effect on humanity is a different kind of discussion.\r\nBut, again not taking into account the spiritual nature of religions vs the more practical part of actual ideologies, makes it akin to pseudoscience.That's one of the reasons why marxism (this time with his broader term) IS incredibly dangerous.See my first comment on that.\r Science should be about the truth, NOT only the facts, because it will not expose us the whole picture, it will be a partial and very incomplete. Human \"truths\" and human narratives are incredibly important, because again we can relate to those at human level, MUCH easier.\n   This is especially true discussing history, because history is actually HUMAN history and no one can separate from it like a minor inconvenience Again in history context is king, so understanding motivation is key,  in order to correctly asses action and understanding action is key,  in order to correctly asses motivation. That two way interaction will give us the whole picture.\r\nDiscussing only one aspect will give us only one aspect, ergo an one sided and ultimately incorrect picture.\r\n    Apropo two way interaction, that is happening in every society. Society (in various ways) acts upon the individual\r\nand the individual acts upon society. By definition the individual IS the smallest component ( let's say atom) of any society and ANY 'science\" that does not takes that into account, it is akin to a complete and utter joke, much in the same way that one should regard alchemy vs chemistry.Today's \"social sciences\" are still in the dark ages.\r\n\r\n And now we are getting closer to the truth, namely to the importance of personal truth's, be it beliefs or convictions.The axiomatic nature of the personal (individual) truths has and had a profound effect upon our societies be it  negative or positive.\r\n  On the negative side one has to mention (evidently) Hitler, on the positive Gandhi or Martin Luther King to name just a few.\r\nIgnoring the effects that those personal beliefs are played upon our history is both incredibly stupid and actually dangerous.\r\nThat's why narratives ARE incredibly important, because we can relate to them much \"easier\"\r\n\r\nMore to come.\r\n\r\n    Apropo you completely dismissed my \"reductions\" even if they DID accurately depicted the 'protective nature\" of fascism and the\r deterministic, systematic and totalitarian nature of nazism. So you see you can protest the simplified nature of them, but NOT the accuracy historical or otherwise. Because \" scholarly correct\" argumentation ( i.e what you called \"dogma\" and how that dogma was 'created\") can't really replace personal ,individual (critical and/or judgemental) thinking.\rit IS important. but again it will give you an one sided view and actually could hamper personal development.( i.e thinking with your own head)\n    T",

YOU said his job is to think DEEPLY about these issues, but all that deep thinking over thirty years of reading has given him no solutions??   \n\nI really want to hear something new... even the thing about working with women and that being a new paradigm where men don't know exactly how to deal with women and their trespasses at work, since men know where the line is and woman don't, all that is already known, and again NO solution to it other than \"we just have to muddle through it...\"  well, dah!!\n\nI repeat: JP is a very LIKEABLE engaging speaker, and even I would say motivational, so that is not what I am after, he can keep filling stadiums full of people who like motivational speakers, but after listening to all those talks, I still have to ask, OK so we knew those issues existed, what are the solutions?? and we come out with none of that, none. Please tell me a solution he has given that we DIDN'T ALREADY KNOW??",

        "text": "@PabloCardonaMusic \nNot quiet solutions ----- Cleaning your room doesn't translate to MUCH of anything, unless you tell me that successful, ordered (as against chaos, he says) people make sure they clean their rooms every morning, and the same applies to all other 11 \"rules\" Some of them are palpably pathetic as orientation for young boys, those \"rules\" remind me a lot of LAZY teachers (most of them) that give busy-work to students just to keep them busy and stopping them from enjoying their lives, and actually exploring.  \n\nLook, we \"older\" people know teenagers are a pain in the ass, so MOST of us give teens and young adults a lot of slack and leeway, let them do their stupid shit and find themselves like we all did, but Peterson has this \nanti-chaos or some sort of mental super-structure he wants to impose on everyone as a way to find CONTENTMENT and his way is to basically keep things as they are, Want happiness? it doesn't exist, he says, the best you can do is get married and adopt, or \"shoulder\" as much responsibility as you can handle, and his recent stint in a rehab place gives you an indication of where taking as much responsibility as you can will lead you, we all almost automatically take as much as we can and DO as much as we are able to. \nYou want a very ordered world?? well friend, it just doesn't exist, and never has existed, we all live in FLUX our entire lives, embrace change and chaos and learn to deal with those and dominate them because THAT is the one CONSTANT in life, change! \n\nAs Orwell said in his book Animal Farm, We are all equal, but some are more equal than others, and even Peterson argues FOR that when the topic is hierarchies and differences between theTWO sexes, etc etc, so \"social issues\" will always be there for us to deal with, every time you deal with the world, REALITY, you must take those \"issues\" into account. \n\nNow, do I wish it to be different?? I guess not, and it is a useless question to begin with, because it cannot be different, The TOTALLY equal society where there is no suffering and no disparity among people seem to me like the idea people have of heaven, and that place is boring as shit and the things people say to do there are horribly narcissistic and tedious. \n\nSo I have come to make peace with the fact that life is struggle with times (not \"moments\", as Peterson says) of enjoyment and peace. But even people who could live doing absolutely nothing keep doing shit to keep busy or \"better\" the world, and some to damage the world... why in the world would you or anyone else with it to be any different, better to face the HORRIBLE facts, because they are horrible, and hope to better the world, KNOWING it can never be achieved. But cleaning your room or not bothering a cat or listening to everyone as if they have something to teach you is not the way, hell, even Peterson doesn't listen to EVERYONE.\n\nWhat you said about thinking about short medium and long consequences is spot on, but DIDN'T WE ALL ALREADY KNOW THAT??  But how is anyone gonna learn to do that properly by cleaning your room!!!\nYou can make a word salad and connect the two like Peterson does, but that is just that; it is woo. \"He does that with his bible stories, his Pinocchio analogies about going to the underworld by going into the belly of the whale and saving your father, or becoming a real man because you are not one like Pinocchio, etc etc... he does that a lot. \nHis best arguments are in the areas he actually knows about and had data to back it up, Hierarchies, differences between men and woman.... but SOME of his conclusions are horribly misguided.\n\nGood luck.",

        "text": "@PabloCardonaMusic \nOne more thing about those solutions you mentioned, that \"seem to work\"\n\nIn exercise there is a known fact: if you have beeb sitting on your ass doing basically NOTHING physical for years, and suddenly take up ANY activity, well, it WORKS, it does improve your health and physical well being... but then if you are sitting on your ass for years , then ANYTHING you do that gets you off your ass will work wonders. The point is (as in the \"clean your room\" analogy) how far can you go, and once you get adapted to that activity you picked up, what happens once your body get ADAPTED to it??  So you get the amateur or newbie benefits of finally getting off your ass, and that lasts for a few weeks or months depending on the sport, and then what??  Do you see? Cleaning your room is similar, if it is a complete mess it will help some, but unless you continue FREVER then the benefits don't last, same if you have baad relations with family or friends, ANYTHING you do to try to fix them will help... butte nirvana people think will follow is just not true.\nWhat Peterson does is like those ads that want you to invest with them, they show the EXCEPTIONAL people who got EXCEPTIONAL results, then they tell you that YOU TOO can get those and that is easy, but of course they cannot guarantee it, because those results will vary and most people end up BROKE.",

Karl Jung peddles Depak Chopra style New Age mumbo jumbo. I say mumbo jumbo, because having a father who is into this I have seen how crazy this stuff is. My father was also a Karl Jung fan.\n\n\nKarl Jung, and thus by extension Jordan Peterson is VERY far away  from mainstream science in the understanding of psychology and the human mind. Remember he hails from a time when psychologists had no way of actually introspecting and analyzing the human brain. Today we have CAT scans, MRI and a host of other methods to connect human behavior to physical processes in the brain we can observe.\n\n\nJordan Peterson is really peddling pseudo science. But as a well read scholar, your average debater knows to little about this stuff to confront him, and thus he often scores points in debates.",

        "text": "@owabowa 1. No, it is not. The only requirement is to be respectful. Nazis are permanently present in history documentaries you can watch every night on TV, we have multiple days of rememberance for Nazi atrocities and related events, monuments to the victims are scattered all across the country (and NONE to the perpetrators unlike in the US) and the Nazis are present in close to every year in school. And not just history, but also in German class, English, religion, arts, music and sociology. Many German students visit concentration camps. I myself have stood in the gas chambers of Dachau. It is the opposite of taboo. Making it taboo would only increase the risk of it happening again.  Nazi jokes aren't very popular though, because it implies a lack of respect for their victims. You can make them but they have to be very good (and I expect foreigners really shouldn't joke). Some German exchange students tell of being greeted by Americans with Hitler salutes \"as a joke\". A punch to the face can very well happen in those cases so that should give you some idea. In short: feel free to talk about the Nazis with Germans but be respectful. Don't ask \"was your dad a Nazi?\" (many Germans will tell you about that themselves)\n\n2. At first it is laughable to hear. Every fithgrader here knows what the Nazis and their politics were. But as you go deeper into US politics it becomes scary as you realise that this is not just some ignorant idiocy but a widespread view many Americans have about the Nazis. The main problem is that Americans who say this are falling for and spreading Nazi propaganda as the term socialist was purposefully included by the Nazis to manipulate people into their cause. \n\n3. Many of those are in German so I am not familiar with international ones. As for books there are 2 I really like that can shed light on how the German army operated and thought about Nazism and the war and on how the Nazis managed to make nearly  all of Germany go along with their atrocities. Those are \"Soldaten. On fighting, killing and dying\" by Harald Welzer and Sönke Neitzel and \"Täter. How ordinary men become mass murderers\" by Harald Welzer. I am not sure about English versions though. \nOther than that I recommend some movies that shed light on the German side and the Nazis and aren't the typical American films which want to make war look exciting. You might get depression from these though. \n\"Das Boot\" (the boat) is probably the best war film ever made\n\"Der Untergang\" (Downfall) details the collapse of the Nazi regime and the last days of Hitler\n\"Stalingrad\" shows the brutal war on the eastern front\n\"Sophie Scholl. The final days\" tells the story of a German resistance group who gave their lives to try and end Nazism\nWatch in German with subtitles",

But it is not unheard of for those morons to get beaten up. A couple years ago some idiot flashed it outside a bar and gotten beaten up so bad the beaters had to be charged with assault. \n2. Of course there are some Nazis in Germany. No country can escape that plague. Our AfD party is far right/fascist. And both the conservatives and the liberals have been sliding towards the right in the past few years. I do suspect however that there are less Nazis in Germany than in other countries like the USA. They certainly are way less tolerated here than in other countries because we know full well what they represent and want. \n3. The legacy of split Germany is still relevant today. The east is still not as good as the west in terms of economy and living standard. Although in some parts the opposite is true and they are better of due to massive rehabilitative investments. There also seems to be a discrepency in religiosity and social altruism between the two. But that is only in tendencies and cannot be applied to all citizens of either side or even to all regions and cities.",

The voting base of the conservatives is dying off and they are thus under threat of loosing power. That radicalizes them. On top of that the new generation of voters is predominantly voting green or social democrat, further ripping power from the right. \nLiberals are now capitalising on the resurgent left by spinning lies about authoritarian greens and oppression by leftists. It is less radicalization than political tactics. Moreover liberals always have a tendency to fall towards the right, it is baked into their ideology.

For example the Nordic rune \"s\" as it was used for the SS, the salute, the svastica (outside of educational content that is)...\nModern Nazis just use similar symbols or things that are not outright banned.\nFor example: alot of number combinations like 88 (stands for the 8th letter in the alphabet, H, twice, it means Heil Hitler = hitler salute), 18 (Adolf Hitler), 28 (Blood and honor) - I think Wikipedia has a list of that?\n\nAlso in theory denazification is part of our constitution. Sadly it's not done too a sufficient extent and we have alot of cases rn where they find out that some Nazis were infiltrating the police, ect. I am really scared the right wingers gain too much power again tbh.\n\nBut it's also absurd: did you know the fraction leader of the AfD, German nazi party, is a lesbian woman? She's married to an immigrant woman and they live in Switzerland - which is not even part of the EU - so basically she doesn't even live in Germany, but is patriotic? Seriously German politics are a circus show at the moment.\n\nAnd yes, I think 2015 with the refugee situation this extreme shift to the right got alot of traction. Or maybe it was the first time I realized as I wasn't really into politics much before then.\n\nI feel like we should do alot more awareness about Nazis. But at least we are not like the US who's like... Murdered millions of natives and then goes around telling stories about how they had this cutesy coming together with them celebrating Thanksgiving 😅\nBut I know American education system sucks balls, so I don't blame the citizens...\n\nWe try to acknowledge the shit that happened in the past and remind ourselves about what can happen and that we should prevent it from ever happening again.",

For this I have also tried looking for youtubers who can do this without having to distort or strawman his views, which is why I am writing this comment.\nYou have made an excellent video and you take up great points showing the other side of the argument. You don't misrepresent his views either which is mostly rare for some reason and then keep brining up very valid points on how he is wrong. I found it enjoyable and entertaining to watch and listen to your arguments but most of all it is refreshing to hear somebody being able to properly tell the man where he is probably wrong.\n\nThank you for having this channel.

Socialism isn't \"seizing the means of production\"; it's government regulation of a country's produce and the distribution of that produce towards the benefit of society at large. It still can work in tandem with the free market and it doesn't completely negate capitalism.\n\nThink of a colour wheel, where you have blue (capitalism) on the left end, red (communism) on the right end, green (fascism) up top and purple (socialism) at the bottom. depending on how close to the center you are, the more government intervention there is, and the conversely, the further away you move from it to each side, the more or less collectivist your government is. And further up or down lies the distribution of power. Where at the top you have the power completely centered around one node of power, as in a dictatorship, and more to the side of purple socialism lies the power of the people. Socialism can never  be a dictatorship. Was Soviet Russia socialist? Fuck no. Was it communist? Yes and no. It had a lot of government intervention but the power still lied within one person. That's not \"true communism\"; it truly hasn't been tried ever, and likewise, true capitalism has never EVER been put in practice by any society.\n\nThe USA isn't full blue. It's between purple and blue, maybe a cyan color if you wanna keep with the colour stuff. Nazi Germany was full on green and Cuba used to be fully purple. North Kore sits between red and green and so forth.\n\nIt's simple but, at least i find that it's a good way to do away with the myth that capitalism and socialism are 100% not compatible, that is just not the case.",

He loved those holidays. Nowerdays my family cannot afford such things anymore.

This man was so deceptive about Peterson I wouldn’t trust him.  I didn’t listen past about ¾ of the way through as I already know the history of the era.",

This is ridiculous because this is one of the points the speaker makes that was even shown in the beginning of the video - that anyone is potentially capable of the evil of nazis.\n\nThen he goes on to claim and/or strongly infer the speaker believes all his enemies or those who disagree with him won't even talk to him and aren't acting fair, etc and he does this by taking clips out of context, clips where the speaker was discussing disruptive \"shut down\" protesters at his talks who use loud noise, what noise generators, fire drills, and bad faith tactics to shut down the very discussions and debate, even with people who disagree with the speaker and who refuse to engage at all...then he claims that this is dangerous because it's like the nazis and then he claims I dont think the speaker is a nazi.

    "text": "Frankly, you might both be somewhat wrong. Your sources might underestimate the role, nutritition played in the holocaust by stating the (misleading) thought that the Germans were well nourished. This might be true for the Germans, but the Axis-territory as a whole was heavily dependent on soviet imports of food at least since 1940. A quote from \nhttps://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungerplan#Protokoll_der_Staatssekret%C3%A4re-Besprechung,_2._Mai_1941\ntranslated to English:\n\"On February, the 14th, Herbert Backe, Secretary of the State explained in the Ministry for Nutrition and Agroeconomy, a 'collapse of the nutrition would occur within the second year of the war, as it did in 1918.'\"\nFrom the same page about a document regarding the role of nutrition for the start of the war with the soviets:\n\"Christian Gerlach has shown in his study of 1999 about the German occupation policy in Belarus, that the document's role for the occupation policy in the Soviet Union was not sufficiently understood.\"\nThe document states, that \n\"1) The war is only to be continued, if the totality of the German Army can be nourished from Russian Territory within the third year of the war. \n2) Millions of people will perish, if we take from the country, what we need for ourselves.\"\n\nLong story short: The intention of Hitler might have been to make the Axis independent of food imports from a potential competitor who might like to cut them later on anyways. The trade agreement between Hitler and Stalin at the time states that the Germans mainly imported food and resources, while the Soviets mainly imported advanced parts for military equipment from Germany. Hitler did most likely see this as a sign of military weakness, and thus a good moment to attack. (The Axis' food storage was fading even with soviet imports.)",

I'd agree with almost everything you said up until this point. Nothing he said contradicts the facts you brought in. First thing though, from how I understand what he tried to convey in the video was that psychologically effects of your true beliefs manifests themselves in your actions. He then used the German Nazi ideology manifested by Hitler's decisions where the outlier was that the urge to kill these people was key for the ideology. How does that contradict what you're saying?\n\nYou seem to undermine his methodology yet you arrive to a similar conclusion although from different angles. You're saying we should learn about the ideology so we can understand the mechanics. He's saying that we should look at human tendencies from an individualistic perspective that later manifests itself in general. He clearly speaks about how this destructive line of thinking is ingrained to some extent with every individual. These approaches are complimentary and are not mutually exclusive. His is lacking the ideological mechanism, yours is lacking the individual aspect. Now we have both, but how you concluded that he tries to \"ascribe Nazi's actions to a wish to cause mayhem\" and \"we reassure ourselves we can never become them\" are a little bit beyond my comprehension.\n\nYou're right about the ideology part not being in this lecture but it's not the key factor in what he states initially. He went to great lengths in his other, more recent lectures about consequences of being ideologically possessed for both left and right ends of the spectrum.",

You play identity politics, you interpret calm, rational disagreement as being triggered, and you lump people together based on your complete ignorance of them.\n\nJordan Peterson barely merits being considered part of the intellectual dark web, because he's not really an intellectual, but the people who are legitimately part of the \"intellectual dark web\" cannot be lumped together into any single category - the only similarity between all of them is that they have offended far-left extremists and many people have bought into misrepresentations of them by the far left.",

        "text": "​@valerierodger7700 Except that is what Jordan is trying to advocate for, patriarchy where Woman are below men like with the interview, so Roy is spot on here and actually more credible than you since he can cite valid sources to debunk JP's claims. You are the one and by extension the guys who insult Roy here, who misunderstood Peterson, because you can't see his Conservative prefix or the implications he gives..... Social Hierarchies not built to help us\n\n\nAnd no Hierarchy isn't something that exists in nature indiscriminately, there are animals who have no rulers or anything resembling a hierarchy, as they act without a sense of ruler and servant relationship, there is no need for it, I mean, animals are mostly driven by instincts, who why create Chain of Commands. Even with more intelligent beings such as Humans, Hierarchies didn't always exist,  there are still tribes and communities, who operate without any notion of Hierarchies and rulers governing them and still do because an absent of Hierarchy=/= no rules at all.  There can still be rules enforced in a society with a lack of Hierarchy as these rules are no longer enforced by a small group of People, but by the entire community that can punish the person together with no need for Leaders or rather no too powerful leaders. That's how Anarchy works, they are not against all hierarchies, they are against unjust ones, the ones JP tries to justify like Patriarchy and anti-LGBT values( which is what Roy probably meant with Minorities here, so he didn't strawmanned JP here). Also, Roy isn't arguing for ending Hierarchy or saying that JP is bad because he promotes hierarchy, he is only against the notion that Hierarchies like Patriarchy are bad, so you basically misconstrued Roy and the critics of JP here, because of your reactionary behavior towards people for reducing Hierarchies. Peters logic is fallacious and should be condemned, Hierarchies like the ones I mentioned are made up Social structures by Humans because We see in a lot of cultures and other aspects of life that Male Patriarchy isn't needed, because Woman can be as, more and less competent than Men and vice versa. Heck, JP's start of the Lobster thing is a strawman, Patriarchy existed long before the west, no one would blame Patriarchy sorely on the West.\n\nEven if we all agree that Anarchy sucks, Hierarchy does not prevent us to say fuck you to patriarchy. It's a very outdated and gibberish Hierarchy that dehumanizes Woman as inferior and unfortunately defended by Peterson, who believes that just because Lobsters have \"Alpha males\" and a form of \"patriarchy\"( they don't, like many animals, including many Bees btw), we should that dumb. Even your bit about the need of Rulers is not even original ( another problem of JP) or relevant about this discussion, it's about *Patriarchy* and his subset of Fascist ideas, not Hierarchy in General, heck he even gave you a video that talks about briefly that Hierarchies are not all bad and show you that you misinterpreted JP as advocating for Hierarchy in general, he wasn't, he was justifying why Men rule over woman and failing to do so. Thanks for proving how awful he is in terms of coming to the meat of his argument, and proving how bad your reading comprehension is for strawmanning Roy as some sort of Hollywood Anarchist, who wants get rid of all Rulers, when Anarchy is only about reducing some power of the rulers and ending Bad ones, like Sexism and racism. Point is, JP has a lot of fascist admirers and it's his fault that they confuse him for one of their members by being so hostile against progress, Woman and Marxism, your defense for him only tells me that maybe you also have a lot of his reactionary tendecies rather than the Alt-right.",

        "text": "@valerierodger7700 I kinda want to believe that you are critical of JP, but the way you defended his strawman of the Lobster argument, makes me doubt that you even understand what type of application he gives, that Naturally Men rule over everyone, because Lobsters do it as well and they are related to us, it is a must to be dominant as well, nevermind that being natural isn't always a good thing like Germs or his defense of Male Hierarchy. I could use the Lions as justification of Matriarchy, since the Male lions are buys to take care of the Cubs, while the Lionesses hunt the prey, which is more scientifically accurate than JP's lobster thing ( https://beta.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2018/06/04/jordan-peterson-needs-to-reconsider-the-lobster/?outputType=amp ) because Lions are much closer related to Humans than some Sea Shell Animals that have gone a different Evolutionary line than us, after all, Lions are Mammals. However, it would be also stupid because Matriarchy is not the opposite of Daddy Supremacy, but just a different form of Gender Hierarchy, so I am more for a more cosmopolitan viewpoint of equality for all.\n\n\nBut why am I even typing, you proclaimed victory and dismissed a rational person as stupid for misinterpreting his critique as an attack on Hierarchy itself, when it was about one specific kind of one, one you should be opposed to,yet did not react accordingly, instead you confused JP as pro-rulers, when it was about it, it was about him being a fascist or not.\n\n\n Speaking about the Mussolini Lobster Linguini, Fascism is a set of many ideas that include:\n\n   1. A political philosophy which was a compound of radical ideas and mysticism, of left-wing-sounding slogans and conservative policies. ( Kinda what JP does, since both the left, right and center have many people in there that can interpret his vague believes either way)\n   2. A strong state with a powerful executive which did not require democratic consultation before acting, combined with a hatred of bourgeois democracy.( not JP)\n   3. Hatred of Communism and Socialism as political movements based on the idea of class differences and class antagonisms. Against this idea, Fascism aimed to substitute a corporative state that denied a divergence of class interests between capital and labor.( JP's thing)\n   4. The formation of a mass party on paramilitary lines which drew its recruits in part from the discontented and disenfranchised working-class. (not really)\n  5.  Admiration of power and the deed which found expression in the cult of violence. Training for war and violence gave free rein to sadistic and pathological characteristics. ( kinda his thing with his fascination of Toxic Masculinity, which celebrates violence in an unhealthy manner)\n   6. Authoritarian programs which emphasized conformity, discipline, and submission. Society was militarized and directed by a messianic leader. ( not his thing)\n  7.  The cultivation of irrationality — the impulse was more important than logical thought. Irrationality led to a cult of death — witness the Spanish Fascist slogan: Arriba la Muerte! — Up with Death! ( He is irrational so that counts) \n   8. Nostalgia for the legendary past. For instance, in Italy's case, the Roman Empire. In Germany, an appeal to primitive myths. The initials SS were written in runic letters from Viking times. Japan resurrected the medieval code of the samurai. ( He does admire Judeo-Christians values and used nature to justify his oppressive Hierarchies like Patriarchy, that counts too)\n    9. Aversion to intellectuals whom Fascism accused of undermining the old certainties and traditional values. ( also his thing) \n   10. Fascism claimed to honor the dignity of labor and the role of the peasantry as providers of the staples of life. With this went an idealized picture of rural life - the healthy countryside versus the decadent city. ( also his thing)\n 11.   Machismo. Women were relegated to traditional female roles as housewives, servants, nurses, and as breeders of \"racially pure\" warriors for the state war machine. ( the racially pure thing is out, so 50/50\n   12. Fascism was frequently subsidized by big industrialists and landowners. ( Not really JP's thing)\n    13. Fascism's electoral support came overwhelmingly from the middle-class — in particular, the lower middle-class affected by the economic crisis. ( not his thing\n    14. Fascism needed scapegoat enemies — \"the Other\" on whom to focus on society's aggressions and hates. ( Pomo Marxist are his favorite scapescoat, it counts)\n\nSo from all the 14 ideas that compromise Fascism he shares 8,5- 14 of these views in some manner, especially the Social conservatism part, that makes him not really a fascist, but based on a lot of things he says, it can appear this way and guess what, it's the reason why he got so many fascist fans. Maybe if you would actually care more about what a Person implies rather than defending premises no one argued against, then we would have no Alt-right revolution or Quarks like JP, who continue to poison people with his abhorrent ideas.  Maybe you and Jp need to use your brains, not just your misguided feelings.",

    "text": "A great video.  Peterson's lack of understanding of historical nazis and nazism is likely why he doesn't understand the ways his own views are sympathetic with today's nazis.  Furthermore, he lacks a lot of understanding of military efficiency if he thinks holding prisoners and slaves is less costly than outright murder.  \n\nI can't speak to his psych expertise, the general impression I've gotten from the statements of other professionals is that he seems ok as a practitioner but derivative as an academic.  But in history and political thought, the guy is atrocious.  It's one thing to disagree.  But he makes such caricatured statements about the left resulting in a complete fundamental attribution error.  And his statements on history ignore all facts and the progression of understanding of historical actors. \n\nIf I were to discuss and critique his psychology work, he would rightly tell me that I am unqualified to do so.  He should similarly leave other subjects to their respective practitioners.",

Similarly, religious fundamentalists frequently claim that religion explains everything.  Like Peterson, the religious fundamentalists seldom reference any source of knowledge other than religion.  Peterson's view, like theirs is essentially reductionist and fundamentalist.  Beyond that, in an informal sense the mark of an educated person is how widely  he has read.  It's not clear that Peterson has read anything in history, economics, anthropology, biology, etc.   Peterson is a lowbrow.\n\nI haven't listened to very much of Peterson, because he isn't worth my time, but it's hardly the case that he restricts his opinions to the field of psychology whether or not he does so in any particular video.  An example, is his opinions about the Nazis and Hitler as Three Arrows explains here in detail.",

A lot of people seem to think that what Peterson says at the end of the video (around 18:00) is that if he talks with the left, then he loses. I don't know if this is also Three Arrows' interpretation of Peterson. But, if that is the case, he is completely wrong. See the context of the conversation (as it appears in the video):\n\nPeterson: \"they regard the idea [some leftists] [...] that if you're in one power group and I'm in another [...] we can´t step out of that group, engage in a dialogue, have our worlds meet, and produce some sort of understanding of [...] of negotiated understanding. No! That's part of [...] your oppressive patriarchal game! That [...] whole idea is part of your game so if I even engage in the dialogue I'm playing your game, you win then.\"\n\nYou can also see that that interpretation is wrong when you see that Peterson has criticised the left for their closeness to dialogue.

Compress it and make it over-simplified (to the point of entirely misrepresenting the topic). Then expand it, use the over-simplified topic to pad out time, add in complicated, logical sounding, big words, pick apart these hugely overly simplistic pixels and further misrepresenting the topic. (These add ons and explanations usually include propaganda)\n\nSome examples of this argument I’ve seen: “gender = sex and those who disagree are against biology and crazy”, “feminism is just angry women mad at men because they’re ugly”, “communism is bad, because countries like Russia and China are ‘communist’ countries”, “Black lives matter is racist against white people, All lives matter!”, “If we defund the police, who will you call when you’re being murdered or robber? Blue lives matter!”, etc\n\nSometimes it’s done on purpose, but I think, most of the time, it’s a result of assuming everything about a topic from a basic slogan or movement name (an example being Black Lives Matter being taken to mean ONLY black lives matter, or feminism being about FEMales being superior, etc), acting like they know everything about the topic and surrounding their entire opinion around that assumption",

    "text": "I typed up your conclusions and some responses:\n\n\n\"The reason this is so important is... by understanding that the nazi's actions followed a rationality derived from their basic assumptions about the world, we are able to grasp the destructive force of racist and anti-semitic ideology of a conspiratorial world-view that is centered around the charge of a group wishing to destroy our values, our way of life.\"\n\n\n\"By simply ascribing the Nazis actions to a wish to cause mayhem to the Mark of Cain, their actions are extraterritorialized from history--exculded from the process of understanding them.\"\n\n\n(Peterson never said the nazi's actions were illogical or irrational per se. He said they seemed irrational if your assumption was that their primary goal was to ensure the economic success of the country. \nTheir actions were in fact very rational if you assume their primary goal was to exterminate as many Jews and so called gypsies as quickly as possible.)\n\n\n\n\"If, as Peterson later posits in the video, the cruelties committed by the Nazi perpetrators  are the result of evil or psychopathology, they are excluded from any attempt to understand them as a manifestation of an ideology.\"\n\n\n\"We can never fully grasp psychopaths, and by pathologizing the perpetrators of the Nazi genocide, we reassure ourselves that we can never become them.\"\n\n\n(psychopathology is actually easy to understand if you are familiar with it. The most easily identifiable characteristic is a profound lack of empathy. A point he makes in his video you reference (long version) is that everyone has an \"inner psychopath\", and it must be harnessed and controlled before it takes you out or takes you over. So, he's definitely NOT saying you simply cannot understand or become Nazis--quite the opposite in fact.)\n\n\n\"Nazism was not just a pathology, and it was not just the result of a want to cause mayhem. Nazis were the result of a concrete worldview\"\n\n\n(The worldview was centered around extremely prejudiced mayhem against certain groups of people. It was not irrational mayhem, and it was indeed founded in a concrete worldview, but it was mayhem nonetheless.)\n\n\n\"If people perceive the world in a way that...\n\n\nposits that certain behaviors, attitudes, and social positions as primordial\n\n\nand that people are not interested in talking to you about them or changing them\n\n\n\nthen conditions brought about by social change, political unrest, or even war, can quickly lead to a political program that, like the Nazis, asserts that the only solution to this problem is for these groups not to live in this world anymore, and to use coercion to assert the natural state of things.\"\n\n\n\n(Assuming this as the solution Jordan is going for to me shows that you don't understand what he is trying to do. \nHe does in fact believe there is a rigid faction in the far left that does not want to be reasoned with. \nHis plan of action so far has been to talk as much as possible to people NOT in this group, and convince them to engage these culturally imposed belief systems as honestly as possible, developing your own individual take on them. He doesn't say you have to believe exactly what he does.\nHe's also constantly on about integrating and controlling your darkest urges [including the ones that lead to genocide], so they don't control you. \nIf anything, he promotes stoicism or individualism, not authoritarianism.)\n\n\nIf you read this plz feedback:)",

It is clear that whatever algorithms are at play in the serving up of content to users are especially skewed towards content that acts as a gateway to the far right.\n\nMy only disagreement with you is that I DO think Peterson is a fascist (of sorts).  He's just acutely aware that openly presenting that way would be counter productive (especially in his line of work), but the fact that his works are so hastily gobbled up by the alt right really says it all.",
