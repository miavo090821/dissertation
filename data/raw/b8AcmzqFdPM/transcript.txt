hello everyone today I want to expand on something I hinted at in a previous video of mine and address the lobster in the room dr. Jordan Peterson most people on YouTube probably know who he is by now but in case you don't I will give you a short overview Jordan Peterson is a professor of psychology at the University of Toronto and rose to stardom not that long ago by misrepresenting the act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and Criminal Code also known as Bill c16 for this he was rewarded with a lot of attention and since then has been fetishized as some kind of free speech model for standing up to the Canadian government who wanted to open the gulags to people accidentally misgendering a person if they find me I won't pay it if they put me in jail I'll go on a hunger strike I'm not doing this that's that with his recent best-selling book twelve rules for life an antidote to chaos he's also become the savior of disaffected young males with messy rooms his main work however are his lectures all of which can be found online and have now also gathered a significant fan base there's one thing that stands out when talking about Jordan Peterson's fan base and that sometimes earns him some uncomfortable questions Maxo marks thoughts on the Jews thoughts on the Jews well the first thing I could say about Jews is that a lot of my friends are happened to be Jewish and okay all right what the hell address the Jewish Question that's a hell of a thing to ask could Jewish individuals use their position of power to seek out revenge against places like Europe and Russia that have a history of exchanges namely that he seems to attract a lot of people from the fringes of the right although he is very opposed to the political views of said fringes his let's say more moderate fan base seems to have no answer for why that is and often claims that if anything Peterson has a moderating effect on people with extremist views pulling them more to the center there is a very popular clip making the rounds which has gathered around 2.3 million views by now and is titled how Hitler was even more evil than you think although I would assume Peterson would probably object to this title because his big thing is that given the right circumstances anyone can be a Nazi prison guard a very revolutionary idea by the way that people are shaped by their surroundings anyway the clip was taken from a longer lecture called maps of meaning 11 the flood and the tower which I will leave in the description so you can make sure I'm not taking him out of context in this lecture he tackles the Nazis motivation for the Holocaust and gives his own perspective on the matter it is unfortunate that as with so many many things he says his own lack of knowledge leads to his points being garbled at best and wrong at worst not only is he completely wrong historically speaking and puts into question if his knowledge of Nazi ideology exceeds Hitler's tabletalk and ordinary men but the way he frames Hitler's or the Nazis motivations showcases why the far-right finds him so appealing he doesn't make any excuses or portrays them positively in any way but what his take and his other work implies fits very well with what the far-right things so we'll look at how he is wrong from historical perspective and why his conclusion is actually dangerous let's listen to the clip shall we so here's what you should have done if you were a Nazi and he wanted to win the war you should have enslaved the Jews and the gypsies and had them work right you had the house should have had them work for the benefit of the victory and then if you wanted to liquidate them afterwards that's the logical thing to do if you want to win and we assume that Hitler wanted to win but that's not a very intelligent assumption why would you assume that he wasn't exactly a good guy so why should we assume that he was aiming at the good that he was promoting even in his own terms right the glorious everlasting fourth Third Reich so what do you do with the Jews and the gypsies well round them up fine enslave them fine you don't kill them you certainly don't devote a substantial proportion of your war resources while you're losing to accelerate the rate at which the extermination is taking place because that's a bit counterproductive unless what you're aiming at is the maximum possible mayhem in the shortest period of time there's a whole lot to unpack just within this short statement there is the fact that Peterson doesn't seem really sure if it's the Nazis third or the imagine by neo-nazis fourth reich he's talking about there is the issue that calling the Roma Sinti and others prosecuted under the labor gypsies the term which reproduces questionable language used by the perpetrators of the Holocaust but the foremost problem is that Peterson doesn't seem to take his own advice seriously now you know you have to that dictum carefully later in the video he cites young of course to make the point that sometimes in order to infer the motivations for an action one needs to look at the outcome of an action you can suspend your unnecessary demolition of people win the damn war and then pick it up afterwards or well you're losing you can just accelerate the mayhem even though it's counterproductive it's like what they pick well they pick to accelerate the mayhem and so to me there's an old psychoanalytic idea I think this was derived by young if you can't figure out what someone is doing or why look at the outcome and infer the motivation that's not really what historians investigating the Nazis and the Third Reich or any period for that matter do not just because not every action might produce the outcome desired by the historical actor but also because and this is something where Peterson should probably have listened to some postmodern theorists if he had read them presents the massive danger of projecting your own cultural and social assumptions and rationalities back onto historical actors who do to difference in historically form discourse might operate under entirely different assumptions and rationalities case in point Jordan Peterson asserts that in order to win the war it would have been more beneficial to round up and enslave Jews and so-called gypsies rather than to kill them this represents a fairly abhorrent application of capitalist logic of valorisation and exploitation under the base assumptions our society in the society Jordan Peterson operates under the mass enslavement and economic exploitation of millions of people represents an understandable a logical policy leaving aside for now that the Nazis did exactly that in addition to mass murder the problem begins when Peterson juxtaposes this supposedly fine logic with what he asserts the Nazis real motif for the actions was mayhem and getting into the metaphysical Union drivel the Mark of Cain or are we going to attribute to Hitler the highest possible motives say no it's an archetypal manifestation of Cain now he's gonna put up a front that says well I'm your savior it's like well destructive people think that Cain is their Savior the reality is simpler yet more complicated at the same time rather than mayhem or any sort of metaphysical manifestation of evil the Nazis are relative be straightforward and telling us their base assumptions upon which their actions and logic is based upon it's not mayhem but rather the idea that the prime objective is the removal up to and including physical extermination of Jews and so-called gypsies from the world winning the war for the Nazi leadership in the German state at the time means achieving that goal war German military theorist Carr von Clausewitz wrote is the extension of politics by other means this dictum is as true for the Nazis as it is for virtually every other war of the 19th and 20th century Nazi politics and ideology is built around one chorus UMP ssin about the nature of society the state and history that all of history including all social formations are built around a biological conflict between races with the most prominent actors on this stage being the German or Aryan race which represents order progress and civilization and the alleged Jewish race which represents chaos decadence decay and destruction since in the Nazi worldview all of history revolves around this conflict so does necessarily the Second World War and the conception of what a German victory looks like in this conflict even with the war itself becoming an important catalyst in radicalizing German policy from discrimination forced immigration and ghettoization to actual physical extermination of Jews in his book the origins of the final solution Christopher browning writes about the important changes that came with the start of the war in 1939 that not only forced the Nazis to consider what they called the Jewish Question in a framework beyond Germany it also represented a qualitative change Germany was now at war for some time Nancy propaganda had branded the Jew as the enemy of Germany if war came it would be through the machinations of international Jewry the Jew was an integral part indeed the quintessence of the Nazi find built or stereotyped image of the enemy now that Germany was at war harsh measures against the enemy including potential enemies non-combatants civilians women children seemed self-evident and justified by national interests we don't even have to look far to get this information straight from the horse's mouth in a speech from January 13 1949 so more than half a year before the invasion of Poland Hitler stated the following today I will once more be a prophet if the International Jewish financiers in and outside Europe should succeed in plunging the nation's once more to a world war then the result will not be the boat is a ssin of the earth and thus the victory of jury but the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe Hitler would echo this prophecy several times in public and after the u.s. entered the conflict propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels wrote in his diary regarding the Jewish Question the fuel is determined to clean the table he prophesized that should the Jews once again bring about a world war they would be annihilated these were no empty words the word war has come therefore the annihilation of the Jews has to be its inevitable consequence the question has to be exempt without any sentimentality we are not here to pity Jews but to have pity for our own German people if the German people have sacrificed about 160 thousand debt and the battles in the East the instigators of this bloody conflict will have to pay for it with their lives but the war did even more than that since in the view of Hitler and the German leadership it represented the manichaean struggle between the German and a Jewish race it both necessitated every conceivable measure and made more radical policy possible it is no coincidence that the order by which the t4 killing program aimed at murdering handicapped and mentally ill individuals in German hospitals and asylums was backdated by Hitler to September 1st 1939 the day of the invasion of Poland the purification of Germany starting with the centralized murder of these units SR or not useful eaters represented a first and necessary step at purifying the German race in a struggle with international Jewry is represented by France the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union alike which leads to another important point it is also no coincidence that what we today consider the holocaust meaning the systematic state-sponsored genocide of so-called gypsies and Jews started with the attack on the Soviet unit in 1941 in the form of the Nazi Einsatz Gorton starting to systematically shoot members of these groups behind the front line the USSR in the view of the Nazi leadership was the physical and material manifestation of the danger of Jewish Bolshevism communism according to Hitler and the German leadership represented the Jews most potent weapon in the historic struggle with the Germans the idea of Judeo Bolshevism had spread like fire from the outside of the Russian Civil War 1917 and had become an integral part of extreme right-wing ideology in Germany during the germinal revolutions of 1918 and 1919 as Lona weddington writes in her book hitler's crusade Bolshevism the Jews and the myth of conspiracy it was the juxtaposition of Asiatic Bolshevism with the oriental Jew that provided the key to National Socialist perceptions of an elaborate Jewish conspiracy of which Marxism with its insistence on eminently Jewish values internationalism egalitarianism and pacifism so antithetical to the focus ideal was a key component in short the war against the Soviet Union was inextricably linked to the war against international Jewry in fact in the view of the German leadership of the Third Reich they were one and the same this is evident in how this war was planned and how the systematic murder of Jews in the Soviet Union was an integral element to its planning from the beginning it was a war of extermination in which the victory meant nothing short of the total physical and political annihilation of the Soviet Union and especially its Jewish population in his study of Varma generals on the Eastern Front hitless a few ha historian Johanna Souter shows how deeply ingrained this idea of the war against the Soviet Union being a war of extermination against international Jewry was among the vemma leadership as well for instance the writings of general Hammond hood who during and after the war constantly emphasized these factors by writing among other things that Stalin's Soviet Union was a Bolshevist Asiatic and Jew a fight state that spread like an oil spill and like an oil spill needed to be contained 1941 was the last possible point in time to stop the flood of Jewish Bolshevism at the borders of Europe what all of this shows is that rather than some abstract form of mayhem there was a concrete discernable and explicit basic assumption about the world that dictated the Nazis actions and logic of these actions victory in the war meant the annihilation of the Jews and so-called gypsies this was the idea that both the Holocaust and the very nature of the war how it was planned organized and executed was centered around this is the reason why the items column started off the systematic murder of Jews and so-called gypsies in the Soviet Union 1900 one why the death camps opened their doors in 1942 and why the German leadership started accelerating the program of genocide even in 1944 because to them victory was impossible without genocide it's also the reason why based on this assumption the Nazis did build a system that followed premises that Peterson calls logical and fine the Nazis did enslave Jews and so-called gypsies and forced them to work in the German war machine millions of Jews and so called gypsies worked for the Iggy fab Manaus wits built v2 rocket sites and the Rockets themselves and manufactured goods for the Vermont also there expropriated assets from robbed art houses and money to the sale of gold teeth and even hay of murdered Jews netted the German Reich millions of high schmuck that were invested in the war economy economists Zinda is a blue dog writes that in late 1930s prices the value of jewish assets amounted to ten to fifteen billion dollars this estimate is based on a 1998 paper by this author its methodology draws on the pioneering efforts by Nehemia Robinson in the 1940s and 1950s and other material this includes estimates of the Jewish share of where for each country in nazi-occupied Europe tax records country estimates published at the time and the SI declarations that the Nazis forced the Jews to file in today's prices today being 2005 the value of these Jewish assets would be some 143 to 215 billion dollars the Holocaust which the Nazis very much organized as a for-profit venture contributed to set capacity while taking a very little resources in manpower the chemists financed themselves and generated surplus profit and even the killing campaign was organized in a way that provided what the Nazis perceived as economic benefits nowhere is this more evident than when it comes to food policy historian Christian gala details this in his book keek and Nihon Falcom watt when he writes that under the impressions of the german experiences of the first world war it was an absolute priority of the german leadership to have the German populace fed they succeeded in this given that in the terms of calories the German population was the second best fed one after the u.s. Americans during the entire war the way this was achieved ties in directly with the Holocaust and the program of economic exploitation not only did Germans go as fast to cause a catastrophic famine in Greece but one of the very motives by the extermination program sped up in 1942 with the operation Reinhard death camp starting to operate in Poland was that the Nazis wanted to save food you don't have to feed dead people and to kill 1.9 million people you otherwise would have to feed no matter how bad it allowed the right leadership to keep rations comparatively high for the German population and here's where we get to what I called dangerous conclusions earlier the reason this is so important and why Jordan Peterson's musings of Nazism are so objectionable is rather simple by understanding that the Nazis actions followed a rationality derived from their basic assumptions about the world we are able to grasp the destructive force of racist and anti-semitic ideology of a conspiratorial worldview that is centered around the charge of a group wishing to destroy our values our way of life by simply ascribing the Nazis actions to a wish to cause mayhem to the mark of cain their actions are ex territorial eyes from history excluded from the process of understanding them if as Peterson later posits in the video the cruelty is committed by the Nazi perpetrators are the result of evil or up psychopathology they are excluded from any attempt to understand them as a manifestation of an ideology we can never fully grasp Psychopaths and by pathologizing the perpetrators of the Nazi genocide we reassure ourselves that we can never become them but Nazism was not a pathology and it was not just the wish to cause mayhem Nazis were the result of a concrete worldview a worldview not too dissimilar to that Jordan Peterson and other figures the far-right flux who are trying to peddle today if like Peterson people perceive the world in a way that posits certain behaviors attitude and social positions of certain people as primordial like for instance Peterson claims in his book 12 rules for life in stating culture as symbolically archetypically mythical email chaos the unknown is symbolically associated with the feminine and further asserts that there are certain groups that are trying to disrupt the natural order of things with a nefarious agenda and the second thing it's an assault on is everything that's been established since the Enlightenment rationality empiricism science everything clarity of mind dialogue the idea of the individual all of that is is normally you'd see it's not only that it's up for grabs that's not the thing it's to be destroyed that's the goal even going as far as to claim the supposed group isn't even interested in talking to you you see and this isn't this isn't this is no aberration that these people don't engage in dialogue that it's no aberration it's built right into the philosophical system they regard the idea of the idea that if you're in one power group and I'm in another the idea that we can step out of that group engage in a dialogue have our worlds meet and produce some sort of understanding of yeah yeah some sort of negotiated understanding no that's part of your your oppressive patriarchal game that idea that whole idea is part of your game so if I even engage in the dialogue I'm playing your game you win then conditions brought about by social change political unrest or even war can quickly lead to a political program that like the Nazis is such that the only solution to this problem is for these groups not to live in this world anymore and to use coercion to assert the natural state of things that's it for today folks and just to make it clear here again I don't think Jordan Peterson is a fascist or Nazi or whatever but that's irrelevant to this video anyway if you notice a significant increase in the depth of historical research this time that's no coincidence the majority of the script was written as a guest episode in collaboration with Joe a fellow German speaker and PhD candidate in history who goes by the name commie space invader on the internet he spends a lot of his time answering questions and moderating the ask historian subreddit which I mentioned in past videos it's an educational community currently with 750,000 subscribers where people can post their questions about history and have them answered by actual historians and experts in the subjects sometimes you might even see me there asking or answering a question so definitely check it out via the link in the description and in the near future Joe and I will also do a live stream together where we will answer your questions about Nazi Germany the Holocaust as well as fighting bad history on the Internet I'll announce that separately though when I know the final date as always a big thank you to my lovely patrons who helped me pay books sparring fees or access to certain studies among other things for a list of the used sources in this video you can check the description and with that I hope to see you next time have a good one
