Justice Clarence Thomas is facing 
no heat over this widening ethics   Scandal Propublica exposed and Thomas 
has this close secret relationship   with a super donor a republican 
official billionaire Harlan Crow if I wanted to show y'all what it looked 
like when a person believed that the law   should apply to everybody but themselves will 
I show you all the police but today I'm going   to show you Clarence Thomas who is Clarence 
Thomas hmm well it depends on how far back   you want to go if we're talking last year well 
then Clarence Thomas is the man who voted to   overturn the right to an abortion and stated 
that the court had a duty to correct the error   by ridding us of a bunch of other rights except 
wait for it the right to interracial marriages alert because he may not care about you but he 
damn sure not gonna let nothing get in between   him and his Honey Bunches of Oats child if we're 
going way back way back well then Clarence Thomas   is the man who should have never been allowed 
to occupy the same seat as the Thurgood Marshall   because he's not only who sexually harassed Anita 
Hill he's an unprincipled he's a who's quick to   admonish and distance himself from the black 
community and any acknowledgment of the racism   we face until of course he's on trial for sexual 
assault then he suddenly remembers lynchings as   a black American as far as I'm concerned it 
is a high-tech luncheon for uppity blacks   who in any way deign to think for themselves how 
convenient is that and if we're talking today well   then Clarence Thomas is an ethically bankrupt 
Supreme Court Justice who's in fake trouble   right now I say fake trouble because let's be 
real with ourselves nothing's gonna happen now   why is Clarence in trouble you ask well he didn't 
just violate his ethical requirements to report   any gifts above 415 in value oh no baby
Clarence was getting flewed out living   high off the Hog on the tab of his Republican 
billionaire Mega donor sugar daddy Harlan Crowe   no but dad asked Clarence Thomas has been running 
it up for the city boys he's been running it up   for so long two decades in fact that his Sugar 
Daddy then memorialized him in a painting at   the crib oh my God is this Who We Are is this 
what we represent do you know how heavy you got   a somebody to have them painted in the year of 
Our Lord do you know how often this man had to   comfortably kick it in a garden full of Nazi 
memorabilia to be memorialized in a painting   hey and I don't care what the White supremacists 
and the Republicans tell you on Twitter nobody   that don't put Nazis buys Nazi memorabilia there 
are other ways to remember since you hate baby   there are other ways I'm scared of dolls you 
know what I don't got a garden full of dolls   but seriously let's count all the unethical 
licks Clarence Thomas done hit on behalf of   City Boys everywhere because I really don't 
want you to walk away erroneously believing   and dismissing this as him just failing to report 
a couple of trips on JetBlue pro-publica reports for more than two decades Thomas has accepted 
luxury trips virtually every year from Harlan   Crow without disclosing them Thomas has been 
vacationing at Top Ridge every summer and Jet   setting with Crow around the world for more 
than two decades Top Ridge is Crow's private   Lakeside Resort a 105 acre property once 
the summer Retreat of the same heiress who   built Mario Lake Mar-A-Lago mar-a Lego you 
know where Trump be kicking it features an   artificial waterfall in a great hall where 
crows guests are served meals prepared by   private Chef's child also when sugar daddy 
crows dime Clarence and his wife yes the same   wife that Clarence Thomas refused to recuse 
himself from cases related to her involvement   in the January 6th attempt to overturn the 
2020 presidential election yes that wife   Thomas and His insurrectionist says wife spent 
nine days island hopping on a super yacht getting   waited on by private attendance for a trip that 
cost more than 500 000 dollars speaking of the   wife it ain't no fun if the homies can't get 
some too so Crow also gave her half a million   dollars to a tea party group that was founded 
by her and he paid her 120 000 salary [Music] there's an important reason why judges are 
required to report Gifts of a particular value   although no government institution can truly be 
a non-political body despite anyone's best wishes   the rationale behind giving the Supreme Court 
Justice's lifetime appointments is that by not   having to worry about being reelected reappointed 
or the usual political processes judges will be   protected from partisan pressures the Supreme 
Court has an extra responsibility to appear fair   or impartial and not like our regular politicians 
in Congress who have known party allegiances and   agendas they must count to which is why If 
we're honest the existence itself of so close   the relationship between a sitting Supreme Court 
Justice and a republican super donor should draw   scrutiny let alone when that Supreme Court justice 
has knowingly and repeatedly chosen to forego its   ethics in exchange for lavish living for he and 
his crooked ass wife but propublica reported the   details of its discussions with Thomas over the 
years remain unknown and it's unclear if Crow   has had any influence on the Justice's views is it 
unclear is it unclear I wonder whether being best   friends with a republican Mega donor who financed 
the documentary on his life pays his wife's salary   and gave a hundred and five thousand dollars to 
Yale law school his alma mater for the Justice   Thomas portrait fund because his Crow put it he 
and his wife have funded a number of projects that   celebrate Clarence Thomas because we believe it is 
important to make sure as many people as possible   learn about him remember him and understand the 
ideals for which he stands mind you I think it's   really interesting that the San Clarence Thomas 
that says he has a problem with affirmative action   and because his Yale degree wasn't worth as much 
because he got it from there has no problem having   money donated to make things in his honor at that 
same school he wanted to close the door behind him   for other black students to attend hmm Crow is a 
man who was given more than 10 million dollars in   publicly disclosed political contribution and 
that's only what he's disclosed because as he   put it I don't disclose what I'm not required 
to disclose Crowe has long supported efforts to   move the Judiciary to the right now ask yourself 
whether any of this could have influenced Clarence   Thomas's views and decisions and be real with 
yourself when you ask it while you're thinking   it over do so with the understanding that Clarence 
Thomas did all of this knowingly Clarence Thomas   made this recent statement early in my tenure at 
the court I sought guidance from my colleagues and   others in the Judiciary and was advised that this 
sort of personal Hospitality from personal friends   who did not have business before the court was not 
reportable Justice Thomas said I have endeavored   to follow that Council throughout my tenure and 
have always sought to comply with the disclosure   guidelines lies lies and more lies and lies on top 
of lies Thomas knew exactly what he was doing and   even if there were world where he did it which 
is not this world we live in it wouldn't matter   because surely a man sitting on the highest 
court in the land knows the basic legal Maxim   that ignorance is not an excuse for the law 
and as an attorney let me just say this you're   never exempt from knowing your professional and 
ethical responsibilities but more importantly he   knew and you know how I know that he knows that he 
was supposed to disclose it I mean besides for the   fact that it stated plainly in the rules that 
he's required to and most certainly does know   because in 1997 Harlan Crowe took him on a 
fancy trip and spent 19 thousand dollars on   Frederick douglass's Bible for Clarence 
Thomas and fifteen thousand dollars on a   bust of Abraham Lincoln for Clarence Thomas and 
then he reported it and in 2004 the Los Angeles   Times published a piece about it for which 
he got Flack and then he never disclosed it   again so baby sounds like you knew sounds 
like you didn't like the obvious deserved   and rightful scrutiny so you stopped telling 
people but more importantly again he knew the   filing instructions for judicial officers and 
employees rules for gift States plainly report   information on gifts aggregating more than 415 
dollars in value received by the filer spouse   and dependent child from any Source other than 
a relative during the reporting period and he   can't say he didn't know he needed to report 
running around the place on Harlan's private   jet because that's his friend because again the 
rules clearly State the personal Hospitality gift   reporting exemption applies only to food lodging 
or entertainment and is intended to cover such   Gifts of a personal non-business nature except the 
exemption does not include gifts other than food   lodging or entertainment such as transportation 
that substitutes for commercial transportation   like a Billionaire's private jet baby as a 
result called for his resignation she said this   I think that his own statement contradicts 
contradicts many of the facts on the ground   and also raises in other ways even more serious 
questions later on in his statement he stated   that the reason and the rationale for this 
exemption was personal Hospitality from an   old friend and he said himself in his statement 
a friend of 25 years Justice Thomas has been on   the court for 30 years and so to say what he is 
admitting in his statement in an attempt to defend   himself is that he began this relationship with a 
billionaire and receiving these sorts of gifts as   after he was appointed to the Supreme Court of the 
United States I think that that in and of itself   indicates a very very serious problem and then on 
top of that he is now implicating his colleagues   and I do believe that Chief Justice John Roberts 
must now come forward and and state if he   allows and is allowing this kind of very serious 
corruption to happen on on this court I agree with   AOC here but Clarence Thomas showed himself to 
be a worse man than this incident reveals him   to be at the time of his confirmation hearings 
and they still put him on the bench so they're   certainly not going to remove him now but 
he's still the conch shell of the week and   a Relentless disappointment [Music] did y'all 
know that dodo birds couldn't fly yeah poor   flightless babies and like in the 1600s the Dutch 
discovered them on an island in the Indian Ocean   and then they brought all kind of [ __ ] to the 
island that caused my babies to go extinct dog rip
