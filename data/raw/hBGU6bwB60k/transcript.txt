I mean they're killing my friends as simple as that and I've been over years that I've been alive so you don't agree then I mean when people say oh it's okay for him he's escaped for what have I escaped where anyway would I go to escape to your country whoever the fleeing black man go we wanted to escape if you break Faith with what you know that's a betrayal of many many many many people I may know six people but that's enough love has never been a popular movement and no one's ever wanted ready to be free the world is held together really it is held together but the love and the passion of very few people foreign [Music] yes that does mean I believe we need to abolish prisons policing and America's entire criminal system as it exists but we recognize that the powers of B won't simply open up all the cells and close all the courts tomorrow just as we recognize that we do not yet have the resources the institutions and the support systems in place to make that feasible but we also recognize that mass incarceration is invested in ensuring that we never do which is why the first thing you should know is that abolition is a vision for the future a world where we've divested from police courts and prisons because instead of pumping money into the criminalization of the most disenfranchised among us we put that money into addressing the root causes of crime like poverty unemployment or housing star of school systems mental health issues and more we must reckon with what our criminal system is to understand why abolition isn't about depriving us of the means to stop crime or address harm it's allowing us to design a system where we do those things for the very first time because that is not what we currently do mass incarceration is slavery a fact that the 13th Amendment explicitly acknowledges by abolishing slavery except for anyone convicted of a crime in the same breath that the U.S government purported to abolish slavery they established the means to continue the practice and slavery is as much a business as it is a sin and a business is meant not just to continue but to expand to make more and more money nearly 2 million people are incarcerated in America over 400 000 of whom have not had a trial or been convicted of any crime nearly 60 percent of all incarcerated people are black or Latino and the vast majority of incarcerated people earned wages below the poverty line prior to their arrest and America makes over 11 billion dollars yearly in Goods produced by prison labor both private and public incarcerated and formally incarcerated people owe at least 27.6 billion dollars in fines and fees Nationwide their families spend over 2.9 billion dollars in commissaries each year in addition to another 14.8 billion dollars in costs associated with moving eviction and homelessness brought on by these cases no system that is designed and maintained in furtherance of making money by subjugating and imprisoning specific populations for allegedly committing certain harms simultaneously intends to rid us of those harms and thus their means of production so if slavery is a system of bondage where a person is treated as property deprived of their freedom and personal Liberty and forced to perform labor for another's gain mass incarceration is slavery and it's making the rich richer and absolutely no one safer but I understand that in spite of everything I'm going to say to you if this is the first time you're hearing about abolition or maybe you even know a little about it it might seem impossible or crazy and that's fair the first time I heard about abolition I was a junior in college being introduced to our prisons obsolete by Angela Davis by my thesis advisor and it sounded crazy to me too but if you want to change someone's mind about something the first thing you need to understand what I believe my professor understood when she referred me to Angela Davis instead of engaging how taken aback I was at the very concept of abolition is that nobody ever abandons their entire world view the first time it's challenged it doesn't matter how many facts stats case studies compelling narratives or undeniable evidence you have on your side people simply do not rip the foundation out from under themselves at the first indication that there may be cracks people believe what they're taught and rarely on their own do they have occasion to question what was presented to them as fundamental truths the sky's blue grass is green cops are good robbers are bad Justice is served when someone goes to jail but just having it brought to my attention that we didn't always have or rely on prisons combined with the realization that there are other countries that do not invest in punitive prison systems and instead invest in genuinely care based community-based rehabilitative models immediately shifted my world just learning that it was possible to have a society without prisons instantly diminished how radical the mayor's suggestion had seen seemed to me because up until that point I'd never noticed that because I was born into a world with prisons I thought they were as natural to Earth as dirt Water and Air rather than the man-made institutions that they are but before we can understand how we get to abolition and why it's necessary we first must understand why mass incarceration and prisons aren't and exactly what they're meant to accomplish when you say you want to abolish the prison industrial complex or more specifically policing in prisons one of the first things people ask you is how then will we stop crime and the premise that underlines that question that our existing system does this is wrong because our criminal system does not address stop or prevent crime because that's not what it's intended to do in fact it's meant to reproduce it America's criminal system is a vehicle from maintaining racial social and economic inequality by criminalizing poor black and brown communities using them for labor and saddling them with debt trauma and rap sheets whose lifelong collateral consequences can rarely be outrun it's not a coincidence that the same communities dubbed high crime areas are those most under-resourced and remain that way generation after generation we all want to live in a society that is free of crime and the social ills that reproduce It But continuing to invest in policing and mass incarceration of communities whose well-being we've never invested in only takes us further and further away from that goal in America the police killed at least 1195 people in 2020 that we know of and they've already killed 320 people this year black people were 26 percent of people killed by police in 2022. despite being only 13 percent of the population according to the Vera Institute of Justice police arrest someone every three seconds in this country yet a 2020 review from University of Utah Professor Shima burgom found the police solve just two percent of all major crimes but the United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world and spends an estimated 300 billion dollars yearly on policing in prisons a figure that has continued to Skyrocket despite record drops in crime yet political leaders in the media continue to sensationalize and manufacture crime waves to scare the public into feeling unsafe no matter how divorced that feeling is from reality so that we continue to support inflated police budgets militarized police departments and incarcerating residents of the most under-resourced communities still people act abolitionists what will we do about the rapists and the murderers without prisons first it's worth noting that more than 80 percent of arrests Nationwide are from misdemeanors low-level and non-violent offenses rape murder and other horrific and sensationalized crimes are simply not a reflection of the bulk of what's in our criminal system they're just What receives the most media attention further and importantly condemning violence doesn't stop it from reoccurring understanding and alleviating the causes of violence does but to the question what do we do about the rapists to that I ask what are we doing about them now in a piece for the guardian titled who will protect you from rape without police Moira Donegan answers the question perfectly and she says and I quote but the notion that abolishing the police will have negative repercussions for women radically misunderstands both American policing and sexual violence police abolition need not be considered an abdication of the responsibility to protect women but rather a way to fulfill it police never investigate most sexual violence because most sexual violence goes unreported according to the rape and incest national network or Reign a little less than 25 percent of sexual assaults are reported to the police significantly less than other violent crimes there is ample evidence that sexual assault victims who distrust the police are correct police departments systematically failed to make arrests in sexual assault cases and their failures are mirrored throughout the justice system according to rain only 4.6 percent of sexual assaults ever lead to arrest 4.6 and only 0.9 percent are ever referred by police to prosecutors conviction rates are also lower than for other violent crimes in part because of police mishandling the sexual assault cases then there's this troubling fact the police themselves are often perpetrators of gender violence and they frequently use the Privileges and protections of their job to hurt women with impunity police households have dramatically higher rates of domestic violence than other homes with approximately 40 percent of officers having intimate partner violence in their households compared to just 10 percent of the general population sometimes police failures to investigate sexual violence look like the result not just of stupidity but outright duplicity she says one study of the New York Police Department discovered it was knowingly under counting rapes in its public figures using a deliberately strict definition of rape in order to shrink the number of reported rapes in New York an inquiry into the NYPD founded Special Victims Unit division to be grossly dysfunctional with officers instructed to simply not investigate misdemeanor sexual assault cases conservative estimates indicate that American police departments have over 200 000 untested rape kits in their possession with DNA samples that could be used to identify rapists and prevent future assaults collecting dust often because police have not bothered to send them to be tested on top of that a 2015 investigation by the Associated Press found that roughly one thousand officers lost their badges in a six-year period for rape sodomy and other sexual assault sex crimes that included possession of child pornography or sexual misconduct such as propositioning Citizens or having consensual but prohibited on duty intercourse a 2003 National study by the police professionalism initiative found that 40 percent of reported case of police sexual misconduct involve teens often young women involved in youth engagement and job shadowing programs despite our reluctance to State plainly with mass incarceration is it's why abolition is neither radical nor unnecessary abolition is about preventing harm and the fundamental recognition that what we're doing now doesn't do that because it's not meant to instead it makes matters worse because it's meant to even if we believe that there are just bad poor people doing violent things what is solved by locking those people in a box and making them spend every waking moment defending themselves from violence sexual assault and other abuses all while trying to survive the psychological abuses of incarceration if we also saddle them with fines and criminal convictions that prevent them from ever leaving Poverty of the circumstances that led them to prison not only have we done nothing to address the violent crime that's been condemned we've given them every reason to act violently in the future then those people are released and sent back into the same struggling under-resourced communities that's why mass incarceration only ensures that communities that were already plagued by crime and violence never Escape it that's the problem with using prisons to disappear people while never addressing the underlying problems the problem survive even if the people don't that's why AI defunding the police ending cash bail and other laws policy and reform efforts that actually take power away from the state and decarcerate are Central to getting us to a world without policing in prisons but welfare doesn't create that world it is precisely what keeps 2 million people locked behind bars while the social ills that led them their rage on unaddressed is what keeps us protesting America's criminal system all while continuing to invest in that system it's not fair of the people we've locked away it's fair of the Reckoning with the fact that despite incarcerating more people than anywhere else in the world and spending more money on some local police departments than other countries spend on their militaries you aren't and don't feel any safer the fear isn't starting over the daunting task of what it would mean to start from scratch the fear of trying to create something new and possibly failing the fear of admitting that all the horror mass incarceration has caused was for naught and knowing that what's been done to people communities Generations cannot be made right fair just like guilt and defensiveness cannot create but it does keep us stuck in place hiding our problems Behind Bars [Music] everybody knew peacocks were flies but did you know they could fly like we knew they ran they're always walking freely about the zoo but knowing that they know how to fly really adds a different layer to it and we recently learned that they could fly because one of them peacocks flew their ass out the Bronx Zoo went gallivanting through the night and came back when it was good and ready child
