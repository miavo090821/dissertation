The host merely proceeded to point out everything that is wrong with the current system, and even sprinkled in a little victim blaming. Yes, we know that the current system isn’t working, that’s why we’re here watching this video, what is the alternative that this movement offers? “Prevent it from happening”, I love that idea, but what, specifically, is the solution for someone who is found to be a murder or rapist, or a serial murder or rapist, or perhaps a serial murder or rapist whom is affected with psychopathy or sociopathy? There are some people in this world, usually through no fault of their own, that are mentally unable to participate in society without harming others. What specifically does this movement do with someone who has committed a murder or rape.\nMy question remains unanswered",

In a society free of jails, the resources and the community must be focused in the systematic problems that are the roots of these kind of conducts. This is very important, because they're the actions that change the dynamics we currently have (very well explained in the video).\n\nBut if the assault is still commited, the community should center their attention on the victim and helping them to overcome the traumatic experience. What do they need to feel safe again? What do they need from the perpetrator? What can we do about it, as their community? \n\nI hope I could convey the idea, english is not my first language and I read about this answer in a translation in mine, but it's in a chapter of Penal Abolitionism: Papers from the Penal Law, Abolition and Anarchism \r\nConference Volume I by J. M. Moore.",

You used a lot of stats to show why what we're doing now isn't working, which is good, but it seems a bit like a deflection.\n\nEven if we say for the sake of argument that only 1% of crimes are done by truly horrible and broken people, what gets done about them? It's easy to say \"just fix the issues that create them\" but some people have a normal life and end up being horrific monsters anyway. What do we do about these people? What about the ones that no amount of therapy or help will work on? We can't pretend these types don't exist just because it's convenient to our argument. There NEEDS to be a solid answer for this aspect of the argument, otherwise the vast majority of people will never be on board, because why would they advocate for something that makes them feel unsafe?",

As such, it begs the question: \"What about amoral sociopaths that will just pretend to change their minds only to immediately get back to harming others? Or those that are entirely unresponsive to treatment?\"\nIn which situation, I'd settle and say that \"Okay, we can have them removed from society, but just for these guys and on comfortable terms (think Norwegian low-security prisons)\".

I call them \"wrongdoers\" not really because they have a \"wrong\" worldview, but rather because what they're doing is often antisocial (in the \"being a jerk\" sense). Even if you think that we're all a mix of quantum randomness and relativistic physics, the question only changes from \"How do we convince them to change their ways\" to \"How do we fire up the neural patterns associated with seeing things our way\"",

    "text": "I think alot of these points are super valid, and i agree that incarceration is not a good deterent for violent crimes, but if i heard my neighbor killed someone i wouldn't want them to still live their lives unchecked in the same community as me. Like, what would happen? Nothing? Ostrization by the community (which could turn into a witch hunt in some cases i think)? Being put into mental institutions, even if theyre of sound mind but killed out of spite, or raped out of lust? Like what would happen? Im not saying that the fear of being locked up prevents violent criminals, and the prison system certainly does not rehabilite these people, but people who murder and rape just going about their day to day lives would probably lead to communities taking justice into their own hands, which in those cases is valid but could tip over into vigilanteism and witch hunts. Im not against the general idea of abolition, i just cant think of a good solution for these cases, even if they are rare compared to the many people locked up for victimless crimes and misdemeanors",

I won a court case after being falsely accused of harassment & the detective involved in the case is now being investigated by the feds & the woman is being investigated by the feds as well. I spoke with Internal Affairs & The Feds back in April of this year. Few months after winning my case back in February of this year. If the detective is found of wrong-doing he could face a kidnapping charge, along with other charges. The woman that falsely accused me according to both Internal Affairs & The Feds will face multiple charges once the investigation wraps up. Most black incarcerated people are put in jail for crimes they didn't commit, resulting in years of physical and emotional harm done to the victims, and the actual criminals (false accusers) either only getting a year in prison, or not convicted.",

This is obviously a small minority, but they do exist, and the Paul Bernardos, and the Ted Bundys of the world are what your average citizen cares about. \n\nI think need to confront the fact that what society did with these people before formalized law enforcement or prisons was some form of what we might call mob violence. Now with the history of America being what it is, we know that mob violence can be extremely ugly and racist form. But given the immense consequences of formalizing arrest and enforcement powers in the hands of a small number of individuals, is the system we created that much better. Are we safer with the police than with the so called mob? Given that average citizens could not defend themselves from the mafia for fear of imprisonment for vigilantism, while that mafia ran with impunity because the police were on the take, the answer might be no.",

Articulating that in the video proper, would likely save you some time in the comment section, unless this a 4D chess move to drive engagement, in which case well done.\n\n I don't believe it myself, I think interpersonal violence is something far more intrinsic to the human condition than we would like to admit, but moving to an abolitionist system is still a laudable goal and \"what we do with the inexplicably violent now that the prisons are gone,\" is so far off it's not likely to be a real concern until much, much later.",

Prisons are, in my view, an appallingly bad way of preventing criminal activity -  in most cases they achieve the opposite - but people need to be protected from some people.

        "text": "Well, I think the point of this whole thing is to find the underlying reasons as to why people \"commit crimes\". It's to try to get people the help they need before resort to breaking the law. Most offenses are a result of poverty, so we have to adress that, as well as really invest in mental health services. We also have to make sure the people incarcerated right now get rehabilitated into society to prevent further offenses on their part. All of this would go a long way to prevent people committing criminal offenses. \n\nAs for sexual violence, I think that mostly comes down to social awareness. A huge part of that is raising our boys in a way where they treat women like human beings, where they take no for an answer, just raise them to be respectable human beings. Of course everyone needs to be taught to respect boundaries regardless of gender, but we have to recognise that in most cases women are the victims. Social awareness also helps to not let people get away with these things, so we also empower victims. \n\nIf all of this works as it should in an ideal situation, we'd probably eliminate like 90-99% of crimes. We might never reach this, but the point is to work towards this either way. And if we only have a handful of people resorting to criminal offenses, would we even need prisons then? Maybe we would need a facility for the absolute worst of the worst, but that's a problem to solve then. The point of all of this is just to work towards a society where prisons are no longer necessary. If there are no longer anyone who would justifyably need to be locked up, why keep empty prisons around? That's at least how I understand it",

I’m here to say that in many cases it rots their brains. They become racist jerks even when they know not to say stuff. We may need prisons for the “big stuff” but most of the time prison hurts and damages more than it helps. I have met inmates directly, being a nurse and having cared for them. But being an inmate warps the relationship I would normally have with my patient and I hate that.  \n\nI want to know what would happen to our society if the money spent on police and prison were instead dedicated to lifting people up, good schools good homes and good health care. (Including mental health) \n\nYes it would be very hard, because the results of generational poverty won’t go away instantly. We have to change so many assumptions about human nature, and the roots of violence. I’m not sure many in power are brave enough to try, but nothing will change until we do try.",

And rape is like other crimes indicative of mental problems drug problems or bc of poverty as poorer people are more likely to commit crimes, so how do you solve this. REHABILITATION FOR ALL OF THAT that's your answer and you can look up pereto principle debunked on YouTube it took me 3 seconds to find one stop watching jordan Peterson. And I know Switzerland and Portugal has prison I mentioned how they solved the drug crisis in their borders and that helped reduce crime as a whole.

        "text": "@SouthPilot Rewatch the video, genius. Abolition isn't the immediate release of all criminals, but the slow and gradual process by which we bring about a world wherein such crimes are less likely to happen, and rehabilitate criminals when they do. Such an approach is favorable not only because it is more humane than the current paradigm, but because it is also more cost-effective. This is because incarceration is wildly expensive, especially in America; rehabilitation is more expensive per person, but not only do rehabilitated individuals have more opportunity to labor and contribute to the economy in the long run than do prisoners, but a post-abolition world would also have less people to rehabilitate, meaning that abolition may actually be profitable in the long term. Furthermore, incarceration has been shown to have a weak and possibly positive correlation with crime rates (that is, imprisoning people may actually decrease public safety), so a post-abolition world would also be safer. TLDR: abolition is more humane, more cost-effective, and safer than incarceration.",

Their prisons appear far more humane than ours, and their recidivism rates are radically lower than ours.  I ask because their system is far superior to ours, but they are still, fundamentally, prisons.",

Are we only concerned with rehabilitation, or does punishment factor into the equation?",
