just for seven minutes straight I ain't never heard somebody be called a in so many ways in my life this how we started okay I understand this MTO devil at his core there's no reason why I should respect and telling me Oh the beat me too bad so I couldn't reply it's stuned me Drake is fit in with black people at a time Drake is fit with white like he fits in with everybody and he uses each side Drake picks and chooses when to move in and out of his blackness [Music] all right hello beautiful black people let me tell you why I've convened you here today really it's the call the time of death on Drake it really is and I I want y'all to know up front Tahoe is going to be fighting for his life and be on his own and it's not because I set it up to where there'd be an Army against Tahoe it's that I only know reasonable [ __ ] and look how look how we starting this how we starting the impression that Drake didn't get ripped in half the only nonblack the only black person I know that that is under the impression never said that didn't get ripped in half oh oh you know oh so you know no do what he did i' waiting for that if go back and in my tweets I I know y'all ain't getting hype off of this pushups and everything he's doing he's doing that because he knows what Kendrick Lamar is capable of we all know that since Kendrick Lamar was doing mixtapes before he even dropped his first album he was been beat half that's he is but what didn't expect not one of Y was Drake what he push none of expect him to come at five no no no all right so all right come on let's be real I did because I I understand this MTO devil at his court all right we we pull the clothes off immediately he's more milk I wouldn't so I'm I'm G tell you I'm so so initially I didn't expect him to respond but I knew he was going to respond when other [ __ ] jumped into the [ __ ] because that was that put him at that put him at an advantage that he didn't have when it was just kindri and the reason why push-ups works because I still think push-ups is it's push-ups is emblematic of Drake's whole career if any other rapper did it we wouldn't be impressed you know what I'm saying push-ups is the is the equivalent of light-skinned privilege on on record um and so I knew he was do it because if he I'm SM look I had a little nap in between and I got some coffee right here so I'm ready uh and so when when cuz the strategically speaking to be able to go at five six different people on record it just it just charges you up that's like that one it charges you up in the booth it looks better to the to the to the viewer and it means he doesn't have to spend a lot of time truly analyzing and breaking down Kendrick who unless he got some ill dirt on him I don't know lot that he can say other than the short short jokes um and and that his fan base rightfully so will look at look at him valiantly for fighting back against a a collection of stars going against him so what is this what is are the outfits okay listen what does that make out want open break up to that line of attack do you want to do this off can we first figure out like what of what bases oh no not you uh Kenny that was what bases are you using to defend Drake then because you said that he possibly got murdered by Kendrick in this entire exp I personally think you know going on one [ __ ] for nearly seven minutes means you got a vendetta and you got things to say so I'm curious like what what what sword are you falling on is it like I mean cuz if he Wasing with just the outfits we we don't need to hear it yeah I'm like but but while you fig figure that out um speaking of the line of attack and hating him right I think it's funny that he's like he makes his DMX like Kendrick makes the DMX reference the the you know I I hate you I hate the way way you walk I hate the way you talk I hate the way you dress and like his Kendrick's whole thesis is this [ __ ] is actually attack like detached from Black Culture and he just be co-op in this [ __ ] only for Drake to get on his story and think it's a 10 Things I Hate About You movie reference yeah the and people were eating that up only if if DMX said this you know rip right to DMX and if he said this he was just like you know I just I hate everything about you do you think that Kendrick Lamar will really go to that movie uh and no it was off of a great DMX said this about you [ __ ] and I'mma go I'm going to definitely put that in the song so that's for the people in the back in the back row like I said earlier for y'all that's like oh you know that's weak like he's he's so somebody did a whole um list of oh Kendrick is that really pop right I genuinely think you have to be delute like I when I said to you I've never in my life like when I say I was fighting nobody I've never felt so confident that any [ __ ] on the opposing side is lying like to like the out like it's not like you don't like listen I'm a I'm not a drake hater at all I am of the mindset that most people when they be telling like Hayden on Drake you click on their music library and there's a whole lot of [ __ ] Drake in there Drake is a [ __ ] that's been on the billboard on the charts like consistently for like well over 10 years like I'm not gonna perpetrate like I don't you know you know what you and and and and and and Fe probably gonna coine this since he got a bug in my house anyway um the the the thing with Drake is that and this is why The Gatekeepers ain't want to let Drake in from jump is this whole discourse that we having around the the defense that most of the most of the Drake Defenders are given this whole discourse we're having is exactly what the gatekeeper saw Happening by letting Drake have that Crown in the first place that now the culture is almost compl completely divorced from the struggle that informed it in the first place so now you got [ __ ] like you know Adam 22 and academics and all these other [ __ ] you know using Billboards and using you know oh well uh Kendrick ain't say nothing new I said this earlier well n and Jay ain't say nothing new what they were saying that the streets was already saying what they were what they were saying about that that's such a trash argument because what that means is you know this [ __ ] about this [ __ ] and you still a fan yeah I know a lot about him and I'm still a fan I know a lot about I know more most about him is that he is one person that has fought more fights more rap battles and won and stayed on top if we talking about rap we're talking about me talk one many fight fight he won he won one he's down too now he lost Pusher and Kendrick killed him yesterday kendri kri came back with a good battle Kendrick came back with a good song [ __ ] de so so so this this is the nicest thing I'm gonna say about Drake it's not over it's not over right he's coming it's not over um because picky back up of what I just said Drake is Lazarus he is an immortal when it comes to this [ __ ] and I like that like cuz like I I just did a did a teer list yesterday see I see I'm trying to be nice this [ __ ] I did a whole tier list last night of all the different battles that Drake has had and he's lost more than one um just put it out there but the problem is a loss doesn't mean anything to Drake Drake is Triple H he's he's ex a different type of figure uh where it's not about actually winning and losing it's about persisting to continue to be the character he is cuz that's what his fans really care about Drake is this like uh especially now it's becoming more and more uh evident as people like Kendrick and to a much lesser extent [ __ ] Rick Ross are finally saying out loud the conflict of Drake's um the way he weaponized his biracial identity because I want to be clear nobody's making biracial jokes about jcole for a very specific reason because of the way J.Cole moves versus the way Drake moves but because Drake has always moved in that way he's always invited this white audience to take a part to to take that black half with them and feel like they belong in in the culture and that all of their ideas opinions and beliefs are just as valid as anyone else's and with and since they kind of control since they kind of control that since the economics run through them and and The Gatekeepers gone and The Gatekeepers being gone is good and bad on some levels there's nothing anybody could say so he's just going to be able to continue even after this is over what I really believe I really do understand what y'all mean about him weaponizing his biracial status um his Jewish side his appealing to both um I think that and I was speaking about this earlier on my show um I don't think ever accepted by black Americans I he want to but when he came around it was obvious they Rock him more so because Jewish side more so I don't know if it was his Jewish side or his Canadian side he just felt out you know what I mean and so when we speak about what what he did with that um I hate black people I hate his face I hate the way he walks I think that's him trolling us I think he's been trolling Black Americans because of his feel feeling of not feeling accepted he's all right well then I'm going to act however the [ __ ] I want I'm not try to fit in I'm tired of doing that and I'm winning at this and so y'all are going to be mad I think he knew to put up that thing from that movie 10 Things I about you believe it was instead of DMX because I think that's more of a genius troll move on Drake's side but y'all not understand that because people that hate him just gonna hate him regardless I actually completely agree I yeah yeah I think no uh first of all I think Jak cares a lot a lot about how Hip Hop perceives him Drake fans don't care and he yes he is able to to achieve Commercial Success regardless and he knows Drake understands that you can give the fan base that he has the mainstream the white people the pop he can give them narrative which is the purpose of having people like academics and stuff to give them the talking points for them to be comfortable and it be fine but Drake does care and is very bothered by how the rest of the culture perceives him that's always but you to understand that he has to exist like that every day he has to wake up and think like and I'm sorry for cutting you off but I really apologize for cutting you off it's okay but I just I believe that his fans like me that he keeps yes he's I remember he was the outfit years ago we always knew that Mt cor and talking about that broke heart and it like yo he showed a sign a sense of I want to say emotional intelligence that was like refreshing to a lot of us and then being able to still rap rap he was still rap rapping I think we make the mistake of thinking cuz [ __ ] singing soft they being like emotionally intelligent right like that's how is I mean like like call me crazy [ __ ] at least you call in what are we talking not just toxic [ __ ] Drake never grew up out of that that's part of the issue Drake Drake never stopped being you know the boy that got his heart broken in high school he never that's why I that's why I feel like 10 years from now we going to look at Mr morale different that I matter of fact matter of fact if you want to look at use Nas as an example Nas is not talking about the same stuff he was talking about when he was 19 on IL madic but if you ask me this is his this is the greatest run of his career but he's rapping grown man stuff Drake is still is still rapping you know like he a kid he still he's still rapping about it's that Progressive I I think as a as a drake fan right like I think the problem is not that Drake is rapping about the same things I think there the problem is that Drake is regressing it's not just that like Drake like was always like an immature boy yeah like yes he always spoke to he spoke to a particular kind of like boyish Outcast but still like oh you kind of like him you think that's cute you know what I mean Best I Ever Had Pander to women that worked for our time and he keeps adapting to the different boy of the time and the boy of the time now like what made us hate all for all the dogs and women hate is some Manis Fair [ __ ] you know what I mean so said in recent years he started becoming like Drake was somebody women Lov because he was pandering the boy the time he was playing then was one that was trying to like Panda to us and oh you know you know all those kinds of songs and now he's doing the opposite he's trying to speak to like the 12-year-old boys you're trying to get in the like the he's he's courting the same audience as the manosphere like in a lot of respects and Drake benefits from it all right because Drake is I mean you guys can say you know he never fits in a lot of you know mix people can find that you know where do we fit in whatever the case may be Drake has fit in with black people at a time Drake is fit with white people he fits in with everybody and he uses each side that man can present as very white if he wants to and he's done that he could present as very black and he's done that you know what I mean like his kid is 75% white but he's forcing the blackness in in his child but that's not even here or there but my thing is Drake knows how to move within the the the music industry he's good at that he's a you know chameleon he can go anywhere he wants to I don't think it's that he you know he just hadn't fit in but that's but that's the real reason and I don't even think it's cuz he's black I don't think it's because he's biracial I don't even think it's because of the explicit using the black or the white side or anything like that it's specifically that Drake is a [ __ ] culture vulture respectfully I don't even mean that in a I don't even mean that in a like I hate Drake disparaging way I swear to God Drake is a [ __ ] that literally tra around the place and be like let me learn the dialect I swear to God he drops some bamian dialect he learned the other day and it's s like Drake goes to cultes studies them and comes Caribbean heat you know what I mean like he really does and I think that's I think that's actually the greater reason why um people have the problem like why he doesn't fit in or he's not accepted in the same way because it's not just that lots of people listen I'm an immigrant lot and lots of people are immigrants or are not from him like Rihanna ain't telling y'all she don't feel accepted or she didn't feel like she fit in or and Rihanna is a whole beian with a beijan accent to this day right she STS it so yeah the issue is is not even so much that Drake cosplays black American culture which he does right or whatever like but everybody consumes that as a hip hop culture and whatever have you that's not the issue I think it's the fact that everybody knows him for just putting on costumes of other people he's known for that like he does that all the time like he done it Su that's what the problem is that's what the problem is cuz we don't say that about and somebody said this to me earlier so maybe y'all can give me some feedback or push back on it Beyonce was R&B then she went house now she's country now we all say all right well she's from Texas Texas but that's the same thing it's when you're great you can say you know what I want to try some of this and then I did I want toy some this I mean I I could see where you're going with that Taho I can see where you're where you know where you're veering off to you know but I don't think it was I mean it gives more like people want to make the argument right that like you did earlier that he doesn't he never felt like he fit in anywhere um it's a difference Beyonce was told that she don't fit anywhere and she just went into those spaces like okay now I fit here I feel like Drake actually knew anytime he wanted to go somewhere he would just flip anytime there was never an audience issue there was none of that what we do see is what because the popularity it's like the popularity vote Drake gets that but when you understand Kendrick Lamar he stands 10 goes down and who he is what he RS about he doesn't he doesn't diverge he doesn't want to go here he doesn't want to go there he stays in this particular Lane and people you know um mistaken the popular vote with you know to me actual rapal College hip hop Electoral College most fans I want to point something even about Drake and and Kendrick anymore real one second FD this isn't about because this is five of Y me this is this really Drake kendri is the culture Drake and this is our this is our last chance we're lose which is which is one of the most poignant lines in Kendrick's Massacre he says he says no I'm not talk I'm not speaking as me I'm speaking for we I'm speaking for the culture he said that like and I think that's I think that's true and I think that's the thing that Drake fans are the most upset about you see in line they're upset about the fact that this idea that despite what they say and what they're all on consensus for and as big as he is the main the hip-hop collect of the black community will not take that perspective and doesn't feel like their opinion or they like I feel like Drake fans want a colorblind analysis for hip hop they want hip hop to be color blind and it's like no one's [ __ ] going for that that is the antithesis more over we're like no more because we so the thing I got a couple things so first off I want to SM I'm going tell you why your Beyonce analogy doesn't work it doesn't work because Beyonce showed us who she really is for like four or five albums straight and then she switched up versus Drake has been basically cosplaying whatever he thinks black people like for since the beginning show up country if that's the case then who no she did so for for the record I don't even like the i i disliked as a as the the most uh biggest Beyonce fan that's a straight man did not like the country album I thought that [ __ ] was whack though but she's not I would say it was she even said it in her you know Soliloquy that she put online listen it ain't about this is not she said it to y'all this ain't a country album but here go people and she put country artists on that album so that country was now presented black country artists were now presented in that way you know what Drake did he be he he put these um he put everybody that he took their vocals or took their style or whatever put them on these albums then started just doing songs without them with the that that tone of voice that style that everything and then jump to another uh uh group of people and just so that's what he does um whatever's popping at that time he'll flock to it he's around it but Beyonce you know as much I I I know what you're saying when you say she's done all these genres yes we can relate those things okay they've both done all these genres they've been all these but Beyonce has always presented as Beyond and she let y'all know when be cuz she knew what the conversation was going to be she's not a country artist but yet she was like to say no country album when it dropped country artists who do not get no play black ones were on that album people went to go stream their music push their stuff so there was you know she did this for a reason and because she was told that she can't do it so she was like yeah no so I want to dig into that color blond comment o uh Olay said earlier because I think that's a big part if I make one critique about Kendrick song that if Kendrick is anything like I believe he is he's just saving this CU he touched on it toward the end is that Drake is an indictment Drake's existence right now is an indictment on hip hop as an industry and the culture and and the thing that I think I think the color blind thing and the thing that makes this all rougher for Drake's white fans is because everybody played everybody played along with Drake for years Drake was Drake was and nobody wanted him and then at some point I can't quite call it he finally won got over with he all right [ __ ] come when he let's do songs with you after the surgery it was after the surgery BW the beard it definitely was the beard the beard was definitely the change I literally depict that in my video he grows the beard and suddenly he's different once yeah but once the culture started saying I Drake come on um then like it was on and popping and steadily he's gotten worse his fans have gotten worse and the the culture has gotten worse I would say and I I I I have the thesis because I said this uh I snuck it in earlier even if Kendrick drops the the illst most ether two dis record uh after this next round or whatever we're still going to lose because we lost once Drake got on like the culture of Hip Hop as we understood it is dead and you just enjoy the last moments Drake is Drake is JayZ because JayZ from jump and this is this is why well I'm from the Northeast so maybe I can speak a little bit to Authority he is New York [ __ ] didn't really mess with Jay like that they wanted Nas to take the crown because Nas was next up but Jay from jump remember Jay Jay is a business Jay was never he never he said you know I don't listen to other rappers I'm not really I'm I'm not really light and so that's why the culture cuz and I was saying this last night if you look at Jay's resume he has the resume but you don't really hear him get brought up in the same bre as often as I think he should you know what I mean I don't think he I don't think he gets the flowers that he really should get consider because of the fact right because he was never a part of the culture like that now Drake is the final evolution of that where he's completely divorced from the culture but he's commodified the aesthetic and he's done and as to has been alluded to he's done it successfully he won he did it and so what but and what are we going to say about it ain't really ain't really nothing we can we can do because he provve he took the he took the the L the LL the JayZ form and perfected it effectively so only that matters like that's it it's the funny thing about this right about Drake is like the more Drake like starts like tries to beat us into submission on this point the more the closer Drake becomes in proximity to whiteness to me even though that's not what he wants because the thing about Drake is this it's like look hip-hop is something hip-hop is created out of speaking to the black experience and the black community and and particularly plight and struggle and things like that right Drake Drake has never wanted to be a part of that you have never wanted to play like the same the game and be a part of the rules to stand up off you've never and you've never felt accepted right like The Gatekeepers that were and you were able to transcend that because white people right like white masses and pop and Rise Above and so much so that [ __ ] The Gatekeepers right you become the king of something and then to to me it is the epitome of whiteness to barge into something that does not want you there you know what I mean that doesn't accept you there that says this is our own we want it to be this way we we've establish these kind of rules and to say [ __ ] what you're established like what you what you decided for your community to become the king of it and then to still feel the need to beat the people into submission about like their opinion on the matter you know what I mean like this need that like the the funny thing is even though it's like yeah hip-hop still loses or the Drake fans will still uh uh the Drake stands because it's not like I'm not a drake fan the Drake stands on it are still going to to pretend that's not the case at the end of the day Drake has shown us that like no matter what his fans say he will always be so upset and what he knows is still like the temperature of the culture at large like The Gatekeepers even though they can't gatekeep him it bothers him that they don't accept him I do not believe so when y'all say Kai's playing Black American culture I'm trying to figure out where how many bullet points y'all have on that because he don't dress like to me he don't he don't dress like he looks crazy when I watch how he dresses when I watch how he that's hip hop that's hip hop you got people in the UK that's doing lot of stuff where did they get it from the Bronx this isn't himo right now who what is that who is that that's him cosplaying his Smo right now that's what he's been doing who is that looks like a person and he OU something right he from the same placex I I have no idea I believe that that's so crazy sino's so good and I think he's from I'm I'm sure he's great I'm sure he's great I just don't know who that who he is they all new little young [ __ ] to me y' me y do not respect the music foret the character no get Char because the music has ped hip hop so far how are we going to say that isn't how are we going to say that is it like you're gonna have your rapity rap rapity rapity rapity rap a l listen to rap rapity rap not a lot of the new [ __ ] like I like I thought all um yeah for all the dogs I didn't understand what y' problem was with fall of dogs I loved it I love certified lover boy I loved it now I did if you go back on my show olle I RI I am a tahov like I'm big on that I was not a fan of him talking the he did Meg not bro like stop but just but here's the problem with that Drake has not build up built up enough equity to move the way he does like it okay if you want to do your a political color blind [ __ ] and do your pop your Pop R [ __ ] I'm with it I love I love Drake mus I am not hating on Drake's music I'll never take that from him or what has been his career but if you want to do that and then you want to play it safe essentially and all the things that matter and you want to you created an audience of of where black women are who ride for you women ride for you and then now suddenly you do want to wage your ass into sociopolitical things within our community to be a [ __ ] what the [ __ ] are you doing you know what I mean on on on what the [ __ ] is he be doing you know what I mean like so but he he's appealing to his audience now his audience is genuinely like no really his audience is academics Adam 22 type [ __ ] exactly if that's the case but you gotta remember he has 150 million followers he has to know even even if we thinking about like this right that man is calculated and what I don't understand about what he does a lot of times it's like when you alienate all of the West Coast by putting Tupac on your like what would you do that a [ __ ] a white man who is a like what is a better example he's stealing nigg sound like Ursula this [ __ ] taking voices this get mad that he bought he bought Tupac's ring I'm thinking to myself it was for the [ __ ] that's gonna that's gonna ride Drake they don't care about him using uh using pac's voice on that track they they don't care they might well the the majority the the the target the target audience what I'm saying is I give a [ __ ] use but why would you you know got to go la you know hard they ride no you turn that on genuinely I have to ask cuz I really be this back to my my true belief that there's no way you [ __ ] believe this you turned that on you heard AI Tupac and you didn't think that was the corniest [ __ ] [ __ ] that ever happen was thought would have interview with album Tupac face why would we when we saw Tupac's holog we we've seen all techology but we have seen it and it had nothing to do with Drake it had nothing to do with culture VES we seen it on stages with your faves I around and you against person claim he's KOB and releasing songs at 2 it's about it's about credibility it's about who who has the credibility to make those type of overtures so when Kendrick did that right when I heard Tupac's voice at the end of the pimple butterfly I started crying in my car the first time I heard it I was like oh [ __ ] I was not ready for it this first time listening to the whole album and as listen to the whole album as an experience and then heing P's voice emerg thinking about what I had just experienced in the album it brought me to tears because of who Kendrick is as an artist who he's revealed as himself up until that point the purpose of that album and the purpose of that album and you consider Tupac's Legacy for Drake a man who has literally never spit a bar for black struggle like literally not one bar in 15 years that's not true charged up it's two bars two bars all right well there's truth and there's truth let's be true he said one bar I'm sorry a man that has given us two bars two bars 15 years two bar in connection black struggle get it right get it right an open letter you know for him to for him to appropriate Tupac genuinely the most radical figure in the history of Hip Hop if you if you know his history was was offensive it it be like it be like you know how somebody die and the person you know they ain't [ __ ] with when act funeral you know what it is it's when H H HW H went around say yeah brother you know me and Randy you know P everybody know Randy ain't mess with uh with Hogan like that Randy cut a whole diss track off Hogan before he died that's that's what Kenny Kenny can I ask you a question you're listening to this right you're listening to this and you're hearing the offense in the room and I and and honestly I feel brother that really love Tac like that and felt offed I love Great ACT rapper those things if this was such an offense to West Coast culture why did Sno repost this on his IG page Why did why hasn't Sno said Snoop the Arbiter of deciding Snoop is one of the great one of the West Coast Legends why would he do that first of all it's not that it's offensive to West Coast culture it's like what it innately represents the idea again imagine you're under Fire what the what the actual issue the character attack that's happening for Drake right now is that [ __ ] are saying that you exploit a culture that you don't stand up for that you are not that you are actually divorced from and that you don't Embrace and not because your race but because it's not [ __ ] I'm not from here okay but you choose that and that's dope you lot of people not from here that don't there's a lot of people there are a lot of people that are from here it's not just Black America what people are saying is to Blackness to black people like that's what they are saying to Blackness it's not just Black America it's that as a black person you do not speak to black people's issues black people's struggle you do not do anything tangible to be a part of this community but you take from this community you you display you take aspects of it for for your own commodification and that and that that is disingenuous right that's the accusation so if that's the accusation to then go take a dead man's voice and the most corporatist of what they're saying is that you've been able to basically like infiltrate and take over this community because of how hip hop is change how how corporate interests have been able to change hip-hop so there's no greater example than you [ __ ] using AI are challenging exactly that it pretty much just like oay was saying it it encapsulates the issue with Drake from day one and this this this again this is the final evolution of that not only is he not only is he commodifying Black Culture black American culture for his own end without even being you know knowledging himself up on it the way that Cole has the way that Colin Kaepernick who was raised by two white parents you know what I mean but it's the fact that again he took the most radical black figure within this genre he he's literally commodifying black radical politics for his own for his own ends that encap that encapsulates the state of Hip Hop that that that is where it and not just black American culture that he that right black Black Culture period right he go to Jamaica now he's red now he's afro be he used in behemon dialect any like and I think that's important right because like like people confine it confine The Narrative there and act like it's just a specific struggle he's having in within Black America Drake is being listened to consumed dissected and analyzed by black peoplewhere who feel this way about him like I am from the Bahamas like where having the same conversation the same the same thing is felt in terms of cuz there is Blackness and black issues a lot are Global struggles there's a reason why black people everywhere connect to a lot of the same [ __ ] and like hip hop and this is this and the next thing so it's not just even black American stuff he he takes from that's the to me that's the magnitude of Drake's culture vulture it's not even just that he's like just navigating because then because then it would be a different kind of question if it was just black American and like oh he lived in Black he lived in America or whatever have you no no Drake goes round literally culture stealing like he he's struggling to speak Spanish on a track right now like he's doing everything I am too I'm trying to learn cause uh Kenny was Kenny was about to say something I wanted to hear what she was gonna say um I was just kind of unpacking the idea that we're talking about the kind of final evolution of him and I think one of my main concerns is that sort of the final evolution as he does follow in whatever his current 12-year-old uh Mega fandom Bas follows is that it's true I'm just saying like the per when I say that when I say that when I say that though when I say that I mean the people he's making music for not the people that consume him but who he's targeting I you know he's not targeting you Tahoe you can't think that Drake makes his music but you and mine for you I I'm listen I'm a 50 I'm a 50-year old 30-y old so trust me I understand what y'all saying in a way but either age he don't want either but the thing is like the thing that kind of concerns me is like as he's kind of never really connecting with any of these things that um kind of galvanized people to make hip-hop or make music in general now he's using it to Galvanize whatever narrative that those 12-year-olds are pushing forward so like he'll he'll um I was like really shocked specifically with his kind of aggression towards Megan if we're going to bring that up again because you made your ire basis off of how you were the Ladies Man rapper and then a black woman is getting intact in like relationship violence and you're like [ __ ] yeah I'm like hello now you're riding out with the now you're riding out with the incels and I'm sitting and I think the core issue in general if we're talking about whether or not he's using Blackness I think my issue in like in addition to that again I like his music I love uh bend that ass over let the coochie breathe sexy whatever my issue is that just innately I feel like as a person as a person I don't find that he it concerns me that he doesn't strike me as an artist or a person with personhood like a person who has uh as a basis and as we're like comparing him to Kendrick Kendrick is very I have an answer you can like like or not he has a very like distinct personhood in his okay if if I'm I'm curious of this one doesn't seem have a Cod like like that so thing is notice this maybe two months ago I said I don't think Drake identifies as black like I don't think there's a part of that says I'm I think he leans into being Jewish with a black dad and I think that's that's kind of the it's it's like he EX he's created his own space for that Heritage like I am Jewish with a black dad he's actually set on one of his tracks black Americans don't [ __ ] black about black people think about that he said that black Americans I'm never black enough for black American I you again Drake is not from America and there's a whole black world so this idea that like break's idea of Blackness saying hey Co did this but there's there's the you're not you don't have black parents that you have to do to be acceptable to Black Americans I know you checked in yeah life I don't know when y'all all started knowing Drake right but I watched the grassy in real time right this is my childhood so I know Aubrey Graham right when he was Aubrey Graham and very much so aan before I know Drake when Drake was trying to come up when Drake Likes music so much he was talking about it on the End commercials and they wrote it into the character for Jimmy to start doing music and then when Drake was like Drake's first single attempt like replacement girl not Best I Ever Had replacement girl with Trey songs on my like I've been around I say that Drake is a [ __ ] that kicked up a n but white people talk about race like it was a new a new discovery to him and that is not I'm not let me be clear because I want to make sure I made this point for my black Canadians who are not I wanted Marin and stuff to be here but this is Drake it's not don't like it's not that race Blackness and the and the black experience is lost to Canada PL let's not have that going like this idea like let's not try to do this thing where we act like the black experience or what are the global global issues that come with Blackness are not happening Drake not black Canadians lived and was with the whites living his wife ex talking about yes he white Jewish mom nobody's upset about that see that's the problem that's the problem Drake interprets and everybody Drake stands interpret observation as indictment nobody is indicting you but it's just like drink well a couple [ __ ] up let's I'm not there is a contingent I don't understand it I was fighting him earlier to day I don't think it's that innately trying to indict him for that it's that Drake wants to have it both you can't always have it both ways you cannot by your own admission not have [ __ ] lived as a black person thought about race blah blah blah and you have proceeded since thus in your adult life to just jump in and out of when you want to D what you want to use for your own commodification and then you also expect to be hailed and praised and received as the king of a culture that says that they don't [ __ ] with that like he can't have it both remember when he came down to Louisiana and he went to Wayne Wayne said do not start being me stay you don't I don't want hear you talking about shooting people I I want you to keep singing I want to keep doing is natural to you that was his mentor advice hold on that was 20 years ago he has since then had been I every time I go to Drake is in the strip club because I be in the strip club every time I've been down there Drake is in vve every time I go to uh uh Miami Drake is in one of them clubs he has had the black he has lived this experience but he's painting on a blank canvas and which yall don't try to yall not trying to really understand that if I grew up my white moms and I nothing around white people all the time and a black dude my experience as a black dude going to school is mad at no one he you see you mistake no one is I'm not mad at that that's the case the problem is that Drake wants to wear other [ __ ] experience as a [ __ ] costume like can't it's have your we've allowed Blank Slate Drake Drake's music has always been pop say what you're doing appreciate you're trying to find you know hey Drake has had these life experiences you know he's half this and half that and no one accepted it on this side and no one accepted him on this side and and you know yeah what was me but but let me tell you something he literally is that sound crazy not the tragic Mal narrative low key that's what it is tragic story exactly all my life I had to F and and every day Drake doesn't live like that Drake literally said he uses the word [ __ ] freely he he's been partnered with so many black rappers he's in the culture they when he first came out he they accepted him as black right he he was a singing [ __ ] right first right and then he came out and a lot of his raps he kind of was like okay this this man loves Wayne like he loves that kind we seen him we accepted him we didn't say oh he's white but then he also can flip he started out at the grassy he knew what he could do he can also present white he can go ahead and do all of that and that's accepted with white people there is no woe is me for Drake Drake knows listen I'm accepted here I he but he knows I'm accepted here he doesn't care necessarily and I know I heard you said something about Black Americans is as o said it's not really just down to Black Americans that man is Canadian he pulls up I remember when he was acting like he was from Atlanta like talking about the six talking about all these different hoods he be in talked about Palm Beach right like like it just he literally will just go somewhere and be like this feels great let me just go ahead and wear this he's confident when he does this there is no this man is he's confident when he does this he's not walking around like oh my God blacks don't like me what's wrong with that the the issue is the issue is that Drake picks and chooses when to move in and out of his Blackness that's the issue it's got nothing to do with him having again going back to the Cole example Cole doesn't do that Cole is black through the good through the bad through the happy through the sad you see him out there you know with with [ __ ] fighting the power and doing all that kind of stuff and whatever and that's why you know Comm is never cut off from Cole matter of fact you it's a bunch of keys got a white Mama we never Alicia Keys We Alicia Keys has never been questioned no no no no you cannot have your cape on for Drake and turn up your nose at jcole y'all talking about hip hop do that why he do that don't become aous now you cannot divorce hiop don't become a struggle you just expressed to us of no respect when the tenants the original hipop here's the problem here here's the problem with Drake's tragic as I call here's the problem with what I call Drake's tragic Mal nonsense Drake Drake's M Drake's musical Persona is the equivalent to the the white boss that wants to give you an extra dap when he sees you you know what I'm saying he's like the [ __ ] are here all you show me I can do it too I'm a cool one I'm a good one but my problem with this my problem with this is that y'all are ignoring the fact that it isn't of course it's real he's never been accepted yo why but he was real but M no no no the problem isn't that it's not the problem isn't that it's not real the problem is that the real part remains to be seen because because because uh like let me let me find some examples uh [ __ ] logic yeah is more honest about his experience and his reality as a bosal person than Drake we still don't like logic but we respect him but we respect Drake we don't like logic hate to me yeah not hex cor look for sympathy what you say looking for this am this much amount of sympathy in the Drake narrative and of itself is some white [ __ ] let me explain why right like being like Drake was never accepted right because like hip hop does not accept or the community does not accept or give [ __ ] their appropriate amount of flowers every day there are lots of rappers who truly they're not being accepted as translated into lack of success they don't get their flowers they get [ __ ] on people don't respect them there lots of them there are lots of like in and there are lots of ones that are successful cuz they still have a much larger audience or white people buy their things that are not thought about in the black hip-hop Community discussions in the same way and like like a titler of the creator has talked about that but you don't see them bitching and moaning and making this this constant [ __ ] issue that people have to be litiga that's some white [ __ ] can we talk hold on hold up thank you oay can we talk about the fact that Tyler the Creator is a whole bisexual in Hip Hop right and don't ever bring that [ __ ] up not saying that's a good Al some like right we had to like Tyler Creator could be doing the whole wave of but he going the whole wave of all he could get every think piece uh what was me moment he wanted and there's like there's complexity there like I don't want to you know we get into the the queer identity and the racial identity a lot of people get sensitive and I don't want to get into all that [ __ ] too tough but I just want to point out that TI Tyler the Creator we still know who that [ __ ] is and we don't know who Drake is is he's not afraid and Tyler is not afraid to be who he is and Drake very clearly is But the irony is that Drake like Kenny said something that I thought was really uh depthful earlier when she said that I don't think Drake has personhood and what it what hit me is that that is very purposeful because Drake is the equivalent I'm about to make a video game reference I know somebody in the audience going to get me Drake is a silent protagonist he is a character in the video game that you choose what they say but you never hear their [ __ ] voice and because of that his audience of primarily white um uh white black cosplayers can insert themselves in Drake's World in reality he's an avatar and they enjoy it and now that and now that the culture is saying Ah that's n of that [ __ ] now they're mad as [ __ ] Drake a like is not lost upon me that all of Drake's complaints whenever I hear Drake complain it sounds no different than when white people who identify as allies are complaining how they in the community it sounds the exact [ __ ] same like the ex I but that's exactly what I said I think that's how he identifies simultaneously want to be like be not only by yourself operating as an ally someone who is not truly of the community in this way want to do that for your own benefits you consciously know it you are doing it and then simultaneously want the community to receive you you as though you are the real deal and like that in end of itself that's what I'm saying is like the more Drake beats this down or his audience beats it down is like interacting with Drake fans online is like it really just solidifies and while you said that but while you said that he are saying like like walk in his whiteness but that does not mean that if he feels like pulling his black card just getting online one day rocking a set of braids having his baby with some braids on like he will walk in that too he knows he can slip in and out of it doesn't really care what people say now if he's in his home whatever he doesn't present as that he's confident when he's on the white side of it he's confident when he's on the black side of it my problem is like you were saying liil Bill like he can just walk around here and be like today I want to I want to be white all right so I'm just gonna stand on the white side of things he can do that and then and then the next day he can be like you know what I want to throw some go on I want to wear a doag I want to really present his black and let me just do that and my problem with that is having his white a and still be able to just when he feels like walking in whiteness they all come around they then they go right in when he wants to go into the black audience that same white those white crew that they go there and they're fighting for him when he's just silent he can slip in and out of all of this and I think it's very problematic be who you are and we haven't really talked about Kendrick as much on this you know while we sitting here this is why we like Kendrick because he is who it is stand T toes down on who you are when you present when you rap whatever I don't think that makes him less and I'm talking about Kendrick that doesn't make him less hip-hop because of how the style of how he raps um that he can be deep and come out and really go guns blazing on somebody I think that is hip-hop just because Drake is a singing [ __ ] he's a you know he half and he can go here he can go there whatever the case may be I feel like just him just um dropping that in his uh stories and everybody's like oh Drake Drake just be Drake just he's he dropped that he's the realest and it's not that it does it's just popularity that's people are just going to go on that side of it for popularity not really for hip-hop I think Drake is Drake is always I think Drake is always black I think Drake is I don't think it's that Drake is is always black is some white ass [ __ ] to say's the black person he's the black person who all their friends like who's comfortable in that who's comfortable in the room with all with all the white people who makes them comfortable so for me is that he's always that because the reality is even as a black no matter how much you yourself are divorced from however divorced you are from your own Blackness or the black experience the world is not divorced from that so Drake is always black he showing up black to them but a brand of Blackness that is comfortable like one that is interested in capitulating to them one that centers them one that says that their voice is just as equal as a hip-hop fan because that's what you have to remember a lot of Drake's fan base the reason why they go as hard for him and why they want to take it back to their color blind analysis is because they resent the idea that the same way Drake resent The Gatekeepers is is why I keep saying that he's an ally like he's Ally more than he is a member like Drake resents The Gatekeepers and they resent in the same way they they they resent the his fans resent the black traditional hip-hop community that says that their voice doesn't matter the same like they mad as [ __ ] that people that Adam 22 makes his opinion and they all click like on it and everyone's like shut the [ __ ] up [ __ ] like right like that is what they about can we switch gears because Rea made a good point can we talk about euphoria and how made how many times so how many times have y listen to good I listen to it like 15 right before it started a lot yeah like and like that's yeah a lot a lot I I made the comment even though I don't I still think story of adinon is like a a stronger disc or whatever it's a better song it's a better song You Foria as a song I likeor way better is an amazing song the song bangs and it's really the thing that that Kendrick does that's crazy boy like what is like like I like the song I like the song I like Euphoria I think yo he went in and I listened to it when I first when I first heard it it's uh probably uh jaded probably jaded um but when I heard Euphoria J is what makes you go up like this no wow I'm a Dicker what you say I know I know what you're doing right now I can't be a fan it's fine I I love you br but okay so when I heard Euphoria and and I'mma keep it real I heard the YouTube version first I was on my phone I was outside and I right cool I didn't really he hit beat right I was like there a bunch words bunch ofes I put my headphones in and I got away from that the construction and everything is going on and I was able to hear actually what was going on I was like oh wow this is scathing and it's continuous this is hard like I just for seven minutes straight I never sh Li kidney shots just body blowers but did we expect anything less did we expect anything I say I told you remember when I when I did your podcast and I told you I heard what Kendrick did when him and jcole were friendly collaborating back in the day I was like I remember so I only know that he was coming out here to murder Drake I knew I said no one how he a special beat like you know people were looking for that that boom that you know whatever they were looking for that and he just like I'm really just coming with a mic I don't care what it sounds like and I'm just I'm here to spit and that's it he murdered him on a jazz beat just the part ofd it's mine are short real quick the worst part is that for Drake is that it gave light to the cultural to the things that it it like really created a real bad conversation for Drake that people have said and little things little little little little really wasn't able to be eloquent about it microphone now and and a microscope yeah Drake so now I I was shocked I was shocked I listen to the um The Breakfast Club this morning I was shocked at how uh tepid um Charlamagne seen cause Charlamagne said something but that that I was like yeah you were he's an OG Drake hater he was the one of the last people to get on board what did he say he isn't anymore he isn't anymore but like I don't know I just figured he just calmed down because he couldn't he just I mean he didn't say much he just you know Charlamagne half the time you don't know if you're going to take what he's saying seriously but I had I been as an OG Drake hater who has has never liked him his songs are not in any of my playlist um when when the song Hit And I digested it I pulled out like a flag and ran around my block yes in Victory cause cause as Tahoe said Drake I knew I knew Kendrick was going I like literally somebody tweeted this and I I need to retweet this but I barely be on Twitter this song sounds like an FD signifier commentary video because he touched on every criticism I've had of Drake pretty much since um take care the the second which was take care was Marvin take care yes that's a long time pretty much since take I saw I saw this was going oh yeah after so far gone I was so far G fds were born like f genre of hater like is talking about his haters [ __ ] like FD is who you need to Envision yes and no you are the old head hater so yes but yes and no there's there's two things there's twoo because I've never hated on Drake for being soft or Pander into women and that's where he lost the OG's initially if we're gonna be fair to Drake that's why he got bullied he got bullied in the way that any male feminist type of dude the same way jerck Jackson would have gotten bullied like that's part of it right I was never I didn't get there I was never there but after take care and his response to it was really his response to control if I want to be fair his response to control I remember this interview and I put it in my video where he clearly was bothered but didn't hit the [ __ ] Booth I was like oh there's something wrong there there's there's a there's a problem with that one that he is saying all these things that was a problem with that one yeah there's a problem with that one I didn't know would get this bad do we hate everybody do you hate everybody else that that um said that one's a bad that one's gonna Kendrick said said a a lot of names and none of them said nothing I hate all of the people that sit at that top tier that do not respect what that means but you don't apologize I don't hate the cold apologize this was about called this what did a seven minute drill song and he took L and then he took the biggest L by bowing out that's completely Real [ __ ] [ __ ] I promise complet real [ __ ] sh to the side and said [ __ ] this ain't about you this about me and this [ __ ] right here we F to handle this that I promise you that's what happened Dro when when euph Foria drop Scotty like something like his response I think was like damn or whatever to to to be like yeah you know Kendrick did that um my thing is J.Cole did what he did I'm not shocked that he did that where jcole is in his life is not too far off of how he presents himself right and he's like you know this is this is messing with my no Tahoe you just gota listen and and you know what's a good point to Kenny's original Drake doesn't have person I think that's the difference right was whether or not you think as corny like as corny or as L that Drake I mean that jcole uh like apologized or took it back everybody believed based on who jcole presented himself to be like you believe it's genuine like you you got the impression he really didn't want to participate and you got the impression it was genuine that he's like ah because jco presents us something real Drake is very not that this is favortism favoritism by the way isor you was just given a little bit of am I'm a drake I a drake fan I have a lot of criticisms for Drake if I had if I had as many criticisms that I like if I believed as many criticisms were valid of another person as I do of Drake I wouldn't be a fan at all that's how much of a fan of Drake music that I am I have let Drake Rock through a lot of [ __ ] like like a lot of [ __ ] the fact that Drake is even a [ __ ] I still click on your track after you for no [ __ ] reason you attacking Meg you jumping on to the fact the amount of times alone that I have had to witness Drake decide to start dick riding a man that was talking [ __ ] on him and throughout his career is unbelievable in general like like Tory Lane's included I'm so sick of it like Drake does so much [ __ ] like so many allegations like you can't even say you listening to Drake on my side of the internet I can't even tweet that without people being so the fact that I even still say I listen to his music is how much I like Drake I'm not a drake hater but I just believe that there are a lot of legitimate criticisms when it comes to Drake that doesn't mean I don't think some things are I fair to him but I think things have gotten less fair or more fair with time like a lot of the criticisms that used to seem unfair now seem more fair in the light of day The more we learn hold up you know what I realized I'm wrong it wasn't the control beat it was when I realized that Drake was going to be wearing the Jersey of any team that was doing good during the during the sports season that was what it's like this [ __ ] a Colts fan and a Saints fan uh whatever's popular that's why I think the funniest thing so the I won't die on this H because I don't want to get in trouble but I don't think Drake is as a creepy of a sex pest as he as people tend to present to him I think he just does [ __ ] to popular so he will he will if if it's if it's between not being a creep and being popular but I need to text a 14y old girl Drake will text a 14y old girl if it means being popular he he kissed like a a 16y old or some [ __ ] like that or something like that like yeah he did some wild [ __ ] years ago can we can we talk about the fact that we're not talking about this $500,000 settlement sexual assault that none of us knew about knew about that happen oh the part of the song with Kendrick is like have you ever um spent 500 th as to uh beat a case or something like that so you know the internet slops did their thing in 2019 Drake got uh sued um for sexual assault by a Instagram model and had to settle out of court for $530,000 and then supposedly she she spun the block on them and got more um yeah I can't I can't speak on something I don't know about M Drake in general it's so funny to watch like to truly like watch in real time and we do it all the time as a culture and really don't talk about it like what like power influence and money like will buy you because you watch a different lesser celebrities get [ __ ] cancelled or get ridden off or can't be talked about for so much less and then the opposite happens with Drake it's like you could keep hearing something a million times but it's like and myself included like I don't really want to like you don't even want to Deep dive into all the [ __ ] that you keep hearing about about and like I say that's why I say I'm not a Dre hater like people will think if you're saying this that's how come I believe like it's so obvious and objective to me in my opinion that Kendrick has W like watched him is because it's valid it just is like I said it as a [ __ ] with hundreds of I probably I gave honestly never mind a second or third list like a try that's how much I have faith in Drake's music I was like hold on I've been wrong before I've dumped the gun before maybe maybe maybe Med player music yeah I want to be fair because the reality of hip-hop and the history of hip-hop and the nature of the industry and so many rappers I am not even bringing that up specifically as like a gotcha you can't like Drake because he's a bad guy because if that was the standard for half of hip-hop a good 75% of these [ __ ] have to go right um is more so to imply how Drake gets to operate outside of Blackness because because if Drake was Dr Quan and was and was was was just little Bill's complexion he'd be Jason Derulo right he he be Ms remember Ms This Is Why I'm Hot This Is Why I'm Hot it was a banger but then he was gone he out there that went in in the reg remix oh my God Bruno that [ __ ] was hard we got so my am I am I in the lightskinn contingent because this is this is my darkest complexion of the year so well that's what I'm saying so you're over the threshold of light from my perspective but that's whole another conversation I am over not quite into the wall yet no Kendrick killed it and that's what we need to really stick with we're not saying the catalog people are getting twisted people are saying Oh but you know Drake is the better artist he has his catalog if we go catalog song for song for song for song for song it's really about this song and this this this disc record okay this disc record is literally just good and Drake got whooped if Drake returns and does anything similar to what Kendrick released today I'm giving him extra credit because this ain't his bag he has white priv I Kendrick like this is like when there's one white person in the black frat and like they they stroll half as well as everybody else but not you the little boy doing the the the um Dr Dr sh went viral again this week like years crazy a white person uh who cooks something a Haitian meal and they're like oh my God meanwhile Haitian people are cooking Haitian meals every day stop it stop it nah not like that not like that that's not this is all hate is all hate from all of this is the conversation we had on your podcast you know when when when um your your co-host was like oh don't you feel a little bad for Eric Adams like you got ambushed and I was like the nigga's the mayor Drake you can't think Drake is the king of Hip Hop he's been in at the top for as long as he has then also think he's the under here's the thing about it is this this is why cuz I'm I'm a young old head so this this is this is why this is why we love Euphoria is Euphoria gets back to it it's the essence of Hip Hop when we talk about a diss track this is what a diss track is supposed to be it's not supposed to be about SP you spill the te for a purpose you spill the te to make a point you don't necessarily have to spill T you could repeat the same I said this last night that it's not on the same tier but Euphoria gives the same energy that ether did when it came out because it it is again everything that the streets was saying about Jay at that point was put on that track and that's what made it hit so hard and everything that the culture has been saying about Drake for the past decade plus it was on that track body blow after body blow after liver shot and that's what that was it was a it was a de it was deconstructing Drake's entire Legacy within the context of the culture yes and there's more there's more that's the thing I'm excited about yeah that that that he only he only touched on the the true disolution what what Drake even said the the elimination Drake he only really did like 40% of it you know to me let me tell you what how you know euph Foria rang off like Beyond just the amount of like I say it's just too many shots to ignore but like on the first listen I knew it was a murder on the first listen like you know sometimes you know you have to respect the artist you know you have to go in and listen but you might miss it if you're not paying attention I knew immediately first listened on my walk Jesus Christ like listening to it I'm not going to lie I have to listen like two three times before I oh damn I did Jesus I I felt the same way about push-ups once he got to the Y andw Melly bar I was done well you know I was comparing the push eight bars when he said find this way more um like I like Euphoria way more than I liked Pusher teas I mean I like it better because it's a better song yeah but we sleep on like going back to Ether right Little Bill uh did you did you leave that up cuz that well maybe you doing it for a video cuz little when little bir broke down ether it really connected to me that like takeover was a better song unequivocally take over I listen to more than ether unequivocally and and people said not some people said Nas one because he said Jay-Z had dick sucking lips or some [ __ ] like that Camel and a camel they called him a camel right but the real but the real reason why ether killed Jay was because much like Euphoria it was an analysis of Jay's existence in a way that Jay couldn't respond to because everything was true and the same things H happened in Euphoria it not just the wind up you Melly bar or let me see you push a t or you don't know nothing about that Etc it's how all those things fit into an analysis of Drake as an artist and his presence and how would all true and I do like either either because I don't think any of these dudes are Saints so I don't know what Dirk Kendrick got out there he admitted to being sex addicted in mid 2010s or something so God knows what what Dirk Drake has pulled up problem but the only way Drake can come back is with something like that that will definitely get the crowd behind because he doesn't have anything to attack him on from like a character but don't nobody remember super ugly so what my problem is nobody talks about super ugly spit spit spit four super ugly right now you go you you trying to say what your favorite um line was from Euphoria and that's what I actually want to hear so what was that no um the fact is that he said these are my something about my brothers if they're my real friends I'll speak about that in eight bars and then talking about Y and W Melly killing his friends eight bars later M brother to shoot the Drake We're talking about rap but but hold on hold on first of all please let me this off what Drake did with pushups was Legend going so many you got people yelling out still got yelling shut your whatever still got people yelling at out every day I know it but I didn't want to say it on this track I don't know where we where we're uh posting this but then we have not seen Drake go at Kendrick we're all saying like oh he did this he did this he did this just three days ago everybody was like oh Kendrick Kendrick Kendrick now who everybody I only children Drake Drake has yet to go wanted this let's be real has been baiting Kendrick he hasn't Drake was not trying to Drake had not Kendrick dropped like that Drake wasn't trying to respond it seemed from all everything that we were hearing especially because it's not like Drake didn't have all his little tra streamer [ __ ] like just dropping information and just talking about it right about oh Drake deliberating whether or not because oh you know J uh um uh he was having his performance and whether or not jcole and Drake would do first person shooter and all this there was all kind of like talk and chatter about what Drake didn't seem to want to do and let's not forget even once Drake um drops push-ups which is only after again to what FD talked about earlier is only after a bunch of people jump in so he could see him he could give himself the angle of oh he's responding to all these people which gives it this kind of leeway but Drake didn't even have the nerve to [ __ ] Drake leak to had the song leak and then change when he finally when it finally comes out it had some bars changed based on what's the P The public's feedback are we are we dead ass kendri all the [ __ ] what happened we're saying that's what happened on his YouTube page on a Tuesday morning when nobody was paying attention that's how you know he knew no no no no no no no he dropped it at 824 I'm here he dropped 84 so that was real the Kobe reference me minutes or it because call kendri [Music] being you have to forego corny analysis you can't call nothing corny if you're gonna be firmly in Drake's camp like no can can I so I want to switch gears a little bit and I gotta start a little I never said that I got start a little fight you think's music is better than krick's let me clarify so what I said was that there's more music Dr has more music for sure the man drops stuff every two seconds an album there partnering with this rapper this rapper whatever he has a lot of songs and you know I like his music I like some of his you know his older stuff of course you know um and that's where I'm at with Drake I still listen to that stuff I still I still when I want to bounce my ass I still just play child's just for fun right so that's where I'm at with it I'm not going to I do like the one with sexy red that Kenny mentioned but I won't play that on a regular I'll go the child's play but with Kendrick you know it's just like some flow stuff I'm not saying I think that Kendrick is a better rapper than Drake period but more music that I've listened to I can tell you I've listened to more Drake songs there's just so many album wies all those type of things so that's where I'm at with it so I love Kendrick Lamar I want to be clear I love Kendrick Lamar I love his music I listen to Dam so many times I listen to to to pimpa Butterfly yo like the the type of artist that he is and he's we say rap I don't think that we're giving him much that much credit because he is also an artist there are people who just rap and that that's coool but K lar is bigger than just just like Drake like he is really amazing at he does and nobody just can I can I get this off and I and then I gotta drop out and I got you understand it and I I hate the fact that I deleted this script cuz I had a script prepared like a year year ago making the same argument that Drake is Mike Kendrick is Prince in the sense that if you if you heard what Mike when Mike was making thriller Mike and this is what made Mike relevant and this is what made Mike as big as he was in the 80s is that he intentionally got all of the hottest sounds oh let me let me get Eddie Van Halen let me get some some disco over here let me get all of this and made Thriller he was a hit maker that was what he was trying to do he wasn't necessarily trying to be the best artist he was trying to make hits Prince on the other hand is an artist artist he is a mus or was a musician that was what separated Mike from prince prince proved that he could write hits but that he could also Express himself artistically you're right so by the time the 80s was over he just said I'mma do whatever I want to do cuz I've already proven I I've already established that I'm a hit maker but I'm also Mike never really got that did they're in two different Lanes but the problem with Drake is that Drake and they understood that the problem with Drake is that Drake wants to occupy Mike and Prince's Lane but he don't got the same but he's not built like Prince the way that Kendrick is yes he does yes he does no he doesn't out mus so so so yeah peace bill so I will give I will I will say I really liked uh never was the same is that the one the little the the Nothing Was the Same you see how much I actually like it um like so I like I like that one a nice amount and I've listened to that one more than once which is more than I can say more than twice which is more I can say about mes music and the reason is that that was the first album where it felt like he was trying to be a person on on on a lot of levels and like sonically and artistically he put an effort to try to hit a bar that he hadn't done before and then everything after that like the fact that it was I think it was if you're reading this it's too late was the the next thing he did after that is so iconic it just because it points out that he stopped caring at that point in terms of being an artist and only wanted to be a star and and a rapper so funny that you feel that way I me I feel like see this when I start to get a little Drake Hive I get to get some of the little Tahoe spirited me you in your Drake video I'm like why do you think that I feel like if you're if you're reading this I'm sorry too late it's to me when I feel like he most really showed us he was a black Canadian like if you know Canadian [ __ ] or follow any of them like to me that was when he really started putting on for the six and giving us that sound and like to me really speaking to like that's when I feel like he really started trying to like put Toronto like think about Toronto but that's the truest version of him he's given us because before then he was from [ __ ] Houston so like that's like I think if you're reading the I'm saying that about not I'm not saying that even about nothing was a saying I'm saying about that if you're if you're um you're reading this it was too uh um oh oh sorry I kind of like if you read the same Nothing Was the Same it's very clear that Drake is responding he's taking take care but but adding like the elements of what is the criticism right like trying to give you more of like I am a person I have a struggle it seemed like that's where Drake is trying to tell me he has a personal story of some kind like this is how I grew up this is what I was doing these was my friends these was the dream like headlines all of that right Started From The Bottom yeah not yeah and so but then if you're reading this I'm sorry it's too late to me is an expansion of that but instead of it being inward it's outward it's for the other people like the city of Toronto like other it's a very like it's a very like soundtrack for them like think about how many songs on that se on on that are like Legend energy everything is kind of ODed to to that yeah well I didn't like that that was that was where it was a complete rap for me by by the time we get so by the time we get to what came after that was views after that it was good I was a certified hater by views that was that wasn't that wasn't it was time to be alive with future after which I which I love yeah yeah when he Jamaican for that one right no he was Jamaican for more life no he was Jamaican for more life and and Views I think is is is a perfect example of a a again now I feel like I'm Dr C let me get my hat I'm sorry no once we start talking to music that's when I turn into the truth right like I feel like views is a perfect example of how everybody rushes to judgment or Drake they be they be talking about like everyone [ __ ] on views and acted like views was this big disappointment and all this [ __ ] most of Drake number one hits are on views like views was nothing but like views had mad hits like even though whatever it has a couple of Skips maybe but like views has a bunch of songs that not only were they big hits but you still [ __ ] with them they were played everywhere andew yes was what turned Drake into the villain because in the beginning that first song he's talking about keep the family close he's talking about Nikki he's talking about betrayal he's talking about feeling out like alone during the wor parts of his life and then after that it just got worse he started moving like yo I you know what I don't care about nobody no more I'm not on I'm not with um I am CNB no more they don't [ __ ] with me like I still [ __ ] with them a little bit but I'm on my own and that was a big part of him just feeling like you know what I'm not accepted anywhere and I'm just gonna be a star you look at Drake in the light most you look at the evidence in the light most favorable to Drake right because you you look at like views which I think is funny that you look at like one of his biggest commercial successes as though some when he could be like rightfully indignant by the time views comes around like even though yes the culture is still trying to like she don't do this or whatever like they normally do with Drake Drake is already like Beyond us like that's when Drake officially becomes kind of beyond our critique and so to me it's not Drake being mad at us it's Drake not having to even pretend to give a [ __ ] because that's when he finally got his number ones like he got them with Hotline bling and controlling one dance or whatever that's when Drake finally had transcended like no no no when was this when was the Meek Mill beef was that around in back to back it's right after it's right after no that was before you right after because I started Law School right when back to back had just happened when me just views dropped am I right o yes right back to back all of that was before and then him and Joe bu made a whole big thing calling views whack just not forget this is now him really trying to prove himself by himself before that he was he was he had and Wayne all of them but now yeah you ain't got so he turn into villain I'm saying the problem is Drake I don't think Drake has to prove here's the thing I don't truly believe Drake has to prove anything to us music wise or that the commu or that the culture is asking him to prove anything music- wise I think most people even a drake haters at this point don't pretend like Drake doesn't deserve any success or he doesn't make great music or he hasn't been incredibly successful Drake's problem again it goes back all of this is Drake's gripe Drake is the one who keeps trying to Rel relitigate this [ __ ] issue because Drake feels like he's supposed to be a king without critique for these other things like no one's trying to dispute that Drake is good at music what they're not trying to let you believe is that you're the king while [ __ ] like Kendrick who they feel respect they're not going to allow that and that's the problem but we we it's not that we didn't say like Drake isn't a good artist like we think he's good artist but to me the Artistry that Kendrick can drop and he doesn't have to do so many things he we just know he can come out and be a lyricist that's just who he is so when there's a problem I hate that it had to be a problem but when there's a problem it's nice to dust that off and come out and we like yeah that's the he that [ __ ] what I give you is that yeah if if you read reading between the lines and the song and also like between the lines so I imagine being a big I'm a big Kendrick fan like I I'm Kendrick is in my top five at this point and he's getting closer and closer number one with every record he drops um and so paying attention to Kendrick Kendrick doesn't Kendrick's Euphoria was seven minutes long because he been holding that in right yeah so so and that's why I think he also has more so if if what he says on Euphoria is true it seems like Drake wanted to get him and jcole he wanted him to be on first person shooter with J Cole right which I can imagine if I'm Kendrick and it's like [ __ ] you know I don't [ __ ] with you and now you want me to appear on your song on your album with jcole so we can be the big three and squash it for your benefit this is the exact type of reason why I don't [ __ ] with you in the first place and so he didn't participate he hears the song and then they dare to well I don't I don't know if Co Drake did but I remember I know Cole evoked his presence so at that point I completely understand uh Kendrick who is a big ego short man but very clear I see why he felt like I need to make sure people are not confused about who who the real top tier in this in this equation is now that still does count as him starting it for no reason I'll agree there I I like your rationale I I do and I will accept it but it is like hilarious pettiness when you think about it like because again it ain't even like it's Drake who said J said love they argu The Hardest MC is it K is it Aubrey or me we Theory like like it's me and this [ __ ] Krick said [ __ ] [ __ ] the big Tre [ __ ] it's just big me that's crazy like my [ __ ] got like imagine getting violent M conf it's some short [ __ ] syndrome like come on bro absolutely like I said he yells like that about love like so it's that's just him bro it's like calm down is that you know people need to stop playing around and call a thing a thing and that's Kendrick ate that and if if Drake responds K if Kendrick respond yeah you see exactly he tried to ride it back but you know he started off like it's you know everybody against me but then came in and was like Kendrick did this and it was good and then and then okay all right no not at all so we're waiting for all Drake has not dropped a track towards Kendrick yet so y'all are calling him out before he even comes out he's still in the locker room you have you to me okay let me let me just be clear as a Drake as a drake fan right like I'm just going purely based on precedent on History let's be fair I understood like with back toback like Drake surprises everybody rooted the against him and we know we didn't have any evidence at the time to evaluate him for right and so by the time in his meek battle I feel like you gave him the benefit of the doubt like I did not go in into push like rooting against him thinking he's not capable of handling himself and Drake showed me that that is not the case like I was wrong like that is what Drake has shown me I am just going based on opponents if you bow out to push and this is no disrespect to push T like like push T is an amazing artist right like where after the is my [ __ ] like but if you bow out to push there's no reason for me to [ __ ] believe that you're going to especially based on what I done witnessed from you th far no I don't agree with that no no no that how I feel there's no reason why I believe that he's going to beat Kendrick and I don't believe that I just want to say this Drake's son people didn't even know he had a son this is somebody that's not even a couple months old like he wasn't even like a year yet like this is something that yo I'm doing a whole roll out just to let the world know that I'm start a family it wasn't what I wanted but I'm proud of it this is my son and for that to happen the way it did I think it got away from for him and I think that and I've been there before I've been place like you know I don't think well let me tell you something if it got away from rap from him for that Drake had that baby for about two seconds Drake inse whatever insecurities been insecure about his and plac in hipop [ __ ] long down and um but but but he talked about his and that's when it went lower you don't talk about my sons you don't talk about my kids bro well I I I don't think Drake so here's one thing I'll say uh agreeing with couple of K's early bars we I I do I don't count Drake out just because evil tends to win in in in this timeline right um so I don't expect I I genuinely don't expect Drake to lose um like I don't know how he's goingon to win but I think he's gonna win um that said I don't believe Drake is some calculated Mastermind no Super Genius Mastermind releases that whack ass house album he did last year um I disagree I disagree though and here's why because my theory is that he constructed it when Beyonce was making uh Renaissance wait reniss and and was working on it with her cuz he wrote one of the songs on there and I think his ass snuck away and said this is what we going to do I'm my own house album like 3 days beforehand and what she going to do about it just sing people [ __ ] it's quite possible but but even still so if even if he was playing if that was his 4D chess move that still proves he's not as smart as he thinks he is um so I say all this to say going back to The Pusher T situation I think he overestimated or himself or underestimated what was possible I could not imagine I'm not a violent dude I own a gun for self-defense I've been in like three fights since uh since high school right so I'm sorry but since like I was a kid I had three fights like up between childhood and high school and I have been in fight since I would have had to see that [ __ ] over over story of ad it would not have been rap it would have been it would have been hands exactly because he he killed his this special moment he was planning with his first first son I'm not making no songs I'm coming to see you even if I'm Drake so like I I don't I don't although it still was a big L and he had to he should have respond by the rules of Hip Hop I do not regr the fact that he didn't but I expect the response to this I expect it to somehow win even while not being as good I you know I would think it's funny again and I'm saying this even as a drake fan but the way that we like I am a drake fan but the way do we let Drake rewrite and we just accept the way he rewrites rules or like logic and rationale like it makes [ __ ] sense it's crazy to me because in the real world the more offensive a [ __ ] is to you the more likely you are going to [ __ ] attack that [ __ ] and go and respond there's no [ __ ] world where you are ready and back now whatever so in my mind there's no reason why I should respect a [ __ ] telling me Oh the [ __ ] beat me too bad so I couldn't reply it it just it stunned me now I'm supposed to believe same [ __ ] is no he just took the L he lost no he just said he just said I con see cuz that's that's one thing that's one thing I embarrassing and fumbling and busting his ass even throughout how he's carried this on like before like Drake not only drw push-ups cool Drake is a [ __ ] who shoots himself in the foot push-ups is was a good enough response for his audience and everybody to be like all right fine I could say positive things about you for no reason he had to go start acting like a white 16-year-old [ __ ] on the internet he's [ __ ] posting stories doing cornball [ __ ] he's calling Rick Ross like he's a loser he's a [ __ ] M Rick Ross is being racist to me supposed to believe it's more trolling he's it ain't [ __ ] who been trolling it wasn't [ __ ] like who trolling got you if you white trolling get you likes if you black Troll and get you smacked all right that's not I just came up with that [ __ ] that's why I'm real rap bar are we going to be see I see what you did with that yes okay you you gonna are you gonna concede the dinner is done over here I gu I got I got I promise that if Drake responds I promise I will I will convene this exact panel again bring okay Taho can come here with a different sense of honesty and humility when that day comes me yes about I'm confused stand Taho but we will see when where I you know right now breake has not released I think Kendrick got a good off didn't like first when I once I justed oh [ __ ] ripped his off Drake is now home cooking and I believe he'll be back this week I believe Backa and he tells LeBron again how this violated like the the tenants to hip-hop and LeBron says it's a hip-hop story and he understands will you will you tell me yeah like yeah this was definitely I will walk your cat your new cat I will walk your cat Okay yeah okay and I will come bring bad ass yes I will walk a cat for a week through a dog park so she can [ __ ] me up off the leash okay trust me I I just trust me so the weird the weird place I'm at with going going off a Tahoe is all the I completely expect Drake to win because again that's the timeline we're in I have no expectation that it'll actually be off the Merit of what he puts out because Drake doesn't make he's not that good he's just not he Drake is not that Drake can rhyme he can bar but a my all my favorite Drake songs all of everyone's favorite Drake songs are because they make you dance because they make you Groove because have great Melodies but she don't give a [ __ ] about what he said what what what what theme the song had what what came even back to back was a meme you see me mes were emerging right over here like oh my God no getting ready to go up underground like oh I can't stand for this I have a life this one and we'll see right we'll just we'll see like give me get me out of here I want to know I don't give a [ __ ] I have things to do that's all we got do [Music]
