        "text": "One thing that strikes me about society refusing to see rape, SA and abuse for how heinous it is is that the mindset & justifications of the attacker are just not believed to be as malignant and messed up as we know they are. Like, it's only people NOT already prone to victim-blaming or disbelieving victims that understood Cassie's testimony when it came out. \n\nCause if you've understood that type of need for power in some way, you can put two, three, four & five together with Diddy's long history of treating his artists like shit and his random acts of violence towards people in the music industry. Those who know (mostly women let's be fair) know that that's a pattern of an angry, abusive man who _needs_ to feel power; _needs_ to crush people under his power. \n\nMost just look it his history like separate events \"yeah I guess he was shady but isn't she just trying to get a cheque off him?\" \n\nI think it's down to a mixture of a few things: the hangover of women aren't really people and women owe themselves to men for their gratification, sexual or service-based. Y'know standard toxic patriarchal society bullshit. \n\nBut the second thing is more complicated: it is genuinely hard to wrap your mind around vicious acts if you're a well-adjusted person. Theres a reason why whenever we hear of a horrible bully, a murder, a mass shooting, a terrorist attack, we ask \"why???\"  Our empathy for our fellow man STOPS your brain from thinking that way most of  the time. It's distressing to even put yourself in the shoes of the attacker and go through their cognitive reasoning. It will leave you fucked up. \n\nAnd that's where a lot of abusers & r!pists get away with it IMO: none of them are ever honest, except to like-minded people, about how they truly think & feel in those situations.\n\nSeriously think about it. I know a lot about DV & SA because of victim impact, victims stories etc. I cannot think of a single time, outside of an attacker flexing to fellow degenerates on a message board, that someone has come out and said \"yeah and this is what that was like for me. That's why I did it. Here's what was going through my mind when i strangled this person.\" Its SILENCE. Because they KNOW their true rationale is heinous, so its always deflected or minimised or \"well it was her fault for not listening to me\" etc. \n\nI hope my argument is making some sense to someone.",

Like the way they're talking about it is giving priest Stonewall riot energy, where cops were just busting into queer bars and harassing people for being there, only in this case, many of the people in charge have the cops in their pockets. And I really don't like how they're trying to make this about sex when it's not. What happened there was not sex. It was not consensual. Many of the victims were minors. They weren't sex workers. From the people I've talked to and things are read from them, No professional sex worker would ever work with a man like Diddy. \n\nBut instead of all of that, people want to focus on baby oil, and lube, and if he had sex with a man. They're so goddamn unserious and they're the ones who always get to be heard the most because other people are just as stupid and unserious as them.",

He speaks to it at length in the very clip that was referenced. The gist was that he wouldn’t forgo material benefit for the people of Belize but he’s been clear that the man ruined a chapter of his life.",

The discussions around power and the criminal system were really thought provoking. \n\nLike, how do we construct a system that supports survivors while at the same time  perpetrators are held accountable and able to be rehabilitated  given the opportunity to make a meaningful change. \n\nI also agree that there needs to be more discussion around how men are raised to view power and sexuality, and the ways media can influence that. It kinda says something about the mediascape we live in where Zuko in avatar the last airbender presents one of  morr realistic depictions of interrogatinng ones own role in perpetuating harm. Where its a slow and often arduous process and not a singular act of self sacrificing redemption. \nI think media presents one potential way to more proactively introduce the tools one needs to understand the harm they can cause others and themselves. It has to be done in tandem with interpersonal and  community discussions around the \"why\"s yall discussed towards the end of the video.",

        "text": "​@olurinatti I'm sorry this doesn't really make sense to me. You say that expecting one of the purposes of prison to be protection of society (current, past and future potential victims) from the offender is an idealistic position. So erroneously idealistic that you even posit that imprisoning people is that will cause a violent offender to get even more violent if and when released back into their communities. \n\nBut your argument fails to see how overly-idealistic the abolitionist movement requires people to be.\n\nDiddy, like many other abuse perpetrators before him - did not need _any_ help in being violent and abusive; in fact from the sounds of the civil and criminal suits against him he was damn right creative in his execution of violence. Are we expected to believe given all the pain & fear he put people through, if he served time, that somehow the levels of dysfunction he's gonna be subjected to are soooo great that we should put his needs over and above his victims who deserve justice? That what he'll experience as an inmate will be at the level of bullshit he put people through? \n\nAnd if that's the case and you're fine with that, then let's consider the next step. We know that any system isn't fair until it is applied wholly and equally across society. The justice system is currently unfair because it is not applied wholly and equally across all of society. But if were more equal, and we chose the prison-abolitionist way; when we get cases like white cops murdering black and brown people with impunity for fun and for sport - that prison-free justice system would have to apply to them too. So would we be happy saying calmly, to the families of George Floyd and everyone who suffered the same fate as him \"well hey listen we don't want to subject the offender to more violence\".  Because now we're getting awfully close to what these police departments have been trying to placate us with for years \"no don't worry, we're very sorry for what happened but we're using this as a learning opportunity\". That's how empty and devoid of justice it would feel to not just me but I think many others. \n\nThe problem is with talking about criminal and rehabilitative justice from a purely ideological point of view is that it ignores the reality of human nature. We get the best progressive, most humane structures when we strive to give people the chance to be better but we also recognise that overly-idealistic or moralistic policy prescriptions can be damaging in the long run. That's one of the things that pro-purity culture and anti-sex education advocates struggle to understand. For them all you have to do is \"be moral\" and any consequences as a result of your moral failings are yours. \n\nThat's one of the reasons why the architect of the Prohibition Era failed in his overall vision. He was the son of a violent alcoholic and rightfully had trauma surrounding it. He thought that \"if we just do away with this, all will be fixed\" ... and well, history and social science showed us how wrong he was. \n\nThe same I think is very much true for the abolitionist movement I'm sorry to say. Just because the criminal justice system doesn't function ideally at all today, does not mean we mindlessly tear it all down without greater, nuanced thought of the consequences. Restorative justice between SA/r4pe victims and their attackers was intended by its architects to be a \"humanistic\" approach to right the wrongs of SA abuse, but all it did was force victims into terrible positions of being made to minimise the effects of what happened.",

Bottom line, having enough probable cause to get an indictment does not mean that when it all goes to trial they can offer key witnesses more than can be offered by Diddy for thier silence or playing dumb on the stand. He has a lot of money and involving the label has probably created a bidding war for silence among employees, etc. so this will be interesting...
