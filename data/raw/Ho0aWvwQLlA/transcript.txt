so as some of you know uh we've been having a series of events this weekend um this panel is called uh the politics of free speech um and we'll be having another event in the evening which I'll announce um after uh we're done with our panel today um so first I'm going to introduce our speakers for this panel then I'll read the panel description and then we'll go ahead and get started all so going from my right which from this side of the table um we have Carlos Scaro who is a co-founder of Midwest marks Midwestern marks excuse me and writer currently working on a seral anthology of American socialism Abdul Al khalan is Professor of African-American studies at UIC and author of Malcolm X for beginners Ralph Leonard is a British Nigerian writer based in England his work has appeared in unheard subli magazine Aro magazine quillette the Platypus review and elsewhere Jack Ross is author of the Socialist Party of America a complete history and the strange death of American exceptionalism and finally Jack Weinberg is an environmental activist former New leftist and is known for his role in the Berkeley Free Speech movement each of the panelists will give opening remarks of about 10 minutes followed by short responses um from the panelists and then we'll open it up to an audience Q&A um so now I'll read the description that was circulated to the panelists ahead of this event for the politics of free speech um and it starts with two quotes which if you don't mind I'm going to read so the first is by Thomas Jefferson from his first inaugural address in 1801 if there be any Among Us who would wish to dissolve this Union or to change its Republican form let them stand undisturbed as monuments to the safety with which error of opinion may be tolerated where reason is left free to combat it and the second quote that we Ed is from friederick angles SL um the Prussian military question of the German Workers Party in 1865 the government knows and the bisi knows too that the whole German Workers movement today is only tolerated only survives for as long as the government chooses for as long as it serves the government's purpose for this movement to exist and for the boua opposition to be faced with new independent opponents thus long will it tolerate this movement from the moment that this movement turns the workers into an independent force and thereby becomes a danger to the government there will be an Abrupt end to it all the whole manner in which the men of progress agitation in the Press associations and assemblies has been put down should serve as a warning to the world workers the same laws edicts and measures which were applied in that case can be applied against them at any time and deal a lethal blow to their agitation and they will be so applied as soon as this agitation becomes dangerous it is of the greatest importance that the workers should be clear about this point and do not fall prey to the same illusion as the Bazi in the new era when it was similarly only tolerated but imagined it was already in the saddle and if anyone should imagine the present government would free the press the right of Association and the right of assembly from their present feds he is clearly among those to whom there is no point in talking and unless there is freedom of the press the right of Association and the right of assembly no workers movement is possible and then we post the following kind of description and questions to the panelist from the Sedition Act of 1798 through the Sedition Act of 1918 the right to public speech has been tied to the politics of the state both Acts were raised in recent prosecutions of Donald Trump to Bar him from candidacy in the upcoming election the 1798 Act was authorized under John Adams presidency as a means of Prosecuting and convicting members of the Jeffersonian press for their support of the Jacobins in the French Revolution and their further criticism of the Adams Administration while the 1918 Act was authorized under Wilson's presidency as a means of Prosecuting and convicting Socialist Party leader and presidential candidate Eugene V Debs for his speech in Canton Ohio which called for turning the inter imperialist War into a class for meanwhile today the same leftists calling toat from the right are themselves called the right and driven off campus what is the importance of civil liberties especially freedom of speech for the freedom of society does society have the right to be wrong what made Free Speech a socialist cause what is the relationship of socialism and civil liberties and and finally why has the left suppressed or supported free speech and what distinguishes its doing so from the right in what way is Free Speech a concern of the left how is its concern distinguished from that of the right um so with that uh Carlos if you like to again just so hello can everyone hear me okay yes okay thank you well it's a first a pleasure to be here thank you so much for the invite is this better now there we go thank you uh in his early writings against censorship car marks proposed that it is insufficient to Simply criticize censorship on the basis of how it depicts a limitation of our freedoms and rights far more important he held was the critical inquiry into the conditions for the possibility of censorship censorship clearly does not arise out of thin air it is produced by certain conditions which call it forth as a necessity for the dominant order in our age where censorship is the order of the day and expresses itself in diverse forms we too must ask what are the conditions which make this censorship necessary while it is indeed essential to call out the hypocrisy of the enunciated values of the capitalist class and the violations of these in reality simply doing this is insufficient to help us understand explain make sense of why it is that censorship is so prevalent in the first place I think it is clear when we observe the decaying trust in ruling institutions and the media which is for instance only 11% of the population trusts in politicians Etc that the ruling Elite have on their hands a crisis of legitimacy censorship is then a clear product of a failure of Bourgeois ideology a deterioration of their hegemonic control over the spontaneous World Views of the mass of people the narratives produced by the ruling institutions of the capitalist class are no longer uncritically and spontaneously accepted by the mass of people most regular Americans especially the youth intuitively understand that the media and other ideological apparatuses of the ruling class are not there to tell us the truth quite the opposite their whole purpose is to distort the world in such a way that it allows us to make sense of it through the narratives upheld by the ruling Elite to employ a technical term we use in the Marxist tradition their whole purpose is to systematically reproduce a form of false consciousness ious a Consciousness which turns the world on its head on the basis of superficial one-sided facts distortions and lies somehow Israel is the victim China the imperialist and Cuba the state sponsor of terrorism this is not simply a problem of epistemic hygiene as the scholar Vanessa Wills has called it but an objective social reality of the capitalist mode of life it is a system that in order to reproduce itself and obtain the consent of the governed requires that people understand the world in a Topsy Turvy manner it is an order that requires a distorted refraction of itself in the realm of ideas not an accurate corresponsive reflection working class Americans and even some dissidents from the more privileged classes are beginning to intuitively understand this reality even if it is not or at least not yet comprehended with a concreteness and systematicity that a Marxist Outlook can provide nonetheless even these spontaneous and often incoherent forms of dissent of dissent find themselves under the boot of sensor Ship by a ruling Elite too fragile to allow any form of dissent on principal issues of Empire they much prefer and frankly need a compatible form of denters whether left or right who might criticize politicians capitalism or the Matrix Etc but who on issues of imperialism fall Faithfully in line with the narratives of the ruling Elite these issues of Empire corresponding to the new imperialist stage of capitalism we find ourselves in are the Achilles heel for the Contemporary Elite the the vast majority of those who have been censored over the last few years have been attacked and maligned precisely because of their challenges to the imperialist narratives no one that I know of has been censored on the basis of calling for the raising of the minimum wage for Medicare for all or for loan forgiveness important though these issues are for the vast majority of working-class Americans the voices which are censored are those which have challenged the narratives of Empire on key issues such as the proxy war against Russia the new Cold War against China the unilateral coercive me measures against Venezuela Cuba Nicaragua and others and of course the most pivotable pivotal issue of our day the genocide of the Palestinians by the fascist state of Israel the US's Colonial Outpost in East Asia I speak today not as an outsider simply interested in issues of censorship but as a director of an Institute that has had to battle tooth and nail against censorship for the last few years 3 years ago when the July 11th color Revolution protests in Cuba were occurring we used our institute's Tik Tok to dispel the imperialist myths aimed as always at regime change our following at the time was nearing 300,000 and the videos we were making were reaching millions of people within a couple videos discussing the situation our account would get temporarily suspended a reality we Face throughout the whole summer as is often the case because they cannot beat us at the level of ideas their only option was censorship within months of the special military operation uh representing a new moment in the imperialist west battle against Russia at the time we used our institute's Tik Tok platform to push to push back against the NATO imperialist narrative painting Putin simply as a bloodthirsty Maniac uh we contextualize the Smo in the long history of usn expansion towards Russia the war on the people of the dabass since 2014 the expansion backed by the west of the Nazi vanderism and its incorporation into the Ukrainian State amongst other factors necessary to properly understand the actions that occurred in February 20 uh 2022 all factors which in previous years the imperialist media itself and various us officials themselves accept C it for exposing these truths challenging to the imperialist narrative our account this time nearing 400,000 followers would be permanently banned in the subsequent year we would create seven new accounts a few of which would surpass the 100,000 follower Mark only to be banned as soon as we once again were capable of reaching Millions as the investigative work of isent McLoud has shown the year the censorship Against The Institute started the Biden Administration would force bik dance the Chinese company with the people- centered algorithm that allowed us to grow to hand over management of their us servers to the Texas based company Oracle a company with intimate ties to the CIA it was revealed in mcl's report that Oracle had a Litany of former US state department and intelligence operatives to manage uh the content for Tik Tok as well as a few NATO Executives for good measure Tik Tok said that they deleted uh 320,000 Russian accounts which included many American socialists who never had any association with Russia in any way including of course our Institute the censorship we have faced however has been far from limited to Tik Tok and app that although managed by the state department in manyways has been unable to fully control the dissenting attitudes to imperialism the youth put out the real reason why they have been moving to ban the app and why even though we've been banned more than seven times we've been able to rebuild a new account with well over 200,000 followers and millions of views on various videos in the middle of February of this year while we were covering the death of the West beloved far-right racist Nal we received news that our YouTube was demonetized this was one of the central sources of revenue for The Institute a place where people would donate through and ask questions in our live broadcast this of course was a unique form of censorship a targeting of the financial Foundation which allows us to do the work we do this is merely the tip of the iceberg of censorship attacks we and many others like us have faced when our ideas not only challenge the dominant narrative but do so in a way that reaches hundreds of thousands and sometimes millions of people as of recent one of uh the director of the international Department Of The Institute was fired from his teaching position at the City University of New York uh Professor Danny Shaw for speaking out against the Israeli genocide social media has as I have tried to outline in my recent writings become one of the central ideological Fields where the war of position that is the war of ideas for the hearts and minds of people has to be waged it is an area people spend 3 to 4 hours a day surfing and which is Central to the spontaneously developing views people come to hold on relevant political issues despite its tubular character and the leakages of dissenting views that spring up here and there it has become the most important apparatus of narrative control for the ruling class A Space where they can boost the narratives uh sometimes directly indirectly through Bots uh that uh benefit them and shut down the dissenting narratives that go against their uh dominant narrative again sometimes directly through bands sometimes indirectly through demonetization and sometimes more insidiously such as through Shadow bands uh which has occurred to various Folks at our Institute in the face of this censorship it is the duty of marxists to contextual ize its emergence in the crisis of legitimacy and Empire we have before us it is also our duty if we wish to win the war of positions to use to our favor the gap between the lofty enunciated ideas of the ruling class most of which are accepted in the common sense of our people and the reality their order creates the fact that on the one hand the elite proclaimed the right to free speech media Etc and that on the other they censor all voices which challenge the dominant narrative especially on issues of War and Peace is an objective contradiction we must explain to the American people and exploit in our favor we must help them achieve coherence in the dissenting attitudes they already hold Aid them in understanding why the ruling class and its institutions ought to be destructed dist distrusted and challenged Lin's question Freedom or freedom of speech for whom and to do what must always be asked freedom of speech or of any other kind is an abstraction that contains an obscured class content freedom of speech for the elite is the freedom of their speech their freedom to distort reality and keep us ignorant uh ignorant cogs in a machine they own profit off of and hope to continue to run freedom of speech for us the vast majority of people is fundamentally rooted in our ability to speak truth to power to challenge the narratives of those who cloak themselves under the opes of fighting misinformation while it is they who are the great liars deceivers and misinforms this requires that we stand against censorship of all kinds not just those who already hold our Marxist worldview anyone challenging Empire regardless of how anachronistic their views might be ought to have their rights to Fe free speech and media protected as marxists that is as the ultimate enemies of the ruling order we cannot stand in favor of the states cracking down on dissenting voices on issues of Empire even if outside of those issues we might find some of these denters views abhorent in our era of blatant censorship us marxists ought to defend the right to free speech endowed to us in our Bourgeois Constitution even if we are able to understand and explain to others the systematic reasons why the capitalist ruling class will always in times of Crisis have to violate the Democratic rights it annunciates with its emergence on the historical seat thank [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you okay thank you uh for inviting me uh it's a pleasure to join this panel and this important audience committed to social transformation of this decadent capitalist crisis we face and we suffer through this talk will briefly address five topics language and Society speech and EST State Black Liberation class struggle and agency we need for social transformation language is fundamental for our human experience and as such is a necessary feature of every society no aspect of social life is possible without it to any great extent in particular language is a feature of a Nation holding together everyone in it across all social divisions if we were to refer to the base superstructure model of society language is everywhere it's a production force of capitalist production just as it is a way that production relations are governed workers and capitalists are tied together by using a Common Language even in South Africa the bors use their version of what was called kitchen Zulu to govern their Servants of course all aspects of the superstructure function with the use of language language as part of the social order is managed by the state key to this is the organization of an education process to make sure that a common language is sustained this is a critical issue in a multinational country this is a political question with practical functionality how many official languages should a country maintain but of course also how many languages can a country maintain of course this is a question that might soon be answered by artificial intelligence each nationality would naturally have an affinity with its own language of origin so if there was an AI automatic translation of spoken and written speech available to all then all languages might coexist speech is language in action both in its written and spoken forms speech as all important Behavior culture and social actions and traditions are usually managed by the state what is possible within the social order without threatening class rule is allowed and what threatens this class rule is deemed illegal and punishable for us we can begin by looking at the first constitutional amendment dealing with freedom of speech now this of course was limited by the US legalizing slavery as an essential part of the social order this system involved the necessary silencing of the slaves whose Free Speech would challenge the slave government's legitimacy for the most part they were denied such speech so much for the Jefferson quote calling for people to speak out that was  obviously the slaves were not allowed to do that that might help you understand what's going on in this country today there were notable exceptions for free black people one example is my great great-grandfather who bought his freedom in 1819 and got the Illinois legislature in 1837 to pass the mcart law enabling him to Sue and be sued and a whole bunch of other stuff this act was an exception to the Black Codes of Illinois that were designed to deny these freedoms to all black people a great struggle took place around abolitionism and the Underground Railroad over whether to practice speech to break laws is protected Free Speech Congress passed a gag order to ban such speech in Congress that eventually got overturned in 1837 Missouri passed a law that banned all abolitionist speech a practice soon followed by all the southern slaveholding states Century later 1940 Congress enacted the Smith Act making it illegal to Advocate quote overthrowing or destroying any government in the United States by force and violence over 200 people were prosecuted under the Smith Act especially anti-c capitalist Advocates of socialist Revolution even in the 1960s the speech of the Freedom Movement was regulated and suppressed the phrase that issue was whether speech created quote a clear and present danger to Society meaning the state and its role to protect the ruling class Southern Police interpreted that to mean advocating for integration the right to vote and other acts that seemed obvious rights under the US Constitution in 1969 the Supreme Court established that speech advocating illegal conduct is protected under the First Amendment unless the speech is likely to quote inight imminent Lawless action in other words there's always a phrase that enables the ruling class to interpret what it wants to allow and what it doesn't want to allow always the condition to be interpreted as the rulers and their political agents seem fit words by themselves mean nothing as its actions what people do that really matter if not by the state then by mob violence that's also a function of what the ruling class wants this brings us to the heart of the matter there is no such thing as free speech without limitations you might say that speech is never really free there are two kinds of limitations what speech you are capable of versus what you are allowed to do now there are two aspects of what one uh person or group is capable of speech skills and what audience you can access for your speech speech skills means literacy and being informed as well as having the cultural proclivity to perform important speech especially advocacy for opposing oppression and exploitation the state has a task of defining Norms of education for literacy and cultivating a democratic culture of public speech this requires levels of literacy and levels of ignorance at the same time you got to know enough to do your job but not enough to challenge power a major aspect of this is also overcoming the fear that workers have IND been induced to have by management this is really a critical question that workers are afraid because they don't want to lose their jobs that's a fundamental aspect of this freedom of speech not the middle class I'm about the working class but equally as important is the audience if nobody is listening you can usually run your mouth your printing press or your computer all you want but when the tender is dry and wherever even a single spark is dangerous the law cracks down the state is usually very intolerant of any serious danger it faces or even Suspects now Black Liberation is a necessary process in which speech plays an important role now one example is rap hip hop speech rap started out as a maximization of workingclass cultural speech a critical expose of racism and all forms of exploitation but two things happened they co-opt commodify and flip the script from radic critique into gangster R self- negating banter of all things negative one good example is they take I who famously rra the police flipped him and turned him into the fake police on TV another as they take te Poe the rapper of the Ferguson Uprising and make him a visiting scholar at Harvard to co-opt and display him as a curiosity in that environment of ruling class ation then the system acts like it favors free free speech by using Court ruling stating that gangster rap is in fact protected speech economic shutdown on the one hand of authentic cultural voice of the oppressed with political defense on how they want it to be the attack continues with a focus on black studies speech and academic freedom the attacked on diversity and critical race theories of Full Assault on black studies black studies was a successful Battlefront for black power beginning in 1966 racist white power sees it as an obstacle that must be contained this is parallel to the other wing of the ruling class moving in with a standardized AP course both attempting to be an alternative to Black agency of self-determination and some in this period of repression and regression speech is being Limited in all sorts of ways now just another word on artificial intelligence especially the role of chat GPT the new tool responds to questions or commands by instantaneously creating text the new tool is a corporate replacement for free speech it makes it an easy process to replace a person's thought with what appears to be clear in better text just like fast food see like a good idea it's fast it's somewhat cheap almost everywhere but also unhealthy in the cause of obesity so getting this text from chat GPT which has now invaded every classroom in the United States every classroom including in places like this so getting this text seems great but when used can lead to undeveloped capacity to think and create original speech I'll skip ahead now let me say in conclusion that the agency we need to advance socially transformative speech is to activate literacy and the norm of democratic debate and discussion among working class and oppressed people we win when the masses move and that's our strategic go no matter what happens via its legislation or Court decisions the masses make history and we should never forget [Music] that uh thank you um if we were to distill the case for free speech in a in a single paragraph it would be the one made by Thomas pay in the introduction to the of Reason where he says you will do me the Justice to remember that I have always strenuously supported the right of every man to his own opinion however different that opinion might be to mine he who denies this another right makes a slave of himself to his present opinion because he precludes himself the right of changing it I think that's a very important point to uh so kin uh because when um if we are going to struggle or make the case for socialism in within Civil Society we should understand that there might be there might be a possibility that we might hold we might be wrong uh in our views so um Jacob manga in his voluminous history of free speech claimed that if the great icons of the cause of free speech whether Barack Spinosa or Frederick Douglas live today he and he writes they would surely declare the 21st century an unprecedented golden age now that seems like a very startling claim giving that given that states across the world still imprison torture and murder critics and opponents with impunity formerly democratic nations still use the Judiciary to silence those they don't like states are desperate to censor speech on social media they label as dangerous and especially in the west there's constant quarreling over Council culture and the boundaries of academic freedom of course this this does shouldn't dismiss the current challenges to free speech rather it suggests that in historical terms we have never been more free to say what we think with more means at our disposal but this produces a contradiction the fact that at least within Western democracies we live in relatively more open societies has led to uh an underestimate underestimating even becoming dismissive of the threats of censorship and other forms of restrictions on free expression whether direct or indirect the success of hisorical struggles to expand free expression struggles that the left has been has intimately participated in can obscure the lessons of those struggles for example the struggle for free speech was part of wider struggle for Freedom whether it was during the bis revolutions or in the OR in causes like the Abolitionist cause or even the struggle for socialism itself there was a recognition that censorship was the weapon used by the ruling classes to foil social change and progress today there is a lot of confusion very often censorship in Western liberal democracies is imposed in the name of protecting the marginalized and vulnerable for instance hatte speech laws but one irony of hate speech laws for example in my own country of England when the first uh form of laws against inciting racial hatred was uh put in in 1968 the first person prosecuted under that wasn't a Neo-Nazi it was a black nationalist called Michael X um restrictions such as these that are usually supported by Progressive liberals and even some parts of the left as a progressive good in it goes in contrast to the previous line of socialist radicals against the capitalist State restricting restricting speech of the citizenry moreover there has been an arrogant attitude on some sections of the left that take a very instrumentalist attitude to free speech free speech is good when we're not in power because it allows us to mobilize and agitate but when we're in power we won't be stupid enough to allow bad people to puke out their ideas in in case to cause trouble and spread counterrevolutionary ideas and this uh uh shows that um when that as a socialist Movement we shouldn't be afraid to engage in the battle for speech and uh to have out our ideas in the public sphere because if we really claim to uh defend the freedom of society then we have to understand that not all the society is going to agree with us and it is through this dialectic of debate and argument that we can have any chance of enacting social transformation on the world [Applause] [Music] scale so um when it comes to um the first the an to directly answering the questions uh posed in in the in the prompt for this panel and basic first principles of free speech I completely share the views Ralph just expressed but um I was asked closer to your okay is that better all right so I was asked to take a more historical view um on this question um but I I guess just to pick up on Ralph and um when it comes so the quotes you opened with um uh first of Jefferson and also pay obviously and then um and then marks and leading that into uh uh continuity between Sedition Acts of 1790 and 1918 um and uh the case of Eugene Debs of course um well on the one hand it's certainly naive to think that uh uh that uh the founders of the Republic uh would have been card carrying members of the ACLU it's it is what is true is that there was a a revolutionary tradition and a continuity that uh was that led into the payday of American Socialist movement for World War I and was abruptly cut off and entirely consistent with the core platypus principle about 1919 uh cutting off of the the completion of bgea Revolution um and its succession by uh by a popular front and state um a lot of themes for those who were here yesterday to listen to Sean KB are going to become relevant for my talk um in one way I I look at this historically um when it comes to uh um to what the Revolutionary tradition was and how it was cut off what is true about uh um so um someone I know named uh Sam Goldman uh GW professor had a short book a few years ago called after nationalism and he had his three rival concepts of American history of Covenant Crucible and Creed and Covenant being America uh basic uh in puritan Origins American nationalism Manifest Destiny and C wilsonianism where it crucially had much more of a popular base of support and um and the base basically you had in American revolutionary period of a potential that was arrested for uh many reasons um but uh slavery obviously being one but also just simply uh just very basic dynamics of Revolution counter Revolution you would have had uh Crucible idea of a single American nationality and Creed basically what was for much of 20 Century called American creed value system derived from the Declaration of Independence and Bill of Rights um that in the new deal period And basically because in world first world war um wilsonianism ultimately failed as a nationalizing project um collaps of prohibition disillusionment with bonian foreign policy and also you had the arrest of the Socialist tradition to the extent you had some uh and so basically articulation of American creed beginning the New Deal era and era in which civil libertarian ideas we know today was really um was really arrest um that was basically I guess you'd call it a papering over of the contradiction um so um I guess none of the previous speakers have spoken to uh uh the current events tyeing of the questions as it uh relates to uh Trump and the case against Trump and uh the arguments Chris Krone made last night well on the one hand um I certainly uh as historian of American Socialist movement and suppression of socialist movement was very disturbed uh uh beginning in 2016 Embrace of the very rationals behind alien Edition Act and the ways in which they were actually invoked um and defining so-called resistance but I um I I'm I I I feel like the facts have changed a lot and I'm not as uh Disturbed I mean um I as far as the why not Trump again um I mean I feel like if anything there's a lot of complacency Trump running again uh January 6 did not turn out to be any kind of reog fire event as one might have feared at one time um and uh it it's all independent actors bring the various cases and they're all falling apart I mean I feel like rather than anything like fascism quite the contrary we as others have discussed already this weekend is just the death of mass politics there there's there there's simply no Mass politics there and whatever else Trump and the Trump cult might represent at this point it's certainly not it's C it's certainly the very big difference with uh viar Germany and and some and related episodes is uh you simply do not have mass politics in the same way and um so when it comes to the so when it comes to the question well yes of what is Trump then and um I mean the I mean it really is very straightforward uh is that he is what Joe McCarthy was and it's critical to recognize what he was and what he wasn't and uh there is a great um there is a historian writing in the 60s uh who had a really shocking quote of how per that how perfectly it applies to Trump DB balil who wrote of McCarthy uh he was able to dominate intimidate the admise leadership of the supposedly most powerful Nation on Earth for almost half a decade precisely because he was an an aoral master of publicity and a manipulative Society now um I think more than anything um that's very relevant understanding what the right answer as opposed to the wrong answer to Trump is um and uh um that uh principle of uh um that was a view of many of the founders of Cold War liberalism that whatever there their failings were heirs to Historic American Socialist tradition and uh um the basic position the problem with McCarthy was not his ends but his means but and so directly on that point is a quote I want to read from uh Norman Thomas in the 1950s um uh several years after the last of his six presidential campaigns and right around the time of McCarthy's downfall and um I uncanny uncannily anticipate uh dichotomy with threats the survival of of liberalism of uh to principles of free speech from trumpism on the one hand and uh um intersectionalism on the other um and I quote we cannot defend Liberty by denying the danger of the organized communist conspiracy even if at the moment it is weak within the United States it was a serious liberal error contributing to the rise of McCarthyism that so many liberals so long minimize the Communist evil communism is a monstrous threat to any valid theor practice of freedom and fellowship among men in this double struggle there are unfortunately some avowed liberals who Aid both mcarthism and communism by persistently minimizing the danger of Communism in America and by assuming that because the complex of ideas and actions which we sometimes call McCarthyism is bad on the whole therefore none of its elements is necess NE AR or even defensible and because the McCarthy big and little have given the wrong answer to Communism there is no need for any answer except the touching faith that truth is mighty and must Prevail not so can our freedom be preserved and expanded in our effort to meet the challenge which Communism and other conspiratorial movements present to the Jeffersonian ideal I think that we should get further By ignoring mcarthism for the time being and asking ourselves what action rational citizens should have commended what they should now commend to their government in the face of the Communist war on freedom under democracy to what Liberties are men and women entitled who in power would deny all Freedom the Jeffersonian faith and the power of Truth has postulated on its ability to Prevail over error openly advocated in the marketplace of ideas now how um so if we begin with the premise that in that quote you can very simply swap McCarthy or McCarthyism for Trump or Trump ISM and communist for woke or intersectionalist or take or pick um um what does that say about the questions of the State and State versus civil society because as was true in a somewhat more limited sense then in the context Norman Thomas was speaking about uh you had uh like for example um if a communist would take over the newspaper Guild would they dict uh uh newspaper policy and how would how would uh how would the either either or both the state or Civil Society respond to this you saw this uh you s you saw this in the 1980s with uh in Nicaragua way the way the state run unions took over The Independent Newspaper L prena and it was very much uh an ominous Shadow over uh what happened at the New York Times during the May June days of 2020 um and um and so I guess the discussion needs to be had is uh I mean if we talk about how do how do you take it on the right way we've seen enough in the last few years of very much like the way uh Pro McCarthy groups took it on the wrong way you've seen a lot of the groups uh the more right rightwing group since 2020 that have uh their limitations and failings have become evident um and again as I said um discussion yesterday about State versus civil society is relevant uh we are still uh a few centuries out from uh uh in along the mark marxian lines the state withering away and so it it is a process of continuing to negotiate that about how can the state or Democratic accountability bring to heal uh organizations of the professions and uh and corporate Capital that uh uh that create that create these threats to uh the principles of uh of liberal of liberalism and free speech and uh that I would say in in a nutshell is is the challenge uh we face [Applause] today I guess I'm next and last my name's Jack just a minute the M he I have the mik I have the M my name is Jack Weinberg um it's not on Pardon B closer to your M can you hear me now yes my name is Jack Weinberg um I thank the organizers for inviting me I was asked to speak about the U Berkeley Free Speech movement 1964 um the panelists that came before me have raised numerous theoretical and practical and contemporary topics um I'll address those I'll address those during the discussion I'll stick to um the Free Speech movement and a little bit about my um trajectory since the Free Speech movement which seemed to be a topic that when I spoke to other people in your movement um were interested in um the story starts for me in 1962 when I was um an upper uh I was an undergraduate just finishing my undergraduate work at Berkeley and I was recruited um to participate in a campaign of a civil rights organization the Congress on Racial equality core um core in those days was a nonviolent activist organization whose mission was integration Racial equality and integration This was um prior to the rise of the black Power movement and I was recruited to to participate in a campaign that was fighting against some racial discrimination in hiring in the Bay Area in 1962 there was no laws against racial discrimination in hiring there was no laws against racial discrimination um and housing anywhere in the country certainly not in California and I became involved in that campaign um within a year um I dropped I went to graduate school I dropped out of graduate school and became a full-time um campaigner for core um the um I'll jump ahead and then I'll come back um I was an activist in the civil rights movement during the early 60s um I then became very engaged a regional and local leader in the anti-vietnam war and the um Anti-Imperialist movements of the' 60s uh was during that time I was recruited to socialism and I became a member of what was then the independent socialist clubs at Berkeley that later turned into an organization called the international socialists um I stayed active in those things during th that period I also had relationships with the Black Panther Party at the time when they were transforming from a local Oakland group to a national phenomena and that took me through those activities and much more took me through the' 60s by the end of the 60s the um student movement or the radical movement at that point um that I was a part of in my mind had turned overwhelmingly to maoism and adventurism and to all kinds of things the organization that I was a part of decided to make what we called a turn to the working class um members from both coasts moved to the Midwest took jobs in steel and auto and Trucking and other um industrial jobs I worked in Auto plants I was hir I was fired in a wildcat strike in Detroit in the 1973 I organized Auto Workers in Detroit um activist Auto Workers in Detroit till 77 I moved to Gary Indiana I worked for the next eight years as a steel worker in Gary Indiana while I was a steel worker in Gary um I became active in environmental issues starting with local campaign um it was during that period that I sort of moved away from my Marxism and know was there was no longer answering the questions that I had it was no longer I it came to me because I I came to it because it was a theory of action and it was no longer answering the questions that I had and it was also um in many ways um out of date in my view I stayed on as an environmental activist um I ended up working for Greenpeace for 10 years years um I then left free peace and organized International environmental networks and I had the Good Fortune of being able to organize a network that's now active in 100 countries that works on toxic chemical pollutant so that's that's the trajectory of my life the Marxism has helped inform me but there are many other intellectual factors as well now to the Free Speech movement um the Free Speech movement was a direct outome of the Civil Rights Movement um the civil rights movement in 1963 began to Peak with the Montgomery um campaign the Martin Luther King UMC Montgomery campaign um which was really the first time that National Television had emerged to the point where something that was happening on the ground in uh not Montgomery I'm sorry Birmingham campaign was the first time where something was happening on the ground and Birmingham that day could show up on TV that night that never happened before and so TV was full of pictures of young children marching day after day getting getting hosed down getting bitten by police dogs um and continuing to do it it was a very inspiring campaign and it caught the attention of a whole generation both of African-Americans and also of of young people and it was from that moment the Civil Rights Movement went into a rapid Rise um the things that Happ I don't want to go through all the things that happened after that um everybody's familiar with the march in Washington various things I was in Berkeley by that time I was a chair chairman of a campus organization whose mission was mobilizing students for for supporting civil rights activities throughout the Bay Area so we would organize students on campus participate and Dem ations you know we were bring we got arrested numerous times um we were involving campaigns in numerous communities in the Bay Area supporting various activities again more complicated than I want to go into um in the end at the summer of 64 was when there was a peaking of this Civil Rights Movement um it led directly to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 64 but when we got back to campus we didn't know where it was heading we just knew that we were part of a movement that was ascended and we were very excited about taking our campaigns back to the campus when the university put out a ruling that outlawed the right to do any kind of activity of an advocacy nature on the campus you couldn't put out a leaflet you couldn't make a speech unless you were registered to make a speech you could couldn't raise money and you absolutely could not mobilize people for activities so that was the beginning of the the semester and let me say the Free Speech movement wasn't about abstract free speech in 1963 the most controversial person in the United States Malcolm X spoke on the campus to thousands of students it went through a procedure he was invited to speak he spoke it wasn't abstract Free Speech it was specifically the right to Advocate the right to organize the right to mobilize those were the things that that was being prohibited uh on the student campus um a coalition of student groups came together and interestingly it included not just the left although the left was a dominant Force um but we also had the Republican student organizations who were also infected and in fact it was some moderate Republicans who had participated in the Republican National Convention that year in San Francisco to try to stop Goldwater um um which was the rise of the racist wing of the Republican Party um it was also one of the one was mainly the Civil Rights Movement but the whole issue of students engaging in activity was seen as a threat um the business Community put pressure on the University and the university tried to shut it down so the act the issue was advocacy organizing Mobil mobilizing not free speech abstractly and the people who responded to it initially were the organizations who were engaged in those kind of activities and um some of the some of the members of our Coalition initially had relationships with the different Deans to try to negotiate some kind of settlement uh but the civil rights organization said whatever settlement you reach we're going to continue mobilizing two minutes already move away well I'm not going to get very far we we won the campaign um with 800 students sat down in the University Administration Building uh more than a thousand sat down 800 were arrested on that prompted a strike the basic the whole campus shut down um the um Administration after some backs and forth this faculty said the students right and it came out the end the end of the campaign was that the university passed a new policy that there should be no limits on the freedom of speech on campus other than um things related to time place and manner of speech uh we won that very quickly after that that became and I'll finish with this thought um very quickly after that that became the basis for organizing what became the anti-war anti An Vietnam War movement the students use those rights to organize a mass uh anti-war teaching 30 35,000 people participated a 35 uh over 24hour activity 355,000 people participated formed uh an anti-war Coalition on campus that later called for the first national mobilizations against the war in Vietnam and I'll end on this note the fact that we won this free speech battle so spectacularly on campus and it was a national International phenomena meant that during the Vietnam war the typical level of repression that you usually get during a war when you're when a country government's fighting a war they don't like opposition it very much opened the space um that enabled uh the mass vietn Antietam War movement for the next period to emerge thank you [Music] thank you so much to the panelist for these opening remarks now you will all have just uh an opportunity to give brief responses to the other panelists before we move to the Q&A um Carlos I'll let you kind of take the first opportunity but please do keep these brief so that we have plenty of time for questions uh um I I appreciate all of your uh presentations I really appreciated the the historical uh background that you're you're bringing to this discussion uh I very much appreciate your discussion about uh language and how that uh keep it close sorry nobody can hear you it's yeah I uh as I was listening I was trying to enjoy not really think much about what I would say afterwards but um yeah I don't have much to say my apologies there's any questions I'll answer them afterwards but just interested in your questions yeah I should have pulled that but we were asking you to please reply to the respond guys guys please don't yell from the audience um do take you know the opportunity to consider your other panelist remarks please um I think people actually will appreciate it but there will be plenty of time for questions do not worry um I was I was I want to inquire caros about when he talks about the class content of free speech that I wanted to press that could kind of clarify what you mean by that so maybe when you next speak you could respond to me on that and also I liked Abdul's um comment about you know he said speech is language in action and I I like that quote because it shows the how like how powerful free you know speech is like and that's the reason why it is so valuable is because it is powerful it is impactful it can it can influence people and move people to you know and mobilize people to do things in a you know collectively and individually um so so yeah I I I I have I don't really have much to say beyond that Carlos would you like to respond to what he asked about the class content of your speech sure yeah well I think freedom is a it's a universal concept and within the dialectical tradition whether it's in Hegel and Marxism uh we understand that universals um are not these uh things that are are Universal precisely because of the fact that they exist in the same way take the same form irrespective of space and time um what makes universals universals is precisely their ility to take different forms in different times um it's uh we operate with the notion of concrete universals that what uh this this sort of Gap that Western philosophy uh posits onto the world when it discusses universals where there's universals here particulars and there's this unbridgeable Gap that's not how we think and so when it comes to the question of freedom I consider it a universal but a concrete Universal it's like freedom for who to do what that's always been the the L inous question and when it comes to free speech um we have to realize that to a certain extent when you have a class that does have the the power and controls over the means of communication and um not just the Legacy Media now but the control over uh the web free speech for them means free speech for their class to say the things that benefit the narrative or the accepted parameter of narratives uh within the bouro order um I I think that for instance in a in a socialist society if remnants of those classes were around I don't care much about their free speech um I don't like because my the content would be we're trying to uh construct socialism and if people are expressing a certain uh form of speech that wants to bring us back into a form of life where um you know there's exploiters that are looting the people and letting the imperialists come in and loot the people uh the right to free speech there is not something that I would invoke but within a bourgea context when we're going to be the subjects of attacks um and uh and and free speech is already you know one of the enunciated values of the b z in that context I think it's something that we should fight for but we should never forget the you know the actual context and power dynamics that uh that that are grounding any uh understanding of freedom and Free Speech it's the same thing with freedom not just freedom of speech freedom in general it's like for who to do what you know the the capitalists have the freedom within capitalism to exploit to loot to do all the things you do around the world but that's a freedom that is conjoined with the unfreedom of the people that are the victims of that so uh socialist Freedom would limit that freedom for the capitals and that same relationship of what's the content of the freedom we have to understand that for freedom of speech as well might be le I might be wrong chck why don't use that microphone right there is on no um there it is okay so I amum so I appreciate so I appreciated Jack remarks about his experiences and specifically how uh the Free Speech uh uh movement uh uh directly contribut to L groundwork for the anti-war movement in the 60s um I would ask if you could talk a little more about uh how you dealt with the questions about free speech for the right I mean when you talked about about opposing Goldwater was it merely a matter of counter protesting when if when he was around or did you attempt to do more than that and I guess I would expand on that to also bring Abdul in discussion because one thing uh that didn't come up uh or I may have if I had more time brought up the importance of uh of free speech and specifically as and specifically Free Speech as understood in uh the context of of the idea of the American creed a new deal Cold War liberal uh Paradigm and beyond that just the larger civil libertarian Paradigm going back to a response to World War I repression um I mean Abdul um uh to bring into that discussion about what do you do you see that um I mean how since you have uh some rather different views one person who very much represented the importance of of that uh ethos to the success of the Civil Rights Movement uh was someone who uh was very opposed to uh uh Rise of Black studies became Dei Paradigm as you describe it and uh as being uh um on the side of spe struggling out his eny and that was and that was by Rustin so I guess I would uh ask you to BR I probably like Jack to answer first but uh but if you could then pick up on that discussion about the about the importance of larger Free Speech ethos and how that is important the civil rights movement or um thank you um I think Free Speech has two aspects one is the um the right um of course it's both the legal right but also the power um to attempt to influence how people think uh to try to influence the range of thoughts that are acceptable within society and to influence um and to build support for a point of view um that may at your moment in time be um in not not that PO popular or not that prevalent so that's the exchange of ideas the other thing is and the part that's usually most threatening because people out of power don't have a lot of a microphone to with their with their ideas although sometimes they do and ideas do get limited but the right to organize to take your ideas and try to turn them into action and try to influence public policy both the laws but also the opinions and the way people act and when you organize and when you Advocate and when you campaign that can be threatening to people and that's that's the part of free speech that we were fighting on but they're both important in terms of the specifics um it's important you know it's hard to think back to that period of time when none of you were born um but in when the Civil Rights Act was passed in 1964 it had more Republican votes than Democratic votes take that in um prior to that period of time um there was a division within the African-American movement whether it to be Republican or Democrat because the Democratic Party of the South was the Bastion of segregation the the Bastion of white supremacy and many uh Republicans particularly in the in the South were trying to use that to get black votes and the north um there were many Liberal Republicans so so that was so on the Berkeley campus there were number of trends of conservatives um there were the individualists um sort of radical Libertarians of an intellectual variety but there're also Republican activists and when the um the de Dem the Republican National convention was held in San Francisco and there was an effort to stop gold water they mobilized students through Republican networks to come and help Scranton try to stop um to try to stop goldw and that infuriated um the right-wing establishment ever almost as much as a civil rights movement infuriated them and the whole idea of students becoming a factor in the politics of society and in the activities of society in shaping public policy was unacceptable so um William Nolan who was then the editor of the open Tribune who had previously been um the the majority leader of the Senate under Eisenhower and one is a right-wing opponent of Eisenhower he and and then became the California um leader of the um the gwat campaign he was very influential and he basically told the university you're not going to get the various um bond funds you want and taxes you want if you let this continue to happen that's where the Free Speech movement came from they were responding to that very concrete pressure from a concrete political operatives who didn't want students to play a role in society and they wanted to stop that and that's what we thought about and for the next era young people in general were very influential in societ soety um and in fact and too much we go into here much of what we see today with Trump and trumpism is The Logical outcome of the interchange I guess voice call Marks to say the dialectic um between um the upsurges of the 60s and the issues that were being raised in the 60s and the reaction to them um in which um the other side had more money and more patience uh and ultimately better organizing skill and they built um the rightwing movements we see today and the left went into a sort of um s zombie mode and didn't know how to respond thank you thank you for the question uh what he's referring to is symbolized by the contradiction between Martin Luther King and the integrationist movement that uh say the early core represented which incidentally comes out of Chicago um and uh mam x a nationalist movement both of these Tendencies were fundamental really to the political culture in the African-American community and it's important to recognize that both of these men were assassinated so it's not a question of privileging one view or another because both Tendencies challenge power the interesting thing about the rise of black power and therefore out of that uh black studies is that it comes out of the cont the confrontation that the integrationist tendency had when it confronted institutional racism of higher education and any other institution workplaces Etc and therefore you have a development of black caucuses in other words the essential idea that oppressed people have to self-organize and do so in opposition sometimes to allies it's very interesting I'm working on a project now regarding the Underground Railroad the state of Illinois has uh passed an act which establishes a task force to deal with the question of the Underground Railroad in Illinois and what's interesting about historical narrative regarding the Underground Railroad is it's often about the Allies you know people who had houses in secret rooms or whatever and The Missing Link in all that are the freedom Seekers the real heroes and Heroes of the Underground Railroad but it's the white allies that get the narrative and so the question really is how do we even see freedom of speech use that phrase and not focus on the oppressed who are the actually people who are silenced in the society not the activist movement that is in court and their legislation Etc the real silence is the masses of people because once say you know this phrase consent of the Govern very important phrase because it's an illusion in other words how many people vote in the elections Etc what is the consent that anybody has given to ruling class rule so anyway to get to the question there was also a generational crisis people who had invested in the Civil Rights Movement were absolutely shocked by what was happening in the 6 s when it came to 6465 and then ' 66 with the development of black power and so the the voice changed from the southern integrationist movement which is trying to catch up with the sort of liberal experience of the north and I say sort of because there was segregation in Chicago uh de facto and you know real in other words my mother helped to integrate the Walgreens that's in the loop on Michigan Avenue so the shift moved to the north and became much more a question of power and out of that comes the Black Panther Party comes all kinds of transformation of Snick uh and the emergence of Malcolm as a voice now the interesting thing about this generational crisis is that we're now facing another generational crisis because the uh the middle of the 60s with the development of the league of revolutionary black workers really was the last major revolutionary impulse of the factory based working class of this country and that because of the de-industrialization that happened factories moved to the South to you know right of work states and then they moved to Mexico and so this de industrialization occurred uh Detroit is no longer what it was you know Chrysler had 60,000 Factory workers in Detroit they don't even have 60,000 Factory workers in the whole country now that was what was driving the Black Power movement was the emergence of a new thrust a self-determination thrust among black Working Class People That's the basis of black power that was the basis of the Panthers even though they had a street analysis James bogs in Detroit talked about the street Force they were really idealizing the unemployed as a force for revolutionary change but today we have another transformation that's the rise of Hip Hop and the rise of the cultural expression of people who are marginalized from full-time work and but now it's interesting because what's happening right now is a reindustrialization of the South the development of electronic Vehicles now billions of dollars are going into the South to build new factories this is going to suddenly then make an opportunity for people not to work at Amazon or to you know pour coffee in Starbucks but actually have a real factory industrial job which is going to change the class nature of the struggle in the South it's going to change the class nature of black and white proletarianization these are the forces that we as people on the left ought to be talking about constantly is how to in in impact the literacy and the speech Behavior avior of the working class that's the fundamental question of course students are important of course middle- class radicals are important but the fundamental issue is what is happening with the working class in this country that's the fundamental issue and that includes a lot of people who are pro Trump why are they prot Trump that's our class and we have to fight for them black white and everybody else but thank you for the question question Abul just just real quick so about by Rustin which Jack Ross ra I mean was he just wrong to think that black power was kind of um a step back or a concession to the failure to build a larger mass movement or what what do you make of that I think that's what Jack was trying to raise well I I have a tendency to uh uh to want to uh argue uh that there is this idea of one into two and then there's this idea of two into one and uh just like the reason I brought up King and Malcolm is that there was a convergence of an understanding of who the enemy was and I think be Rustin uh and his background coming out of uh the Quaker tradition coming out of the uh attempt to build the Civil Rights Movement the attempt to live out his own personal life there were a lot of contradictions that bay brustin was dealing with uh and tri too yeah uh left Tendencies and uh I wouldn't say he was I would I think he was wrong in opposing the Revolutionary potential of black power and of a self-determination impulse but I don't think he was wrong in terms of a contribution he made to the common struggle that we're all engaged in and so uh I think that uh well I'll just leave at that as um as I as as I understand um and uh uh a lot of plers members are more intimately familiar with the texts that that that Rustin wrote whether it was protest of politics or other articles that came after but I mean as I understand it I mean when you say uh Revol that he was wrong to oppose revolutionary potential I think the I as I understand the very question he was posing was to what end and that's I think you're you're you're I I I feel like you're simply making statement about about Means versus ends and again the question is is to what end the Revolutionary potential I I I am familiar with someone uh I someone I knew who interviewed him in the80s and as as I I do recall in that interview with Russ where he said uh it basically said if King wanted to move north did he have have specific concrete goals in mind did he know what did he know he would have a mass movement behind him and and to and up to a point it I I think he did but I I again I think I I I'm would really say I think the very question he was posing was to what end would this revolutionary potential be go ahead yeah on the same topic um in my own experience um the turning point from the integrationist movement to the I mean there are a lot of factors but the actual turning point in my in my experience was a 1964 Democratic party National Convention when a Mississippi Freedom Democratic party sent a delegation to Atlantic City um the they sent a delegation they had been registering voters um they had been denied the new voters were denied the right to participate in the county caucuses of the Republican Democratic party and therefore the Democratic party of Mississippi was all white by not by accident they they denied access to black people to the Democratic party process so the Mississippi de Freedom Democratic party um held its own convention own caucuses and elected its own integrated slate and sent a competing slate to Atlantic City and there were two slates the official Democratic Slate from official Democratic party and the freedom Democratic party slate that was led by Fanny ler and when they came up and there were hearings um and Johnson who was the presidential candidate saw the threat and he instructed Hubert Humphrey who was the leading liberal in the country who was also his Democratic vice presidential Campa candidate if you don't shut this thing down you're not going to be the vice presidential candidate and the whole liberal establishment um the UAW um the lawyer for the Mississippi Freedom Democrats Ral the whole liberal establishment clicked in they shut down the Mississippi Freedom Democratic party um seated the the democ the official Democratic party from Mississippi and at that point the entire Snick operation everybody was following the Snick operation the one lesson is you can never rely on white allies and so that was a huge turning point in the African-American movement as I saw it and then for those radicals who were active with them who had been in Mississippi who were friends of people who were Mississippi they had no ways to go they had no place to go because they they didn't have a role in the in the new African-American movement at that time but they were just as alien iated and just as angry and that was really the rise of the radicalization in my experience of of white activists on campuses that then one other thing in terms of what you said if you go about what was going on in Detroit you mention bogs and you mention the the black revolutionary workers um but bogs and the black unfortunately if they would have adopted bgs's ideas they would have been much more successful um in fact they ended up um becoming very narrow SE very very narrow the they became very narrow sectarians and couldn't work with other people and um bogs had a different set of ideas and so that was part of part of their part of their dead end was organizational as well but yes that was a big movement in Detroit you know I I was I was fired in a wildcat strike that was associated with sort of the high point of their movement so yes thank you okay there there's a lot of issues I want to deal with first I was chair of Snick in Chicago and I was at Atlantic City so I know a little bit about that the uh the question you rais about uh where is it going what is the end process uh and you also pointed out just that the league of revolutionary black workers made mistakes and they could have done you know see I think history has to be understood in terms of what what actually happened not in terms of what we can make up and assume that people have made errors that we imagine what could have happened outside of the actual historical process we you know as materialists we have to understand how history actually develops and not make up Alternatives that's what happened a lot of times people said if I was in the Civil Rights Movement I would have done this that and the other as opposed to understanding that people are rational and people do what's possible and that's that's the way we have to understand understand history so when we think about where is something headed what did black people do everywhere that black people went they formed black organizations around the self-determination question on campus it was a black student union the Black Panther Party it was Jesse Jackson in Chicago organizing black business people in terms of what he was doing in other words what Beed Rustin was talking about simply didn't happen in the Tactical sense of what black people actually did they organized for power and that's the way in which the society changes on the basis of how you think about power does that mean that the integrationist movement or Allies or transnational groups were irrelevant no it doesn't say that at all that's the point I was trying to make I'm not trying to to demonize anybody but I am trying to talk about what actually happened so that for example in Chicago when the Black Panther Party organized there were Hillbillies in Chicago some white people workingclass people organizing and they were carrying forward the Confederate tendency because that was their understanding their misguided understanding of the South the panther party went to them and they began to work together the same was true with Latinos in other words what actually happened is what we have to understand and so this this whole question today in this country is looking at Free Speech the question is but I raise who has skills for that and so the the decline of Education means that workingclass people do not have the same skills that they had in the 1960s in other words people who worked in factories became more literate the Detroit workers were more literate that's not true today and so when we start talking about what is possible for social change if we don't deal with the question of literacy we don't deal with the question of what cultural proclivity there is for speech to overcome the fear that workers have that they will be penalized and fired and unable to take care of their family that's the reality we're dealing with in this country so we talk about Trump you know we can we can talk about is it Trump the magician or is there a real movement if you're in the South and you're dealing with the rise of this conservative religious fascist tendency you know there's a collectivity to it whatever you call it but workers have to be helped and encouraged to have the culture of democracy to oppose that tendency for suppression and exploitation and so right now see in Detroit you need to investigate people like not only James bogs of course but people like General Baker because this word proletarian intellectual what would it be like for factory workers and workers to be intellectuals go and study those people in Detroit you will see something that might tell you about what the future could be like if we do what's necessary if we do what's necessary and so that's what I have to say about that thanks let's open it up okay so I've got two people running mics I'm going to ask also um Daniel I kind of can't see the back corner so if there's stuff up there please let me know um so we're going to oh my goodness so many hands um let's start with the question in the back corner and then it would be uh Spencer who had his hand up before everybody else raised their hand hi I had a question for Abdul and Carlos about um the Jefferson quote because Abdul said uh if I'm remembering correctly that that Jefferson quote was  and I wanted to ask in what sense is it is it in the sense that it's hypocritical that it's a good idea but that Jefferson didn't really believe it or embody it or is it in the sense that there's something wrong with that idea that you know rational views if they're allowed to freely uh you know spread would would naturally U outpace irrational views because it's just harmful for people to hold irrational views and I pose this question to Carlos as well because uh uh and AP you know I apologize if this is incorrect but it it seemed that you were saying that the most of the censorship going on now today is stuff uh censorship of you know Anti-Imperialist um perspectives um on behalf of imperialism doing this sort of censorship um but are there um are there groups of people who are having their right to free speech violated or curtailed right now who you do disagree with and what what do you make of that do you think that those are uh what perspective would you take on if there are groups that you can think of that are having their right to free speech violated but that you disagree with and don't think are advancing the struggle for socialism yeah I I I mentioned this in the presentation um I I think that um the Ultimate Enemy of the State right now uh or at least ideally the Ultimate Enemy of the State or Marxist because we're the only ones that actually want to have a social Revolution reconstitute Society a new so in a context where censorship is prevalent and we're ultimately going to be uh if we get strong enough I hope we do um the uh you know the the object of the fiercest form of censorship I think it's rational to defend the right to free speech uh especially for those that we don't agree with um in this context if we're going to affirm some form of free speech absolutism excluding of course the form of speech that leads to you know violence or stuff like that if we're going to affirm that it has to be for people we don't agree with as well if it's only for for people we agree with then um you know it's it's it's it's it's not uh it's not free speech in that sense um was there was there another part to your question that that I missed I also wanted to ask about the Jefferson quote that was read in the introduction and uh if it's wrong if it's hypocritical if it's neither or both I I I think um you know perhaps it's it's it's uh I think if you look at some of the actions and the ideas there's there's a clear disconnect there but I think this is something that's consistent in in bis revolutions and the figureheads and ideologues which is that some things are said which are very Noble and then some things are enacted which are in in many ways contradictory to the things that are said and this is specifically because all of the bo revolutions are revolutions that are led by a very small class that needs to win uh to its side the vast majority of people and so it has to affirm what are narrow class interest in such a universal form that other classes can join in with it but then the order that it establishes is as uh absolutist and brutal as the feudal orders that it overthrows um and what ends up happening specifically in the US and I've done some some research and writing in this area is that by the 1820s and 30s the the the people that are are are born and bred believing the Jeffersonian ideals of democracy and the Democratic Creed they're looking around and they're like this isn't very Democratic I mean you have the formal aspects of Elections and stuff but if you look at industry you you have tyranny there you know we have no there's no democracy in industry and what ends up happening is you know to use an expression from from Dewey that comes in the 20th century is that politics just ends up functioning as the shadow of big business so um they held on the Bas basis of that Democratic Creed that they saw as taking from Jefferson that the uh the only way to actually actualize those Bourgeois values and give them concrete form realize them was through socialism they're not using the term socialism they're using the term communalism or something else Cooperative societies uh but I think there's something that we have to do concerning that Gap in bouris thinking where there's the enunciated values that the vast majority of people already accept as common sense and then the reality of the order we have to exploit that Gap we have to let people know that hey we're the society that was uh founded on the rights to life liberty Pursuit of Happiness right to Revolution what a paradox that in the 20th century have been the the at the front line of preventing uh people from emancipating themselves and having their revolutions uh how interesting that you know we Proclaim uh what this Gettysburg addressed to defend the government of by and for the people where is that I I don't no American experiences in their everyday life a government of by and for the people it's a society very clearly of by and for big Capital um so those gaps in the values and the reality I think we have to exploit them and then uh in in with time uh perhaps develop a a new way of reconceptualizing but the most important thing for Communists and I'll wrap up with this CU I'm getting longwinded uh is is to realize we have to convince people we have to educate them and to educate you have to find points of contacts with people the way I've described this is you have to find the rational kernels in the incoherent World Views that they develop spontan ously on the basis of bour ideology and use those rational kernels to disarticulate it from the dominant worldview that they have right now towards a new Marxist one that means finding the points of commonality and I think that hypocrisy between the bouro ideals and the reality is a good place to start uh finding the rational kernels and showing that if you actually want these values it's only socialism that can provide them yeah I think he basically said something that I would agree with that is that words that sound good have to be always interpreted in terms of the practice associated with those words and so I was chandling the slave perspective on what he said which was from their experience a lie and so when we use the word democracy regarding the United States you have to ask the question when was that you know uh Langston Hughes let it be a land it never has been yet yet must be so of course we could have language that is our aspiration but so what unless you connect it to the concrete reality now one of the interesting things about freedom of speech is let's get absolutely real about it class Society has limits on freed on any kind of speech whether it's capitalism or socialism in other words we have these aspirations that are maybe connect with our understanding what communism is you know uh the the life liberty and the pursuit of happiness uh but the reality is 20th century socialism also imposed limitations on speech necessarily why because of the state of the working class if the working class was literate and not illiterate if it was mobilized and empowered that'd be one thing but there has never been a revolution where that was true true the working class has always been backward as a result of the capitalist domination they've experienced so we have to get real about what the process of revolutionary transformation is it's not some idea it's a reflection of reality and so when I'm looking at Thomas Jefferson I'm looking at a  liar somebody who deceived America in his personal life as well as in his political life now doesn't mean that he wasn't better than the previous guy I mean come on it's like what Malcolm said about a dagger in your back if I pull it out two inches you know should I applaud well I don't know maybe if it makes you feel a little bit better but the knif is still in [Applause] you do you want to say something WR no are you sure you know you did quote um Jefferson's collaborative paint at the beginning I you might oh so I have to defend Thomas Jeffers um oh okay so I I would simply address uh Jefferson you know that um the hypocrisy or the double standards doesn't necessarily discredit the original claim of you know whether it's the jafferson quote or the pain quote or you know the you know the lines of the Declaration of Independence but it is uh what those aspirations also imply is a task for us to really realize them because these values are Universal they don't belong to they're not original to Thomas Jefferson or pay or any of these figures they are you know products of a historical process and it is up to you know us or socialist movement as in of these struggles to truly realize them in a way that um these figures couldn't have possibly imagined we got Spencer's question and then um next I guess I want to really uh interrogate this notion that underlying um universals is a particular class interest right it seems to me that it's a fundamental question and it really is the question of how we understand politics in this question of the politics of free speech right are we defending the right to free speech or are we simply advocating for our speech to say what we want to say and to do what we want to do right it seems to me that the theory that's being Advanced here that it's really a question of or at least by some of the panelists that it's a question of the right to say what and to do what is ex exactly what we're facing as a crisis of the right to free speech in the United States because what are we dealing with we're dealing with people who say well you don't have the right to be racist you don't have the right to be sexist you don't have the right to uh insult trans people right people are you know in and this is the real thing that's firing workers right people are being fired because they're told that they're racist or they're being fired because they're told that they've done this or they've done that right the if you go to workplaces in America right people will whisper about supporting Trump in their workplace right that's just obviously the case right and we see it since at least 2017 right since Charlottesville the major American organization the ACLU that defended the right to free speech which is to say the right to be in the minority right to not have your words backed by power right not to Simply Be able to win the war to be able to speak right and they collapsed after Charlottesville because they had defended the unite the right rallies ability to organize in charlottesvill and after that they've been completely co-opted by the Democratic party and it seems like this has a long history on the left and this is where I would say the idea of making a virtue of leftists suppressing free speech in the past is a profound mischaracterization of History I don't think if when the Bolsheviks limited the rights of others to speak freely denying them paper and ink that they claim that was revolutionary virtue they said this is a matter of an extraordinary circumstance this is a matter of Civil War we are retreating right and it gets to The Wider question I think of capitalism um which I which is the last current issue I'll raise which is science right what is the crisis of science today right in the world of misinformation disinformation deplatforming doctors and scientists you can't really say that that's about class you can say it's about corporate power right but it is inherently an interest in science right that we can't have science without free and open debate and so socialism wouldn't be about simply Asser ing one class's power about another it would be about unleashing the universality of the concepts of Bourgeois Society like science which is constrained and corrosive corroded in capitalism so I I really want to challenge this this notion that you know you could take it in terms of Thomas Jefferson that the universal truth being articulated has to be weighed against the individ you know the the the class content I mean first of all there's a a lot of historical mischaracterization going on here right there is an abolition of slavery that is Flowing out of 1776 and flowing out of Thomas Jefferson's words and that is giving is creating the context for slaves to publish their slave narratives in the early 19th century right it's about their rights it was highly contested highly contested the right to publish slaver narratives right and to disseminate them right and of course ultimately uh the the South had to the Proto Confederacy had to break with the Constitution and the early Confederate leaders said Thomas Jefferson was a deluded revolutionary right that's what they said that's what Alexander Stevens said that's what Frederick Douglas defended against right so I think you know and also you know this notion that that you have to go with you know what happens right that this is I I guess no I'll leave that I'll leave it aside I just think that this question of liberalism and the defense of free speech in terms of its own categories not in terms of class categories but in terms of the universal right of free speech do so socialists defend that or not and is a retreat from that a retreat from socialism in history whether we're talking about the Bolsheviks whether we're talking about the SP we're talking about any leftist engaged in suppressing other leftists have they has it ever been a virtue for them to do so in the mic in the mic of course Jefferson was an abolitionist I mean that's obvious right he says so and his faction were the leading abolitionists in the north right what his he was tied to Benjamin Franklin and to Thomas Payne and to his nephew Beach right and these people passed the abolition of slavery across the northern states in the immediate wake of the American Revolution right and he was a rovian of course he knew that he was living a hypocrisy and that they had made a revolution that in time would abolish slavery yes of course in that sense he was making a revolution that was tending towards the freedom of all mankind and he never made a virtue of owning slaves of course yeah and Jefferson um was not only a slaveholder um but he worked he had such a lavish lifestyle that he worked his slaves more arduously than other Virginia slaveholders uh and he never um even gave freedom to his own children um so one observation I have is starting with Athens and the Greeks and Athens is slaveholders have historically been the greatest proponents of the concept of freedom because they understand better than anybody else what it means not to have freedom because they deny freedom to others now those ideas of Freedom that they articulate can take on a life of their own that go beyond uh the people who articulate them so we don't have to turn Jefferson into an abolitionist to say that the ideas U that he articulated have a life of their own and that life of their own is useful for people wanting to expand freedom and Society um similarly I heard and I don't remember who said it and I that's just as good um I heard somebody say and it's essentially true that we really can't talk about real democracy in the 20th century everywhere but I also heard that we can talk about real socialism in the 20th century somewhere and I think if you can't talk about real democracy anywhere I don't think you can really talk talk about much real socialism anywhere either yes you can say during the period right during and right immediately after the counter Revolution there could be good reason to suppress opponents because you're dealing not just with abstract speech but you're in the middle of a fight for survival but when it goes on for decades and generations when it becomes a mode of governance when it becomes um the mechanism in which people ACR power and hold on to the power that they ACR and they do it in the name of the working class as an abstraction um then that goes beyond what I accept the work class is not an extraction it's living breathing human beings uh the greatest education I had more so than my University education more so than my Marxist education is the 10 years I spent working on blue blue collar jobs and having have having have to live that life so the working class is not an abstraction and I would say these other ideas are also not abstractions and one final point which is a little bit off the topic um we've heard a lot about the working class I can tell you that today if you look at the op at the movements that's going on within the major unions today within the teams within the Auto Workers with lesso but within the steel workers people that I know from the 60s who were students at the time and decided um to move to workingclass jobs and take on a workingclass lifestyle they were um instrumental catalysts for much of what's going on in terms of the Insurgent movements in the working class today so I say to you students here these are all good ideas but Marxism if it has any meaning has to be a theory of practice and I think that at some point you need to decide are you going to stay in the purely intellectual world are you going to move into real world with real people that you talk about abstractly and find ways to interact with them and not just on um Twitter or not just on on Tik Tok which is a way of talking to similar-minded people but going out in places where you're unpopular and it there thank you um if I could uh comment UNS Spencer Quest if I could comment on Spencer's question um I I don't feel nearly as qualified to speak on the the historical point about uh Jefferson or anything else adjacent other than to just stick up for the principle of both hands not either or but uh with that said um I uh I just want to pick up on your whole point about uh I think you said very well about what's not a question of class per se about the actual uh uh threats to uh uh workers Liberty on the job of conscience or speech or what have you um and when I talk when I spoke about it in my remarks as a question of uh State versus civil society I feel like uh listening to How Spencer put it on kind of missing the point when I talk about ends or means that's to say that uh because as fener said it's not a m it's not a question of class per se so much except in The Limited sense that we're talking about uh corporate capitalism and the professions and because that is how the threats to free speech and to liberalism generally have advanced in the last generation that because that for that reason uh one can talk about the finer points of what that solution is and how much it should involve the state but because that is how it is Advanced it requires a political solution and the discussion needs to begin there yeah I think the point you made about language and universals is really very important for us to interrogate relative to American political history uh founding documents uh there are a lot of things that sound really good but if you divorce them delink them from the actual experience they represent because language is also used to mistify and to uh misrepresent what's actually really going on uh Jefferson for example thought black people were inferior uh it's it's hard to think about uh someone who thinks black people are inferior as representing abolitionism or some level of equality but I would also raise Abraham Lincoln and uh Bill Clinton as good examples of the American state and the point that we're talking about Lincoln is regarded as a great emancipator and yet he confused the difference between supporting the legality of slavery versus his own moral beliefs in other words he said I'm against slavery but because the Fugitive Slave Act was a law he supported that so the great emancipator in the Emancipation Proclamation said he was going to try to free the slaves where he couldn't and didn't free the slaves where he could in other words the states that were in Rebellion he said you all can be free he couldn't do that right that was a military question and he didn't free the slaves in the states that were pro-union Bill Clinton said he's four black people he played saxophone but then he changed the laws regarding welfare and impacted the actual lived conditions of people who were being marginalized in the US economy the point I'm trying to make here is that the American political system has always had a language that represents in quotes their understanding of some universals while at the same time practicing politics that in fact represent class and racist oppression of marginalized people and it seems to me that's really gets at the then the question of again whether or not we will allow ourselves to use the word Democratic when it comes to the United States in classrooms throughout this country in K through 12 and in higher education Etc there are words that are used that are absolutely  for example take the word race I bet you everybody in here at one time or another certainly has heard it maybe came out your mouth as if the word race was something that was real now in geography Department you couldn't say the world was flat you'd be laughed at but the word race is accepted as a legitimate concept even though the American anthropological Association anybody else says it's a  doesn't exist but we use it and we use the word Democratic with regard to this country never been true and of course with Jefferson and all the founding fathers the question is well of course they didn't mean the slaves well that's always something that we have to interrogate so the question really is that we're really talking about free speech is where is this country going what's the next stage of development that's the critical question with regard to free speech it's connected to free dumb and that's what we have to interrogate and yes of course it has to do with the texts that we all think are important to guide our thinking but they're only tools to help our methods of thinking it's the reality of the world we live in that the thought process the logic that Marx used in capital in other works and I think is still very relevant but it's how we apply them to the world we live in not M the world that he lived in we live in a different time in a different space and that's what we have to really struggle over and we live in a racist country that is undemocratic at every level in every Institution So when you say for example that workers whisper about Trump you must not be talking about the south you must not be talking about counties in Illinois like in Pike County Illinois where I work in a project regarding New Philadelphia the town that my great great-grandfather founded as the first African-American which they just made a national park in the restaurants and in the the surrounding area large signs Trump big sign on the highway Trump have you miss me yet in other words they're not whispering about Trump they're Whispering about freedom and an alternative to Trump and in the South workers are Whispering about freedom and about maybe the reforms you know maybe a little more money maybe some health insurance may be collective bargaining but do you think that people saying I'm going to vote for Joe Biden is going to get them fired for a hostile work environment for contributing to a hostile work environment I'm not talking about they're talk they're Whispering about another world I'm saying they're Whispering about current politics right that they're being fired about you know mainstream politics they're being I think the main question is the general thing of workers in the south in particular from all perspect political perspective is fear and it depends on the context of the uh of the workplace but fear is a dominant thing of how to get people to begin to organize particularly around collective bargaining that I think is a dominant aspect of both political positions whether it's Trump or Biden or coronell west um okay so that and then we have Diana and then I'll go to can everyone hear me good um I wrote a question down here so in the opening remarks Jack Ross said that Trump's supporters on January 6th constitute something different than fascism uh that raises the question should the left support the right of free speech or the right wing or even fascist political sentiments is the rationale of whatever answer the speakers give attack or a principle and is it derived from any sort of specifically leftist political logic I of course encourage all the speakers to respond but I'm interested specifically in Ralph Leonard because you mentioned that free speech is something that's sort of intrinsically Universal um okay so you asking me what do I think um well I when I when I referred to January 6 I was talk I was talking about from the other side just what it did not become it did not become the excuse for massive repression by uh by the Biden Administration or the Deep state that it might have been and I was making the point about just what we've seen more recently that it's just decadence complacency that uh with Trump and his own individual actors who are going after in various cases and and doing a very bad job I I could be proven wrong about that in the next next few months but um I mean if you're question what are they if they're not fascists I don't think there were I don't think there is any real actual politics I mean there's uh I mean the religious nature of what of the groups that were demonstrating uh between the election and leading up to January 6 is something that has been largely forgotten and not given enough attention and that is to say these were the I mean I I was I was getting my hair cut when it was on the news and so I had a somewhat hazy idea what was going on but I remember just singing a new saying the bar this is just like a a medieval peasants Revolt where they just march on the palace and thinking God is with them they'll just take over [Music] um as far as so but I said earlier what is I I made the other statement what is like what what I said was there was whatever else Trump or the Trump cult represent and I resisted the idea that that not that it didn't exist but that that was a common denominator I um I mean I'll say exactly what I said in in in making that remark which is we simply don't have mass politics or got very attenuated with I guess the rise beginning in the 70s of of State sponsor primaries in a media centered uh uh process so I don't know if Harry Hawkins is still here but uh I um I have to say I think he's completely wrong about rag Choice voting or anything else that uh relies on uh um state sponsored primaries incidentally I mean I pretty much the French electoral system uh I I I more or less completely swear about which is very different of ours and from there's uh multi-party runoff system fairly straightforward um Jack I think part of the question was about whether and I know that the other Jack wants to speak maybe he can speak next but um uh it should the left protect the speech at the right is that is that correct that was basically the question well yes I mean this what what I mean we could argue finer points I've had I've had to uh I've had to acknowledge certain elements of Truth to uh the the standard resistance Li fascism argument about the nature of the Trump phenomenon and I mean I do think that all the more disturbing things he said uh T in more recently continue to be signs of weakness but um um no we're I mean we're we're nowhere in a situation where you could even begin to talk about uh about revolutionary Justice or or quasi military contingencies of a revolutionary or counterrevolutionary situation is the case may be that's just simply not the reality of of where the country is if if anything that I think the main point about this election is just is just the country is exhausted and and it's willing to I mean I think I think Trump I think the bottom line about Trump is that he's just another phenomenon like Margaret Thatcher and Bill Clinton where everyone but their core supporters hate them but the opposition just simply does not have its  together and yes I I'm very I'm very sensitive to the greater extent of more disturbing and alarming things and and breakdown of bgea norms and it's very easy and and more often than not I'll ridicule everyone caught up in norms and guard rails and indeed the thing that is most most most completely floored me about this past year politically is that the Democrats and political class have learned absolutely nothing from 2016 uh but I mean that's that that that's basically just ly that's we're not at all in a situation remotely like that where questions of re of revolutionary PR principle apply thank you yeah I think we live in different worlds um you know first of all in terms of speech there is protected speech but you can also use speech to commit a as as an element in committing a crime and that crime can still be a crime even if you use speech as part of your act of committing it so January 6 was not about speech it was about attempting to change to to influence the transition of power and as a result um that was criminal activity and it wasn't speech number one number two ja wouldn't social want to influence the transition of power um I well socialists would want to influence the transition of power but you have no right to you you have no free speech right to um block the transition of power through activity uh you have a right to trans to to block it through speech so what with all the lack of democracy this country has had for a long time we have had orderly transition of power now you can think that's a little thing and you think that maybe we don't really need an orderly transition of power but I think that's a I think that's a big deal secondly those people who think a second Trump turn will be a replay of the first Trump turn again I think are living in a fantasy land I'm more reminded of the situation 1930s when the international communist IST movement declared and I'm hearing re I'm hearing Echoes of this today in the international communist movement declared that the difference between social de Democrats and fascism is a matter of taste there's really no difference between them other than the social Democrats are more dangerous so that was the position so at a time when it was possible to create a united front to prevent the fascist coming to power um the left was attacking the social Democrats more vigorously than they were attacking the fascists um and we know we know what came of that so that's number two number three and I'm interested I don't know why and this maybe I'm just not familiar with this surrounding I have not heard even a word from anybody about the environmental crisis the Earth is facing now you may think that's a boura no certainly some of my colleagues back in the in in the 80s when I in' 70s and ' 80s when I started getting involved in environmental issues thought it was a Bourgeois notion uh but I truly believe that climate change has the potential to disrupt all of the Earth's human support systems and disrupt societies I don't want to go into I'm not give a speech on it anybody interested in talking about on a scale that's unimaginable able and we have a limited period of time I think the election of trunk with all the other things with all the promised retribution that he plans if he gets reelected is also going to basically cut make it impossible to do the transition that we need on time so the notion that this is just oh H seems to me shortsighted I believe it is a world historical threat of the kind that we have very few in in human history and I think this transition is very important and there's yes there's a right to free speech but there's you know if I say if I hold a gun up to you and say stick them up is that free speech I said stick them up and I say hand me your wallet is that free speech no that's not free speech I Have a gun in my hand so you have to distinguish between speech and activities that go beyond speech thank you um I just want to make one thing thing totally clear which is I did not say and I would would do not argue that uh January 6 is a question of of free speech or first or First Amendment rights generally and I I'm sorry that I simply cannot resist reminding you of what may come as a blast from the past from an old comrade of yours Virgil vogle at the time who simply said very bluntly Humphrey is not a Social Democrat Nixon is not a Nazi as far as any invocations of of the third period uh nonsense what you got um as far as um should socialists defend the free speech on the right then my the answer is simply yes because um you know the point about free is not about the right to talk sense or speak uh views if you agree it's about the right to talk  and not be persecuted because of it um and you know it's it's the point I think John Stewart Mill made that if you have a group of 100 people in the room and there was one person in that room that went against the rest of them that person deserves extra attention because what he has to say took him a must have taken him effort to come up with and he might have a grain of Truth a grain of truth that might make you consider your views differently and ask you why do you have the views you have why do you believe what you believe and maybe uh you know just uh make you struggle with uh why what you believe and you know struggle with um why it's right or not I think this question of whether or not the left should support the right of the the right to speak is an important question and it connects to this whole idea of a class analysis of society and it connects to this question of what is the Trump phenomenon right now A sizable group of people in Congress represent that far right a big section of the ruling class in this country represents the far right in other words Trump is not an isolated phenomenon I mean he's a character and we could characterize the whole thing around Trump but an analysis of Congress and the freedom caucus and an analysis of the ruling class and the billionaires and what they're funding represents a way of trying to understand how Danger this moment is and so we that is the left have to accept the fact that we are outlaws in this society and that we have to accept the fact that our speech is going to be severely limited much more than the fascist right and that means that when we talk about the right we have to understand they represent a clear and present danger when they talk because it's connected to a movement that can harm all of us but we also have to understand that they have a greater right to speak Fox News the change of the law that Ena that kind of news to exist as opposed to requiring a more balanced presentation of the news that I grew up with Huntley and Brinkley and all of that in the past so we really have to try to understand this class struggle that's going on in a very severe way in this country and nothing can be separated out from that everything is involved in that and so we have to ask the question whenever anybody on the right speaks we have to demand the ability to counter that and that we have to accept the fact that when we speak they're going to make sure it's countered it's part of the struggle it's not just an abstract question it's part of the actual struggle that takes place and so when we talk about Trump we have to talk about this concept of the American people and if Trump in fact is ahead of Biden in the swing States according to the polls we have to really prepare our ourselves for what might in fact happen and it's not an abstract question it's a political question of power and everything is about that question of power [Music] okay so I have a question for um I guess this is more I'd like to hear most from Ralph and d and also Jack on this um but segregation was brought up quite a bit um so capitalism not socialism compelled the white worker and the black worker women and men to the same Factory floor not just the working class right no rational capitalist really wants to pay for separate bathrooms no rational capitalist wants to exclude perfectly good labor from the labor pool right so given that were the new left and its socialist ideas even necessary to the struggle against segregation that's my question see I think you have to ask yourself why you believe that a rational capitalist would be against segregation because one of the functions of that segregation was to separate and demobilized the working class to have it against itself so it was a tactic it was a tool used against the working class and the struggle against segregation was a struggle to unite the working class and so uh this whole this this abstract again idea of what a rational capitalist is when did that ever happen when did a rational capitalist ever be divorced from uh patriarchy from racism from Colonial imperialist intentions I think a rational capitalist wants slavery why because he don't want to pay nobody um well the question of like a rational capitalism is you know cuz on from a rational view no capitalist wants War yet capitalism produces war cyclically and that's because capitalism as a systematic totality is very much irrational and goes against our rational interests as a society and that's why it's a contradictory uh system which Jack did you want to talk uh Jack Weinberg because you were so involved with the Civil Rights yeah yeah I mean the Civil War was basically all other things being equal uh struggle between the perspective of a capitalist North and a plantation South a system based on enslavement and and plantation society and a system based on um on which is also capitalist with a different totally different um flavor of capitalism and there are a lot of you know abstract theories can be very simple and the real world is very complicated um and so there are interests that are played out by segregation and there also um Trends in the world that have lives of their own independent of the interests the immediate interests that are being played out so for example I spent a little time in 63 traveling meeting um civil rights organizations in different parts of the south in some South Carolina one of the issues that particularly enraged the Civil Rights activists was that um for example if somebody drove uh a truck that delivered um soda you know to to stores they would have a black person there to drive the truck and to deliver them and they would do the paperwork so one of the demands that they raised was that the dog catcher should drive his own truck in other words that was an issue to them because the nature of segregation in the South was still had many was still a carryover from the whole notion of a of of a society of um of of of of a society that was still struggling with its roots in slavery and still unaccepting of African-Americans as as full people with full rights in the north if you go in steel mills um they hired African-Americans and they hired white people but they hired them for different jobs more or less if you go to the coke ens uh uh the dirtiest job in a steel mill where the likelihood of getting cancer is extremely high um that was all black and for the African-Americans who were working there um they knew that was going to shorten their life expectancy but it was a good paycheck and they accepted it and if you go to the rolling Mills which um was a high skill job and compared to the basic Mills where were were were was fairly clean um that was all white in fact it was Protestant because the big Mill was also had Catholics in it but the but but the rolling bills didn't have Catholics so the nature the nature of segregation is is complicated and the nature of the rationality of capitalism is complicated the anal these simple analytical tools give you a start but the real world has a life of its own and there are processes of their own and there are things that happen in this place different than things that happen in this place and unless you can somehow get out of thinking of everything in terms of theory and connect your theory to real people living real lives engaging real struggles I think that it becomes um it becomes an exercise Jack is so I'm wondering for the whole panel too about your remarks why do you guys think it is that you know this is a panel on free speech and you know we spent a lot of time actually talking about segregation and slavery in the history of racism in America um why is that is is it because segregation renders Free Speech suspect um you know why why is this the conversation we're having here today even though we can't use the oh even though we even though we can't use the word race the the history of America built on slavery and in fact the history of Western EUR European um de Economic Development up up to an including the enlightenment was all dependent on the wealth wealth that was drawn by slavery slavery and segregation and its repercussions is the American disease um I spend a lot of time working with organizations in Africa it's it's the the where this where the relationships are very different but in America you can't do anything you can't deal with any Progressive issue you can't deal with any social issue you can't deal with any cause without being hit in the face with the legacy of enslavement which is the birth of our country and and just goes through every aspect of it and that's why it comes up here and that's why it comes up in every conversation that you're really trying to deal about solutions to the problem plaguing this country can we let caros speak just because he hasn't spoken a lot and then Abdul and then Jack yeah uh thank you for for your question um Mark said when he was treating the Irish Question that racism is the secret through which the capitalist class sustains its power and that reflects itself in these various different forms of segregation that I do agree with the r are fundamentally rooted in keeping workers away from each other and dividing the working class as much as possible so that they realize that the common uh enemy is the capitalist class it also serves the purpose of keeping one part of the working class in a condition of constant super exploitation um and feeding as the boys would say the the white part of the working class with a sense of vanity um that they can always end up saying well at least I'm not black um and that's why I I I I think you brought up the question of free speech and we're going back to segregation the Civil War part it's because this the struggle of the black Freedom Movement the struggle of against the colon ey has been the determinant form the class struggle has taken in the US it is wrong and and this is what the liberal Academy wants us to think oh it's just a race struggle it's not just a race struggle it's the form the class struggle has taken in the US it's the quote is the history of all H Earth or existing societies is a history of class struggles plural they take different forms and the struggle against the color line the struggle Against Racism has been the primary form that we've seen attacks against Capital whether with the uh Civil War which was the second American Revolution that realized for a period of time uh some of the you know completing the Bourgeois revolution of 1776 it's overthrown in 18 uh in 1876 uh with a council Revolution that basically brings about fascism in the South and then 1964 is about going back and undoing that counterrevolution of 1876 actually completing the the Bourgeois project of of democratic rights for uh specifically the black part of the working class and it's absurd to think of that just as a race struggle as something that's divorced from the class struggle it was very clearly a a a struggle against Capital especially if you look at it in the South um it was very much embedded in in in the working class the industrial proletariat and it created the conditions today for a for for fertile ground for a multi-racial workingclass struggle yes there's still racism yes it's still institutionalized yes you still have parts of the white working-class that have prejudices against black people but the intermingling of workingclass black and white people and Hispanic people has been such uh has developed to such an extent that I think the social consciousness of the American people specifically the young people after 1964 in the Civil Rights Revolution is drastically different than at any other time in in our history and we should applaud that that's something that I think creates the best conditions for um for struggling for socialism together and the leninist position on this has always been like these Democratic struggles are important because at the end not only do they guarantee the Democratic BW rights for the parts of the population and the working class that didn't have them but they make the class struggle more acute it becomes easier to see how the enemy today is the capitalist class and how we should unite around that and I find a lot of Hope in the youth I find that the the inclination of young people white black Hispanic or whatever it might be is towards a position of of unity and they're a lot closer to being anti-racist and against uh the system that that uh necessitates racism than they are uh to be racist racism today is almost something that's mocked by by young people and I think that's something that signifies a positive move yeah I think the U the discussion of the exploitation and oppression of black people is Central to the history of the United States I I doubt that that's a problem in anybody's thinking in this audience uh but at the time of the this moment of the struggle we have to ask ourselves what is the greatest denial of free speech particularly at a time of the Palestinian struggle it's genocide in other words you just kill the people that's what happened to the Native Americans the First Nation so yes we have to talk about the exploitation of black people but we can't have a discussion like this without mentioning the genocide of the settler colonialism that this country represents against the First Nation people and it seems to me that's really again a critical question because not to talk about the people who experienced genocide in this country desensitizes us from our historical role for example in supporting the genocide against the Palestinian people okay ja did you want to say something or should I go to the next question um yes um obviously there is a kernel of Truth uh with respect to both the enlightenment generally and American history specifically as there is to every Wicked idea and that is if if I have been vague or abstract about what I FRA the about what the enemy that I frame all of my to free speech all my discussion around it is that idea it is the idea whether it's derived from from France fenon or or or other very unmar thinking that uh of replacing class with race that is essentially reducible who believing about all all white people or the idea of whiteness and the Very utterance of that word infers acceptance of the IDE of believing that you you referring to all white people the way anti-semites refer to Jews that is to say a Superfluous and arbitrary descriptor that serves no other purpose than to ascribe unique and intrinsic wickedness to the subject and and as far as that is a statement of class that base of class remarks frankly I don't I think the relationship of that idea and that that's the current idea in the academy to Marx to mark that that's Marxist or invoke or is invoking of Marxism that frankly at this point you have to Simply uh compare that to the Nazi uh uh relationship to Christianity thanks Jack okay we're going to take two more questions so Richard and then the final question is going to be clay hear um so this is a discussion about free speech and it seems to me several things tend to get conflated with about Free Speech the traditional uh civil libertarian concept derived from the enlightenment about Free Speech relates to the state and the state's limitation of Free Speech but a lot of what we're talking about in the present is not State action but the actions of individual Civil Society universities often private universities large media corporations Etc you know the question of employment and termination of employment whether for supporting Trump or for supporting communism or whatever was brought up none of that seems to me protected per se by the First Amendment and I want to ask since it's a question about free speech and everyone takes for granted the value of free speech what are the circumstances and I would like sort of all the panelists to answer it what are the circumstances in which the panelists would defend the ciling of free speech in other words would defend censorship for example the question of a post-revolutionary revolutionary government censoring uh counterrevolutionaries was brought up would people support deplatforming say white supremacist uh questions like that in other words where are the examples if there are any where people would support restricting or curtailing free speech on the panel should I go first um to bring it back to my opening remarks um uh I think the pr the principle involved is uh the what was a standard called War liberal principle heresy s conspiracy know that uh uh the that y so the principle that was articulated in the 1950s was heresy yes conspiracy no which is which is to say that uh uh the the ideas and organiz the the freedom of ideas and organizations uh that and belief systems that uh would as a matter that would as a matter of course deny that same freedom and power is an absolutely essential aspect for free society that uh that is that it does not follow that uh they should be allowed free reign to uh to Simply uh have to Simply rabuck over inst over institutions uh by duplicit by by duplicitous of coercive means and that is perfectly legitimate for the state to control I I'm not qualif I don't feel qualified to comment on on individual revolutionary situations I could comment historically about I I suppose about exactly uh what the turning point was after the storming of The Winter Palace I guess but but uh without dealing with the specific uh uh military or revolutionary situations uh if you're simply talking about Day-Day functioning of society again as I say did the principal heresy as conspiracy know indeed we what we are dealing with is conspiracy throughout uh the professions and uh and corporate class classes and and universi system is adjunct to that is Swift advancement of conspiracy that has to that that has to be checked by by Dem by political and Democratic accountability thank you uh for your question um to to get back uh sort of connected to the other question uh that that seemed to imply that in these instances uh people are making virtue out of necessity I I think precisely the point is opposite to that that if we're realists uh we we recognize that socialism is not uh being constructed in this perfect Ideal World disconnected from uh global capitalism and imperialism every single socialist project every single project where workingclass people came to a position of political power and started constructing their own destiny had to face IM immense pressures immense different forms of hybrid warfar blockades invasions uh spying chemical warfare all different sorts of hybrid Warfare and socialism has always been a socialism in Siege it's had to construct itself Siege so in that context when you have uh forces that are attempting to consciously overthrow the gains of the people you have to suppress them this is not something we would like we would love for socialism to just develop you know purely in this abstract real but that's not the case you have to suppress the Batista goons after the Cuban Revolution if not you are betraying the revolution you have to suppress their right of speech these are people that are killing the the uh the people going and doing Gades bringing bringing clinics and and bringing schools to rural areas you have to suppress their right of speech and you have to perhaps even do more than that now I think the slogan that Fidel uses is the right one within the revolution everything outside of it nothing which means that there might be differences of opinion and plurality and discourse and debates within the revolution as long as the principal contradictions we can agree on we're fine but once you start getting these these because there's they're not just disconnected it's not just spontaneous they're connected to the greatest forces of evil which is Empire and how do you combat it eventually a socialist society like Cuba it's been 60 plus years socialist um it's been able to focus on education as you were emphasizing and with an educated populace now it can allow more information from uh from their neighbors up north to come in and on the basis of that there doesn't have to be the same level of uh repression and limitation of speech and and what the people can see and stuff as before but even even there there wasn't much how do you compare that sort of limitation of the speech of the imperialist which I'm sorry I'm not an epistemic uh um uh relativist I think their speech is I think their narratives are so how do you compare the censoring of that stuff um to the sort of censorship that that that's constant that plagues our forms of society it's just night and day and when you see it from that lens even censorship under a socialist context is still moving us towards a more Universal uh uh ground for free speech Carlos but even within like the tradition of malism are people critical of the antibus campaigns after the 100 flower speech for shutting down what they believe was actual debate and discussion within the working class I mean isn't there some ambiguity in this even within kind of your own political tradition absolutely all of these processes because of the tremendous pressures that they're under there's contradictions it's not we cannot expect socialism to be this pure thing this this the embodiment of the pure idea that exists in our head there are going to be mistakes and we should try to avoid them and if it comes to a position where we have to take these sort of Acts that we might feel are against the Socialist morality out of necessity we should not make those virtues that is something I agree with we should understand that okay it's because of this context but everything is dependent on time and place and uh there's a time in place when socialist societies can be a little bit more open and there's a time in place where uh where where that cannot happen cuz you're trying to fight back uh a fascist uh a a a potential fascist Nazi invasion or you're trying to fight back an imperialist invasion of your island or whatever the case might be it's all dependent on context and that's that's why the you know the category of concrete Universal is important this idea that we can just talk about things divorced from the actual conditions of the world is it's absurd we can appeal to uh to to we we can have these principles that say we're going to fight for it world where there's where there's free speech and all these things but we also have to be realists that's not the world we live in now and uh I much prefer to Value the capacity of people to affirm their self-determination develop the revolution than to have some clinging to this you know to have this Purity fetish to to these ideas that that that I would like to see embodied and because they cannot be embodied I'm going to just condemn them Jack Jack W if I know got something to say [Music] yeah I have an almost totally polar opposite uh Viewpoint um if you know the Free Speech as as an American Civil liity pertains to the the state and the state inter interfering with the right to free speech and if we extend that and going a lot of complications and subtleties and areas of ambiguity but I want to go to the heart of the the point that was just the response that you just got with a couple just quick anecdotes when I was in Gary um I had a friend who was a former Communist Party member a former steel worker then a pres then a university professor and he he was a German origin he went back and he visited Germany this was before the fall of berin wall and this friend happened to be the president of the Indiana civil American civil liberties Union and when he went to visit Germany and he came back and he couldn't help himself but say how things in Germany were really pretty good this was stazzy Germany um but they were pretty good and I had friends who are members of the Communist party and um or certain M friends who were prepared to defend everything that Stalin did on the basis of supporting the working class and I had friends on during the cultural revolution in China who were thrilled that we having the Paris commun occur in China during the culture Revolution so the word socialism and the concept of the working class becomes metaph physici to the point where you can defend anything and Justified anything even if no workers if you if you could actually take a poll of workers and if they actually had access to information interests were being preserved were being were reflecting their views or anything else so the notion of socialism and the notion of autocracy in which which the means of production are controlled by the same people who control the political system and the joining of the political system with the means production is often called socialism it's often spoken of in the name of the working class but those are just metaphysical ideological Construction in my view to justify authoritarian Societies in which the working class suffers terribly so that's number one now we get into so so that's a different Viewpoint that we have not a very small one you know there there can be there can be there can be certain circumstances about even the state restricting free speech I would say if it goes on for more than a couple of months in an emergency situation then I begin questioning whether it's emergency situation um it could be even a little bit more so I don't want to go into all the subtleties you know the the crunch that up the crunch that Uprising or or the struggle against cross yet but the other thing is I think people on the left in this country have been tricked because there's also the question of the right of somebody else to speak in the right of Might to disrupt that that speech and that's a different question than the question of the state the state invol Jack Jack just real we have a lot of younger students who don't know what you mean when you say Kad or the struggle of try could you just explain it I mean where I I I could but I think I I I think for those people who don't know I don't think you're missing much and I'd be happy um and i' have I'd be happy to talk about it at some other time but we don't have to do we don't have time go into history um so let's talk about today um the you know let's say um there there are people who exercise free free speech as a as an act of provocation there are provoc provocators they come to a campus they set up the most outrageous topic they can think of they get all the students who disagree with that topic up in arms they shut it down and then they get a national medium you know those people have fallen for a trick you know the Civil Rights Movement we did provocations all the time to try to expose the police or to expose expose the segregationist and they always fell for it so there's a lot of falling for provocations the question of the when it's a real question of free speech um there and not just responding to it and the other thing is I think a lot of students live in a surround ing where all the people think more or less like them and therefore they don't understand with and they want to homogenize the thought in that world and impose restrictions on the thought in that homogenized world without realizing how isolated they are in society as a whole and that makes it susceptible to provocations if you actually have a contentious issue that there's disagreement in your community about there are various ways to struggle it out and you may win you may lose you may and sometimes you have to isolate people sometimes you have to C children sometimes you have to embarrass them that is it's not just talking there's a struggle that can go on over ideas it can have it can be multiple can be have multiple ways of going forward but there's a difference between free speech and the restrictions on speech imposed by the people who also control the armies and the police and all the military might and restrictions on speech imposed by or Ordinary People for ordinary reasons and I think those are two different things and even in those cases I think in most situations you don't want to you don't want to you want to look at the correlation of forces not just in your immediately surroundings but how it's going to play out in society as a whole but what if those Ordinary People are a large corporation pardon me what if those Ordinary People are a large corporation say or a university bureaucracy a large media Corporation you know that's a that is if I had the ability to stop large corporations from funding from being treated as a person and funding politicians and having more free speech rights than me I would do that I think this like on media companies like on media platforms that's a private space right legally so in other words if a media platform sensor certain forms of speech they're not violating the First Amendment right there used there used to be laws in this country which were not perfect but did did require for certain political topics for there to be a balance and that was that that was eliminated under Reagan and that opened up the world de so it was the government did have the right until the Reagan Era to have certain requirements on the media companies of that era to when they dealing with political topics they didn't do it well have a balanced have some balance so I I have if I had the power which I don't I would certainly be in favor of putting more restrictions on corporate rights than on the and treating corporations as people in the whole Free Speech realm and I uh uh and I despair at the disproportionate power that they have over the power of of of of people like myself and in so far as I have the ability to struggle or I have connections with people believe I want to fight that but but we're not talking about Free Speech now now we're talking about I think anat France was the first person who said it he said the law in its Majesty protects the rich as well as the prevents the rich as well as the poor from sleeping under the bridge you know the law is not you know the law has a different impact on the wealthy and on on the powerful and the in powerful and I am for policies that strengthen the less powerful and that put constraints on the more powerful particularly on the corporate more powerful but these are not that's that goes beyond the topic of this conversation and how how you realize again you know Mark said one of the things I do agree with marks um the the the point is not to criticize the world the point is to change it um and I think that that's the question how do you how do you take a bad situation um and make it better or better yet take a bad situation and make it much better or transform relationships that make it better and there are no magic answers thanks je I'd like to Abdul and then we have to kind of wrap up so this is really interesting question when should the left support somebody from the right to have the platform and uh it I agree with the phrase clear and present danger in other words people who are advocating a point of view connected to an actual social Motion in society that's bringing harm to people I think that has to be restricted in other words having well it's interesting they Define it from their point of view we would have to Define it from our point of view so it's as simple as that in other words the challenge of democracy is to enable people to represent their interests so our interests have to be represented and and and there is is the crisis of capitalism or I mean of democracy uh so there clear and present danger now the question was also raised does society have the right to be wrong well I'm not against somebody hiring an economist like Milton fredman to talk but I would be against having a department of Economics solely advocating those views which existed here as opposed to having a debate which is what the university should be about the debate of ideas and I would be for them to be as open as possible to debate all these ideas that doesn't happen in most universities but when it comes to a country like Cuba it's very interesting this question of freedom of speech in a country like Cuba number one we worked for example with local libraries and there were these libraries that developed that represented kind of free speech they were all supported by the US Embassy and a lot of them were pornography and if you'll accept that scientific category so you can't talk about free speech in Cuba without understanding the role of the United States so in this country the question of when should the left support somebody from the right that's a democratic question that has to do with the consciousness of people in this country now because the left has been so isolated on campus when they want a Clansman to speak or something then a small group of people take militant action and that seems like an irrational anti-democratic action when it really is a reflection of the class struggle in this country and my whole point about Lincoln and the Fugitive Slave Act is a question of the legality that we have a moral right to stand stand up against all the laws that are in fact anti-democratic and against the people and that's a decision that has to be made so to protect the the right of free speech for the left means you have to go up against the laws because it's an immoral thing to do but it's an illegal thing to do and in this country today that's a decision everybody here has to make it's not just an abstract decision and it's a political decision we all have to make you come to the university and you join platypus because you're an intellectual and because you're reading thick books and you're understanding very complex ideas but if you're going to be a transformative figure in society you have to accept the fact that going to the working class and mobilizing them with a class conscious speech you're going to in fact go up against the legality of class rule in this country that's a decision have to make it's a moral decision it's a political decision and platypus needs to prepare you for that decision because the right wi is moving rapidly in this country they have a big chunk of Congress the billionaire class now is expanding rapidly so prepare yourself for the struggle to come um so we do need to wrap up Jack and Ral do you guys want to say anything to this question and then I think um we'll so on the question of uh when may it be permissible to restrict free speech and in what context like to engage in that thought experiment is like um there isn't like a it's always was a case by casee basis so if say a bunch of fascist gangs would go you know armed themselves with guns and said we're going to go to this place and shoe up this place then yeah it's best to you know act on it and prevent that action and that's a you know and that's a very different thing from censoring an opinion because you can politically oppose uh whether it's fascist or rightwing what the fist were not going with guns but just speaking and making racist statements like would for example uh what if there's a a teacher at a university let's say uh who's an outspoken white supremacist that students protest and more the teacher F that's not a First Amendment issue strictly but it is in some sense a free speech issue that's a good question um well that's the question not of obviously you implied it of Civil Society where where those Civil Society draw the line of who where you can make that speech and I suppose in in in that context is if if that teacher cuz that teachers now in a position of authority and his white supremacist views means that he's going to be biased towards black students or other students of um different racial backgrounds then it's best not then he's like breaking that kind of code of conduct that teachers are meant to have that they're not supposed to be discriminatory and that's very different from say you know preventing him from speaking you know you know puking out his views on social media or or on any other platform so that's a very subtle uh line read that's uh that shouldn't be conflated and you know more generally is that you know one shouldn't be afraid of confronting these views in the public sphere like that's the whole point of free speech is that it gives you the opportunity to confront and challenge them and you know one should be able to do that because you know you shouldn't sort of imagine that you can be protected from these views because they exist and you should have the confidence that you can challenge them and not fear that you'll be somehow infected by it and become a fascist cuz you know this isn't Co we're dealing with here you know and I think that's what should you know we should all have is that fortitude to stand up for our views and challenge um any you know the oppos opposing views okay um so let's have a round of applause for our panelists thank you very much
