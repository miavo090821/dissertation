hello and welcome to weekend podcast of lotus heaters i'm here with josh and we'll be talking about mark's and his view on the individual and how accurate that is or not exactly so this is going to be a two part today and tomorrow and today we're going to be talking about the first well we're going to talk about how marx's views uh kind of of their time and also we're going to compare them to kind of his contemporaries and kind of show that there were already modern ideas in circulation that we accept to this day that marx rejected and we're going to kind of be looking at where he's right where he's wrong because i do think there are some actual benefits to his interpretation of the world like it's not just because of the awful things that have happened because of some of his ideas doesn't mean that you need to discredit all of them and i think they're worth talking about but also i do want to talk about some of the more dangerous ones and why i think they're wrong and why they're dangerous so the kind of ideological overview will be what what's gonna what we're gonna talk about today and and so what what are we going to leave for tomorrow okay so to today i'm going to talk about the kind of ideological overview as you said and also i'm going to talk about marx's view on human nature and how he rejects the idea that humans are naturally selfish which i disagree with and i'm going to talk about why and then in the second part i'm going to talk about human motivation and how marx believed that individuals in history are not as important as kind of the circumstantial factors so history has a a driving force that no one individual has total influence over and also i'm going to talk about the limitations on the individual which is things like uh ways that an individual may not or can be free essentially okay okay so uh so let's let's start with the first part then sure um actually i would like to talk about why i actually wanted to cover this okay um so i believe that our view of politics is predicated on a model of the individual like our understanding of the individual and how they act is how we establish our political beliefs i i think at least that's my case i can't speak for everyone but i think at least some relation to that is important how do you kind of feel about it so do you feel that that that's important in the way not not to just inform our own thinking about ourselves in society but also in the political system or the political implications of it yeah like um if there are policies that run counter to human nature they're going to cause more problems than they're going to solve essentially and i've and you know i would imagine that a lot of people would be protesting right now against against there being such a thing as human nature so well there's certainly okay but it's not necessarily that we have to uh construct legislation to kind of placate human nature necessarily some some things we need to mitigate against like i could give the example of if someone steals from you and then you kill them and then you find where their family live and kill them as well that's obviously awful and that is something like being violent towards people that do things to you is kind of part of human nature i don't think anyone would necessarily dispute that but it's not necessarily something that is good and natural is not synonymous with good okay in just to clarify yeah that's a that's a good kind of way to put it that even because it's often assumed right when someone asserts that something is natural that that automatically means means good especially when it comes to like food like natural is like the be all and end all like right yeah but when it comes to human nature it's less beneficial i suppose so just the fact that something is common to our our kind of inner being doesn't mean that that's how how society should be organized anything exactly yeah right i i do believe that because we are conscious we can overcome our inherent nature which is what makes human beings unique from animals so i think you said you said that we'll we'll get into that based on some of the studies that you have in there absolutely there are there are many ways in which we are not different from animals and [Music] they they are quite funny in how much they represent it but i won't spoil anything because it is quite amusing but anyway to get into marx's actual ideas um we should look at kind of the political ideas circulating in the 19th century when marx was about so in the 19th century liberals were already considering the development of the individual as the most important thing which is something that i think we are very supportive of here and the term individual and individualism were strongly associated with liberalism at the time so even the notion of the individual had some degree of political connotations at the time and liberals seem to point out that all we needed were good laws and any laws or customs which could not be rationalized as promoting public good or social welfare however you want to define it should be kind of scrapped and we we want to be promoting the welfare of citizens however that may be and although liberals may not have agreed what welfare meant it it was the basic framework in which they all operated under and in germany they kind of rejected this idea which all all ominous things seemed to start with um so there was the jurist and legal historian friedrich carl von savini i'm probably butchering how that's pronounced but there was there was this person who believed that laws could not be written by men laws were derived by the soul of the whole unit which is a bizarre so essentially only laws can only be contrived by a collective the individual like individuals are only a mouthpiece for the collective will is what essentially they believed so when when you started saying that i thought you were going to go on to say god or something like that just it's it's not yeah it's it's derived from the soul of the collectors all of the whole yeah so it sounds very he would say it is not an individual that thinks it is the nation or the social body that merely uses an individual as a means of expressing the collective's thoughts that's what he believed and this idea was very popular in germany at the time and there are also other germans uh the uh anthropologist and philosopher ludwig ludwig if you're a back f e u e r b a c h i'm painfully poor at any foreign languages so i apologize to any germans that are watching um he believed that both nature of each human and humanity as the whole um were the same thing okay so the individual did not differ from the collective essentially which was where marx more heavily derived his interpretation because of course anthropology and sociology they're kind of closely knit disciplines aren't they and and so so when when these people would have this kind of idea of the collective and the individual would they recognize that an individual can have different thoughts and different kind of ideas than the collective or because you said that the individual can only be a mouth before the collective in that view is that uh can can the individual differ from the collective in some ways or and and then is the kind of is only the collection of the individuals and if you average them out like what what makes up the collective well that's the problem with the the ideas they they didn't really feel the need to define or elaborate on it and the the exceptions to the rule where people believe things differently to perhaps a number of people were kind of overlooked as almost anomalies i imagine okay so it's it's a very limited view of the individual that kind of is the basis for and the environment in which marx developed his theory of the individual right so so that that's the background to marx and so what about likes himself so it's kind of my opinion that marx is he kind of has an impression of what human beings are like that seems to kind of relate to human nature but he gets a lot of important distinctions wrong and there are some things that he does get more right than wrong and there are lots of things that he gets more wrong than right but i think in breaking them down into different subjects we can evaluate each of his claims kind of by its merits rather than towering his entire model of the individual as wrong okay but i would say it's more wrong than right so let's do it claim by claim then sure so i'm going to start with mark's view on human selfishness um so it was already kind of proposed that human beings were naturally selfish and by people like kant and hobbes and canton hobbs believed respectively that this could be mitigated against by being rational which was kent and through the state which was hobbes i'm more aligned with the kantian view that through being rational you don't necessarily have to behave selfishly and in a kind of base manner if that makes sense right so through rationality you can overcome selfishness because rationality is a product of consciousness and consciousness allows us to overcome our nature or at least i believe so it seems like a quite intuitive idea to me and quite advanced for the time that human beings could mitigate against their nature just simply through thought and i believe that is the case and so so what about someone like the stoics then who would say that it's in your nature to be rational and that's you fulfilling your true nature well any economist could disprove that because human beings as in using your reason to kind of lead your life rather than your impulses well human beings simply just don't behave that way people people operate on their impulses uh far more often than they don't and this actually ties into something i know quite a bit about which is dual process theory which is a behavioral decision decision making theory which poses that the human brain has two different neural systems um you might have come across it in thinking first thinking slow by kahneman and taversky probably butchering that as well um but essentially they say that you have a slow deliberate conscious process that's more rational and you have a quick heuristic or rule-based system which comes to snap decisions and the kind of evolutionary rationale is that the quick decisions allow us to avoid life or death situations so you walking down a dark alleyway might seem a bit ominous even though there's nothing there but that's because you've got kind of heuristics that avoid potentially dangerous situations yeah it's much more important to avoid danger in that situation valid to be exact yeah exactly so they're not they're kind of blunt instruments to keep a being alive essentially and that is kind of the the entire basis of human decision making according to them and something that i certainly subscribe to although i think it's a little bit more complex than that right okay but i'm not going to get into that i could go on for hours about that because i've done research into it and i won't bore you along with it and yes so sorry that i'm provoking you to go into rabbit holes so let's get let's get back to mark of course so mark's thought that a good society was one which allows our nature's full expression so obviously he did not believe that human beings were selfish because generally speaking being selfish is not a good thing or being prosocial it is kind of perceived as the more it's the thing that we want to encourage essentially although some degree of self-interest is obviously important we don't want it to go too too far and extreme it's it's the thing that is seeing as as the desirable one yeah and he believed that people behaved selfishly in his own time because it was a product of scarcity and capitalism and is not an immutable human trait essentially so he believed that capitalism taught people to be selfish because there was a finite number of resources and therefore they had to behave in their self-interest so if scarcity ceased then human beings would also cease to be selfish okay which is definitely a product of its time because obviously in modernity there's not really any scarcity of you know food water at least in the west i mean uh you yeah but uh then you could say okay people are being people might beat um might be playing devil's advocate but uh that people might be less selfish today about things like food and be more kind of altruistic about about these things that are in abundance and and more apprehensive of of those things that are that are still kind of scarce or yes subject to much more scarcity to put it in economic terms people would be uh more selfish with consumer goods because those are the things that in a modern society are perceived as supposedly scarce whereas you know food water although there are certainly a small minority of people that might struggle for those in a western society it's largely a human need that is satisfied would you say that's fair um yeah i would i would say i'm not sure whether whether um where they can consume a good and like even if the distinction between consumer good and food is not like i i'm not i'm not sure that that's uh that's particularly okay i i'm not sure about about that one but uh i understand what you're saying is that that you have some things in which obviously you can you can observe people being selfish about and those are the ones that are still still a lot more scarce but isn't that something that would kind of validate on this point what marx was thinking well i think that there's there's not necessarily any reason to suggest that scarcity is anything to do with human nature like i know that's a weird thing to say but i don't think human nature will necessarily change too much when because we we were programmed to survive and you only meet a minimum threshold to lose a trait in evolution so if if you've got no reason to lose this self-interest then it's still going to manifest if you understand my kind of argument here yeah i think i understand your argument but also what i think marx is saying is that if you remove scarcity you remove the reason why selfishness is displayed by people it might it might be still encoded in them somewhere for the for example when scarcity comes back then they become selfish again but when you remove scarcity they stop being selfish because there's no point is isn't that maybe i'm understanding him wrong but but he i think the the the key thing here is that he believes that scarcity and capitalism is the root of human selfishness so it's the capitalist element as well that plays into it and although you could make a reasonable argument to say that if there was no scarcity there would be no need to be selfish there's also the argument that you have it programmed into your brain that you are to behave in a self-interested way and unless there's some way of changing that that's not going to change like you've got you've literally got to alter your brain to just get rid of this and there's no reason to think that would be easy either because it seems to be something that's very core to at least mammals i would say so it's it goes beyond human consciousness and although it might be possible to overcome it through rationality and being conscious it's it's going to be something that would be very difficult and i don't know whether it's possible is it possible that selfishness is not displayed in people when they're not in a situation of scarcity right is is that is that an option right that you still have it ingrained in your brain it's still part of your nature but it's it's not it's not manifested because you don't act on that kind of impulse if you're not in a situation of scarcity sure um i mean you can consciously mitigate against your biological programming i think that's certainly something that's possible but until we arrive at a point it's difficult to say anything with certainty about you know a post-scarcity world yeah so i don't want to make any claims that aren't based on any evidence because we've we are yet to get that to that point yeah so it's better to have it grounded in our current situation i don't think scarcity is going to go away anytime soon and in fact with a growing population it's probably going to be even more likely that people are going to compete for resources so um just just to make it clear what what what marks what marx thought would happen on the communism or after the the socialist communist revolution it would be that that eventually society would would arrive at a state where it would be stateless classless and and scarcity-less yes that's this kind of vision of communism and so um of course then then if you if you move that kind of vision to politics and and political systems then it then it becomes some something completely different but like that's there's the kind of idea that that he was he was proposing that in this kind of world people would not be selfish anymore because it would there would no be there wouldn't be any scarcity so there wouldn't be any need for it exactly yeah and i would also like to add the caveat that marx did not believe that capitalists are motivated by any essential kind of viciousness they simply had a drive towards what he considered the bare semblance of human existence so he believed that they were essentially satisfying base urges for resources essentially so for money and power yeah so he's not necessarily saying that they are particularly immoral but he's saying that they're they're not taking the totality of the picture in his view right which isn't necessarily an unreasonable position per se um and the reason he says it's a semblance of human existence is that he believes that capitalism alienates people from their true nature as kind of alluded to just a second ago so so he thought he thought people's true nature was something that would manifest himself in in communism right yeah and so and so the fact that uh that you don't have communism means that you you what you're seeing people behave like and be like is not their true nature yeah it's a product of the economic system that they lived under essentially so um i want to get on to why i don't necessarily think marx is right um and i want to start with the prisoner's dilemma which i imagine you're relatively familiar with i don't know what it is yeah yeah so um i've actually got it on screen here so essentially the two it's like a hypothetical scenario which it has been used in lots of uh economic and psychological experiments which looks at cooperation and essentially selfishness and it has a kind of dilemma of two prisoners who have been caught and they either stay silent or cooperate with law enforcement and then they either they have these respective um kind of sentences i suppose so if they both cooperate they serve one year in prison which is the the lowest kind of prison time um if one uh betrays but the other doesn't then one serves for three years but one goes free and if they both betray one another they both serve two years so there's kind of like a an intersecting model there where cooperation is the kind of the best for both really if you're kind of calculating it from the needs of both people they would only serve one year each which is the lowest amount of time um however it the research into this dilemma seems to suggest that cooperating isn't necessarily the most rational strategy because you if you at least not not in in a one-time event yeah if you've if you've got continuous cooperation then it makes sense because you want to preserve that relationship but if you if you have no ties to this person then it probably makes sense to betray them because they might betray you and you might end up serving the three years in prison while they go free whereas if you betray them at least you know you're going to get two years rather than three free so it always makes sense to betray the person in this scenario yeah and so so if it if it moves to like a continuous kind of relationship or repeated event where you can react to what has happened before and you can foresee that something else will happen in the future based on what you do now then it makes sense it makes sense it made more sense to cooperate rather than to betray because then you need to foster that relationship yeah and so then the optimist optimal strategy would be to to always do what what you saw the other guy do in the previous round right sure but the reason i have included this is because it provides a like a a good example of how human nature could incentivize a lack of cooperation like because you can't guarantee the the good nature of the person you're cooperating with it pays to have your own interests at heart and i think that's the the core of why our evolution has programmed us to behave in this way and this can be seen in something like uh richard dawkins selfish gene where he talks about um the g from like evolution from the gene's point of view or all the gene wants to kind of anthropomorphize it is to spread more copies of itself right so it's a means of explaining altruistic behavior because people who share your genes it helps if you want to spread your genes further to promote their survival as well whereas people who have no shared genes it makes sense not to cooperate with them from an evolutionary perspective and i think that is the the core of why something like this manifests in human behavior and why people might behave selfishly if that makes sense yes partly but wouldn't wouldn't the best scenario for genes preserving themselves and spreading themselves be cooperation a lot of the time where you can foresee that cooperation will put you in a better position ultimately because you have capacity to think about those situations do you think about those there's outcomes it's not necessarily a binary thing of cooperate or be completely self-interested there's a whole spectrum of cooperation and i think it it pays for people to cooperate to a certain extent but where the cooperation puts you at risk perhaps disproportionately than it pays to have your own interests at heart um according to this sort of theory yeah that makes sense so i want to move on to a little look at economics in primates which sounds very counter-intuitive but my my reason for including this is that because human beings are so complex and we have consciousness we have elaborate societies it's very difficult to establish what aspects of our personalities and our behavior are manifestations of our higher brain areas or our conscious minds essentially and what parts are pre-programmed and biological so through looking at closely related primates it kind of helps to establish what traits we have and which we don't there's the lobster view it is yeah it's the petersonian lobster view that um lobster's body language is altered by how successful they are in their conflicts and therefore it influences their future success i didn't know that that that was that that's what it was what it was about yeah i thought it was about them um um expressing male and female traits um and kind of possessive traits and territorial traits as well that might be a part of it i'm probably just uh [Music] the only thing i've actually heard about lobsters was in the uh kathy newman interview with jordan peterson where he mentions it so that's i haven't actually looked at the research for myself but i've heard him talk about it so i might not be completely accurate though as a caveat okay let's go to chimpanzees okay so this comes from a research paper known as chimpanzee or tarki and an ortarki is just an economy that occurs in isolation i believe and i'm just going to read out a quote from the research paper so although chimpanzees do engage in non-costly barter in which otherwise valueless tokens are exchanged for food this lack of risk is not typical of human barter thus we systematically explain barter in chimpanzees to ascertain under what circumstances chimpanzees will engage in costly barter of commodities that is trading food items for other food items with a human experimenter we found that chimpanzees do batter relinquish lower value items to obtain higher value items and not the reverse so they've got some degree of understanding of value up there and however they do not trade in all beneficial situations maintaining possession of less preferred items when the relative gains they stand to make us small okay so what that seems to suggest is that there's some understanding of the risk of trade there so that if you might offer something to your partner trading partner you they might betray you and you they might run away with with your stuff so chimpanzees don't really understand property rights which sounds ridiculous but it but it is true they they don't understand personal possessions so um if uh chimpanzee was to offer something in trade another chimpanzee might just take it and run away and you know it's not like they have a moral compass to kind of feel guilty about it later so because there's always the risk they know that there there is this kind of risk yes so if if the gain is small they won't engage in the trade yeah so this is like a small example of economizing primates essentially right which seems to suggest uh at least in my view that some degree of capitalism seems to emerge from our origin as primates and i'll go on to elaborate on that a bit further so there's a brilliant study which looks at cappuccin monkeys which are small kind of simplistic monkeys that figured out how to use monetary tokens to essentially prostitute themselves so so they they didn't trade with food but yet actual tokens so that didn't have value on on their own they only had exchange value and not them this can actually be read about in quite an accessible new york times article which covers it rather than the actual research paper but if you do want to look at more research on this i recommend the research of keith chen who conducted this study who's worked in behavioral economics with primates for quite a while so essentially he says of capuchin's the capuchin has a small brain and it's pretty much focused on food and sex and they he says you should really think of a capuchin as a bottomless stomach of want so this kind of gives you a picture that they they are very focused on gaining resources right essentially so in the experiment which uh keith chen did with lori santos at yale new haven hospital um they gave these kind of silver discs with holes in them they were like to they're meant to represent like coins essentially um but they were they had these weird holes in them i don't know i suppose that's just for the monkeys to be able to grasp them i don't know the rationale behind it but they had these little tokens which they taught them to exchange for food items so these silver discs would be handed over to a human experimenter in exchange for apparently jelly cubes and grapes and they they established clear preferences for um certain food items that were more desirable so they figured well now we know that they can use these tokens in exchange for food why don't we manipulate the price right of the food so they increased and decreased the price of these certain food items and they found that the monkeys essentially employed a utility maximization strategy in the they they bought as much food when the price was low and they bought less when the price was high so they were able to wait or how long or um they don't necessarily give a time frame but they essentially proved that these monkeys had some theory of price because they reserved their tokens for a time when they could make the most out of them as opposed to when the price was high so they also um kind of experimented with something known as loss aversion which is something that was observed in human beings first and essentially loss aversion is something where human beings seem to find losses as twice as bad as an equal gain so losing two pounds is twice as bad as lu as gaining two pounds and the kind of rationale behind this is that in the kind of environment in which primates have evolved losing resources is far more dangerous for an organism's survival than gaining yeah yeah if if you get what i mean oh i think i do so is is it is it something like that if if you're if you're in like an adverse environment and and you you've got you've got some limited resources sure um the loss of a certain portion small portion of the resources could be could be deadly to you if especially if scarcity is is very severe around you in like in less kind of wealthy conditions less civilized conditions let's say then uh even a small loss could result in in catastrophic consequences whereas a small gain is a gain that's nice but is not as important is not as consequential and that's where this seems to originate from um and why you can prove mathematically that losses are perceived as twice as bad as the relative games are and they found this which we thought was quite an elaborate well the the scientific community thought initially that it was quite an elaborate human trait was actually found in capuchins which are relatively simplistic monkeys essentially so it it provides kind of a compelling argument for economizing man having more biological drives than you might initially think well it kind of kind of makes sense that loss aversion in particular would be something that you would observe with with other other species as well especially because that kind of environment that kind of situation where the concept of loss of vision makes sense is is something that humans might be actually less exposed to that situation just because they can through through that you know reason through their long-term planning they can achieve a higher level of wealth that where this loss aversion is not as relevant anymore as it is with with other species it's certainly not something unique to humans and it's certainly a concern that should be of to all animals essentially so they they sent the experimenters essentially concluded that the data they had gathered from the observations of these capuchin monkeys made them statistically indistinguishable from most stock market investors which uh i'm sure the people at wall street vets wholly approve of what does it mean then like what what do they what did they well they're essentially saying that they're trying to maximize their gains their reverse to losses in the same way and in and with the same mathematical patterns that we can observe in human behavior so did they test like that you know predicting power of like how successful they are at making gains or something like that as opposed to stock market investors or i don't i think it's simply comparable i think they're they're trying to make make it a bit um why did they make the statement like what was the point of comparison like the same thing the same trends that manifest in human behavior can be observed in monkeys is the point they're trying to make it's not necessarily that you're gonna get loads of capuchin's working at hedge funds very soon the point is that that when i was uh i i saw an article a few months ago maybe we'll be able to find it for the footnotes but for the show notes but uh in the article you had researchers um with some monkeys and they let the monkeys just like randomly press buttons on like some machines that would like buy and sell stocks and they compared that to a performance of a fund something like that right and the performance was very comparable so that's like the uh the thousand monkeys 1000 typewriters sort of analogy taken to real life so that's that's what i thought this uh this meant or that this was referring to but maybe not i'll try to find that because that was really good that sounds like a good study actually so um the the research goes on the researcher goes on to say sorry that um there were also some interesting observations that they didn't actually try and like test for if you will so i'll read the following quote the research assistant happened to slice cucumbers into discs instead of cubes as was typical one cappuccino picked up a slice and started to eat it and then ran over to the researcher to see if he could buy something sweeter with it because the the roundness of the slice of cucumber looked like the token so to the capuchin a round slice of cucumber bore enough resemblance to chen's silver tokens to seem like it was another piece of currency so it shows that they understand roughly what these tokens come to represent and it seems to be that uh some kind of aspect of the shape of it and the size seems to trigger something in their brain that that it's a store of value yeah exactly so they also talk about an anecdote of uh the first case of capuchin heist once a capuchin in the testing chamber picked up an entire tray of tokens flung them into the main chamber and then scurried in after them it was a combination of a jailbreak and a bank heist which led a chaotic scene in which the human researcher had to rush into the main chamber and offer food for bribes for the tokens um and this this seems to show that they understood that the value of these tokens was high enough that they would risk bad behavior right yeah and also the act of the experimenter having to bribe these monkeys to give the tokens back also reinforced further stealing as well so there's lots to unpack here and um it is also worth noting that in in this heist one of the the capuchins involved in that the heist took the tokens and exchanged it to another monkey in exchange for sex which then the uh the prostitute monkey then exchanged for a grape this profession it truly is so interesting what this research seems to suggest is that not only can primates economize they also have an ability to understand understand value in abstraction like these these tokens didn't have any inherent worth right to the to the capuchins but they're able to exchange them for food and therefore they became valuable in their mind and so so even even then if if the not the token itself but the kind of roundness and the shape of the of the token had this kind of value in their brain yeah they they then saw the cucumber which they i suppose understand that they could eat it yeah but they could understand that it has double value it has value for them as as food and as the exchange what it shows is they tried to eat it first realize that this is a cucumber i'd rather have a grape right and then they're like well actually it's a better value that i exchange this for something i want to eat so that's that's quite a like an elaborate thought process for a low world monkey essentially i'm not sure if that's the actual term for them but that's what i'm calling them now so um what you can kind of see here is that marx's view that human selfishness arises from capitalism clearly isn't true is it because if even monkeys understand the utility in self-interest then it suggests that it's not uh some a product of consciousness and therefore it's not something that something as elaborate as an entire economic system can reinforce it seems to have biological underpinnings as opposed to this this just means that you introduce capitalism to the capuchins but if if even a capuchin can understand capitalism then there's got to be something there that that shows it's inherent right like that's not unreasonable is it capitalism is inherent to human nature well that's that's essentially what i'm arguing like okay it was the oldest economic system i mean it's we've got evidence that it existed over 9000 years ago from archaeology that some of the earliest kind of documents of writing was to deal with trades and stuff like that so i think there's certainly a compelling argument to suggest that but anyway that's the end of part one and make sure to tune in tomorrow for part two where i talk about things like human motivation and marx's view on that and why it's wrong and the individual in history and how marx characterizes history and also the limitations on individuals thank you and goodbye [Music] you
