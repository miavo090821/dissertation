If anything it makes you more so either entitled or by noticing the scarcity and hoarding what you are given. But if you scrap hard for everything you have and now have your needs met with abundance, you become more generous because you’ve been there and want to help lift others up to where you now are. It’s not a zero-sum game when you become successful, but it is when you have nothing. Capitalism allows your true nature to flourish bc you can make money off of your passion. The state probably doesn’t care about the songs I play or the books I write unless it’s propaganda, so art has no place in a Marxist society, especially not politically critical art. Whereas art flourishes in a capitalist society because people will pay for it as they like it and encourage artists. \n\nFinally, all individuals can work collectively together but the collective can never work individually. That’s the nail in the coffin of Marxism. Individuals in a capitalist society can actually be more or less Marxist on a self-sufficient farm. But individuals cannot operate safely in a collectivist society. Even worse, we see evidence that capitalism persists under Marxism in the black market bc people are attracted to efficient answers for their problem and freedom to make choices. But the state clearly would rather enslave us and force our hand.",

    "text": "Main rule in basic Economic theory: Assume people are rational. From there, one can theorize which option a person will take cause the assumption is they will choose the most good for them. \nMain rule in reality: People are not rational. None of the fancy graphs and formulas will ever fully capture human behavior. \n\nHonestly, Economics was one of my favorite subjects, especially when we got into Game Theory. Prisoner’s Dilemma is a good example of people trying to figure out what is the best outcome from a poor pool. \nI find the idea of ‘Strong Pig, Weak Pig’ or ‘Big Pig, Little Pig/Piglet’ also an interesting take. Pretty much there’s two pigs, one bigger than the other, in an area where a lever needs to be pressed to distribute food on the other end. If both do nothing, neither eat so no one benefits. If BP presses the lever, then Piglet gets first dibs while BP will push them aside for the remaining food when it gets there. If Piglet presses the lever, the BP will probably eat all the food before Piglet has the chance to eat. If both press it, then Piglet will have to get to the food first for a chance to eat before BP makes it. If Piglet is too slow, then they wasted energy for negative to zero gain. Most graphs I’ve seen have Piglet gaining something under the assumption they’ll be faster than BP, but if it’s Weak Pig then that might make a more pronounced difference based off its nature.\nThe argument then gets down to which option benefits both. From Piglet’s standpoint, it’s obviously better if BP presses the lever so they can eat. From BP’s standpoint, the lever needs to be pushed and whether they push it or will affect how much BP can eat, though not as drastic as in Piglet’s case. \nSo make the stronger provide the means, let the weak get first dibs, and then push them aside so the stronger can get something? Let the weak provide the means, and the strong collect all the gains without giving to the weak? Or both start at the same place and the spoils go to whoever gets there first? \n\nThe more moral answer seems to let the weak benefit and then the strong will get their due. But shouldn’t the strong be the first entitled to the product of their labor? \nIssue with weak pressing the lever is they may never get the benefits, but the strong were able to continue on. If both contributed and started from the same place, then isn’t only fair that the best got the most reward? \n\nSorry for the seemingly random topic. I just tend to geek out whenever Game Theory is brought up.",

Of course, tha explanation still indicates that humans are, by nature, self-interested, which I don't think is what Marx was going for (despite seeming to be the most true probability).  This also does, however, bring-up the rather interesting point that selfish behavior can sometimes go against an individual's self-interest, particularly in regards to interactions with others.",

I think he's stuck working in the contextual framework of the dictionary definition, which is not the same as the economic definition. Scarcity is endemic to the human condition, which means you would have to change the underlying human condition _first_ before you could \"eliminate\" scarcity. Which means that simply eliminating \"scarcity\" (dictionary definition) both won't actually eliminate \"scarcity\" (economic definition) and won't affect the human condition, because the human condition is the independent variable in this relationship, not the dependent variable. In fact, in TNG, the reason we consider this a \"post-scarcity world\" isn't just the technological advancements, but also the fact that humans _themselves_ have fundamentally changed, which is why no one does things for \"money\" any more, and everyone simply does things for \"fulfillment\". Sargon was right to label Roddenberry's hypothetical world \"extremely optimistic\".",

It is a biological imperative which has brought us to where we are now.\nAs our brains grew we learned, and over time we came to understand that, for a miriad of reasons, it is in our own self interest to cooperate with those around us - safety in numbers, reciprocal food sharing...we learn as toddlers that cooperation and sharing ends up getting you more in terms of material things, but also in terms of alliances and human connections.\nSome of our behaviours are adaptive and apparently altruistic...giving aid to strangers for example.  Aside from the feelings of wellbeing this can bring, it also signals status as a generous person - something people may remember when you are in need.\nAlso, it is ameliorating the suffering you see around you, which ultimately makes for a more settled and less threatening environment for yourself and your progeny thereby increasing probability for success.\nWe are not unselfish.  We have learned how to compete and cooperate with one another to the greatest benefit for the most people.\n\nWhen that breaks down - as history shows us - our real selves emerge.

Any animal that scavenges and stores food, like squirrels, will expend a greater amount of energy when gathering when food is abundant rather than when it's scarce. Spending time and energy looking for food when it's not widely available is a waste of banked resources that may end up earning no gain or a net loss, when it could be spent in other activities such as nest building or searching for mating partners. I believe this instinctual understanding of energy investment against payoff is a large contributor to behavioral patterns of animal species.",

Even if scarcity is eliminated you cannot socially engineer away our human nature. You can only create a system that accomodates it and tries to meet our needs while taking our sometimes destructive traits into account and create a culture with rules/laws that to the best of our knowledge tries to prevent and deal with their negative consequences.\n\nI don't think most communists shares Marx's view on selfishness, I think they very much believe it to be part of human nature but it's something THEY can rid humanity from by creating a system that dogmatically doesn't allow it in any form - a totalitarian collective. The individuals simply cannot be allowed to live for themselves but for \"the greater good\", for the collective. It's basically a cult ideology which at its core is based on contempt for human nature and the concept of the indiviudual. Obviously, if \"selfishness\" is part of our nature \"the greater good\" must accomodate for this. You simply cannot say that the elimination of a fundamental human trait is for \"the greater good\" when the collective consists of individuals who all share this trait. It's an inherent contradiction in communism and that's why it has ALWAYS failed miserably and will continue to do so forever.",

When things are not scarce, people don't suddenly become less selfish, it's just that non scarce goods are cheap. People will still act selfishly, but scarce goods are just more expensive. Price is merely our way of prioritizing how generous we want to be with things.",

Without all voices collectively we can not express the full range of society.

In short, we are not capable of individually creating a monopoly. The ability to do so would take more effort than the individual. This is not to say that Marx was correct. The individual can indeed go against the categorical imperative and use the efforts of others in order to extend the desire of the individual.",

The conservationist would argue that the regular manufacture and steady replenishment of resources means you must also protect your supply that you bring to market. \n\nA lack of understanding of the scarcity or its limits makes the capitalist respond with only the assumption I must bring to market as much as I can while I can control the market.

    "text": "Consciousness does not appose nature. In fact it is simply a brain function that has evolved naturally. Not every conscious animal is rational, so that thought process is wrong. \nAnother thing is that selfishness is often counter productive, especially in herd animals (witch humans still are, despite the fact that most of us see us as more than animals, witch we are essentially not). Doing what is best for the group, is very often what is best for the individual as well. It is the main reason why animals that live in groups develop that ability for empathy. And empathy is not a rational thing, it's based on emotion. Though that does not mean you cannot rationalize it. \n\nRationality can and is very often used to legitimize selfishness. Sociopaths often think it is their duty, or at least not their fault that they fool people, and manipulate them. To them it teaches those individuals that they shouldnt be so gullible. They rationalize their own horrible behavior to justify it. There is 0 empathy, while fully aware of the entire situation and their own selfish actions and the consequences of the actions. In fact it is the very negative outcome for the other person that is the pre planned goal of the sociopath. \n\nSimply put there are logical reasons to be found for both being selfless or selfish. So the statement that through rationality you can overcome selfishness is factually untrue. Proven by the fact that us humans have been rational since the enlightenment at least (actually way long before that, the very idea of a god is an attempt at rationalizing natural events that they didn't fully understand yet). But still wars are being fought, resources hoarded, people left to die from hunger and preventable deceases and other countless atrocities that are being done on a daily basis. Often pre planned, and knowing that other people will be negatively effected. China's government consciously makes decisions based on their own rationale and ideas, that negatively impacts their citizen for the sole improvement of their own selfish interests.\n\nPersonally I have never read Cant, but I can safely say he was wrong. Otherwise China and other evil regimes would not excist. Unless you want to argue that these regimes do not use rationality at all, and are purely random actions, devoid of consciousness thought and rationality.",

    "text": "These two are not equipped to analyse this topic.\nThey are approaching this with top-down analysis and when you're dealing with topics such as self-awareness of the individual and decision making you simply cannot discount the fine details since they set up the underlying field of action.\n\nFor example the word rational is used with respect to Immanuel Kant's work, but what does rational mean? For rational to be well-defined we would need to have a complete classification of what is considered irrational and we don't have that either. Josh's subscription to Kantian ideals also shows a naivety to the incompleteness of Kant's models.\nKant is completely ignorant of the mechanisms of Irreducible Representation.\nIf we are ignorant of the consequences of Irreducibility of word/symbol problems then we cannot form a particularly coherent image of \"thought\" since we must represent thought through symbols.\nGiven that there are completely irreducible symbolic representations (i.e. while I may be able to express the meaning of this post in fewer words, the existence of an irreducible ordering of symbols is a requirement for ANY post else all words collapse and there can be no meaning), we can only reasonably conclude that while the network structure of our brain may be somewhat plastic it is indeed restricted within a fixed limit that we cannot \"think ourselves out of\" [this can be explained through algebraic structures associated to the graph/network, see Leavitt path algebras or C* algebras i.e. what Josh mentioned as the sort of \"two brain\" hypothesis falls into a specific subset of a path algebra, we may expand this hypothesis into domain specific decision making as well by considering how non-trivial ideals within the network can form coherent sub-algebras then start considering how the sums of partial isomorphisms form an overall decision making structure, this then falls into a class of non-IBN ring algebras and we must work within not necessarily linearly causal logical frameworks].\nWithin this framework we may then consider how individual selfishness maps to collective social benefit. Individuals who act completely selfishly do not have access to the level of domain specificity that a social collective has.\nThe sole individual must do everything as opposed to being able to focus on a singular field to produce more efficient results within a social system.\nThere is very explicitly a selfish reason to be social. This selfish reason very explicitly fits into theories of natural selection because when a pressure is introduced to an ecosystem the sole individuals have less access to resources and are then less likely to survive.\nBoth of these outcomes are due to selfishness but they aren't necessarily comparable in terms of something like a \"selfishness index\" where one party is more or less selfish than the other, they are simply oriented along different vectors where one of them fails to predominate under the action of the underlying field.\nThe reason they orient along different vectors can then be due to any number of underlying local constraints on individuals including but not limited to scarcity of resources making sole competition more preferable, lack of socialisation meaning that an individual may be unable to access the other option, geographic isolation, etc. We notice here that the local constraints and global constraints to not necessarily operate within a necessarily linearly causal frame rather that the global constraints emerge due to interactions of local constraints resulting in a structure that appears to be representable as a non-IBN ring algebra since we have \"interactions across dimensions\". {Global system and local system are different dimensions, the concept of \"spatial dimension\" is a part of this broader mathematical kind of dimension.}\n\nNot properly defining what we mean by natural does not relax any of these constraints, it just means that trying to say anything meaningful becomes more difficult and prone to working error.\n\nStart by defining natural or at the very least have a set of irreducible definitions to work within otherwise this may as well be pure speculation.",
