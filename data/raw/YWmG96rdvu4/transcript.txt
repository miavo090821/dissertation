so I don't think it's the third party right obviously we know that I think what it is is how much how we talked kept people home they're preparing for all of these policies that are about to go into place they're already creating in concentration camps for migrants in Texas I'm like I know I did as much as I could and for me I think I'm at the part where I'm like I also wasn't doubting how white people were going to show up there are a lot of tools at the disposal of the GOP of the Republican party that are not at the disposal of the democratic party or the left in any sense there isn't an answer for somebody who can stret the truth indefinitely we have you know Democratic clubs on college campuses there was no like turning points USA for the Left Right these institutions that are basically just propaganda Rags the Democrats have enough money you I was literally talking to my mom about it and my mom was like no the Democrats are the party of like you know working people I feel like the party has increasingly gotten more elitist a little bit [Music] hello beautiful black people hey I love that we started giggling on this somber occasion oh there is there is nothing else there's nothing on my mind surely other than the results of this godamn election so I'mma just take it to the room anybody who wants to share how are folks feeling honestly on my end um it's funny I think for me because I feel like I ended up kind of like taking a step back from like super super radical talking points and stuff for a little bit because we like fall in line let's not distract away and I was like let me just lend my platform and lend my voice in a way that feels right um and so being able to do these commercials do these ads talk to people um canvas outside like do all these things uh political education I'm like I know I did as much as I could um and for me I think I'm at the part where I'm like I also wasn't doubting how white people were going to show up I never doubted how white people were going to show up and so for me it was really just like yeah I had that moment of hope when I said oh [ __ ] okay people popping out and still in the back of my mind I said to be responsible In This Moment quote unquote with my platform is not to be as critical is not to fully engage in this way um to make other people kind of be comfortable so I was thinking around like a little bit of my role as a content creator in this space but then not only just that like I took yesterday completely off I was like I don't have it my mes some my former students like checked on me but I was also just kind of like contextualizing what some of this means for them as well because some of them is their first year in college and they're out in Central PA and they're like I don't know what I'm supposed to do and who I feel safe around um and so I think that's the part for me that I was kind of like working through a little bit more is because I was on a college campus when he was elected the first time I remember being a junior in college um and so now where I'm in a role of a admin person in college and figuring out like what does this mean I took time for myself yesterday but immediately my thing was sitting there texting like all right so what's some of the stuff mean and don't answer this right away but like for political strategist with the Working Families party I'm like all right what are some of the next things that we do because for me I'm like I got to get into planning for the midterms in 20 um 26 and so these are things that I immediately get to because I was like I'm not surprised white people going to do what they do but I just want to make sure especially working it education I'm not only focused on just like how I know I'm going to move but also thinking around like oh my students are going to actively be impacted by a lot of the stuff that is going to happen with a fully red government so that's where I'm at right now but I'm finding pockets of Joy I built a new entertainment setup so I said I'll can control what I can control so is my small win of the day I don't know I know you're not supposed to do I remember talking to my mom like oh sorry I know you're not supposed to do the Monday Morning Quarterback you know but that's just that's how I do that's what I start I start doing the autopsy I start trying to figure okay what happened here what um and I start uh just looking for patterns things that I things that I can try and make sense of um because I you know I knew this was a possibility but I don't know sometime hindsight's always 2020 foresight is not a gift that Humanity has uh I mean it's a it's a problem it's our downfall so yeah it's easier to look back and one of the first things I noticed was obviously like the left just couldn't unify and the right just everybody fell in line in 2016 people were Heming and haing and making excuses for him you know slowly but surely they were like is this the guy we're not so sure about him there was a guy who I knew personally who after Trump was elected was incredibly upset he was a he was a republican he was a republican that I went to uh to high school with and uh this year he was just like what a great campaign uh by this point the entire Republican party is falling in line uh he got RFK up in the mix it's not like it's not like k k ER is gonna bring out Jill Stein and be like hey like we um we got at each other's throats and that was uh and that was all part of the play We felt for that one Hook Line and Sinker and then also man I started just thinking about all this uh you know the alt-right the uh the kind of hot bed that started out that has totally evaporated because they have there's like a mainstream level of appeal with like Joe Rogan and uh Logan Paul and all these like podcasts that he can go on now he doesn't he doesn't need Alex Jones anymore he doesn't need uh the French people with you know there's no uh Pepe the Frog and all that [ __ ] like that was like that was their version of hipsters like that was their uh you know hardcore but he doesn't need that anymore um we need to start at square one with that [ __ ] like we just we don't know how to talk to people it's interesting because I'm I'm a I'm one of these people that um you know I'm looking at this black woman who got thrust basically into this position um less than a 100 days and I actually think that she did a great job considering the circumstances I actually think that um we are much harder on the Democratic party because we expect more and that's just a reality I'm not excusing you know messaging that didn't land I'm not excusing XY I'm not I'm really not you know I was home visiting my father in Philly and three people knocked on his door he has a Kamala Harris sign right out front because he voted early and his wife didn't mind you his wife works the polls but they knock to make sure excuse me are you who you voted for who you voted for so the ground game was strong there the way that she handled this I think was and is a lot better than what we're giving it credit right now now because we're disappointed um her specifically I think that the Democratic party it's very hard to not have a to to have a Donald Trump running this wasn't a regular Republican right you have a Donald Trump esque figure running it's very hard to not draw that contrast when every other day he's doing something that is completely appor and it's appor to his to some of his supporters as well they just don't care which brings me to the understanding I I started to ask myself like okay why would someone vote for Donald Trump I have family members that voted for him um in Pennsylvania and I started to ask like even I started to ask myself what is freedom what what is this concept of Freedom that we talk about because I don't think that freedom the way that we're defining it is the same across the board I think that a lot of people's version of freedom is to have the rights that white folks have and to have the power and the privilege that white folks have but it's not about Equity it's not about equality it's not about community and it's not about like any anything else outside of that it's about whiteness yep and whiteness is the American dream the countries founded in that and so I start to think about all of these people who we consider to be voting against their interests when they're not they're voting for the very thing that they want whether they're ever going to get it or not because proximity to whiteness is freedom in this country and so then I started to think about all the ways in which we are analyzing this and nobody's I don't see people talking about socioeconomics I see people really pissed off about with men U specifically Latino men even the 20 some per of black men that voted and I'm like there there isn't listen there has to be some type of correlation between men voting for economics and an economic agenda over everything and anything else and I won't even say agenda because there really isn't an agenda there's not no plan but how what they perceive because they perceive Donald Trump as the white American Dream right they perceive as strength why because he's his proximity to whiteness they're voting for that and and they're also head of house they also the the patriarchy is also real they're also expected to provide a certain amount and so we have confusion around why that's their number one thing choice and just real fast and so the cast thing is something that I've been really sitting with and then this the other thing that I'm sitting with is I'm sure the folks on this call know that the tariffs that Donald Trump will impose will end up costing us I mean I just saw someone crying on the internet on a video because they work in a warehouse and they were just told that they will not get any of their Christmas holiday bonuses because they actually have to purchase all of their materials in advance before the terrorists go into play I mean so with that said there's a policy issue here there is a disconnect between policy if we're talking about the Democratic party is forgot about the middle class maybe or we're not really educating folks and people don't understand policies and they don't understand how policies directly impact them they don't understand when policies go into place and who's actually responsible for that the disconnect is missing and they're going to get it soon they're going to feel it I have an immigrant person in my life who does it just applied for a green card is all about Donald Trump you're going to feel it bro like you have cases you're not going to get your green card and you have children who are School AED and you're not going to have a Department of Education you have a daughter that has pel grants you're not going to have that [ __ ] and so the disconnect is real and if we do this education around policy I feel like that helps us with the propaganda I feel like that helps us with the misinformation I feel like that helps us with the activation I'm on a so Fox right now but I've I am only thinking about what's next I can't think about Donald Trump like Donald Trump and his and the people who are just bigots they're going to be there but the majority of people who voted for him really believe they're not bigots and really believe they're not racists which we can have that argument but they are voting for their self-interest and their self-interest is white sup like white supremacy whiteness and that is the American dream I shut up oh may I quickly jump in of course I would I want to make sure if they got if Dan or Jay wanted to talk real quick cool all right yeah all righty so there's a couple things I've been sitting with because of looking at these um exit polls and like really analyzing it and I really wanted to kind of get into like the educational piece but also this aspiration to patriarchy that you were really alluding to antonet um and so when you talked around white male Freedom it is thinking around the ways in which that people want to go back to Traditional Values that seem attainable but in reality there's a disconnect that is happening with the opportunities for for men and the development of boys I think it's actually a skills issue because if they are also and I'm thinking just from like an education standpoint more women are going to college less men are going to college that's Point Blank period and graduating from college men don't want to go to school anymore men are also looking for manufacturing jobs that make them feel manly the daily had a really really cool episode around the gendered election and to hear some of these boys talk and they even asked some men when I was out canvasing they're just like they forgot about straight men that now that's another conversation because I said ah we can get into it but there is this pursuit of the American dream which is actually more like white male domination and wanting to like pursue that in a sense too and so they're not wanting to go into education because most teachers or people who work in education are still it's still a feminite a feminite job right and so they don't want to go into that which is why they're not pursuing degrees so I think we also need to ask around like what are some of the extra barriers that are there but why are men actively also disconnecting from education CU that number is increasing that they are not wanting to go to college anymore and so it's like oh you don't want to go to college but the reality is and especially if you're black um you still need a college degree to at least potentially make it into the middle class in some way shape or form to have a fundamentally easier life but also when you look at the family structure the man are not able to bring home the bring home the bacon anymore because in reality those jobs that they are looking for do not pay as much as degreed jobs are paying and so when I'm looking at this from an economic standpoint and also just from like a cultural standpoint I'm like oh y'all are chasing this patriarchy that does not exist for you that is not going to be attained because the reality is women are ultimately going to become the Breadwinners and you you know how to reckon in a world where you need to be a partner to women that you either love or you or forced to be in community with which I'm just like if you can't even be in a true partnership with that can you also take this idea that a woman can lead in presidency because also part of those exit polls where it's asking who do you think would be able to lead this country effectively over 70% said Donald Trump 24% said kamla Harris so even look at looking at some of those exit Poes and like what they are thinking about I'm like oh so if I'm going to like focus in on a little bit more of like the young men that also collectively did not want to get off of the couch in order to vote cuz Trump's honestly his uh popularity with white people slowly actually went down but his popularity with people of color went up the people were going to vote for johnald Trump were going to vote for Donald Trump regardless the people who came out for Biden though did not come out for Harris and so I thought it was like very interesting to also like name that piece because I think we can name white supremacy and patriarchy I think we can also name like this real fox Traditional Values that men are still seeking that does honestly it's going to be non-existent which is why we're seeing all these rollbacks happen because when those rollbacks begin to happen and this idea of progress happens there's an idea that men are going to be left behind because they cannot keep up with everybody else and the reality is if you don't want to go to school you're going to be left behind if you're not trying to pursue an advanced degree economically there's you're not able to be mobile because the last time somebody without a degree had the most opportunity to be economic upward have upward Mobility was if you were a no degree in the 80s Millennials today do not have that same opportunity with a degree and so I'm sitting all in this data I'm like dog like that's the scary part which is also making me like oh I think around my job in college access I'm like oh I have to get these kids into school even more because if I don't this is going to persist the frustration that men are feeling is going to continue to happen because what men don't realize in your pursuit of trying to get this thing because you're thinking around yourself you don't even realize that those same policies that TR is about to put in place are going to screw you over because you're going to feel the frustration cuz guess what your ass is still working class I recognize in my position I'm not going to feel all of the effects right now because I'm single and still making a decent amount of money and I live in a space that does not cost too much to live and so it's interesting to like have to round that and do some self-reflection but also talking on the ground doing this and talking to younger people I'm like dog I'm so I'm so nervous for boys I'm so nervous for women who have to deal with the frustration of boys women and F who have to deal with the frustration of boys who grow into men who can't attain the patriarchy so longwinded sorry but Anon that you made me I had to write down some notes no yeah I I yeah I can't as many times as you said like left behind in class and it's this hierarchy it's that cast system that keeps coming up and it keeps being like if you're going to take my job there's not going to be enough for me you know and whether it's men and women whether it's college educated or not college educated whether it's immigrant versus American whatever it is it's always going to be there's not enough for me too and I have to think about myself first which is the root of all of this [ __ ] it's capitalism that's it's just that's it that's it and I do feel like also and I think somebody kind of named it earlier right like the Biden Harris Administration not like naming their wins like I have a lot of critiques of their Administration more broadly but I feel like you know they invested in 400,000 uh new energy jobs that's part of the inflection uh inflation reduction act um and that was a very big Bill that was a very big deal and those are going to be physical like you know what I'm saying like construction jobs and like I think you know while I'm not saying that it's nearly enough like there are a myriad of examples just within that one bill I think that kind of like demonst straight actual investment into like those communities and so like sitting there looking at the exit poles especially like the night of like I was just like damn like I I think I think you know again like I think there's a lot of critique to be had for the Democratic party but I think like more broadly there are direct things that connect to I think a lot of these like asks that we're talking about and I think there's a there there's a lot of like excuse my French like [ __ ] footing around and it just felt crazy like I don't know like I feel did they not message their wins or did or were their win not celebrated did they did poor messaging of it's to I think it's a both and I think they did poor messaging of wins but it's also it's also the feeling connecting it to like the community connecting it to like ex like the people and so I I I feel like there were a lot of and and I think it's also really interesting right cuz I think at one point at least in my childhood like I remember the Democratic party being the party of like the everyday man um and that's how you know I was literally talking to my mom about it my mom was like no the Democrats are the party of like you know working people and I feel like the party has increasingly gotten more um elitist a little bit and I think in the way that they speak to people like I you know I like like Maris said I'm I'm blessed enough to have had opportunity to get into education and that's something that I'm passionate about but a lot of black people are not like being spoken to and I think arguably spoken above and I think there's a lot of ways that talking numbers doesn't connect it to the actual impact that it has on on people's lives and um I guess that's more so what I mean I think I think it's hard for them to have Messengers because when you think about it um the political landscape has changed a lot right like when you think about the time of when people had strong or positive feelings about the Democrats is in a time when your parents sit at home and they watch the news all day people do not like the all right they don't watch the traditional news anymore that's not the main format by which people even get news in fact I would say most people are most people are consuming political content and are constantly being politicized and drop propaganda but not directly like they don't realize they're watching the news like you you see what I'm saying like this is a political Channel even if it's not a political news channel it's said to you that way right so I think what happens is I think the landscape has moved more to the to the extremes or I don't mean the Extremes in the negative way but I mean like staunchly on on two different sides so I think the right has the benefit not only are even even of the mainstream news like let's pretend people were watching it the majority of it is right-wing it is right-wing and it's rightwing owned like even CNN is rightwing owned the hill is rightwing you know what I mean all these places the fox all like what do they have MSNBC right so then if you so then there's the main news is already right and then they have constant right-wing propaganda is not just with like all the figures that you know this even Crowders the bench of hero or whatever but it's all these Joe Rogan all the man is fair all of the shade room all of these things people are constantly consuming right-wing propaganda and the Democrats are at a dis disadvantage because they don't have Messengers because what happens is the Democrats are associated with something that you can't really be anymore the Democrats are considered like say this whether you want to look at as Centrist moderate or just standard liberal those are all terms and our current our current zeit guys no one wants to be associated with right like you wouldn't want if you're on the left right like the Democrats is the party you have to pick you would be the only people to do Messengers or or you know what I mean talking points for for uh their wins and you can't do that if you're trying to be a leftist and try to be received on the side of there you know what I mean so they don't really have anybody to do it so what happens is we had an entire election season where the right was completely activated all of their media from the biggest to the smallest on pure right-wing [ __ ] meanwhile the entire leftist media landscape was doing their Endeavor best to like either be against them or not seem for them like people who know they did not want this outcome but they're like I can't say go vote for come can't say Endor kamla because this leftist media landscape is to crucify you for that so I don't think I think yes I think the Democrats do bad at marketing their wins because the people who usually sell your wins for you if you do it as a as a as a political group or the government it doesn't feel genuine or sincere you're not going to receive it from them and the people who would typically do all that messaging and talking won't do it can't do it you know so I I think there's so much of this that just goes to how much of a and this has been litigated a lot it should continue to be is the generational fumble that the uh oh no they're coming for me no but like the generational fumble that the Democratic party has just kind of accomplished on themselves because they let's not ignore the history that the Republicans have kind of hated after the New Deal in FDR how the Democrats seem to be doing really well and so they started building institutions that are like okay the Democrats or the so-called left liberals have regular colleges and universities where you like learn books and you learn like from history and you learn stuff that's in your fields on The Cutting Edge and then the Republicans are going to create the American legislative exchange Council they're going to create the Heritage Foundation they're going to create all these groups that are reaching out to Young conservative lawyers like we're going to give you a job they're reaching out to Young uh Republican campaigners especially if they're people of color because they know this is going to happen they've been wanting to they've been doing this since maybe like the '90s and the odds for sure um they there's been such a failure for Democrats like you've all been saying to build the institutions of power that are actually closer to voters on election days that they even have an ear to what black voters want what um any voter who's voting on economics versus you know everything else that Donald Trump represents what they're doing and so now you get the result where um the climate the Department of Education anything the Department of Transportation was going to do investing billions of dollars into um public transportation naal Transportation um Ukrainian sovereignty uh even though some leftists believe that Donald Trump was going to free Palestine that's going to get a lot worse you think it can't it's going to in my opinion like these are things that I blame the Democratic party on you know I don't blame I can't even blame the green party third party voters because they don't didn't even add up to [ __ ] so like at this point like the rhetoric it's annoying but it's just a bunch of like posters and I've seen that more on the days and days so I'm kind of like just moving that aside towards people who are on the ground people who are more activist minded people who are like actually closer to these issues and I'm just thinking like the Democrats amazingly fumbled this especially because enough people like we're seeing in the exit polling and just the regular results didn't even turn out this time like 10 to 14 million votes that is a failure on the Democratic party for a lot of reasons there's a lot of things going against Kamala Harris but that's still a fail I think getting people elected when you think about it like getting someone elected is a community sport is a team sport like everybody like everybody plays their roles Donald Trump and the Republicans did not solely get him elected right like they had years and years of right-wing propaganda taking hold of people's viewpoints right the reason why they were able to Market to people to be so anti-trans or anti-immigrant is that because they've been feeding it to people for the last four years so I think like when it when it comes to the Democrats because here's the thing to what Antonette was saying I think they were on the ground like my my editor Aaron is in Pennsylvania and he was like Comm them was at them doors the Democrats or whatever right right I think I think what it I don't think it's what it I think this election has shown me is confirmed to me personally that a lot of what people have been trying to dismiss is online or Bots and trolls and all this different stuff is real like what the influence is because I think I don't I don't think it can be understated the role and what our media and our discourse has become and and how far right people have moved and in and in the uh same sense I think it's like a fail failure on the part I think it's a fail I think it's obviously the Dems the all this blah blah blah right I think there are a lot of different compounding factors I guess when I um think about it in the the space we're in or what we do I'm like it's also our our we gota you know be persuasive we have to we have and I and here's the thing I'm not blaming people with platforms or people with voices or people with thought leaders for why because they are reasons why people and and many of them are valid why they're not willing to stick their head out as being like a trojan horse for the uh you know what I mean being an avatar for the Democrats or whatever so I understand that I'm not blaming people or saying people are wrong that they didn't do that but people didn't do that what we had is we had a large right-wing you know what I mean saying all this and then we had the left actively trying to point pointing out every problem you know what I mean killing the momentum and I think so I don't think it's the third party right obviously we know that I think what it is is how much how we talked kept people home you know what I mean it was like the like it's funny to me to see so many like people with huge plat form so disappointed by outcome but I watch them all election season try to kill the momentum at every turn everything that was done to try to appeal to people outside of us that like everybody just decided to try and kill it and that and and that kept people home and I think that I think that more than anything like the people I don't think the people who were they were annoying but I don't think the people who are galv who were running on with the third parties and all of that galvanizing I don't think they're who did it like you can see that by the stats I think it's the rest of us you know what I mean the actual you know the the the left the progressives whoever you want to call call that actively campaigned against kamla like it wasn't just the Republicans campaigning against Kamala it was the left the left campaign like and I bet I don't mean the left isn't like the third party left I mean all of the left you know what I mean like 100% And it's also these like I agree with you completely it's also the fact that like there was no we have you know Democratic clubs on college campuses there was no like turning points USA not just in this election cycle but like in 20 2008 or 2004 for the right these institutions that are basically just propaganda Rags the Democrats have enough money all right because they just haven't been doing that same sort of seating that exactly you're talking about that the right-wing has been doing with with transphobia with um migrant Caravans uh interestingly those seem to be all of a sudden gone the past couple days now that Trump's won I wonder how that works um but yeah I I I'm angry that the people who have all of the institutional power did nothing with it but pay themselves and Smith their own farts and like I also hear the fact that like there's a vocal thing that like we need to be very introspective on that I am trying to be as well um so you made a lot of good points there but like we're we're also on platforms that the Republicans have institutions that in 2016 were working the refs for the reason why uh Facebook and uh Elon Musk uh called him on Facebook Mark Zuckerberg Elon Musk all these tech people used to be perceived as liberals and now are conceived now perceived as Republicans they were always just capitalist but because Republicans used the political party used people in Congress use their media platforms to work the refs on these Facebook algorithms I remember I was working at that time that used to be almost a fair game then Ben Shapiro started complaining then you start having like Josh Holly and all those people stop myself there they Al I'll start doing their hearings and all of a sudden Ben Shapiro gets like seven out of 10 of like all the hits on Facebook news and now even the decisions Facebook is making like saying oh we're going to deprioritize news or you have to like opt into seeing political content that it's like you know being silent being you know I'm forgetting the quote but like being silent during Injustice you or were you silenced exactly and so I think there's all these factors I don't think that's again it's very much a both and I don't think these are in um consequence but we need to think big about building institutions that are away from these platforms as much as possible and then using the power of our audiences to um grow them and build those power ourselves and I'm I'm happy to please that like in this environment where we've gotten um you know media just gutted like papers of record gutted uh Amazon owned by billionaires that say you can't make endorsements last minute Lo um sorry Washington Post uh LA Times also went by billionaires who cut off endorsements in the last minute like these are forces that it's you know it suckss that a lot of these journalists are losing jobs but I'm happy that you're getting a lot of these platforms that are now run by journalists that are worker owned that are building their platforms and I hope they all succeed I hope this kind of stuff succeeds because we're definitely going to need it for the next couple uh to jump off of what you were saying there are a lot of tools at the disposal of uh of the GOP of the Republican party that are not at the disposal of uh the Democratic party or the left in any sense and I think that that also extends to just the tactics that you're allowed to use um there isn't an answer for you know somebody who can stretch the truth indefinitely I mean there are plenty of lies and plenty of uh Hal truths and untruths um from the Democratic party uh but but they can't they can't do it on the scale that that the right does uh it just it doesn't uh facts don't matter anymore and that used to be our strength like the truth used to be um the truth used to be powerful and uh that power is is slowly waning people don't care about it as much you go answer that no you should finish I hear your point because you were about to say it I'm like people don't care about it's also like yeah people really don't care about it anymore right like not for nothing I was I was very sickened on on uh yesterday about how many people like let me know like what I all year is frustrated with all the work like all the content specifically and this isn't just my experience like every Creator I know that does this kind of creation and this kind of work and advocacy has been complaining about it all year that all the content that you do specifically about trying to debunk this misinformation or educate people about the election or the threat to project 2025 or why voting they're not watching it like your audience is actively avoiding it like [ __ ] just the algorithm they won't consume it like they will comment like I'm not watching that I don't want to know they they actively they do not want you to tell them something that dispels you know what I mean what it is um that they're so so that's the thing right it's like you can make this [ __ ] but if they won't watch it you know how many people commented on on my um videos like all my project 2025 videos my voting videos all my takes that they wouldn't they didn't watch saying ah this my first day watching I'm sad to say I'm shocked by what project like they they chose not to watch it like I find it interesting that like my my video my video s my whole documentary on why you should vote in the election and stuff 85,000 views right next one like maybe like same thing 50,000 38,000 whatever my video about the loss and the tragedy and feelings and all we feeling like now that it has happened more than half a million views you see what I'm saying it's like this is this trend of like I feel like people never want to listen or get involved when we can actually do something preventative like everybody always wants to react respond you know what I mean and I I feel like that that's the thing I I think that's the thing that plagues Us in so much of our work and movement work and Justice and all this in general because it's always like think about like I think about this in the context of like the issues I care about like criminal justice police brutality whatever what always would stress me out is people always would act like the solutions what we should be trying to do is what you do after someone is killed by the police and never what to do to prevent it right it's always after after after people always want to respond to [ __ ] but they never want to avoid the Calamity and like do that preventative work and it like I don't know what to do because I don't know if that's something that's just true about human nature because I think I think it is on some level like as a lawyer that always say is like a lawyer is best served to you in a preventative capacity like there's no special magical lawyer that will change the facts of this case or if you confess or if they have the evidence or whatever right like a lawyer is best served to tell you before hand why you shouldn't do something cuz how the law will play out or why it work but people don't listen to their lawyers in the preventative capacity you know what I mean they come to you they want you for after there's a problem so I don't know I don't think it's something that's just like a problem we have you know on the left or you know what I mean or anything I think it I think it's a human thing we that that we might be dealing with but I don't know that's I think your point is like your point is super valid I I agree with you so I I think that um God it's there's also this this very real thing that you have folks who are exhausted you have folks who are marginalized who don't or feel like they don't have the capacity to take in anymore right because there's plenty of people who are preventative they just are the people that are the halves you they're very preventative they're very proactive Elon Musk was proactive as hell in this election Elon Musk said if I if I invest 50 million plus dollars into this I will get it back tenfold and in the first day he gained 26 billion do he has SP to be proactive and it's even higher now yeah and I and I wanted to I just want to say while we on that how many the stocks have shot up on like jails and prison you know what I group all the way up all of that because they're preparing they're preparing for all of these policies that are about to go into place they're already creating in concentration camps for migrants in Texas the contracts are going through right and so there is this we are in this place where people don't necessarily want the information right there has to be a way to disseminate it I I I remember watching Mark Lamont Hill who pissed me off greatly and I have great respect for Mark shout out the Philly but he was pissing me the off during this election season like shut the [ __ ] up bro you did did this before shut up but to there's also and also the Democratic party is made up of folks who have moral compasses right who are critical thinkers and who can Envision more right and so you have some folks who are just tired and they're like help me out in the now I need my eggs to be cheaper okay okay and then you have other folks who are like I can afford the eggs we need to imagine something else for ourselves what about Palestine what about Sudan what about Congo and the strategy is missing from this party there's there's we again it's not a love letter to say kamla Harris is the greatest most upstanding human being in the world that's not what it means to vote right it's just the messaging is just not strategic mark lont same dude on his site was like yo I don't want to talk about Diddy's case but guess what that gets my numbers up and then I can talk about the other [ __ ] and educate folks every night you know on whatever his night school there is a game that you have to play there is a push and pull and there there is a duality that has to be had that I just don't know that they have the right voices behind the like in at the room in the table excuse me at the table like I don't know if they really know how to do this thing but I also am frustrated because there's so many people within the party with varying opinions and that makes for great democracy yes but it doesn't make for great strategy when you're trying to present someone to the nation to vote for and that like what everybody said that's what the Republicans do best they will fight behind closed doors it's like two parents we're not arguing in front of the kids especially especially when that someone that we're bringing on like to the National stage is also like a black woman right like and I think especially when we're bringing somebody onto the national stage with like what 110 days or however long she was like on the campaign Trail like the shortest presidential campaign in history like I I I think I I think I think we don't we don't have a real I think you know what the I think the truth of the matter has been staring Us in the face all the time and we all know it right like at the end like it isn't as complicated as we think it is you know the right is united in white supremacy it's very easy when you have one agenda and it's defeat them your agenda is defeat them you know what I mean is [ __ ] them other any any group that is other and there are certain groups and we see who they are we can see the demographics that believe that they they believe that they can vote themselves they can align themselves they can friend themselves they can whatever themselves into whiteness they are wrong they are deluded they are misled they are under the impression that they won't suffer the consequences but that is what it is that's what they're aligned in right I don't know if it's white supremacy because they don't give a [ __ ] about those poor white people they don't but that but them but but they right like we've still included into the they Aspire Aspire these people poor white people don't give a [ __ ] about poor white people either because they they they they buy into white supremacy and they look down on them and they believe and they like the idea of Elon Musk and Donald Trump and these people because they think that's what I was saying earlier that's cast that's capitalism exactly and they think they can be them the difference is like the left is is not united we are all truly a bunch of different like we have entirely different views agendas groups feelings Dynamics just all under a giant political umbrella and that and that and that is the problem we can't unite to do anything because we don't agree like there are people like there there are people that fundamentally believe like they are not they're not there to defeat Donald Trump and they're not necessarily there to accomplish anything for any group they're there to defeat the Democrats like they their number one agenda is hating the Democrats I want to defeat the Democrats I must end the duopoly I need revenge on the Democrats and that's their agenda right then there are other groups who like I want I don't want a progressive new future on the left I want yesterday I want us to go back to a time before people were being Wild on the right da then there are the people on the left that are like I want further I want more of a progressive future I want you know what I mean and I think and then within that group it splinters off into 10 different serious different viewpoints and how we get there so it's like and I've just named a couple of different major ways in which we can't get on page and there's so many so so so many down the list like we love to believe like okay we're all like these marginalized groups and we all come in there we understand but it's not true even within all of our groups we have strong different beliefs viewpoints prees we don't feel united we don't all you know what I mean so it's just like yeah it makes sense you're not going to be able to a hundred different groups that that don't see eye to eye that don't like each other necessarily that see the other groups as hindering them from getting what they want to get are not going to be able to fight against one just ah I don't care about facts I don't care about truth I don't give a [ __ ] who he I don't care if he go to jail I don't give a [ __ ] what Insurrection there was I don't give a fck what happens to you [ __ ] all y'all this is my team and I am here to defeat you you can't beat that if the other side is like I'm not a we're not a team I don't even believe you're on my te I don't believe you're on my team you're not really on my team you say you're on my team but you're not you're not for real you're not the for real you're over there here to be this is my team and I'm oh we're all this is my team and I'm here to to defeat you so that I can maintain control and the power that I already have then you have the Democrats who the way that you dismantle that is you can't then want that same power right you can't then want to replace white supremacy with some other form of Supremacy so the way that you dismantle that is to dismantle this cast system which is anti-c capitalist but they will never do that because then they're going to be the big big bad socialists which was was wild to me so many people were ping and saying that the biggest fear of theirs and the thing that they were voting for was to protect democracy and I thought that it was people trying to protect democracy from Trump but it was Trump supporters trying to protect democracy from socialism because they want to maintain whatever power they think they have these poor white people at least I'm not black and that's how they feel it's it's so rooted in this and it I to me it made it so clear that like this [ __ ] is never going to work as long as we are rooted in this cast system because all we're going to be trying to do is to replace Massa with another Massa and the [ __ ] don't work like that that ain't Freedom no and the thing the real the reality is I think as well is like we are going to be in the conditions where we will have no choice but to be activated now which is going to be super interesting because normally movements are created during Democratic leaders Reigns like BLM Democrats historically this is when we are creating these movements and when it is other folks when it is Republicans we are now reactionary but that's when we begin to see the more radical voices come about and we can look at 2020 for example this is when we are getting into more of like the left this the defund the police we're getting all into this stuff because there is no choice because we have now met another extreme on the complete other side and so what I look at just like the humanity of it all is the reality is we don't want preventative measures many people don't want preventative measures because they can't feel that they need to be able to react because in those moments humans can feel the reaction we can feel the quick things that we need to put into place and if I can't feel that at my doorstep right now it doesn't matter but the reality is people have been so duped because we're not looking at the slow painful drip of capitalism we're not looking at this whole painful drip of how these policies impact this because we are just going through day to day to day right and because we are going through that in such a slow it feels like a slow way we don't realize all those little pin are now adding up to a bloody back I that's why I'm just like I think also as we are looking at that slow drip that's what the Republicans actually were able to achieve was that slow drip of messaging and being able to change the culture and I I say it all the time culture shifts before policy does culture shifted which is now why we Cann now look at the frustration that folks are feeling about this fox trans people are taking over type situation they're not worried about straight men anymore they're not worried about this anymore this all of this language has been there and we saw the first huge like digital iter iteration of it through the manosphere right and so now it is like these ideas of people need to be put back into social order the reality is we see this what happened from the enlightenment period that went right back to the uh restorative age age of restoration because we went from Progressive thought and back to the church it's the ways in which that culture has historically shifted every single time and I think we are now witnessing it and now taking it out of theory is now the fact that people have bought into this Republican code and this idea of restoring social order that anything that feels like progress means that the binary is Left Behind that means that what we knew that was supposed to be markers of success now that goal poost have shifted so what people are feeling on an emotional standpoint is that oh I can't compete in this new world that these Democrats or progressives are trying to create because that world is not one that I know that's not the world that was sold to me that's the reality because when I'm sitting there talking to people the anxiety yeah it's work it's um making sure I got money to make sure I can be a provider I can do all this stuff and it's also that space of like oh this person is validating me in a ways in which that I need quick that quick validation I don't care about the other people because who cares about me and so I think from a Humane standpoint that's what that is and I think the preventative measure I'll get into a little later but it is having to now attack the RO because it is something to say of us being really and I said it myself and I I eat my words I was excited for Gen Z to be the first group of Voters for this being one of the first national elections is because I was like oh everybody's saying that gen Z is much more Progressive come to find out they either didn't get up or they also lean towards Trump as well and so I thought it was like a really really interesting piece and so I'm even like thinking around that a lot so uh thanks Nick all to you oh yeah just to jump off what you were saying about um the like slow drip the the the the the the snowball you know before you realize your your back's covered in blood um one of the re one of the ways that we play into that is um we have and and it's it's not our fault but it's something we're manipulated into is that we there are so many marginalized communities that have been unheard for so long that um when it comes to when it comes time to collectivize especially around election season um there's uh it's imp it's almost impossible to prioritize it's almost impossible to uh to have everyone feel like uh they're being Hur and they're getting what they want out of it because um everybody is forced to make concessions because of years and years and decades and centuries of neglect um one thing that we all get taught uh from you know our our our youth is um we got to try twice as hard uh to get half as much um I don't think that that's something that the current Democratic establishment fully understands trying to run a candidate like KLA Harris against a candidate like Donald Trump um I do think it's evidence that you know a lot of the diversity that has been espoused by uh the left is superficial because [Music] um I they needed to understand how dire and how hard they were going to have to work and I uh especially at the 11th hour or you know as as rather as late into an American campaign season as they did um yeah I mean 10 to 15,000 not showing up that's um that's almost suspiciously wild to me yeah or million yeah million that's wild so what do we do cuz I we can point out all the problems but it's like I heard Mar has some has has some one weird trick as an artist as an artist I do think that there is there I think there has to be some sort of uh there has to be something attractive like something uh there has to be something that has an equal but Oppo opposite poll to Donald Trump it has to uh it has to to to to quote chich and Chong it needs to appeal in the same way but different it needs to be the same but different we need to figure out how to Galvanize people in the way that that idiot has well I think it's the reality is he speaks to the every man right that's the reality and so though he does not personally identify with the every man that every man aspires to him and I think that's where the ba the imbalance becomes and so if we're asking like where do we go from here the reality is what it's funny I was just thinking about the other day I was like oh you had people talking on stage that nobody like you didn't have storytellers on stage to talk around how the Biden Harris admin actually did a lot of stuff because my family from the south actually felt the effects of their policies right I think us being in cities well I'm assuming most of us are in cities um us being in cities we may not see that right away because we already feel protected because we're already in these more Progressive spaces right um and so I think when you're asking around like where do we go from here and what Solutions are the reality is you we need to point out every single pain point that people feel during this Trump presidency that's coming up and making sure that when we speak to those things here are the solutions to these things because now you're going to have to react because now that you have a cut you need a Band-Aid if um Democrats these Progressive parties are not able to articulate that in a ways in which that appeals to the emotions that appeals to what people are feeling right away we're never going to do that because again people don't want prevention or uh yeah people don't want to be like preemptive with that they want to be reactive though people don't want to be proactive there we go um but I think the reality is we have to on Strate political strategist organizers ends the work is it it's already been happening but the work is goes into overdrive now and so the messaging that people are feeling and I and I'm lucky enough to like live in Philly where it's like we have the working family party and we have Democrats right and so in that space the Working Families party talked around like rent um diversion diversion programs which me people got to stay in their homes people I know personally benefited from those programs right and so when I'm looking at those kind of things if you don't know how to communicate and articulate those things to every person who is actually feeling what Kendra Brooks did for Philly then that's where if they're not going to follow seat on that that's where Democrats are going to continue to lose that's where we will not be able to see that because again we're going to allow these folks who voted for Trump to Aspire to something that they will never achieve however on our on our end back here on the ground we now have to do that kind of education where they see us as regular people they don't speak above their heads we are talking to them and meeting them where they're at and it's annoying because this then requires Us in some cases to have to take the moral High Ground because we know that in the work of progress and activism people do not imagine the future that we are able to see or see or foresee and if we don't know how to communicate that in every day then it switches people said Maris you got me to be able to vote because you talk to me directly and then you could also articulate why these pain points would be even worse under Trump and again I'm not saying everybody is able to do that because I recognize even with a platform I still have to leave this square that I do my podcast on that we talk on these panels on and they have to feel it that way and so I realize I'm like yeah not everybody's listening to podcast that's the reality not everybody's watching my show that's the reality but people see me every single day the [ __ ] on the stoop um Claud at the bodega Mr Jim down the street Aunt Sheila down the street like I know my neighbors that can get them activated and so I think it's that that point of just continuing to build the community with people that you trust because people in this election look to me to figure out like oh Maris like what should I be doing and I'm like I hate that like we're a deciding factor because they see us as people of influence but they see people that they feel morally aligned to as well and so as we are thinking around these next four years as black people I keep saying we got to figure out our Ten Commandments that we want Go fool black pant there on them that we are not willing to like waver on there are things that are going to [ __ ] up in like the little splinters here and there but if we are all committed to 10 things that we need as a community in order to survive and thrive that's what I think we need to be able to articulate right away from building out those spaces and values then we can translate those things in the policy but we need to articulate those values and think around it like a teacher here's the objective how do we reach that objective the Democratic party needs that yes that's exactly what they need as a whole because right now they don't have it it's like when black lives matter came out and everybody was calling it flawed because they didn't have what do you want what do you asking for what is the thing and they came out with it but it's just like when I'll never Van van recently asked me what version what what does the your ideal version of America look like and I couldn't answer it he said so what the are you on here talking about and fighting for do you even know you gotta get specific because you can't how and I think we all do go ahead Olay I was gonna say see I I know the things I want I like know exactly what my agenda is how I have the world like like what like you know and I was originally when I I thought this world I thought K was I I originally my original first first first take was the correct one in terms of what happened but I let everybody convince me she was so then I thought she was going to win so I when I thought my original intent I thought my you know at my postelection thoughts video was going to be about telling people to really sit and come up with what it is that you want and where that happens at and how you organize about that and like really think about that and then I decided I don't give a what anybody does anymore and you know all of that like I'm noty ain't no room for that girl oh you know what I an immigrant and there is like I I've I've actually had this country announced to me far too many times they hate immigrants for me to keep like stressing myself out and giving myself a life of chronic illness and anxiety and overworking myself thinking that you know whatever you know what I mean like have at it it's your it's your [ __ ] you know um that's another tricky thing that's a thing that's happening online right now you see all the these threads of white it's coming from the wrong group okay these white women are pissed off the black women are saying like y'all got it y'all figured the [ __ ] out don't count on us anymore and they're like what do you mean we're going to need you midterms of this the that and it's like so but it I hear that I do because I feel that and then there's also this well I gotta live in this country though or I don't but I am currently so what do I do I've always had to live in this country I've as as an immigrant I've always had to live in this country where there is no advocate for me or anything ever changes for me I've been like there never like again I and I talked about this in my episode that came out today I've never advocated for thing I've never made my platforms or anything that I do about advocating for the things that would actually help me as an immigrant of a particular status and no one else ever has and that has always been fine for me I've always lived my life in this country in service to others into into larger groups that hate my guts um and I've actually had enough and I think it and I think it's fair and fine you know what I mean like I I think if people tell you enough I'm hated by every every side like you know what I mean like like every side the hatred that's had for immigrants and everybody finds what they believe is a nuanced reason to justif justify their hatred their hatred of immigrants but that is what it is and like I'm like you know what respectfully when I think about it I've like literally stressed myself clear the out trying to figure out how you convince people to do things that benefit them you know what I mean like I'm like all right this is a nation full of people of more say than me this is this is their country they let me know all the time they they have an ability to vote they have the ability to actually change things all I could do is talk they they they took with the power and the choices that they have and the and this is actively what they wanted so from my from my perspective it's like what exactly am I am I doing what am i g I'm keep gang banging to people about what they should do you know what I mean when they know exactly consciously what it is that they're doing what they want and why they want it and who they don't like meanwhile I'm off to like deal with the Wrecking and the ruins of of my own of of how immigrants are attacked with no with no assistance no help and my brand like and the thing about immigration like not only does everybody hate immigrants and everybody attack immigrants but nobody the majority of immigrants are forgotten to America America thinks that American propaganda around immigration is that immigrants are just undocumented immigrants at the border which which is enough to Galvanize the right to hate enough for the progressives to think they only they're only it's only Progressive the progressive agenda is to only care about undocumented immigrants and pretend as though anybody who's not an undocumented immigrant is all good they're safe they call you the bis the this that meanwhile the majority of immigrants in this country are not at the border the majority of immigrants in this country are not undocumented the majority of undocumented immigrants are not are are didn't into this country as undocumented immigrants they were they are people who came as documented immigrants and became Visa overstates so if everybody has the attitude the entire other side give a [ __ ] about all immigrants and the other side like has it in their mind that the only ones who matter because that's what feels Progressive that's that's a narrative they like they like to be like oh they're in cages they're in this and then they paint everybody else as though you don't have an issue because they don't know about their immigration system they don't realize they have an immigration system that makes it impossible to do it the right way to remain legally to work to make money to do all these things and they don't care it doesn't sound it doesn't sound exciting it doesn't sound depressed enough for them so no one gives a and like I'm I'm just like at this point I I can't keep I can't keep fighting black people to not support a criminal system that wants to incar that has that is is working against us I can't convince Latinos not to vote for white supremacist whose main agenda is to get them the [ __ ] out of here you can't convince women or at least white women in the rest of them right it wasn't even just white women Native American women Lino women they all voted this way wrot it crazy um you can't seem to convince them that they're you know what I mean these so it's like what am I what am I talking about at this point like like respectfully it's like I I I was explaining to my my boyfriend today because they were talking about how you're seeing all the people like me like oh seeing all my other Creator friends and stuff saying the same thing online like I'm done I'm [ __ ] it you know what I mean have at it y y y and I was like respectfully like if you think about it it isn't just like like for for the rest of us it's not just like Donald Trump comma lost but it's like we all got fired too right if the entire if if our job is to be thought leaders or to persuade people over to the left and to in inform people in all of this and the entire country swings right didn't we all failed to they fired us that's the way I feel they decided they they they elected Trump they gave him the courts they give him the house they gave him the Senate and they rejected Progressive initiatives criminal justice and and and and across the aisle every Progressive [ __ ] just across the country they fired us so to me it's not about us saying oh I I'm not going to do it anymore they fired us they made it very clear the least of what the they want to hear is from us so who am I to keep trying to like literally making myself ill like I'm a 31 year old woman with three chronic illnesses how the [ __ ] did that happen you know what I mean autoimmune disorders whooping my ass over the last like year and some change for why to tell to tell other people to tell other Americans who have more privileges than me to do to do something with them like have at it have at it like I feel like at this point like at this point I keep finding myself in a shitty situation because I spend my time advocating for everybody else but me and then at the ninth hour those everybody else who spent all their time letting me know they hate me as an immigrant leave me in the cold so the way I feel about it is let them have The Advocates they want let them listen to what it is that they want let people figure it out themselves because it isn't a lack it isn't a m a lack of doing on our part and people like to say like they they say you know they make it seem like the left doesn't like we don't do anything you don't try we don't try to you know reach out to people and do all this and that's not true you know what I mean there's there they're like we like sure I'm sure like people will there's never there's always a problem with a me there's always a problem with the tone of a message you don't want to hair you know what I'm saying like when you try to educate people they say you're speaking above them it's too it's too boring it's too nerdy you're not meeting them where where they at right if you if you try to to talk to them like meet them where they at that's the problem too why you the chamber room that's not where you're supposed to be you you know what I mean that's not how supposed to be like people will tell you in the same breath that people tell you that uh like your tone isn't polite enough or whatever have you whenever you're educating people on the side of the left they will love Charleston whites and Donald Trumps and Joe Rogan's and every kind of abrasive you know what I mean figure whatever the race so it's [ __ ] it is [ __ ] they always move the goal post and find a reason because the reality is fundamentally they don't [ __ ] with these group they don't [ __ ] with people they don't like who they deem as other they don't like marginalized that's why you keep hearing people say stupid [ __ ] like oh they they're not about the straight men and the this and the blah what the does that mean what does that mean like what does that mean literally my eyes literally what they all they're actually saying is I don't appreciate that you're in any way doing anything for those other groups and I take you doing something for those other groups as not doing for me as taking from me and it's that simple to me like I'm like you know I'm how do we appeal to that though like if we lost and if we got fired how do we now you know like a lot what do we do if we got fired damn keep going I don't know that's L that's literally my question because like I think mariso saying something interesting that like about like how there was a way that the left didn't catch a lot of this you know Manis feere um misogyny uh you know racism at the front or at least you know approached it differently to me I'm always wondering look I'm never going to start caping or like uh go against any of these Val that I developed for a long time but I want to be a effective communicator and like you know try to you know win people over at this point I don't think I'm going to win over like Trump people but I can at least get people who are disaffected who are unactivated maybe more on my side but they're still you know susceptible to a lot of that propaganda too so I'm curious to anyone how how do we approach that and I think Nick kind of alluded to some of it earlier and I had to write his point down but it was like the the role of art and culture that's also I know it sounds a little woo woo but the role of art and culture is still important in the times of that ultimately we're going to end up in are the times of consistent Rebellion for the next four years for the next eight years highkey um and some but in those moments it is like we need to continue to tell stories that highlight these other things I think often times and even I'm connecting your question and even what Olay was saying is like it's the single narrative that happens every single time that does not allow people to empathize or be in community with whether it's Paras socially or actually in person the reality is we're so hyper individualized in terms of how we approach things the algorithm only tells us one thing that we would like to see after we like something right and so even in that our tunnel vision happens here our ability to see other perspectives happens here and honestly I look at it from even a literacy rate I they're not so they can't even think around like how do I get entertained into having a catharus to empathize with a character that I as imaginary so yeah and so I'm just like there is a diminishing of arts and culture which will then move us into we have to just go for the money for the money for the money and so the lack of stories that are being told around particular experiences and that then supersedes which is what happens to the fear is how they enact the fearmonger because any of us can be like child that is not every that if they look at me and be like you were a singular gay experience and this is how we're going to look that's never going to be it right I was like I'm not that right there are multiple experiences and being able to see a rounded out idea if they're just like anet is the only woman I've ever interacted with they're only going to think anet is the only person she represents all women at this point in time right and so it's annoying but on our end some of the things that we have to think around is consistently having to and it's annoying because it feels like we have to justify our humanity and get in people to like look at it but I think it is like oh we have to go back to the basics and teach people empathy we have to teach people these things the ones who are too far gone cooked but the people that I think we can do the prevention stuff with I think absolutely have the capacity to change it just hurts right now that we were screwed over in this moment and so it's still I'm annoyingly optimistic that we still have the power to change people and prevent this in the future I know I'm I know I said I'm here um but I think I look at it because I have to do Youth Development and I can't in my everyday job lose hope for my kids who looked at me and were just like I saw you do this thing and I'm just like did you change and so I'm like in this space yeah I hate to be a negative Debbie Downer type [ __ ] but I guess that is where I'm at today right everybody's allow to process the way they got to process I think here's here's my thing right like if we're if we're being honest with ourselves oh I I hate to be a [ __ ] killing people's inspiration good but if your if our agenda was to move forward right like if that's what we want our lifetime let let me just say I start from the place of like a Derek Bell critical race theorist of I believe in the permanence of racism like I don't believe that we're ever going to ER eradicate racism or all these systems in my life right so there was always a there was always awareness that I'm doing whatever little I can to move us towards a massive Vision that I do not expect to be realized in my life in my lifetime but I was at least trying to move us a little bit forward towards that the reality is the more the country swings not just swings to the to the far right but dismantles the institutions and then the little privileges that you had that you didn't think were enough the work that you will do now will just be trying to to save some of that or get some of that back so we are in fact not moving forward like even your best case scenario our best case scenario is what Donald Trump is going we we know exactly what the he's gonna do like you're it's not it's not hyperbole it's not suspicion it's not anything we about to enter a dark time and anybody who's deluding them themselves into believing otherwise the joke will be on you child like we are that man has they they have a plan they have a agenda and they have everything lined up to do it there is no roadblock in front of them to stop them they a checks and balance they have the court they have the house they have the Senate he can do whatever the [ __ ] he wants right and like most of the groups that he really wants to Target and stuff do he damn sure can do whatever he want so like the t is your our best case scenario if it goes the best it can for us right is that this country that will move into far right extremism the best case scenario scario of us being successful is successful enough to get them close enough to a liberal status quo that we were already trying to move against that that is our best case scenario successful you're not going to swing them all the way back to the left so I hate to say it's like oh is there hope if if you consider the the the yesterday we thought was terrible you know what I mean like like to the idea of my best amount of hope is to move towards that from the far right that we're going to get Dr Kicking and Screaming it too until we get a Time [ __ ] I hear you Olay I do I think it I think you deserve rest I think you deserve um to feel how you feel I'll never invalidate that um I think you have a very unique experience here um what I will say is for me personally if you going to shoot me I ain't going to be on my knees ever so I'll tell you this if I got if if I'm fighting you and I lose an arm then I'm still fighting you until I'm gone period And so um yeah I'm going to join the Working Families call at 8 o00 I'm going to hear what the hell they have to say but that's because I have capacity for it love and that's not to shame anybody or anything work their asses off yeah that's cuz I have capacity for it and I can understand people who the f don't I also understand that there is privilege that I have I I'm looking at this I'm not an immigrant I got a white mom look there's certain privileges that I have and so it's time for folks who have capacity to let other folks rest and do what needs to be done but I'll say this you're not nobody what my hope is that nobody would ever watch what's happening and give up you know you got Palestinians who are watching everything be decimated around them and they still have a will to live and so we I what I want to encourage people is to have a will to live to have a will to be liberated and to be courageous enough to IM imagine and work towards something else always well that sounds like a word sis that sounds like the end of an episode that's be [Music]
