Saying you want Jews or other people groups to die isn't attempting to kill Jews. And before you talk about threats of violence, yes, if someone were to say that they were going to kill Jews they should be arrested for that because that is a *direct threat of violence.* However using the excuse that because someone believes in the Nazi ideology as a pretext to take action, is declaring someone guilty of a crime they have not committed and technically haven't stated that they're going to commit, which goes against the major *left wing* judicial practice of innocent until proven guilty of the crime they are being prosecuted for, which in this case would be genocide. B. Even if you believe in locking someone up for speech, I hardly see how that excuses violence. Violence is an appropriate response to violence, but not to speech. If Richard Spencer and his goons were to go out and start attempting genocide, then you could go use all the violence you want to counteract that, hell, I'd join you.",

        "text": "I mostly don't see how people believe in the \"tolerance paradox\" when it comes to free speech, or in general. The \"tolerance paradox\" states that \"if a society is tolerant without limit, its ability to be tolerant will eventually be seized or destroyed by the intolerant.\" If we are talking about speech specifically here, speech isn't intolerance, the speech of those that are intolerant is a symptom of intolerance. You don't cure a cold by suppressing the desire to sneeze, in fact it can make your cold worse because you're bottling up the virus inside of yourself, which is kind of analogous to real life as I'll touch on in a bit. Regardless, being tolerant of speech isn't being \"infinitely tolerant\" in any event anyway. No one on the left who talks in favor of free speech is in favor of tolerating, say, hate crimes. \nSpeech in and of itself is not harmful in any tangible way. Though it can affect the way affect the way people think and, potentially, act, if you want to restrict free speech because free speech can lead to authoritarianism, then you are yourself advocating for a paradox: \"In order to be anti-authoritarian we must be authoritarian.\" \nThis being said, I did say \"mostly don't understand\" in the beginning because I do understand and agree with why someone would want so criminalize, say, a direct threat of violence, because A. it is pretty much always clear what is and what isn't a direct threat of violence, and B. a direct threat is a statement of intent for criminal wrongdoing, intent being integral to how and with what crime you charge someone  in the first place.\nI believe however that ultimately restricting speech in cases other than threats of violence aren't helpful to society in any real way, and only fuel the right-wing victim narrative, and when they are being charged, they're technically right, as they are being persecuted over free speech in those instances.\nAnother funny thing about the \"tolerance paradox\" is that it is essentially right wing tribalistic thinking. A right winger could easily apply this \"paradox\" to entire populations, saying \"if we're tolerant of people who are intolerant (i.e. Muslims, in their thinking), then we'll be destroyed by them.\"",

As opposed to fear and subjugation which is what happens when you start throwing people in cages. More so for simply saying words, especially if those words are tantamount to enough is enough of this bs, stop or else. Cause if the person allows violence to occur after being warned it will happen, clearly has no comprehension of respect. Even only that respect is of the situation one finds himself in. This isn't anything new. This is the basis of our most everlasting social contract (which would greatly benefit from an affirmation once again).

In particular the popularly circulated comic does not include this, and I think it kind of misrepresents his point as a result.  I know as a concept it's used more broadly by a wide variety of people, though, and not all of them may share his initial thesis.\n\nAlthough I think a few of the others in this thread go too far, there is a point in saying that suppression of dissenting ideas (even focusing on bigotry or disinformation) can as easily be turned on us and our beliefs by those who don't share them.  Unfortunately it's difficult to determine when speech is revealing the brink of violent or authoritarian action, and yet if it's not taken into account it can be too late.  At the least, I think it's important to cultivate minds critical about these tactics so they can see through them, rather than trying to silence those who espouse them...

And also to question whether something's right or whether there are other, faster, better ways to do things. \nThat's valuable for many companies. So I'm in online marketing spending a lot of time analyzing performance data, which has nothing to do with linguistics, but believe me: Staying up to date in this quickly changing business and explaining the changes to colleagues and customers is what I do really, really well. Oh, and I also write a lot of how-tos etc. Because seriously - learning how online marketing works isn't rocket science, it took me about 3 months for the basics and another 6 months to get the practice right. Since then it's just improvement. It doesn't require years of university, it's mostly statistics and a little bit of math and a lot of psychology.",

To start off, I don't know all the specifics of why he's been banned, though i know it involved the Sandy Hook shooting and claiming that the parents were paid actors. Since he's defaming those people, I actually agree that the video should be pulled down. Should he be banned though? Imagine Alex Jones was sued for this (and I'm pretty sure he was) and the prosecution won, as they should, but the decision wasn't just that Jones should be punished for what he said, but should also be banned from speaking or in any way communicating in public. That's essentially what happened to him, just on social media. Furthermore, after Jones' banning from multiple social media sites, there's been a massive increase in the suspension, pulling down, and banning of political content and politically involved users and pages, both left and right. Turns out when you give silicon valley oligarchs an inch on whether they can restrict what you say online, they take a mile. This is also why I'm not in favor of the government criminalizing any speech other than defamation/slander (and only in cases where the victim is tangibly negatively affected), and  *direct* threats of violence. I don't exactly trust the government to tell people what is and isn't acceptable speech, *especially* the US government.",

    "text": "In regards to the question from the recent left-leaning individual in a conservative household:\r\nI definitely agree with your response, not only does genuinely listening to the views they put forward help to create a dialogue of respect, it also allows you to better assess and address their points as time goes on.  If they're out and out not interested in discussion though, it'll be rough either way.\r\n\r\nI'd also say to remember that the political dimension of a person is only one dimension of a person, even if it may impact others.  Even if it's not possible to agree on issues of principles or politics, there are other places still to find common ground if you so desire--which by the question, it sounds like they do.  For me at least, this has also been true outside of my family, as I've grown up in a relatively conservative community, and have had a good share of conservative friends, while I myself am left (and look the lefter still in my home country of the US...)  If we engaged purely on topics of politics there would have been little to keep us in touch, but we shared various other interests and activities, and over the course of some years of discourse better came to understand one another's positions, even if there was rarely much in the way of concessions more than the minor (with only one notable exception I can recall.)\n\nAs you said, it's hard to say anything without knowing more about their specific situation, but I guess the question made me reflect on my own experiences.",

Before I subbed I wanted to check out your channel more and this seemed like the most logical choice to get a feel for it. I was very surprised on how many political stances you and I disagree on. I’m not really a fan of political labels but I suspect you would think of me as “right” or “ant-sjw”. Though in today’s climate I could understand you feeling that way, I believe you would be wrong. The closest I would label myself would be libertarian, but I don’t really fit there either. Anyway the reason I explained that is to give more context to why I subbing and looking forward to more content. You are confident in your beliefs, able to articulate them and distinguish between facts and opinions. Plus, like me you are a fan of history, particularly the world wars, I am always up for learning something new. It is such a touchy topic in current political times and propaganda is everywhere.

    "text": "Sadly I could not find the person who commented and asked for your opinion on studying histoy. Therefore I like to give a \"professional\" (really big air quotes since I am just starting writing my PhD) opinion on it. The most valuable thing to have if you want to study history and even consider going into that direction professionally (PhD for teaching/research at university and/or working in adjected fields) is the ability to read a lot and read in many different languages. For example already for modern history if you are not a German or French nativ speaker many fields can be quiet difficult to handle (source-wise and literature-wise). If you already have a field of interest you want to study, like lets say communism, it might be necessary to even study something that is often refered to as an \"area-study\" in combination with history (like Sinology for Communist China or Slavistic for the Sowjet Union). \n\nThe point I want to make is: Studying history to not only be a teacher but an actual researcher requires one to learn some kind of special language ability to stand out and then apply this ability to reading lots of stuff. Daniels suggestion ties into that too: It is firstly necessary to read several different publications (also in differently languages, since there are some big differences between the national discourses on most topics) to understand the academic discourse(s) and then judge the first hand accounts (which is stricly speaking only considered a source in history) with your own philological and theoretical tools. Therefore I would always suggest fellow students to pick up some special field of interest and maybe even couple it with a second degree in the appropriate language. (You can still learn languages late - its just more costly).",

Another one:- if this question is not the right question to ask vis a vis the problems of Venezuela and Zimbabwe; what IS the right question? Is the right question \"how can Venezuela rid itself of all the bad people who obstruct the first ever successful planned economy\"? Are questions about price controls and capital flight and inflation questions that only wicked people ask? If a socialist asked these questions ( in hope of an answer) would that turn them into a hateful wicked bad person? How do economies work? How can wealth be created and how can it be shared? Are these questions only evil people ask?",

But I disagree that communism isn't prevalent enough for us to acknowledge it. We currently have 2 \"soviet republics\" in Ukraine, Venezuela collapsing under the current regime. I have classmates in grad school openly praising Lenin, Stalin, Mao, and even somehow Pol Pot (they lose any right to claim to be good people, especially with that last one). They spend their time making jokes about people pointing out the atrocities committed by the USSR, they out right deny the genocides, say the Gulags weren't that bad, etc... In a way extremely reminiscent of Holocaust deniers. Their antifa(TM) buddies openly call for violent revolution (\"nothing can change without bloodshed\", \"The Bourgeois must all be killed\", etc...). They really have a wish of power and control, they don't even pretend not to be authoritarians.\n\nWhile I find the collectivist concept of communism to be something that could be good in a small community, naive for a small society, and outright dumb for large societies, I have nothing against it. I do have something against people who defend monsters and genocides, whatever side of the political spectrum they are on.",

Their only purpose is to hold your attention and so, keep your eyes on the screen. This is what drives the polarization of everything, which is ripping the world in half. This is why each side of any issue thinks the other side must be insane. You literally do not see what your opponent is consuming. He never sees where your ideas come from. Go study at a library. Physical books on shelves do not have an algorithm.",

I see nonpartisan blank unfiltered youtube every day in working towards this endeavour in trying to figure out what combination of settings or behaviours triggers it suddenly not working as intended. And on boxes where I've not looked at a single video, I see the bigger left-wing channels show up, but the so called \"alt-right\" stuff never finds its way to the front page, or when it does it's a TYT vid critical of Milo. I know how echo chambers work. And I'm pretty sure the narrative of this monolithic right wing presence on the platform is a product of such echo chambers, since it's not borne out by what one sees when they step outside their echo chamber.",
