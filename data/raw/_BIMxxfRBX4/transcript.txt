hello everyone it's time for another Q & A so I recorded some video game footage for you to look at while I answer your questions it's my first time playing this game so don't expect much if you're paying attention you folks sent me a bunch of questions so let's not waste any more time hello Daniel congrats for hitting your milestone my question for the Q&A is with YouTube being a cesspool of Aldrich youtubers like Lauren southern and Paul Watson or useful idiots for the odd word like saga niveau can't party can Chris Reagan and it was Ken temple etc do you think the left of YouTube has a chance of rising up and overtaking them honestly that's really hard for me to say but I'm not as optimistic as some of my PS here on YouTube when it comes to strict policy the left might even have the upper hand with TYT David Pakman and the likes when it comes to the culture stuff though or the right just has a massive advance specifically the demagogue types like Crowder or Shapiro just have a massive advantage due to not seeming to care much for what is actually true or factual I don't know maybe we'll see a shift over the next years but I'm not holding my breath sorry to start the Q&A on such a pessimistic note everyone what do you think of the rise of the American Left such as Bernie Sanders and Alexandria or Casio Cortez and the rise of membership in the Democratic socialists of America and our revolution do you think America is seeing the birth of a social democratic movement that one came from the mad Menshevik and I would love to see it happen the u.s. is probably the country in the Western world which is in need of a true left-wing movement the most so I'll keep an eye on the midterms and hope that they pull off a victory what advice would you give to somebody starting a tube channel now genres similar to yours also what resources do you like to use in your research thanks and congrats on 50k definitely at the word [ __ ] to your comment what filter other than that have fun and enjoy yourself don't let your videos become ensure that you only do because you feel like you have to regarding the resources my local library is my best friend and I can only recommend taking advantage of one if you have it nearby the next one is in a similar vein hello three arrows I love watching your videos I was recently inspired by you and a few other youtubers to try and start up my own YouTube channel do you have any suggestions that's like the hardest word in the English language for me for programs to use in regards to recording your audio or for recording other youtubers videos to respond to sincerely seve prime or CV sorry if I pronounced that wrong before recording audio I used to program audacity and the video editing is done in hitfilm express they're also known as browser add-ons to let you download videos from YouTube directly and if I have to record something from the screen i use obs one of these are free to use and I can recommend all of them at least they're sufficient for what I use them for although I'm currently looking for alternatives to hit film but those ones are perfectly fine to get started and even after that next one according to your points on your video about the removal of Confederate statues should we remove concentration caps and abolish the day of membranes the structures of liveries are not art and their conversion into museum makes a counter plug of them the fact that Holocaust dinars exists shows that they fail to connect to some people these are my thoughts after watching your videos before that I thought that celebrating the Holocaust and Israel and the school trips to concentration camps made sense okay so if celebrating the Holocaust never makes sense but I get what you're saying the comparison from Confederate statutes to concentration camps as a forty one though because they have different effects and serve different purposes account of leg on a Confederate monument is pointless because it's laughable in the contrast of what the monument imposes on its surrounding and also doesn't provide much value in terms of Education concentration camps on the other hand are completely transformed into places of remembrance and education the concentration camps are not maintained to serve as a reminder of how awesome the Nazis were but for the opposite reason I hope that helps favorite music artists or bands from Emperor Tiger Starr I don't have a specific genre of music that I listened to most of the time but my favorite band is called The Glitch Mob which you should definitely check out I'll put a link to a song in the description for you guys hi left your great war video I think it did a great job of bringing social history on a military topic usually military history on YouTube neglects this badly even if they are good at explaining the military capacity of an army they may not be able to discuss the social and cultural connections to the war my question is have you thought about doing other videos on this the Spanish Civil War comes to mind as one you could make a great topic on especially since you can discuss propaganda political violence and the fallacy that fascists and anti-fascists are the same looking forward to more of your work yes thank you for the kind words I always feel awkward reading them out loud so the video I did on propaganda and what were one is in my head at least part of a longer series about propaganda I hinted at this step in the bank myth at the end of the last one but ultimately I want to jump from arrow to arrow like doing a video on cold war propaganda then maybe the Iraq war the Vietnam War I'm not sure which one will come next though this menace of a woman also be an interesting topic right now I have so much to choose from that I have trouble deciding on one I'd keep you guys posted though if your life had a soundtrack what would it be I know that's an odd question but I often wonder what the world would be like if everybody had their own theme music that was playing all throughout the day and everybody could hear um my shit's [ __ ] up by Warren Zevon that was easy the next question is one that I got multiple times so I'll just summarize it for you guys considering that the symbol you use is from the iron front whereas all the anti-communist content it seems like you only attack the right my first response to this would be that you shouldn't hold me to the standard a few idea of a long-dead paramilitary group I'm my own person as I mentioned in a previous Q&A I used two three arrows as a placeholder when I started my channel and then just ran with it when the channel gained popularity also if the iron front would exist today they would probably be labeled as far left they just weren't Bolsheviks the iron front was an SPD led group and their political ideas at the time would be considered far left in today's political landscape but that just as aside when as I said it's irrelevant to this channel when it comes to the reason why there is no anti communist content on this channel well it's the same reason there is no anti-monarchist content on this channel in today's Western political landscape the threat to democracy posed by a communist revolution is non-existent and on YouTube there is no far-left steven crowder or Paul Joseph Watson or really anything comparable also I hope that I didn't give you the idea of me being some kind of centrist just because I'm not in favor of communism or the far right which ties into our next question are you an anti capitalist yeah I would say so next one when it comes to dealing with historical legacies of world war ii atrocities japan has often contrasted as a bad example of this with germany as a good example what are your thoughts on Germany's attempts to come to terms with the Holocaust and other Nazi era atrocities compensation for victims how these things are taught in school etc should it do more has it done enough is it realistic to ask that to do more even if one personally believes it should that one came from car I think Germany did a good job of coming to terms with the past now there are some caveat to that because this process was very different in West Germany than the GDR which is one of the many reasons why the far-right gets so good voting results in the eastern part of Germany for your question if Germany has done enough I wouldn't agree with that framing since this is a continuous process and its main goal is not really to make up for it I don't think that's possible but keeping the memory alive and working towards a future where something like this can never happen again which historian would you be most interested in meeting and having a conversation with as in my dream is to meet Antony Beevor and ask him about Stalingrad if I can pick any historian my choice would be Herodotus of Halicarnassus but that's a bit cheating since the guy is long dead I would love to talk to Peter Hart one day he would a fantastic book called the Great War which everyone who is interested in the subject should check out have you ever looked into the sceptics fear of Germany I get this question a lot and honestly I have to say no I could name like three or four German youtubers who do political stuff but that said this wasn't a deliberate decision for me though I just never stumble upon them and right now I don't have an interest in doing so you said in one of your Q&A videos that the three arrows were supposed to be a placeholder but your channel blew up so fast and now you just roll with it so if you could go back in time and change your name and icon would you do it - something like Kaiser Wilhelm with laser eyes that one came from Higgins - rad Segal I wouldn't change it because since then I have learned to appreciate the logo very much especially to cross out other channel icons and kaiser wilhelm ii with laser eyes would probably give off the vibe that I'm some kind of monarchist or reactionary the Kaiser Wilhelm is a meme for my twitch channel by the way for those of you who are a bit confused by that I know there was a sort of surge in white-winged German channels awhile back probably due to capitalizing on the right-wing YouTube scene and being anti-immigration would you say most of the German youth is leftists or are these channels kind of representative although recently there was quite a shift to the right the majority of young people in Germany are still considered to be on left that's nothing exclusive to Germany though younger people tend to be more left-leaning nearly everywhere around the world when it comes to the surge and right-wing channels I can't speak for any Germans became channels but yeah there was a time when the amount of people complaining about sjw's on YouTube exploded but luckily that seems to die off slowly hey Dani a huge fan you were the gateway to the rest of left YouTube for me I'm a huge history nut and hope to one day get a PhD in history what is the most important aspect of history well you would be better off asking historian about their craft than me but if I can give any advice it would be to always seek out different perspectives when you think you have the definitive answer to a historical question it's also important to know the history of the topics you're interested in to fully understand how our modern outlooks on things like the word was and such developed over time for instance the historic of our understanding of world war 1 could be subject of an essay in itself I think that's the best advice I can give hey Daniel I've been a fan of your work since you began creating videos and have had my political views challenged and changed over the course of the last year I grew up in a pretty conservative right-leaning home and my new beliefs are definitely not welcomed how do I maintain my relationship with my parents will still be true to myself xx Gaby well I can't speak to you a specific situation one thing I try to improve about myself when arguing with people who have very conservative views so not appear as condescending or outright dismissive while the other person is bringing forth his or her arguments that usually makes the other person instantly deaf for your arguments when someone makes a statement that is obviously rooted in ignorance it's hard to remain serious sometimes but yeah that's the thing I'm working on when you've found a solution sent me a Twitter DM I hope you have success with that I was interested in the recent press around the ask historian subreddit policy on Holocaust denial many to shut it down immediately when dealing with the old right in particular where do we draw the line between things that should be rebutted and things that should be ignored to avoid legitimizing the opposing arguments I also love to hear thoughts on how we can actually make a difference how do we get the kind of arguments you debunk and discuss and more pertinently the critical tools needed to debunk such ideologies into the minds of those who are currently particularly susceptible to them so for the first part when should we draw the line on what is allowed to be said free of punishment well and this may be because I'm German for me the line is crossed when someone engages an activity that serves the purpose to overthrow our free democratic republic as well as threatening minority groups once that point is crossed I have no objections to the state using violence to prevent further damage from society I know a lot of people are really big on the free marketplace of ideas memes but that idea fed miserably in this country and I'm not willing to allow that to happen again and Germany we call this fortified democracy maybe I should do a video on this and for your second question I like to tell myself that my videos may be able to pull people away from white rank demagogues but some people are just so far out there that any argument is pointless so I guess we'll keep on trucking and see what the future brings since you know so much about German history are you a history student from down no I'm not and most of the stuff I know about history after the last two years sadly I found my interest in history where the light in life which means in my early 20s do we have an opinion on the writings of Peter Kropotkin and anarchism in general I can't recount her off my husband asked to read the conquest of bread but unfortunately I have no idea when I'm gonna get to it right now my reading time is limited to stuff I need for upcoming videos sorry do you have any book recommendations a thinker gave some recommendations for nonfiction on my last Q&A so I'll just name a few fiction books that are really enjoyed if that's okay my favorite book series is the Hank Thompson trilogy which is kind of hot boy at crime story or three books following one character it also really enjoyed the road by Cormac McCarthy as well as the power of the dark by Don Winslow's sticking with the theme of dorks road dogs by emily annette is also a great book and in the case that you want to be really really depressed for several months I recommend the read writing series by David piece which is modern Noir I would say I know a lot of people on the internet really like fantasy books but unfortunately I don't enjoy those at the moment one book which you should never read is American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis because it's very boring and the of time and no one will convince me otherwise Otto von Bismarck living up to the legend status or overrated tenantless heck from Nikolas definitely not a talentless hack but also a bit over idealized in Germany for my tastes but you know he's pretty much the creator of this country so people don't usually care about his anti-democratic stances a very good politician this time though and the last one for today Hey I just watched your video on world war one propaganda and I wanted if you have watched the channel the Great War and if so what are your thoughts about how would they present the war I love the Great War the YouTube channel that is think they do an awesome job in education while also being very entertaining and in case you didn't know yet they just started with their week by week coverage of World War two so definitely check them out and that's it for this time everyone thank you for your questions and I'm sorry if I didn't answer yours there were a lot of them also thank you for 50,000 subscribers and to all my patrons I wouldn't be making videos without all of you the next video is gonna come out in about two weeks from me uploading this so hopefully I'll see you there although that one might be a bit more painful to watch good place ended here on a cliffhanger so see you then everyone
