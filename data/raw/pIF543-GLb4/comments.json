I'm a survivor of abuse, had years of ptsd therapy and my cope is strong, but this Crowder shit has me triggered. I just want you to hear some validation for everything you felt and everything you said during this video. It's fricking textbook abuse and it would only escalate. When a woman is murdered by her husband, I guarantee it started EXACTLY like this! I learned too late to have zero tolerance, but I have it now, and I LOVE that young women like you get it! I'd keep going but I know I'm triggered, so I'll just say thank you (!) for expressing yourself, it has helped me tonight! 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 #following",
