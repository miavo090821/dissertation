says imagine if we had 650 or even half of that of MPS of Andrew and Rupert's caliber integrity and honesty until we have more efficient and different set of incentives in play our politics uh well strap in and get get out of the cities and B says Andrew I'd love to know what you think uh where you think all of this ends my viewers that David Betts who's a professor who's been talking about Civil War in Britain uh thinks is correct and thinks we're going to arrive at a sort of lowgrade Latin American style Civil War faster than it can turn around yeah and um what I do say to people is that the darker it gets you got to remember we're nearer to the end it is going to get darker and worse and but we are relying a lot on the Americans to help us out even if it's only with a a tsunami of Truth and Justice coming across the Atlantic which would sweep away self-serving politicians that we've got in this country currently take advantage of your first amendment that only that only be rupit left yes uh and uh awith says hubby is a doctor in a in Australia luckily he is married to a criminologist I had to do Lauren psychology trained in the '90s for criminology was cool Medicare in Australia admins aren't doctors uh yeah that's another point is the admins are not doctors aren't they anyway Let's uh let's move on so do you remember a little while ago when we were told uh actually the RAF doesn't need useless white male Pilots because we have impossible to hit diversity targets and good God do we need those diversity targets so this was only in June 202 23 so it's not like this was ancient history and things have changed in the world since then uh but this is this is a fascinating thing that was just like okay well can you give me an example of institutional bias against straight white men yes from the RAF from the the one of one of the three branch the new sentencing guidelines are pretty daming aren't they they are but this this is this is one of those ones where it's this is a remarkable thing so the selection boards uh were complaining in these leaked emails and documents that they they just couldn't get nonwhite people I passed that at big and Hill when I was 16 oh really it's called test in advance it air crew right okay uh they say a number of selection boards uh to place recruit SCH courses uh were also canceled if they did not include women or ethnic minorities according to these messages so this is outright racial discrimination and gender discrimination which theoretically is illegal in this country this is positive discrimination still discrimination yeah just you're not allowed to discreate on protected characteristics technically this is a crime but of course this is never going to be prosecuted for anything and uh the Air Force had to pay out £5,000 each 31 different cost more than that yeah it does but at least they got something because it doesn't really matter the amount to be honest the fact that they got paid £5,000 is proof you were in the wrong and you had to pay compensation so this is categorically you have admitted through the payment of this compensation you were wrong even if no one will actually be charged or anything for this uh and the uh the chief uh Chief Air Marshal uh Wiston don't know who he is well the air Chief Marshall actually uh said that no these were well-intentioned efforts to improve diversity and they didn't discriminate against white men illegal yeah so why are you paying out £5,000 to each one of them if they didn't may have hurt their feelings Yeah well yeah exactly so you're admitting it right and a spokesperson said well the selection standards were not and have not been altered and there was no compromise of Entry standard no impact on Frontline or operational effectiveness oh really but quite an effect on morale yes well uh no no no no they say no no there's no impact no no there's no impact we're we're absolutely certain uh no impact on operational effectiveness and we're going to see the so how's the recruitment going then yeah exactly it's not going great uh so for this no one was punished no one was punished so the Air Force just have to pay out 155 Grand because they were being racist so they were just actively discriminated no they were sorry they got caught yeah that's that's they were sorry about they got caught the service apologized blamed incorrect legal advice and said everyone had been acting with the best of intent and no disciplinary action was recommended so no one was punished no accountability nothing no no one gets canned for this no one's career is harmed over this no one loses their pension over this no one loses anything this get to be just overtly discriminatory against straight white men and nothing happens other than the taxpayer has to pay 150 Grand this is how this cont collateral damage is people are getting the message wellcome yeah no no that is um so Sky actually did a really good job on this which is remarkable and they went and looked up uh this was a sorry a period of time afterwards uh so they looked up what happened to these people and uh so air Chief Marshal sir Mike wigston uh retired just no problem at the end of his tenure a vice Marshal Maria biford uh retired just you know so she's got her uh salary up until the point of retirement £ 179,000 a year air Comer Joe Lincoln just moved to a new post and group Captain William Dole who was then the head of recruitment so you would think that this would be his particular uh decision on who to hire and who not to uh was promoted good job yeah Bravo brilliant job group Captain William Dole and so okay well you know it's just being racist to the straight white men who we expect to defend the country they're surely signing up in their droves to defend the country now that things are going south with Russia aren't they yeah no oh what a shock the RF what would we be fighting for I mean what would we be defending um what freedom of speech you know the rule of law uh equality the the country that belonged to your ancestors even giving that away to foreigners as well I mean who what are we fighting for maybe we said and who would want us yeah who wants to invade us with all our problems like yeah exactly Russia invades takes over it's like oh you can have it back thanks so I got thanks I was just going to say maybe if we said we were going to go and fight and defend for Palestine then maybe we'd get a more diverse roster signing up you know what they would have done they absolutely would but they wouldn't stop over there and fight for their own country would they no yeah anyway so the the telegraph here reports um that the RAF is now facing a pilot shortage after a diversity hiring scheme backfired an official document revealed the Royal Air Force is need for a higher number of pilots and training and they're so short stuffed that candidates who were previously rejected are being urged to reapply really candidates know know you're white we're not having you actually oh white men please come back St this way yeah please reapply cuz actually we need to go fight and die for you know the multic difficulty Britain it remind the poem Thin Red Line of Heroes you be acquainted with that I know I know OB but it's been a long about how no one valued them as soldiers you know I went into a public house to buy a pint of beer the land lady got up and said we serve no Red Coats here but it step forward Mr Atkins when the band begins to play yes and this is precis the music the band's warming up and uh and no one's in the crowd we we may have racially discriminated against you but please reapply say the we really need need you now yeah because you may have to die for your country exactly we need you to die for the the institutions and again was anyone punished no they were all promoted they were retired they got everything they wanted of course we've what we have got in the milry now is is all the blairite they're the people at the top now and also what I need to share with you Carl and Harry is that you you think that the mod is run by the military under Blair it was it's run by civil servant it is not a military organization anymore that's why you've got things like this going on because the mod is run by civil servants yeah I mean my my dad was a sergeant in the RF when he retired from the uh forces Wellington ran the British army very successfully with 25 non military yeah I mean the the whole them yeah the whole story of the British Empire is one of minimal Administration as well it's so good uh anyway the the the point being on this is that they're begging for you to reapply do you feel like it um the uh the air force is also short staffed uh in various other ways as well and it's not just the Air Force TR to parachute people in it's not just the Air Force it's the Army as well uh Lord Hammond has come out and pointed out that look young people are totally unprepared to fight a war for Britain why would they want to why would they want to defend the state of this country I don't know whether you've noticed but this country is falling apart Our Town centers are completely overrun by strangers who have just been allowed to come here and we're paying for the privilege of them being here who then bring more people in under skilled Visa work skilled worker visa schemes for being Kebab shop chefs a third of the people who are allowed to come here are just let me just let me just just fire one in there you know why do we need to bring in why would the The Establishment it's clearly clearly designed bring in all these men of fighting age between the age and people are worried that they're they're going to do something well what if what if the plan has been for a very long time that a large number of our indigenous men of eight to 40 will be heading to the Eastern front and won't be coming back what do you need in your country I don't even dare speculate on it but uh it's honestly it's a the war's been the war two years ago the civil servants knew the war was coming and morale went down they knew the war was coming the plan was for the war with Russia Honestly though it's too Grim for me to ponder you know like I I don't want to think about it but the the the point being of course is that they know that there's no reason that a young person would want to fight for Britain in fact many of them are thinking how can I get out of Britain where can I go and lots of people are going to Australia uh because this country is going downhill and everyone knows it because everything we have is just being given away it's just been given away it's been taxed away it's been given away to foreigners and you are being treated like a cash cow that will be discriminated against as a second class citizen as people were in the RAF and so Lord Hannon Hammond says there's no point spending lots of money on Def equipment if you haven't got any men to press the buttons and we are unable to recruit even rather poultry scale Army that we currently have it's 72,000 men we're always about 8,000 under recruitment because what's the incentive what benefit what bonus what privilege will you be given in society if you fight for it no you're a straight white man you at the bottom of the the hierarchy in this country you were treated with just open contempt by the institutions why would you bother why would you bother it's Tommy this and Tommy that and Tommy go away but espe train for Atkins when the band begins to play I you know I I wish you prob you were going to bring that up cuz I would have reread it it's been yes I mean I was literally in school it's all there I mean it's all there they always treated the soldier badly but it was a Thin Red Line of Heroes when the band begins to yeah yeah well so they're a bit more educated now and they know what's going on yeah yeah exactly exactly so um Lord Hammond here says and this is just fascinating right uh we're not geared towards this of course and uh if you stop men of their 20s and 30s and ask them how ready they are to drop their pens and computers and have head off to the recruiting station I think we'll get a pretty clear answer there is a major societal shift going to be required oh is it required it's not just about money it's about the organization of the economy and the orientation of societ follow we'll follow Lord Hammond he'll be out there surely it's it's too late for right behind us like 30 miles behind us if yeah but why why is it the society is so geared against the native young man and in favor of every kind of foreign Min they've been denigrating him and calling him far right exactly uh scum scum um he's probably in jail right now because he posted something on Facebook because he didn't like children being stabbed yes like like I'm sorry something he would have stood up for yeah exactly you know against children being stabbed yes I'm to love it's just like this is where we are you know and and so it really does annoy me and they say where are all the real men yeah why aren't they staying to our defense yeah why why do you deserve it toxic you know an element of toxic masculinity might be needed to defend the country and so um one uh Colonel uh was interviewed by the the mirror uh who's talking of conscription it's like well are we going to have conscription it's like no you're going to have a civil war if you think you're going to conscript like I I think there' be an awful lot of conscientious obors this time yeah that like people are most people I know would rather go to prison yeah absolutely than die I did say saying there's probably a ditch in the dbass with your name on it yeah yeah I I would I mean I I would definitely advise anyone to be a conscientious objector quotequote to any war that this state wish to fight because look at what you'll be protecting well I did point out in the summer that we were heading prob almost certainly for a war and that Rishi sunak had let it be known to the generals in the mod he didn't want to be a wartime prime minister and clearly that starma was up for it and he he does like his khy doesn't he does saw him in the Ukraine uh outfit finally Mook him for zinsky at one stage I mean see a bit of that can't you yeah he's he's he's very much a hawk isn't he with what's going on in Ukraine and I you know you just can't believe the politics that's going on and the transision you know when you've got a labor government now bringing in the other night that they're going to cut benefits for the severely disabled as if giving them less money is going to make them able to work there's so much wrong everything everything's inverted isn't it there's so much wrong with this country anyway um so basically uh if you're a young man in this country I don't recommend you sign up and uh I won't let my son sign up when they're old enough so you know things things would have to be very dramatically different for me for to want to defend the current government of this country if you wouldd like to see the full
