        "text": "Apparently, the entirety of the EU didn't perceive their brutal oppression upon their own citizens leading to very few willing to enlist and fight for the tyrants leading the nation astray, demoralizing the citizens to the brink of not having any reason to fight for their own nation.  The EU will have to conduct themselves like Ukraine and begin abducting military aged citizens in broad daylight for all to see and to threaten them into being soldiers.  \n\nI doubt the EU are caught off guard here, the elite are most likely feigning ignorance as they know full well what they are doing, but ignorance and ineptitude are reliable Marxist tools affording the elite \"plausible deniability\" as they usher Europe into a dystopian nightmare.  It looks like the elite plan on using debt to enslave Western civilization, globalists have openly called it \"shareholder capitalism\" which is meant to replace all Western governance, where those that own the nations debt become a board of trustees that replace sitting governance and the citizens all become debt slaves by seemingly gross negligence to obfuscate from the fact that this was the goal all along.  \n\nThe EU instigating war with Russia is maddening, it's the very definition of insanity, Boris Johnson immediately flying to Ukraine demanding Zelensky not honor the deal rendered with Putin that afforded Russia port access, thereby an endless proxy war ensued and it seems like Putin has kept to his word all along and only seeks out the port access, as was the original agreement before Zelensky broke his word with Russia and saddled up with the West pleading for intervention and entry into NATO.  Of course, none of this could have ever transpired without the two CIA backed coups that led to regime change in Ukraine, how much do you want to bet those coups were funded through alarming exploitation of the US taxpayers like what's being exposed from USAID.\n\nApathy and hopelessness has ravaged most Europeans by now, the past few generations realizing they are being stifled out of their own economy and marketplace by sky rocketing taxation that refuses any citizens the ability to prosper.  If Europe desires war with Russia they will have to depend upon foreign militaries to fight on their behalf.\n\nThe mass invasion of foreigners have no reason to enlist and fight this war being coerced into the Cold War 2.0 if not WWIII due to Western interventionism and the West's continued fear tactics in which they claim their intelligence assets and war games perceive/imply/assume Putin doing X, thereby giving the West the green light to do Y, all while claiming their hostile act of aggression against Russia is only a defensive measure.  Like Ukraine launching missiles deep into Russia targeting civilian cities baring no responsibility for said conflict, the West implies those attacks are not attacks but a defensive strategy against whatever they assume, perceive and imply to warrant them the right to attack Russia.  \n\nCurrently, the hopelessness and apathy within Europeans due to the EU's brutal oppressive and dogmatic agenda has become a massive problem for the elite, as the citizens are well aware of what's going on, they have no will to fight some pointless war and the mass invasion of foreigners will not help in the slightest as the leaders of these foreigners have made it clear they will not tolerate the EU dragging them into conflict they have no business with, leaving the EU hopelessly dependent upon America leading the charge while America has made it clear they demand an end to the war and repayment to what has been extorted from the US taxpayers.  \n\nEven if the EU declares what is clear for all to see from demographic data and charts pointing out the obvious to be \"conspiracy theory\" or not, demographic data does not lie, nor does the perpetual litany of fraud against the citizens seem to help by those very few who are abusing their authority in order to line them and their friends pockets at the expense of the citizens, or the many extortionist practices of foreigners taking advantage of the systems that all but pander to every desire these foreigners request, even when the crimes are obvious, there seems to be no mechanics of holding these few monsters in power responsible for whatever it is they're doing.  \n\nBesides the failed leadership chasing after ruination of their own nations, they also brutally punish any dissidence daring to point out the obvious, clearly they fear any more citizens realizing what it is they're doing and they abuse the justice system in order to instill fear within the citizens in order to maintain the peace by brutal oppressive tactics wielded against any that mention the obvious.  Interesting how there are no mechanisms in place to afford the citizens the ability to investigate those that have erected themselves above any legal standards the masses are being brutally subjected to at present.  \"Rules for thee but not for me\" on crack, the hypocrisy is palpable.",

It needs to be just full of their own people (mostly) and culture and have a media that represents and celebrates this. \n\nThe government has chipped away at the pride of the average working class male and female for decades. Going through many different channels. Great effort has been put into demoralising them and forcing the multi cult by any means necessary. \n\nThe problem is that the people that they've imported, even born here, not all but many of them resent the people and country and actually some even have a strange type of envy but superiority complex at the same time. These people will never fight for this country. They are British when it suits them and not when it doesn't. They've also brought in a massive amount of criminals and scroungers too. \n\nRidiculous that they thought anything but a tiny trickle of foreigners will join the RAF, Navy or Army.\n\n Virtue signalling and 'the current thing' is a type of religion. Now because of the absolute state of the woke poophole and divided nation that this country has descended into, there is no way that an actual British person,  with roots going back centuries or thousands of years will fight on behalf of a succession of politicians and governments that hate them.",

He spread Islam by the sword. He hated music so much he would pour\nmolten lead in the ears of musicians. Jesus doesn't come close to doing any of that. Islam is a false religion based on bigotry and hate.\nAnd don't let anyone tell you differently. (The Quran literally says its okay to beat your wife. Just don't hit her in the face so you\ndon't make her ugly. And Now you're stuck with an ugly wife. But the worst, is it says to kill non-Muslims.) Peace",

        "text": "@chrisnoname2725well they won’t be fighting along side us . Therefore we would be fighting for them to stay in this awful country they hate so much they would never defend. In fact a war may just be the only way they would leave. My nephew is in the army.. there are many different races who join the British military. Not any Muslims though. I was very surprised considering they seem to love this country enough to live here. Yet they won’t risk their lives for their so called safe country. I bet there would be a tick box for if a war started. Such as not a British citizen ( so no need to. Join) they would all be falling over themselves to tick that box so as not to fight to defend this country. I bet the government would still not deport! It’s absolutely infuriating. My daughter got badly beaten up and spat on for having the audacity to sit on the top deck of a bus. We live in Lambeth. She was 16, coming home from school had her headphones on brazenly had the audacity to go to the top deck as the downstairs was rammed. Unfortunately the top of the bus was full of kids (Somali descent. bus driver and witnesses observation not hers) about 15-20 of them between the ages of 14 to 20 years old.  Male and females. She was told to leave the bus as no dirty white pigs allowed up there. She was polluting their space. 1st of all she just thought they were just hyper sch kids shouting to one another and made the mistake of sitting down. She had on her head phones and was completely surrounded by them. So they ripped out her headphones and started screaming in her face laughing calling her derogatory insults. So she tried to get up to leave taking her phone from her pocket to try and wrap the headphone wire around it, That’s where the physical attack started. They smashed her phone into her face then all started slapping punching and dragging her around the top of the bus. Every time she tried to stand they knocked her back down stomping her spitting on her ripping out her hair. She’s 4”9 ,weighs 46kg. The bus stopped after realising something was going on. As soon as the bus stopped they all ran downstairs and jumped off the bus. Absolute savages. They stole her phone bag and coat that had been ripped off her back during the attack. The driver and other passengers came to her aid. The police were called she was black & blue with facial injuries her left arm was pulled out of its socket her ear ripped and her face so swollen covered in blood. No one was arrested. The police called it a street robbery. That’s NOT accurate. It was a brutal attack. Nothing was done except she was given a crime reference number and received a victim support leaflet through the post. She never went back to school, and has never left the house alone since.that was in 2022. She studied online to finish 6th form and her dreams of further education ended that day. She won’t go to university she’s too afraid to leave the house alone. We are selling our house and moving to try and get her some confidence and life back. This country has turned to Sh*t. When my daughter recently turned 18 she was too afraid to go out and celebrate her birthday. I’m furious at the lack of effort put in to help our daughter get justice. Many names were given and there’s plenty of cctv. Unfortunately there is a larger amount of unwillingness to seek out and prosecute these animals.",

Cool to see someone in UK actually knows who he is.\nSaxons have saxon Kings the norse gods. Days of the week. The royals of Europe. All came from Odin. I Making a video game on British gods and mythology. So Celtic and Saxon (Germanic / Norse ).\nAt this point I'm considering adding Zianists as bad guys with the Demons and Jotunr lol\nEngland has these god kings : Woden = Odin. Frigg. Vedeg.\nBaeldeag = Baldur.  Seaxneat. Winta. Whitgills. \nThe other Norse gods became the first kings of Europe...\n+ Before that England had Celtic Gauls tribes like Icini with Queen Boudicea. Considered a godess when alive. Today the patron godess of England...\nSo England is Anglo Saxon with hints of Celtic Gauls tribes.\nScotland is Celtic with Picts ancestory.\nIreland is Celtic with Gaels ancestory.\nWales is Celtic with Brythons Ancestory.\nThe Saxons are basically England and Germany and Germanic country's.\nThe Norse gods are Saxon, Germanic, Scandinavian Kings.\nThe Celtic gods are mostly pagan Dietys, But alot of them are also Ancient  Irish, Scottish, and Welsh Kings.\nEspecially Ireland with the De Dannan. ( Also we're Faeries / the fae originated ).\nIdeally I'll include all this in my video game.\n... maybe in 100 years time people will play it and be surprised that for a while the UK had white people. 😅\n....\nIf it finish it. Was going call it \"Myths n Manga\" OR \"Mind Body Soul\". Now I'm thinking it should be called.  \n \"A British  Game ( before Ye Olde Britainnia was woke ) \"",

Those that opened your borders to others that act against you, as a Nation.  Simply put, take back your own country with a common sense view and right the wrongs that have been done against you.  Become the Britain that the U.S. has always respected and cares for.  We are with you Britain, simply act upon your known convictions of right and wrong, as you did once before in the making of the \"Magna Carta\".

Do not concern yourselves of the immigrants demands, especially the illegal ones, and stay true to the British culture, and damn them that go against your culture.  Remain British, for the British.",

        "text": "What a deceptive channel. \r\n\r\nI hear no commentary on the actual cause of overcrowding in Britain, that being the legacy of Blair and Brown's opened borders policy to allow post-expansion EU migrants legal access to Britain's resources in person. That's right. You complain too much and about the wrong things. \r\n\r\nAre you meant to convince British people that it's okay to give British sovereignty away, replacing the natives as long as the tens of millions of freeloaders who can't even speak English call themselves Europeans, pretending to be Christians??? \r\n\r\nEvery comment in this video is anti-British. You berate the British Commonwealth, her contributions to Britain's past prosperity and successes, explaining it away as some recent ploy to undermine, completely ignorant of the facts. \r\n\r\nYou pretend to oppose what you call multiculturalism, when two thirds of your panel always consists of what I call non-British stock. That's right. Don't think this slips under all radars.\r\n\r\nThis channel is a product of the very same initiative which resulted in Britain's demand to leave the EU. If you could get away with it, you'd be canvassing to rejoin, but you have to maintain the illusion that you care about the plight of the British people.\r\n\r\nThe problem today in Britain, the one threatening actual straight white British males, has nothing to do with Muslims, or blacks, or West Indians, who are traditional British Commonwealth minorities having the right to be in Britain, considering that Britain decided to \"share\" their ancestral resources.\r\n\r\nThe problem is a recent influx of aliens representing 20% of the previous population. These have NOTHING to do with Britain or her history. They don't even know how to speak English, and they're everywhere, in every town, in every borough, in town halls, running councils, businesses, and political parties. They're everywhere! And guess what! They consider themselves to be white males too! These promote immoral living, unnatural marriages, and liberal ideologies, in stark contrast to what you call Christian heterosexual values. \r\n\r\nThe problem white Britain faces is akin to an invasion of the body snatchers, who just happen also to influence mainstream news and all social media, including this hypocritical channel.",

Only catch was convincing the seller he wanted the meat still alive and breathing instead of dismembered and wrapped in banana leaves for take-out. It was touch and go for a while. Then it was back to business as usual but this time, a lot more profitable because those do-gooders in England virtual signalling to the world that 'slavery bad' all while keeping their dividends in the slave trade via the British East India Company high and dry from financial loss while trying to convince the world of their righteous indignation. Seeing England suffocate under a blanket of brown people is kinda sad but funny at the same time. Yes, karma is a bitch and now England belongs to that bitch.

Most of the civilians in the 40s through the 70s, at least in the States, voted for policies that LEAD TO THIS CRAP, or actively took actions that did so. So no, they're not ashamed of us. We should be ashamed of THEM, for putting us in this predicament with their voting practices. Voting practices, mind you, that have made it incredibly difficult to change course, because they solidified the power structures that lead to this crap.\n\nBoomers, who are largely made up of our grandparents and great grandparents, were the ones that irreparably damaged society. And then they blame us for it, instead of looking in the mirror. They were the ones to build the welfare state that harbors illegals over its natives. They were the ones that irreparably damaged the economy of the time, leading to the dismantling and destruction of all the benefits they had that made them wealthy, benefits that most people today don't have, and thus can't use to build their wealth. They were the ones that sold the nation out from under their children and grandchildren. They are the ones that are leaving behind nothing but a path of destruction, bills, debt, and a broken society at their inevitable death. \n\nThough, I'm speaking as an American. I don't know if similar events happened for Brits. I'd assume they were similar enough, since we're largely in the same boat right now. Rampant anti-wyt narratives, \"diverse\" policies, rampant soft-on-crime attitudes, broken economies, rising poverty, and criminals flooding through open borders. The US would (and likely will be) right where Britain is now in 4-8 years, unless we continue to elect Trumpian candidates for at least 2 full generations (40+ years). Because once Trump is out, the FIRST Democrat in office will undo everything he did, and we'll be right back to Bidenomics and \"diversity is our strength\" crap.",

I was there 2 years before the bullying started from the British management. After 3 years of blatant bullying which included threats of violence and being told to fuck off by my manager while he was on a video call with his wife because I wanted to put a days holiday in to watch England play rugby, I decided to go through BAe’s dignity and respect process and put a complaint in against the management. The joke process was a joke. It was brushed under the rug and in the end the management manufactured a reason to sack me. They gave me 6 days to leave the country despite having a 90 day notice period (eventually after I refused to leave because it was impossible they relented and gave me the full amount). When I returned to the UK I called citizens advice about taking BAe to court for bullying and I was told that because I was a white, heterosexual male I couldn’t be bullied and there was no way I could take them to court for it. Unless I was gay etc I couldn’t even start the process.",
