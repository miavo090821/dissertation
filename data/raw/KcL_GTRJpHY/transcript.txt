we're being encouraged to vote for a black Asian woman who's a prosecutor this wouldn't be happening if she wasn't viewed as a black woman all these attacks would not be happening from all those different angles if she was not seen as the inter we eliminated cash bail in in Illinois all together we passed historic bail reform we introduced the end solitary confinement act in California who gives a [ __ ] about this symbolic loss of like you're being asked to vote for a cop who gets she has a very clear political change theory which is that she believes you can change from the inside

Harris and I am I don't know where to begin because there are so many things currently in the discourse and in the Zeitgeist right I think like I have thoughts around the misogyny on the discussion of having um Meg the stallion being at her rally I think this has been a stupid ass discussion that the the public is having that I think we should break down I also think the larger conversation that is happening around Kamala that I predicted would happen I said we because of I said there's been a rise of xenophobia in some pockets of Black America we know which pockets they are um and I knew that was going to affect the way you saw kamla being discussed kamla's Blackness being um like attacked from different directions right like it's one the conversation on on biracial identity but then there's a whole another like and the way people act and like two things can be true it's funny she can't be black but she could be Indian like they're like oh she's not black she's Indian it's interesting how we're doing we're doing this and then the other conversation that I really want to talk about is that her her unmistakably black father because he's Jamaican they're saying that's not black because of a conversation that I think I have been experiencing a lot I've been exper because I'm an immigrant so I I knew firsthand because I get it every day how this has increased in the last few years of people saying non-american black people are not black and not wanting them to be like seen as such or included or represented um and I think now the rest of the country I think this is a good time to talk about it because now other black people who are not as chronically online and don't know these people are seeing it so I'm going to give it to the room well I just want to say my name is clay and I turn black when I heard uh P Lael out sing Diana Ross and Motown returns of the Apollo that was when the melanin took over I just just in case uh Trump or Laura whatever is is you know wondering you know it's it's interesting I um reesi and I were having this conversation earlier I sometimes wonder this is happening in an echo chamber because when I talk to people outside of social media they are kind of stunned at the dialogue that's allegedly out there now to be fair I'm not from New York I'm from Philadelphia and growing up in Philly I didn't see a large distinction between somebody who was Jamaican or Haitian we were all black we're in a black neighborhood Philadelphia is very segregated so I didn't see this large distinction so when I see this [ __ ] now I just feel like it's white supremacy gaslighting all of us and they don't want to see black folks on the same page because they're afraid of our voting power if they could try to convince you that vice president kamla Harris isn't really black enough they're hoping from their Jim Crow spirit that you're not going to vote for her that you're not going to show up for her because they they think we as black voters we only vote for folks because they're black because they're proud enough or because they perform Blackness right and it's it's a sick twisted way to look at it I have to hope at the end of the day it's not going to impact us as far as an election but then again o Amy I don't have your background I mean I've never I I this is very strange to me I'm I'm a bit older than the rest of you I'm 47 years old I don't oh [ __ ] CL and don't look try try but no filter either no know like I just remember us loving uh Marcus Garvey and people that I I mean obviously I wasn't born back then but we worshiped Marcus Garvey and Shirley Chisum and and Malcolm X and these were all people who had diverse backgrounds so to see Blackness being dissected and chopped up this way uh is disturbing to me but I know they're doing it because they're afraid of our Collective power I saw this take um on Twitter recently that someone was like I think that Trump and his little Maga Intel people have been as someone who's also chronically online just like oay is they've been looking at discussions that have been happening in on online spaces between black people and the strategy is they're using the words that they're seeing us use to to create this Chasm that has already been happening in very ignorant ignorant ways within the dias as for Wars as just we're kind of like I think unpacking what Blackness means to us different we barely we barely can understand race ethnicity and nationality so we can't get to different ethnicities within the black diaspora so I think they've been using that strategy because period Point Blank the right sees kamla Harris as a black woman they they see her as black which is why they responding this way they've been responding um that way towards her is since she's gotten the she's not technically the nominee yet but it's looking like she obviously GNA be she's been met with Mage gen Noir off rip um sexualization just all types of stuff so I think they're just using rhetoric that they're seeing how we're kind of fighting with each other which really makes me that it it bug that really bothers me because I know they're white people they're they not smart enough to to to create this Chasm and use these what how do you know she's really black because they are the ones who see us all really the same any [ __ ] ways but they've always known it was to their advantage for us to not see it that way right like the thing is they're they're both observing us they're observing conversations we're having now with the tools they gave us to have those conversations because there's a reason like white people like in terms of like how whiteness as a identity who crafted in America there white immigrants that were seen America made an executive decision White America to recognize them as white people in order to create that kind of power around whiteness but they've always fed like and not just in America they've always how colonization is working across the black Globe is to feed black people this this uh anti-blackness towards other black people and I know that from like being raised in in the Bahamas the way bahamians would see Haitians the way they'd see people like my father was Nigerian you know um so it's not even just in America that's what colonization has always done right to create that kind of uh uh lack of unity between us and if you've looked if you look at like the rise of these groups right like I experience the the particular groups where we're getting these talking points from and I normally don't like to say that like damn Candyman okay but FBA and them right like like those groups which I maintain are white supremacist hate groups right and I'm glad other people are finally getting to see it but I experience them by the drove every day like they make videos about me they attack me they my comments on every app so I know what it looks like and I also have blocked thousands of them like take a sat down and took the time to do it so what I realized from doing this research right like one day was last year on my birthday last year I I went and I went block everybody with FBA [ __ ] in their thing and I went through all of their following like I didn't just block them no no no I block everybody they followed and we're following and what I learned from going through that was a lot of this are white they are like you'll see it they follow nothing but rightwing white supremacist Bots and farm so a lot of it like there's a reason why so many people are shocked in real life to be I was just saying this Garrison when we were talking before this was my experiences uh I think xenophobia is something that has been has been packaged to the entire black black lob right and my experience has never been that black Americans are exceptionally xenophobic I've been in this country now since I was 14 and 2008 to now I have never heard this kind of dialogue before 2021 at the earliest and now I hear it every day right but I look into it yeah and you can see that it's these like white supremacist groups these these Bots these Farms so the reason why they know about it and they knew to like pick up that talking point for kamla is because they have been investing in bot farms and stuff for the last however many years and helping pedal that dialogue and if you look at a lot of the places where it comes from if you look at the kind of people that are like the leaders of those groups and talking about it and look at who fund them and look at all this you can see that it's it's tied so it's like yes they're listening to us they picked up on they're listening to us to know that we're having those conversations but they also influenced why we're having those conversations I guess I want to add like I I really got angry about it when I saw what JD van said him being the father of like three biracial kids and I don't even know like how you had those kids I'm kind of like but but when he was like oh she weaponizes Blackness I was like oh this is one a manifestation of where we are at with identity politics and how it kind of arose to maybe demand more intersectionality in more liberal or left spaces and now it's being weaponized against us and I and I and I think one of the functions of that comment about Kamala is to I don't know I guess I'm thinking about like my best friend who's a black woman like after Biden got into office she was like oh I was kind of glad when Trump was in office because black people got a break like they were like they were just going after the immigrants and and so I like to me it's it's targeting a certain area of Blackness where people are like oh maybe I don't trust her because she's that kind of immigrant or maybe I don't trust her because she isn't committed to a certain kind of Blackness and and and so that's where I think it's like it's really Insidious because there are going to be people out there that are black or PC or whatever they're going to be like oh yeah I guess I she does kind of weaponize her Blackness or why does she dance like that and so to everyone's point it is feeding or picking up from these conversations that are happening diasporic online and I think if anything our job or the job of like people that support Kamala is to like one name how it's messed up because I'm like white people created the one drop rule in the first place so how you gonna take it back and and the second part is like I think it's like really weird where we're going because I'm like for me at least as someone that doesn't support Kamala I'm like I didn't politics are being weaponized for people to be asked to support her but I'm like she's a black former prosecutor like why would I support her and on the other end you can see that the right is trying to be like well she's not black enough or XYZ and so I think it's interesting how these different dis dissections of Blackness show up no matter what side of the aisle that you're on and I think the danger is that it's being weaponized against us yeah I mean I want to say two things I kind of want to bifurcate this conversation just a little bit for a moment because I do think that there are two kind of competing elements happening here at the same time on the one hand I think there is actually real value in specificity so like I think that's necessary when when when Martin Luther King Jr used the term American descendants of slaves he was talking about a very specific lived experience that comes from being the descendant of American Catt slavery here in the United States and that experience has real economic and continued social impacts that are real like very real and measurable to this day for those people who descend from that Heritage and so talking about not only the experience but the culture the cultural contributions of folks who descend from that particular Heritage I think is merited in its context I think it's it's it's smart it's important and and within my own lived experience as a person who kind of descends from that Heritage my cessors were slaves in this country when I talk to my Jamaican friends or my Grenadian friends or beian like when I talk to people who are from the Caribbean or from West Africa and they talk about their Heritage and their cultural contributions and cultural heritage all that it's beautiful it's beautiful and it's specific and it's different in these really interesting ways and I think it's helpful to have language to describe the ways in which my culture is beautiful and specific and contributes in a different way when it comes to to to the vice president this is totally irrelevant and I agree that there is an effort I could I could almost name the people who are advising former president Donald Trump in his campaign on how to co-op the language of black Twitter in ways to drive Division and so I we have to know that that's a real thing it's not a conspiracy or a thought there are real people who are doing that who who are on who are black people in to black people they're using it in that way but but I do think that there is a a kind of solidarity ethic that existed all the way back in slavery times when when the Haitian when Haitian people overthrew their oppressor there were all black communities popping up across this country that named their communities Haiti ha y TI that is a part of the black tradition there is a diasporic Consciousness present in Black Liberation Abraham Galloway a former slave here in the United States got on a boat and and and rode to Haiti to help them with their like like that's a part of what we do and who we are and I do think this is almost that union busting idea and it's definitely what it is when When Donald Trump deploys it yeah well I think that first of all this this conversation didn't start around vice president kamla Harris becoming the Vice Presidential nominee this was the number one method of attack when she was running for president in 2019 the first debate she got 80% of the attacks of the negative attacks for all of the candidates mind you these were 20 people on stage at the time 80% of their attacks online were directed at comma Harris and it wasn't around oh she just started supporting Medicare for all I think that she should have been supporting Medicare for all since 2010 or whatever it was around the issue of questioning her Blackness Donald Trump Jr was one of the first people to amplify this and activate a right-wing troll Farm to push the narrative that KLA Harris isn't black enough these groups that you've mentioned they were weaponized against her not just around the issue of her Blackness but with things like so-called no reparations no vote tangibles 2020 when you look at it because I've supported her since 2019 when she ran for president so I looked at those hashtags and I said okay I haven't seen this before let me look and see what they're talking about who are they directing this to almost all of the tweets are are post were to KLA Harris and to Corey Booker there were 20 people running for president and they were all directed towards black people and so it's not just Blackness and whether she's black enough but it's the issue around black uh black causes around black advancement that are being weaponized against her that aren't accurate let me be clear about that and the and and the assertions that they've made that she said she's never goingon to say anything for black people when they put five seconds out of 15 seconds where she's literally explaining how doing things for black people benefits everybody all of these things have been weaponized against her if there's any kind of weaponization of identity politics it's actually weapon weaponizing it against black candidates they actually are penalized more for how only black candidates are asked do you support reparations only black candidates are asked what is your Black Agenda only black candidates are asked what are you going to do solely for black people only black people black candidates are asked for where is our black hate crime bill when we've had black hate crimes legis leg since 1968 you don't see these questions being posed to Mitch McConnell to Mike Johnson you don't see people chasing them down and going to their rallies going to their fundraisers and having them on a hot mic asking them any kind of questions and so it's not just simply the issue of black or black enough it's also the issue of what our community cares about which data around that evidence gathering around what our community cares about isn't even what's driving the conversation about what our community cares about right yeah I guess all of that also makes me think like whiteness can police what Blackness is but vice versa can't happen and this is just literally a manifestation of that once again but on the national stage and I I also think too it's funny it's interesting like seeing all these different like this discussions of how they've co-opted how they've been doing this um and the whiteness of police and Blackness because to to earlier about the what you said Prince about the one drop wool it's funny like they're the ones who gave us the one drop rule and I think this is also a discourse they've seen us pick up on because I think there has been a rise Nuance right to Garrison talking about why like some things in Spec specificity are positive right like there has been a rise of people talking about how um I guess black identity has been especially if you look at like how media and entertainment has replaced like black women with multi-racial you know what I mean like instead of and and you get you get a lot of that people willing to like receive a lot of like multi-racial people or as the as the face of Blackness as opposed to actual black people right it's the way Hollywood if they need a black woman they go run to like Zend and them as opposed to someone who would phenotypically look like what you would think of as a as a black woman and so I think there is there's been a rise of and I think there's Merit to those discussions of people talking about how like one drop rule or something is was racist right this is idea that like your your nasty black blood can suly the whole thing you're one drop and now you're black right and so this has become this like something that is is racist and maybe that shouldn't be how we Define blackness that has come our sense of holding on to this one drop rule because of how our lived experience you know is that if because America's racist so America your people's lived experience is that if you have one drop you received and treated as black so you have a black experience and so we you know in turn embrace you as black and now there's been I think a a conversation that keeps bubbling up of people feeling like they want to uh reshift our understanding of Blackness to be black and allow multi-racial people and biracial people to be this and because I think all these conversations are happening and they're still being fleshed out they're also able to take that because there's some Merit to discussions of that that you know what I mean and then take it to weaponize it against a kamla Harris to our detriment you know even though they see and receive and move like this and to rees's point especially about reparations is you're right reparations is a non-starter among every other candidate you know what I mean anybody that's non-black they they're never even considering it there's no reparations that they have any interest in hearing in fact they use it as like to be GST the candidate but yet it's the minute the minute a candidate is in any way a black person here we go you know what I mean let's let's and it's because they want us they know how we feel about that discussion go she can I just say Sheila Jackson Lee is not [ __ ] Sheila Jackson Lee is not FBA and she sponsored the hr40 commission every time and I I saw when the H when when the reparations commission passed in in California and I saw that group activate to say oh yeah look at we got we got them and they said that what was in Congress was [ __ ] and I literally did a word match and it was almost identical language in the hr40 commission reparations bill that Sheila Jackson Le has been sponsoring for how many however long and John coners before that and all these other folks before that it was nearly identical language but because Sheila Jackson Lee is in Congress and their their agenda is to try to uh undermine the CBC and and and try to diminish the Blackness of whole people in the CBC that wasn't good enough but what was in California was something to be celebrated about so I don't have a problem with us having these discussions but let's not be full of [ __ ] let's not be hypocritical let's not use it to try to discredit people you know people have sat up there and made videos you talked about the abuse you've had people made video saying I was molat which is a slur I'm not I got two black parents okay I had you know how many time somebody come on my page this is not a FBA person I am I don't I I don't have you know acronyms and [ __ ] in bio but but it's it's it's not about whether I am or not it's what you are putting out there to try to discredit me because we're not going to have a substantive conversation we're not going to have a conversation that's based in facts and evidence we're going to have a conversation that stays on the level of you cannot speak on this because I'm I'm ascribing this identity to you and because you have this identity then your opinion and your V your your whatever you have to say fact or not is not valuable and see that's what I have an issue when it comes to not just Comm harrris but to all discussions that we have as black people around our political advancement I literally just I was just talking to Garrison about this I actually just quote tweeted somebody yesterday somebody tweeted at me yesterday talking about when I say it's funny when I say I'm an immigrant or you know people hear my accent they act like they found something I was trying to hide from him and it's this disgusting truth like they're screaming like they're like oh well now that I know that you are you are an immigrant I am offended it is disrespectful for you to speak at all for you to have an opinion on what happens in this country or this election because I am not and it and it's it's it's it's it's interesting I get that a lot I was telling Garrison like even when I am actively advocating for the things in in service of black people or what these people want they will literally quot tweet me and be like oh I liked what she had to say until I heard that nasty ass accent you don't speak for us you don't speak for FBA you don't speak foros and it's like yeah you know what's interesting I I think um I think part of the struggle that we have uh is just not knowing about race nationality ethnicity but so I always tell people you know by racial was not a racial identity it's a racial descriptor yeah and biracial does not always mean light-skinned you think about Naomi Osaka she's quote unquote biracial if you like that term but she's not a lighter skinned woman so I think often times that we're talking about what you're referencing as far as uh all these images of quote unquote multi-racial people we're talking more about colorism yeah than we're talking about being quote unquote biracial again I'm a little bit older than y'all I you're right but I can recall when Vanessa Williams became Miss America and she had blue eyes and she was lighter skinned and it wasn't about her being by racial it was about here is this light bright woman who was now the first black Miss America then when they kicked her ass out and stripped her of that crown and treated her terribly then a lot of folks said wait a minute oh she she she she is black look at the way they're treating her so when I hear about this obsession over KLA Harris's nationality or her racial background we're really just doing a descriptor of someone's racial background but race in this country it is legal it is law it's not just a a a social choice and there are some people who I may you know the May dance around it differently but for the most part uh it is a a a a legal choice that really rules your life it's written into policy uh it's written into our everyday lives it's in the actual census according to this country we have five racial identities and though and that census rules our life as far as where funds are allocated so I think often times we're talking about biracial like it's a separate racial category as of now it's not and it's an attempt to erase someone like KLA Harris and I could be wrong if I'm wrong correct me y'all I feel like I see it more with women than I do with men yeah abolutely with Obama you heard it a little bit in the beginning but it was more about he wasn't born right he wasn't even born in this country which we know was [ __ ] yeah but with women it it's this weighing this Blood Quantum of Blackness which is straight out of the antibellum South that we're going to weigh almost some Quadro octom [ __ ] and that for me you know uh those are trappings that have always divided black Americans it's deeply deeply dangerous so again I just like to always stress that we're talking about R biracial it's not a race it's a racial descriptor and I wish that we could have that that distinction I think it'll be better to understand uh that kamla Harris is a black woman with a diverse background yeah yeah I mean I I it's it's a lot in my mind because when I'm really thinking about the function of why they're calling her out in this way I think it's to all of y'all's points like I was thinking earlier I was like oh it seems like they're saying that she chooses when she's black or weaponizes it because she's a woman and women are manipulative and they and they Cod switch or whatever and so I think there's the layer of that and and I mean that to me is like really dark and Insidious and and I I think yeah the the other function I think is H yeah it's just it's messy especially what what Jon said yeah I think it's also a desirability thing um I I'd say the way that like not as someone who doesn't who does benefit from desirability politics within black experience the way I've seen desirability with with also my Womanhood and that intersectionality as opposed to like desirability within black manhood it it just it's I haven't yet found the words but I have noticed the same thing clay and the same thing you're saying prince it's like it it's just a very specific intersectionality that happens where it's like also a lot of like black women who benefit from disability politics colorism texture Etc have weaponized that against black women in the way that I I I don't really know if that has happened within black manhood you know because that's just not an experience I had so I think that Al in a multitude of ways in and we we know Desir politics we could talk about h a whole episode on that so I think that also includ like includes the manipulation aspect that Prince you're talking about that it's like if you can get this light skinn black woman and P portray her as like she's weaponizing her Blackness she's not black you're then now removing her from her base that would support her the most which is black women yeah yeah I mean and distrusting her because I you know and I said this I just like listen I'm so glad sometimes whenever I I come out with a an opinion you know people go to bully you on the internet I'm sure y'all all know and it make you start thinking like am I tripping am I and then as it ages you're like no but I did say kamla would be would experience so many different intersections and cut-ups of these kinds of attacks right and I think what's happening here I have a video on my page called um how trans how transphobia hurts black women and hurts like sis black women in particular and in that video I talk about the way like masculinity and femininity are and the way like colorism functions and features within our community as it pertains to that right when it comes to like black men right it's like colorism always functions that there is more privilege the closer you are to White right like so that will always be true right whether men or women but when it comes to masculinity versus femininity masculinity black man the darker black man is considered more masculine more strong more this to their detriment and how colorism functions they're more criminalized more dangerous more Angry more these different things but in terms of masculinity you know what I mean that is more the desirably on a dark skinned man as opposed to a lightskinned man right like a light-skinned man doesn't threaten like masculinity in the same way but in terms of femininity right which is how black women are hurt by our traditional understandings of femininity and colorism is that because dark skin is considered more masculine more the more feminine and more desirable are light skin women and how that like functions in terms of privilege and what light-skinned women experiences in our community creates a real you know what I mean there there's an actual real problem with that and there's a real lived experience of black women you know what I mean that that that has a problem with that you know what I mean rightfully so and so it's it's it's it's easier to paint like to to take a comma like I said comma is gonna get attacked Every Which mother effing way right because then they're able to do that with her be like oh she's see you know she gets to be like a black woman but here she is that's why they're like oh look at her look they're showing you all who she dated they're showing you all her outfits they're trying to do all of these different kinds of things because there's a way to like they're trying to create animosity right and like all of it if you look at it it's all steeped in the idea that they're making her like deceitful what what it basically all the different attacks are basically on fake you know what I mean like right is this idea that like oh the the the ND The Immigrant is is a fake who's trying to take from you you know what I mean they all try to take from you so it immediately makes you see for me is like this wouldn't be happening if she wasn't viewed as a black woman it's like that's what the irony of all of it is all these attacks would not be happening from all those different angles if she was not seen as the intersectional person that she is does not include the fact that she's still benefits from certain things that has privileges in a lot of their ways and that she has there's valid critiques about but it's like you're you're doing the thing that they do to Black wom where you're you're completely derailing over here to attack her in all these different ways I I think it's also interesting in the sense of like if like it's it's they're saying that she is like like I don't know I think it's all the language how it's mixed together it's like hotties for Harris or white women for Harris and a lot of like if you if you look at how people are talking about that like they're like oh the white women are talking about how pretty she is how articulate she is and and I think there is this side of it where the right is trying to call out her racial background in order to say like she's fake but I think the next thing pass that is like it's almost like the right wants when they criticize Kamala in this way they want people to trust them in how they police Blackness and and that in turn says like she can't help you because she's gonna betray you down the line because she ain't really black but we can help you we can make America great again and so I think it's almost like the the initial step is like plant this uh idea that she's manipulative because I'm like thinking about all the like the podcast Bros and all them they're G to they're going to follow that [ __ ] and like preach it and then the next step is like oh maybe the right or the capitalists or the conservatives can really help us and so it's almost like I mean if you're looking like a tactic of they're trying to like discredit her image by making her deceitful and then telling her base to what y'all are saying like you can't really trust her because she can't really pick a side it's so obvious to us and I think that it's just it might backfire though and you know and like and I think it first of all let me just say I think it's gonna backfire and I I will say KLA is doing far better than I ever if anybody had told me prior to her announcing like but prior to this happening to Joe Buton dropping out if anybody had told me KET had been the Nom was going to be the nominee running I would have never thought it would be going as well as it's going for her right so let me just say that and I do think her team like and I'm not saying this in terms of because people don't [ __ ] understand the difference this is a comment on strategy and reality this has nothing to do with a personal endorsement you know what I mean just in terms of how she's doing her campaign they're doing it well you know what I mean they're making a they've made a lot of good like Steps right um I also think TLA what I think it my why I think it might backfire on her I think there's so much [ __ ] there's just so much [ __ ] like so much disingenuous like [ __ ] up [ __ ] that it really doesn't get you around like you you can't you don't have the time no one gets to valid critique like when I think of even when I think of like how the prosecutor discussion has been going on kamla right I and this is something you know I realized because obviously like on the left is oh she's a cop she's a prosecutor d d right like obviously I'm I'm a public defender a former public defender an abolitionist type so y'all know where I stand on belief system to some degree but I will say this T comma is credit it's like the right is going out of their way to like try to paint her like they honestly they don't even know what to do anymore because originally what they want to do is like pain her as soft on crime then they realized that like tough on crime she's smart crime smart on crime but so now but those two competing the narratives don't make sense you have to pick us you know what I mean like they're it it it doesn't make sense like they're trying to paint her as two different things both of which are not accurate you know what I mean or true or fair in the discussion and then it makes the whole discussion so stupid you know what I mean and like Superfluous I don't think it goes anywhere and I think to I was talking to Garrison about this earlier Garrison if you're here we can't see you so refresh but I was talking to Garrison about this earlier when I was explaining because we were talking about how I feel about the prosecutor thing and I I I'm going to make sure I'd say this when I was in law school I know a lot of prosecutors I went to a prosecutor Mill I know and a lot of my and I have friends who are prosecutors is like and when you ask a lot of people I went to school with why they become a prosecutor and ask me why I become a public defender a lot of us have the same answer right up until a fork in the road right so I want to be cleared that when I I don't think that anybody every black person who's a prosecutor everybody that who is a prosecutor is op by by their own choice in their soul like I'm not that that they wake up and they decide they're against the black community or something me and a person who is a black prosecutor have a disagreement on what we think is the best way to pursue that you know what I mean but that does not mean that I think if I say like oh I don't love that a kamla was a prosecutor or I don't love the idea that a bunch of people will be inspired to be prosecutors that doesn't mean an indictment on kamla's character on kamla's commitment to black people it doesn't mean that I'm saying that everything kamla did was to hurt black people or it's bad or like that and I don't think that kind of conversation is what people are having or like I said even that kind of honest conversation what I am coming from is I just I want I personally want to see us in a world where I think we divest from mass incarceration and the prison industrial complex I want to see more black people be inspired to be organizers or to do other things or to not because I just don't believe that we will based on my lived experience uh that you're going to change the system from the inside I think people who choose to be Progressive prosecutors have a massive uphill B uphill battle because the system is against them their own system does not what a progressive prosecutor by virtue has to do is to fight against even their own offices and the own mandates of these people in the system and that is very difficult and that is a hard Road and I know people who try to do it so it's not an indictment of her and I want to be clear because I think that is how like the conversation I see from the left is just like oh she's a cop oh she's a this and it's just that that's not what I you know what I mean like there are lots of black people who have come before me you know what I mean and even now who pursue things differently you know I mean they're navigating their own different Waters and how they do it and we have disagreements as to what I think is the road or how effective that I think it is and there's something that I don't care to like I don't like the the conversation when I see people be like we need this because Law and Order and this is good versus the criminal and D I don't like these particular kinds of narratives but that's not an indictment on commis Blackness or a commitment to the black community or anything I just think in general something I'm exploring I think a good book people should read is locking up our own crime and punishment in Black America by James Foreman I think in general I just want black people to move away from this belief in like tough and crime and police and prosecutors in the criminal system and I'm always skeptical of us like anything else that I think is going to add another block to that but that's not an indictment on kamla's moral character I think that's the most nuanced way I could I could put it for me and I don't see it out there so I just wanted to say that before I give it to back to the floor I think that's fair can can I can I say a couple things so I want to go back a couple points um the the conversation around KY Harris's race is not to persuade people to support Republicans yeah in 2020 there is lots of reporting about this um and and even going back to 2016 the Republicans have been running a dissuasion campaign against black Americans they literally have Cambridge analytica they have tens of millions of people's data and tens of millions of black people are marked as dissu voters so they don't even try to say Harris is black so vote for us they just want you to stay a black ass at home exact and so what kind of encourages me about this conversation is number one none of this is new this is already baked into the cake they tried all this stuff already and a lot of this was coming from the left and it was coming from the right she was getting from all angles and people say yeah I'm G get my checks and Pearls when she became the Vice Presidential nominee and now that she is and she is officially the Presidential nominee she secured the votes through a virtual roll call so she's now officially the Democratic nominee for president so she's already made history you know surely Chism tried it and now we finally got a black woman and so I'm excited about that today in particular but the whole point is that what encourages me about it is you can't put the genie back in the bottle all right a lot of the energy is out now maybe the energy might change depend on who she picks VP and people will find something to be mad about whatever situation may be but in terms of around in terms of what the energy and the momentum is around having a historic candidate reinvigorating the race and having a much different Outlook from a vast majority of the electorate not everybody I'm not saying everybody is but from a vast majority of the electorate has a much more optimistic and and different view with KLA Harris being uh being a candidate part of that is because she's a black woman part of it is just because she's not an old ass white man so either way if this is all that they got is that they're gonna just try to spend the next 90s something days litigating and trying to relitigate her racial identity I'll take that because that's not going to be what's going to move the needle as much as they think it is in 2024 when we know what at sick and then the other thing I'll say about our prosecutor record is I think that there is always valid critiques that you can make of anybody as long as they're fact-based and as a person who has studied her record I'm not just saying that I've looked at the articles that have been written about her I've literally looked at her da um her da archive versions of it I I've literally read the reports from the Attorney General's office I've read I've done original research hundreds of hours of research on it and a vast majority of what people say about her record the issues that they have with it aren't actually fact-based at all that's part of the problem and then number two they're completely dismissive of all of these things that she tried to do and they're dismissive of the context that we were living in I grew up in California so I know I was there when they passed proposition 187 I know how they when they passed the three strikes law I know how many times they they they were against de Criminal izing marijuana this idea that California is some liberal Bastion or even San Francisco was that's just not true California is actually California has like one of the largest prison system they're actually like the cited to like example for like America's policy choice to decide on mass incarceration like they made a million prisons like over the course of a night you know there they they have some of the worst like solitary confinement practices in the country like most of like when you see um um uh prisoners doing strikes and having to to do do all their organizing like you're seeing it happen in California California is actually a nightmare if California and New York are both places that are nightmares in terms of the criminal system that are painted as these Progressive liberal Utopias and it's just not true can I just add one more point though because I just want to add one more thing because to your point earlier about how Progressive prosecutors are fighting against their system one of the things I've watched um dozens of her uh AG announcements her press conferences and um one of the things that always struck me in those press conferences is every time people got up there and they talked about this has been in the work for years this has been in the work for months we do not have a system whether it's you could talk about the justice system you could talk about the legislative system there is no system in America that is designed for anything more than incremental slow change we do not have a system that is designed for radical overhaul the most radical we got is the fact that Donald Trump got three Supreme Court Justices and they like what are we GNA do whatever yall want abortion gone affirmative action gone who knows what the hell that'll be up to next so that's the most radical that the most radical that this country has been in terms of Rapid drastic change and rolling back of rights that we've won after 50 years and so what people don't understand is you can have a wish list but that wish list ticking those things off is not something somebody can do with the with the wave of a magic wand no matter how genuine and how sincere they are or a matter how revolutionary they are things take time and you don't get 100% of what you want and I think that is more like for me like I guess the Nuance on on my position on a on a commo presidency that I I don't see in the discourse right like for me um I actually was watching your prince your video today actually this morning Prince When I was thinking about this um it was like within the first two minutes and you talking about um you know why so many progresses running behind this like this is going to be what creates so much change or whatever for me I think that is what I like want to caution to people right like I think change is created by the people and I don't mean that in like an an ideological philosophical way I mean that in an actual like tangible real world like organizers way what happens is all these groups organizers on the ground they're the ones that are doing all they they they write laws they try and like Lobby around them and they eventually find like a legislator who is willing they can have an heir a sympathetic he to them and get them to coign that that's why you see like in California like I think of like the unlock the Box uh campaign to try they did the N solitary confinement act and they had Corey Bush sponsor that right so I I think obviously the reason why when I tell people like oh the Democrats I prefer the Democrats or the Republicans in power why you want to pick your weakest adversary is because the reality is in my like real life when you get the pre-trial Fairness Act in Illinois or or bail reform in New York City it's happening because organizers and the people are able to go and communicate to Democrats and those politicians who will to harar us out and support the acttion legislation and that's how we're getting the change and I know this I talk to the politicians I do it and I know and I've never been on the phone with a republican because that's not possible it's a brick wall they're not hearing anything so period That's why why my perspective has been and will continue to be that it's better for us to have comma than Donald Trump and them or whatever right that being said what I want people to not do you know what I mean even for their own for their own selves not even just because for me just so people don't find themselves disappointed is people do this thing where they act like if you're telling them you should do this or that it's in their best interest or they vote for them what you're telling them is that by voting for them that person is going to do all the things that person is going to be the person that creates the change that person is going to give you the revolution that person is going to give you that no no they're not and also that's not what I'm telling you and it's not what they're promising you and I just want us to be clear here because I don't want you to interpret like please stop interpreting progressives or or the organizers or the people who are trying to create change or who support you in the work that you're doing in the Vision that we want please stop interpreting us saying that this is to our better our best interest of in this current Dynamic to do this as me telling you that I this person is a reflection of me and my ideals that this person is going to create the change or that's what's going to happen because you're going to be upset not only are you going to be upset and disappointed but you're also not going to do the work because you've missed the part of the message that I'm trying to tell you is that it's us who have to do it right so I just want to be clear about that there are a lot of people and have it have it enjoy yourself don't let me stop you but a lot of people Carri it on like what I'm telling you they're like oh this going to be you know what I mean like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa because then you know what I mean and then what happens is when you have that mindset that this person like what anyone is promising you is that this person is gonna create revolutionary change for you or whatever have you like my Lord you know what I mean like even what they will do will not be given any credit you know what I mean and if that's the idea that you have if you're expecting the black woman because she's a black woman or whatever you've told your to mean she's going to come in and give you a progressive black woman's dream like what you think the world for black women then like you are going to have you're going to be evaluating them on this insane metric meanwhile look at what the opposition is and I think that's something America always does because even in the conversations we were having about like even when it was still Joe Biden I'm like Jesus Christ it's crazy how like Republicans the bar there is no bar there's no expectation that we have for Republicans or right is is actually crazy like Republicans can literally be planning coups you know what I mean like like in and out of impeachments you know in and out of Criminal Court they could be in front of you like immigrants gay people let's kill everybody we gonna do this we gonna give the police all of the immunity we gonna get them we gonna make it legal for you to roll them over like that's real like that these aren't even hyperbolic things like I'm not even being hyperb they're literally saying things and like the fact to me like I said it says something to me about where we're at and what we think is normal for the other side when like we don't even mention that and we're like Jesus Christ Joe Biden is a old [ __ ] answering them questions like oh [ __ ] like the fact that let just like slid past like the like the extremism and the craziness for the right is scary you know what I mean because then like we have this idea it's like we hold we we we evaluate all the work that we do not just B I'm not just talking about the Democrats I mean even about ourselves we we evaluate our movements negatively we act like everything is a failure we consider BLM a failure d defunding a failure if everything is not over now we don't give oursel credit for anything like anything we evaluate everything all our actors all our movements all our work all our discourse all our legislation in the light like least favorable to us we we analyze everything in a way that disenchants us I've noticed this consistently from like two seconds after like it's no reason why people carry on like black lives matter is done or defund the police was a fail or we haven't gotten anywhere I'm like this should happened four years four years ago and do you see how we've changed the discourse you see all the different things we've done look at all the different kinds of I'm like we got the pre-trial Fairness Act in in in Illinois we've gotten rid of cash bailing places we've done all kinds of amazing things but because we we insist on like analyzing ourselves like all of our things in this light we never see progress and then we get disenchanted and we don't move and we criticize oursel and we allow this other extremist side to just be momentum momentum momentum you know what I mean I just I I just want to caution us on that Prince I see your face I think I want to push back agree in a lot of ways but I think for me as an abolitionist it's really hard to have ex or we can all say it was really hard to experienced 20 it was really hard to experience 2020 go into my city get beaten up by police one girl here in Ohio died after being exposed to tear gas so many amazing subversive intense demands along this long list of what abolition should be and now four years later we're being encouraged to vote for a black Asian woman who's a prosecutor and so I think if you even just look at it optically there's something weird there for me where I'm where where where I'm kind of where and and and and and so that can exist but I also think the other thing is like what I really fear is that I I think about the James baldon quote where he says like a cop is a cop no matter who they are like they might be a nice guy but all I know is that they have a gun I don't have the time to find out and so I that's how I feel about Cala because I'm like and and I I do respect what you're saying reei in terms of like I think a lot of people like she's a cop she's a prosecutor so because even for me from researching her more I do see over the years like she's had certain policies and there's been certain headlines and she's gone back and been like that was a mistake or I shouldn't have done that or like things could have gone differently but I don't trust politicians and I think that we're being asked to trust these people and there's this I mean but but I think on some level like that's the language around like why some people are saying like voting for her is harm reduction where it's like so I'm supposed to trust this person to lead this next era of what like a better version of America you're not being asked I don't think you are being asked at and I I think it's a lot of the language and the guilt that comes around how some people are speaking about voting for Kamala I'm not saying that that's in this conversation but I do think like I don't see how voting for her and waiting for whatever her version of America is is helping us get but no one's asking you to do that and I think that's the exact opposite of everything I just said and like I I think we talk a lot as black people like I think and this has been a discussion my entire black life of like symbolic wins how we feel about Sy symbolic wins and I think something I want to introduce to it like and we've always talked about the harm of symbolic win symbolic things black history month or Obama and all these I think I want to talk about the harm of symbolic losses you know what I mean I think that's where I'm at now who gives a in terms of our actual progress on as a movement and where abolition has come and what we are actually doing like the idea that like oh you're being asked to vote for KLA as a cop and commas who gives a [ __ ] in the last four years we eliminated we eliminated uh cash bail in in Illinois altogether we passed historic bail reform in in in New York City we have done that we introduced the N solitary confinement act in California we have been doing [ __ ] like that all over the country we are experiencing all kinds of wins who gives a [ __ ] about this symbolic loss of like you're being asked to vote for a cop I think it matters I think it matters if people are actually angry about what she's done what she represents and but are they are they actually saying what they're angry about they I haven't heard one discussion not even from my own educated friends and people point out what other than just saying she is a prosecutor you know what I mean like they're not saying what the they're mad about or anything policy to have parents get locked up if their kids didn't go to school she passed a book called smart on crime where she's paring Progressive language but still doing fearmongering about crime in communities and saying that policing is necessary because of that while also passing more reformist things in the background I think that contradiction should be articulated and I don't think you're and I I don't think we totally disagree with each other but I think there is a contradiction in how Democrats can use more Progressive language and then we have to wait to see if they actually perform their like Progressive bit in office and I think with electoralism what I struggle with is I don't think people are willing to fight enough to push her and I and I and and I don't think that's the inherent truth but that is my fear and my personal difficulty with like I don't think the change we're going to get especially when it comes to policing like policing in the criminal system the factual matter is most of what happens in policing in the criminal system in America does not happen on a federal level it's not happening on a federal level in the first place there is very little that happen that's Happ in terms of our fight and abolition and criminal justice that happens in the federal level so there's no reason why we have this focus on the presidential election when it comes that I am not and I don't think anybody is like promising that KLA is going to be I think you're right I want to say this like the Democrats are not the Democrats are not pro- abolition the Democrats are not pro abolition the Democrats are not pro uh dismantle the criminal system they are not pro even massively reform the criminal system nobody and I I'm at least I am not arguing that and I'm not sure I don't think anybody else on the call is but I think um that's not what they're promising and that's not where we're going to get there and I think that's fair if you want if if we we want to critique that we're not going to get that from them what all I am saying is in terms of the only people that are pro- abolition that are pro getting rid of the criminal system that are pro these things are the organizers on the ground are the organizers and the people and the they don't have a chance in hell at being able to pass [ __ ] or get through to what kind of control and power if we let another if there's another Donald Trump Administration what will happen on the Supreme Court what will happen on all of the all of the different courts throughout the nation that he can that he can appoint what will happen in terms of the other Republicans will be the rise of this there will be a brick wall between us and Progressive legislation and things that we want to do so no I am not saying I I have criticized you could find it a laundry list of criticisms of the Democrats and their support of policing Joe Biden and what Joe Biden wanted more police put more money into policing I have said that I believe that KLA will be a more competent version of this Administration all these different things I think you're absolutely right I just think in actuality in the meaningful way that it really really matters they don't matter and that doesn't matter to what we're doing and we keep having that conversation to me instead of the reality is the real Progressive [ __ ] that we want to do the actual divesting from the criminal system the initiatives that do that like I say like getting rid of cash bail all these different things we can't do that with a republican stalemate can I can I just correct though when you talked about treny triny had been a prosecutable offense in California since 1977 that was not a concept that Comm Harris created she never prosecuted uh parents of children children the law that she helped usher in actually um actually resulted in the most punitive jurisdictions people who had prosecuted 500 cases in the Years preceding the law actually dropping down to three cases over the course of six years and so what she actually did around truancy was not to be more punitive it was actually to tackle the root cause and get more resources for parents and for students and it was actually Governor Jerry Brown that vetoed three of the initiatives that she tried to get ushered in to get even more resources so a lot of the conversation around treny is I understand the discomfort with some of the language that was 20 years ago people didn't talk in the same Progressive language that we talk about now but if you look in terms of the policy we can talk about Olay you've mentioned multiple times now getting rid of cash bill that was one of her uh bills that she that introduced and on a bipartisan way got got ran Paul to support it was to incash Bill at the federal level when she became Senator part of her work what she was trying to do was to make make it so that public defenders were equally as funded as prosecutors there are so many things that she did around women in incarceration there were so many things that she's done for criminal justice that don't even get talked about a lot of this Progressive wish list outside of abolition she's not an abolitionist I'm not I'm not going to lie to you oh you know K gonna get in there get locked up people gonna get locked up she locked [ __ ] up she prosecuted people she was in a prose she was in a room the prosecution room locking [ __ ] up because she was she was Prosecuting people for child rape and molestation in some cases murder so I'm not gonna sit up here and lie and act like well come ain't for people getting locked up if you did the crime she gonna have your ass locked up now that's something that's a red line I respect that that's a red line there's no abolitionist candidate on the ticket on either party but I still respect people's red lines I'm not want to argue with nobody about their red lines but when I look at this is why o and I said this last time I was on your show let's talk specific policies because when we talk specific policies on average the wish list that people have she's addressing it or she has a position on it and it's not me take take my word for it I can point to a specific piece of Senate legislation I can I can point to a specific uh hearing where she's testified in I can point to work that she's doing as vice president I can point to reports that have nothing to do with anything that she said but just reporting on her efforts so I think there's a difference between talking about in theory what we're going to get and talking about specifics and the last thing I'll say is making Comm and Harris the face of disillusionment and and and and and and dis disgruntled um attitudes about the lack of progressive progress when we have as I mentioned on your show before oh like 500,000 elected officials in this country 500,000 we have 23 states with Republican trifectas we have one one glaring example was what this Administration tried to do around lead water or our water infrastructure Tate Reeves the governor and CLA talked about this many of times who who came up with confederate heritage month was sitting up there blocking money ail from the federal government to the city of Jackson Mississippi so they were boiling hot water when they had been hundreds of millions of dollars or tens of millions or whatever the number was that was trying to go there so all I ask is that if we if we're g to talk about policy let's get specific we're GNA talk about the record let's get specific maybe it's right maybe it's wrong I personally had a problem with some of the way that KLA responded about the critiques against her because I was like actually that ain't right you're apologizing for some [ __ ] that didn't even happen but you know that's me being nitpicky I think her team sometimes thought it was easier to just say sorry and move on yeah I mean I I agree with a lot of what you're saying but didn't she literally like advocate for those policies like to me I'm like was that fabricated or like no what what what policies specifically the truy policies that that made parents culpable if their kids didn't go to school no she she the truy had always been a against the law for since 1977 when she was a prosecutor what she talking about San Francisco prosecutor she did advocate in terms of let's use this law as a way to force people whose kids are missing 20 30 40 days or however whatever the the percentage is um U of school and so she did use the law because as the as the prosecutor that's all you have she wasn't you know the mayor or something like that so she had the powers within her prosecution office and her tactics okay yeah I can understand why somebody says I don't like that she sent the letter saying if you kids don't go to school uh you going to go to jail I can understand that somebody don't like that but the bottom line is the kids got at school nobody went to jail so we can quible with tactics think that's the part that I have a problem with because I'm like if we support abolition we shouldn't be supporting criminalization I understand that and like I said if that's your red line line for me that's fine but I'm just saying that's different to say she shouldn't have sent a letter this way she should shouldn't have talked in this way that's a different critique versus saying she locked up parents for treny or that's a different critique than saying because of her people were locked up for treny when neither of those particular statements are true it's true that she sent letters it's true that she said stuff and maybe she people don't like I'm put it to I'mma put it to Y let's face this is exactly me Prince and reesei is like I'm right in between y'all on exactly why this is what I said why I ultimately don't like the idea of more people being inspired to be prosecutors because of what ree is talking about right now the actual just like reality of the system that you work in you know what I mean will have you having to do or say or operate in a way that maybe is not you know what I mean does not you know express your ideals or what you want on my Progressive ideals um I will and and to this this is what I'm I'm going to say with like um what they can do I like the DC crime Bill the that's what I call it uh with mayor Bowser marriel Bowser and DC pass early this year right I criticized that all over public like social media and I when when the politician when some of the lawmakers who were writing the law reached out to me to to talk to me I let them have and explain to them exactly why every provision I think is this why I'm saying what I'm saying publicly about it what I think is wrong with it and what have you whatever and they made some tweaks still a up law still a DC crime Bill still calling it that still opposing it but it's still worth while for what you can accomplish if I can make it my attitude wouldn't have been like when they called me my attitude wasn't oh no I'm not going to speak to y'all cuz y'all you know what I mean cuz like you know what I mean I'm not even going to try to get you to do something a little bit better you know what I mean I'm still against you you're the offs I'm still calling this the DC crime bill but I'm going to try my best to with the tools that I have try to at least get a little bit of something or whatever it is that we have so I still feel I feel a lot of like what you feel Prince you know like I said I I don't want us to be I don't like prosecutors you know or all these different things and I agree with you on the federal can I just add really quick um I do want more prosecutors and I'll tell you why um I used to feel I do want more prosecutors um and I used to feel exactly the way that that y'all feel um about three years ago I began doing a show on my serious exam uh a show called exonerated and I've been interviewing people who've been wrongfully convicted and nearly every single person where their case was finally overturned it was because a progressive prosecutor often times a black prosecutor sometimes even a white dude like Larry ker in Philadelphia got into office and fought for justice I I don't like the idea of none of us being in that space and literally the exonorees that I've spoken to 30 40 years behind bars they said thank God for this prosecutor that came in in Wayne County in Michigan in Chicago in Philly in Cali so when I had that experience and them in tears on the phone saying I hope more people vote I can recall when um this guy Jimmy Dennis 25 years in death throw in Philadelphia he said when Trump got into office my lawyers went into overtime doing EV I'm sorry he was the the president-elect did everything we could to try to get me in front of other judges because we knew it was a wrap when Trump got into office so the exonorees that I've spoken to they have totally reinvented my perspective on prosecutors and lastly I'll add um I feel everything that you're saying Prince I get it I understand where you're coming from I think for me I a black man I a black gay man my community is disproportionately impacted by HIV I saw healthc care get shut down all throughout the South um I saw nonprofits get shut down due to the previous administration with my intersections and I respect what you're saying completely my very right to exist and my community's right to exist could be damn near non-existent I have friends who live in Georgia who are considering moving out of Georgia because of their of their right to exist so the state has always tried to kill us so of course it has but but but listen we still have we have to protect ourselves regardless I'm also of the same identity pocket that you mentioned but I get that but literally the threat that my community saw under Bush under under Trump there was a distinct difference under Obama and this is just my experience yours could be different there was a distinct difference under Obama and B my number one issue is Healthcare that is always my number one issue and so that's another lens that I see it see it as well but I'm sorry I just wanted to add the thing about what I learned from the Exon around prosecutors oh you can I one I thinking I I'm sorry I say this real quick I don't think that anybody's asking anybody to emulate the language of 2004 but then to also say a person who has evolved in terms of their language and the con language they would use now that now it's disingenuous or why should I trust you the same reason why you trust anybody who has evolved over the past 20s something years and who has evidence of they're evolving and who still has the policies that or there's a consistent thread of the policy so I just want to point nobody is saying that anybody should go and and look at old KLA Harry speeches from 2004 and be like yeah yeah let's go talk about locking up parents of treny but then again but then also like let's recognize the way that she talks is drastically different even there I don't think her policies are drastically different because I don't think they were they were never as bad as people put it out there to be they were always Progressive but I don't think you can say we don't want people to imitate that language but then also she changed her language so she's full of [ __ ] I just think that's a disconnect but I'm sorry don't know I'm in listening I'm listening I feel like I'm in the middle I really look I'm trying to figure how the I'm in the middle too I'm very much I'm very much like smack dab like I wasn't feeling no type of Hope with with Biden being the candidate and I did feel Su me and she she could a little bit when you know he dropped out I was like oh [ __ ] like this really kind of like affected the election whether whatever happens that moment really is something historic and I saw people engage again which I think is the perfect time regardless of how you feel you could not vote for her you could vote for her but people engaged again and that momentum is super important to get people to do the organizing that you know o is talking about whether they again vote for her or not I think everybody on this panel isn't saying I thinki un I I don't want to not not educated in the way of like oh to to be like academic elitism but just the reality that right now the critical thinking skills in America are like disaster ly low I think among certain groups everything that we're saying is like yeah no one's saying that but talking to other people who might not know like I've learned some things on this line I'm educated as hell but I learned some things on this on this call alone I think a vast majority of people are not and they're using that very like snippet of language that we all are talking about to get people to like be on one side very quickly and that is I mean that's part of like political strategy we only have a couple months till the till the election which is why it was really [ __ ] annoying that Biden didn't drop off before because we could have maybe had more time to kind of combat the things about K Harris's record um so I think like as I again I'm in the middle too and I am leaning more towards like actually voting for her but I vote I that's a whole other thing I saw your tweets on that I think um the balance that I'm struggling to to find and I'm realizing for the first time that I think is we have been really critical on what change happens and who who told us to be critical on how we have Progressive change and critical of ourselves white supremacy told us to be critical on ourselves number one number two I do think sometimes there are there are people who are like oh don't don't have any type of critique because if you you critique her in an ounce because she's a black woman blah blah blah blah and what we're seeing it'll just deter people right away and they won't interrogate further I think the language of how we critique is what kind of needs to be the shift and it could be what I'm really happy that I'm seeing more of that I haven't really seen in other elections and granted I'm 20 I'll be 29 so there's only been a few elections I've been able to vote in but I remember I remember when Obama first got elected is that people are finally being like you know what I can vote for Kamala but and I'm going to push on this and I'm going to push on this and I'm not voting because I align with her I'm voting for the environment that I want to work in and that type of language I think being championed among whether you're liberal LEF is Progressive is what's really been exciting for me um and realizing that we're all just we're we're all coming from a position of where we feel is the best what I haven't liked is people thinking that how you feel about this election is like that's your moral superiority we're all victims of the same system everything inated as self-expression like if you think that that anyone here is is trying and a big ugly Boogie bad guy like let's be serious people are doing what they think is the best and what they have the tools and what they have the resources to do some people might have the tools and capacity resources to be a prosecut I don't have to be that some some people might have the tools and resources to be full on abolition abolitionists then they can do that the Judgment of kind of like what you feel like you can do as long as you're not like it there's a difference I'll end on this I know we like to bring up Harriet and Harriet has to people bring you know leave people behind and [ __ ] but there is a distinct difference in having to leave people behind because they are actively like against your livelihood and perpet uating these things that are against their own livelihood to try to weaponize a semblance of power over other people and people just ignorant and they need to be talked to and they need to have a a little bit of Hope and if you can't differentiate between those two groups then I think there's some faultiness in that as well and that I think is what's being highlighted in her being like the nominee now yeah it is frustrating like there really isn't any any Nuance like I I had tweeted this I feel like KLA when the minute kamla became the nominee everybody like black men and women were signed up for the campaign you know what I mean and if you are not like act you know jumping up high enough like you you're in trouble you know what I mean and if you even like just for me personally I haven't even felt like I've been critiquing KLA I don't feel like I've even offered a comma critique this whole time I don't think I've gotten an opportunity to the discourse because I've just been trying to talk about what K is up against and people are perceiving you even talking about what she's going to deal with in the race as negativity as a critique of her and it's like I'm not even critiquing her I'm not even getting around to that yet I'm talking about just like the landscape right um and I guess the only last thing I want to say is to something like what clay was saying about uh prosecutors this is the thing this is this is this is the thing very few like there are very few like exonerated people and there are very few even like when you think like divisions at P Prosecutor's offices to handle it you know what I mean to handle because they don't want to that's when you think about it that's an error on their part that's not something they want to do and what often happens right like something I experienced a lot especially when I worked in Brooklyn is you get in the criminal court and the court officers are black and the judge is black and the prosecutor is black and the defendant is black and you're black and everybody all the other people don't give a like I remember this one time this black man an old black man had a seizure like he was the defendant he had a seizure and he fell they let his head like hit the ground and I watched the black Court officers the black prosecutor and the black judge not give a [ __ ] like go to Shackle a seizing black man and something like I've very often when I get in court and I know every black public defender I know who feels like this the last thing I want to see is a black prosecutor or a black judge like that the last thing I want to see very often they are not our [ __ ] allies I cannot even think of one in my entire practice one I don't can't even think of one black prosecutor I've ever that would have been like yeah that's a good one or judge not once not never not never in fact I've had like that's actually the opposite experience that I tend to have and so and the reason for that is it's not that they all signed up to like in their world they all began an Blackness like to what I was saying earlier about law schools and how you're educated to be a part of their systems they educate you out of progressiveness you know what I mean like I said I went to a prosecutor Mill they try to fight you from this direction they teach you to believe in the system they teach you to perceive you know people this way they teach you to perceive it So eventually you don't even realize it's like a running joke amongst public defenders that the worst the most like tough on crime worst judges are former public defenders you know what I mean and like black people talk about how often black people in the system we know it James Baldwin to Prince talking about it earlier how Black Ops be the worst you know what I mean they feel like they have to show out and do uh the worst in the system me and even more sometimes exactly me and my boyfriend always laugh my little sister is um my little sister is a she works for a college and she be there dashing dreams child like she she run the money like man's the money and me and my little like every time she called like me and my boyfriend start our progressing people [ __ ] she be like I got a job I'm getting promoted I'm doing this whatever and we always talk about like that's what the system like with the whole fun of a systemic problem the system teaches you to feel like especially when the system is against you a white supremacist system teaches black and marginalized people that we have to overcompensate we have to do even more to ascend in those systems so very often we turn into the worst Ops so I'm always worried as why I was saying why I worry about a world where a pro a comma I want like I worry about the the effects of people feeling inspired to go down this route because what they're educated on that run how they're taught they don't often become like you run into their a one and a you get those good like black ones who do great things they're always going to be them but they be in the minority and the like school you got to go to to even be that like when I think about me as a public defender I've always said this I'm not representative of your average public defender and I feel like the rise of public defenders like me on social media in the last like four or five years has led to public defenders maybe getting a little bit of a better you know uh uh but like spin I think we've always had a worse spin like than is deserved because I think the system intentionally wants people to instead of vilifying the legislators and the prosecutors and the judges making the choices they make you hate the attorney that being said I still think the average public defender isn't maybe isn't all as Progressive as me or for the clients what I think actually like in my class at legal aid we were actually the result of them feeling like that getting criticism for it not being that like I remember legal aid y'all don't know this because this is a world of public defender [ __ ] legal legal aid is the biggest oldest uh Public Defense organization in the country but Bronx Defender Services in uh started giving us a run for our money in their Progressive stuff they took this holistic approach and they started becoming the face of like Progressive Public Defense and legal a didn't like that [ __ ] so my year they went and they hadn't hired like a black public defender while they had they had a whole class of people like me and my friend and Sh like there's Mad Black public defenders in my class and we're all like this and they couldn't stand us at the organization you know what I mean like you just like everybody's like I remember when I got to my offices and like these older public defenders were pissed the off that we had to like reconsider the collateral consequences of your client's case like my class of attorneys was was educated to like not do something that would up your client's immigration case if they're an immigrant or their immigr status the older public defenders were pissed I remember one of my first one of my first favorite clients was um I got him I had actually been covering for this old white lady i' been covering her case the guy the client had like six cases and I ended up like he asked me to sit down I was just supposed to call his case in a journey and he asked me to talk to him right quick so I sat out outside and talk to him and real he was going through a bunch of [ __ ] and so then I asked I was like you know let me take these cases I I asked her like hey can I get these cases of course let her give up six cases she was like yeah take them but then so that was like Friday and like it wasn't uh so on the weekend I'm working on the case I go and I request like Social Work services for her for him but she was like still on the case in the system she had me an email cursing me the out about how dare be getting social work for these guilty clients and I'mma learn on and how and that's saw a lot of them will so I say this to say you'll be shocked by how like how very much the system on both sides is pro you know this way so I'm always worried like when me I don't i' be scared of people hear and not like let me go be a prosecutor let's go get more prosecutors and then they go and they go right to these law schools that teach them to be the Ops and these organiz can I ask you a question though so are you saying that you don't believe any black folks should be prosecuted no I'm not saying that any black people shouldn't be prosecutors we have a we have a system that exists right like exists I think people do their best or whatever have you I don't think I think they're going to be ones who go be good but when in terms of it's the way we is it is it wrong for some black people to want to be basketball players or rappers no should do we like that every black person when a bunch of people people are feeling pushed to be in that direction no exactly so for me it's like I'm not inherently saying oh we shouldn't have any black prosecutors or we shouldn't have any black people that try and like fight from that side or whatever I just want to divorce us a little bit from that being our plan a you know what I mean from so many of us thinking that's the way let's do it if we have more black cops if we have more black prosecutors but we just have more we want Tim Scot we don't want we don't want Tim Scots and Clarence Thomases to be prosecutors and judges and cops absolutely I'm with you can I also say can we can we can we stop erasing that she was the second black woman to be US senator that she's the sitting Vice President of the United States she's running to be president and so I think that what I believe more people will be inspired to believe that they can grow up one day to be president or vice president or US senator as opposed to people wanting to be a prosecutor I think that the the emphasis on her prosecution and granted I think it's clever that now she's leaning in because she's up against a person who has 34 felonies I mean I if you if she didn't do that I would think that would be political malpractice to not make that contrast I don't think she's wrong to do it but it is like I can show you them comments like I have so many people in my comments screaming about law in order and how good it is that we hav't heard because it shows that we are the we actually the law in order and he's the criminal and this is why this is good like I have people in my comments actively being like it's good like people have they've let go of that that anti- policing stuff and da D and they're acting like this is a return to form you know what I mean so I'm not it's not a it's not a criticism of KLA and like like I've said I think KLA has not been given the benefit of KLA does not get the benefit of actually getting to be represented or even like criticized or praised for her actual self you know what I mean our actual fullness of or the fullness of the record right so like it's not even comma I'm just talking in terms of the narratives you know what I mean like what is being fed and what those have because those have real how we brand things how we receive things as a community has such like a major impact on how we feel and how we move you know what I mean like Obama's black Excellence you know what I mean Obama and with that and how we felt about that and that black fem all those things we still people still love that there's a reason they still celebrate that people point to these things so I'm not it's not of her it's not a criticism of that it's not talking even about like saying that she hasn't done a million other things or she won't be inspired in these ways I'm just talking about the way I know people are going to attach how they're taking this prosecutor Law and Order and this to mean this and how they're contrasting that with our movements to say like oh see you know what I mean we're getting back to Law and Order we're getting back to this that's only my own my worry not about her it's about the the social implications I guess I think that's a fair point but it's also when she ran in 2019 as a progressive prosecutor with the receipts of being Progressive the progressive folks ripped her ass apart so it wasn't a good political strategy to run as a reformist person to run as a progressive person to point out no cash Bill to point out all the things that she did that were actually Progressive that weren't popular at the time and that a lot of people have co-opted and so when we talk about completely Fair Point obviously we don't want to um for the purposes of our society become more CTI we don't want to talk about more U punitive things more policing and things like that as a political strategy yeah for this election she wouldn't have been able to run any other way because of the critiques against her usually not fact-based in some cases yes because she's not an abolitionist she would have never been able to run any other way when she tried her ass was ripped apart and so I get it but this is the only practical reality because even the people that want to see the language and want to see the progressive policies would never have accepted her language and they would not have accepted her as being the right voice for that and the evidence is the 2019 campaign you right and what's Garrison thinking what's Garrison Garrison been nodding a whole lot I'm making a lot of facial expressions you know I mean appreciate it I think here's what I think I think that KLA Harris has a very clear and I mentioned this last time we were on I was on your show Olay that she has a very clear political change theory which is that she believes you can change it from the inside that's what she believes and to be honest with you she's been effective it's worked it's allowed her to get to places where she's been able to lead um what I believe to be both Progressive change and meaningful change in ways that we're living through the benefits of um right now and so I think my you know I don't want to use the word critique but my question I think to those who are maybe launching um trying to push her from especially from the left is that in many ways it feels like you all or those folks who are doing that are outside of the political process it really feels like if I'm you know thinking about the way that that vice president K Harris is who's which voices she's listening to the voices on the left almost seem as though they've seed their vote that they've said I'm not voting for a person who isn't all the way to you know whatever place whether that's abolition or ceasefire to the to the you know to the net all of that and so it feels as though you've almost kind of given away the opportunity to push this very powerful political candidate one of only two running in this country and and so i' I've always kind of wondered what is the political change theory or strategy behind that particular position and I think the the other thing you know we talk about harm reduction a lot but if you look at and I would be remiss if we don't mention project 2025 like if you look at the plans from the people who are closest to Donald Trump who have advised Donald Trump who were part of his administration those people are deeply hostile to progress around policing they believe that the Department of Justice should never investigate police misconduct which is how we know that Missouri and Baltimore and like that that's how we know about Ferguson that's how we know about Baltimore police departments that's how we know that these police departments have targeted every single time the Department of Justice um studies a police department they find that they're racist like that's just how we know it and they want to stop that from ever happening and so it feels like with the choices before us I I really want us to kind of keep the main thing the main thing and it feels like the choices before us are are fairly clear for the ends that we wish to see achieved yeah oh real rap bars I feel like we got a show anybody got any any any last words any final words there's not enough time I I I'll just say I I I invite critique on vice president KLA Harris but be receptive to the response be receptive to the facts I've been doing this for five years now and in my experience a lot of people have had an aha moment like oh okay so what I heard wasn't right or oh okay now that you explained that a lot of people find a lot to get behind I I will respect everybody's Red Line clay you and I we talked about this yesterday on your show on and when people asked about Gaza if that's your red line that's cool I'm not gonna say vote for the black woman who cares about Gaza if that's your red line that's your red line whatever your red line is that's fine but if we're going to talk about critiques then all I just ask is let's come to the table with with the specifics and let's be receptive to the facts whichever way they sway then let that be what dictates the the end result and not just what we want to be committed to understanding about Comm Harris yeah I mean I I won't add too much but I feel like as an abolitionist I'm like is she G to stop cop cities or she gonna fold to what is already political her to be baby she's not she is not and but but that's that's what I'm saying in terms of my own what I see of the future I don't trust her and I don't trust the political and I also think for me abolition I believe in divestment and making changes in reform from the inside and doing that but I also think we need to burn prisons down so I think it's like different strategies but I get what y'all are saying I I and again I want to make CL baby I agree like I like I like I understand where you're like she's not she's not going to she's not gonna be like Op City like she's not GNA come out here with me on like Eric Adams and like like they're not going like she's not I'm gonna in in in if she wins like if she wins thank God we'll have held off a project 25 and then we'll be critiquing the [ __ ] that I don't like there that we be we'll be talking [ __ ] about that she'll make some statement help about protesters a while out or blah blah blah they gonna make they gonna do all the things that get on on on Earth it's gonna it's going to happen and I think it's important for like for me I just want to make sure I communicate to people that thinking first of all foremost do it everybody wants I can't vote I done told you I'm aant I cannot vote anyway so you know and do what you want with your vote you know what I mean um I just want to be clear that to the people who like want my opinion you want my perspective you know what I mean if I'm if I'm offering it to you I think it makes the most sense to do to to to go that route then what is the other option or or Donald Trump but that doesn't mean I'm not telling you to put your faith in her I'm not telling you vote for her does not mean deify her vote for her does not mean put your faith in her vote for her or vote for the Democrats or something none of that means that I'm just telling you to pick the people that it's going to be easiest for you to get an ear to you see what I'm saying for you to even be able to explain your perspective or how you like accomplish even a little bit of you of what you want like that's all all it is like they're not I'm not expecting any of them to align with you or say all the things or be a self none of that none of that so I just want be clear I'm not nobody's cherleader for the Democrats or kalala anybody but the [ __ ] Republicans and what Donald Trump and them are going to be on like just factually what they're going to be on we're we're dealing with what they were on last time and they haven't chilled out yet like they just got started they was just getting they got Amy con Barett in and October they was just warming up so let me tell you all done impeached Trump twice took him charged him took him to court convicted he if he win he going show his ass like like you think he gonna let y'all get opportunity to vote again absolutely abely not they the Republicans are really they're idiots let's be clear um but they're so organized the one thing I get they ate that one little thing is these mother organized behind they hate you've never seen nobody hate as as good as that it's really crazy because you know what it is to what reei was saying earlier Republicans show up Republicans show the up that's why their strategy is never to win us over or to get us to vote for them is to not show up they just need to disenchant us cuz Republicans going to be out in big numbers you trust that that's all it is real quick real quick I went to I went to I was in DC for like a um [ __ ] was this a fellowship women in Congress Fellowship in 2017 and we had they I had to go visit the Republican National Committee and I really did not want to be on that exerion but we did and we went saw their headquarters and we were be able to ask them questions about the 16 election so we came in like so what the like what the is that not to mention there was one room where all the black people in the RC were working and they had ego spirituals on I swear to I swear on my life they were in a corner office you walked through all the black the only black people in the entire mother headquarters building they were there and I swear there was weight in the water plan I was like this is insane but anyways so we asked them their strategy for 2016 and they straight up told us they were like we were really tired I'm paraphrasing and co- switching we were tired of losing we took data research and all the resources the last four years to make sure we were not going to lose 2016 again and whoever looked like they were going to be able to get the people to vote for them they were going to get everything even if the Pelicans himself didn't like if you we remember correctly 2016 when Trump Republicans did not like Trump they really did not like him but the moment they realized damn he's going to be able to get the popular vote he's going to be able to to get the win for us they rallied behind them even and they they cut all people started dropping from the r from from being a republican candidate and the issue was the Democrats were still there were so many people trying to win the the candidacy for being like the de uh the nominee for Democrats they thought it he was so extreme that there was no way he was going to win but the Republicans rallied behind the moment they realized he was going to be the one that would get them to win and ever since then that's what they've done like I want to be care remind you when when Trump first became a thing mad Republicans didn't didn't like him didn't with him like considered him like they didn't like that the same way people be like oh Democrats in America and liberals don't like like Trump's extremist racism and stuff the Republicans didn't like it either they had like a Playbook of little much yeah they didn't like the like buffoonery to it you know what I mean they liked the they liked the way it they used to package it right so a lot of them didn't care for it like let's not forget like the tea party was kind of like that offshoot for them the wild Republicans and they've taken over the tea party has taken over and what the rest of the Republicans realized was get down or lay down like this is what we got this is what we change and they got behind their boy you know but you know whatever thank you y'all y'all are amazing thank you glad we got to get a lot of energy out this was really good I love that I love oaying friends and I finally I finally got clay and reesi I'm so excited and Garrison made their Garrison aons made their second appearances love it I always appreciate being on it's always good to be with you all [Music]
