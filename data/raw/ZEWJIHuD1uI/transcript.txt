what's up guys sean here and today we're gonna talk about Adam ruins everything Adam ruins everything is a college humor slash truTV series where Adam supposedly debunked myths and truisms that most of us accept proving them false with facts and data however in a recent episode of Adam ruins everything entitled black people are being left out of the gun control conversation Adam and truTV fail on every level in fact there were so many mistakes missteps errors in this video it's actually difficult for me to find out how to start my video in response to it now I'm going to put together a well researched refutation of the facts and figures presented in Adam ruins everything and basically shame him and the truTV research staff because again I'm one person not an entire staff and I managed to debunk almost all of the claims in this video but since the primary function of this video is actually to virtue signal about race and show how woke Adam ruins everything is my wife is black oh no I just became one of those people Eva I'm sorry I I had no idea it's not her responsibility to talk about it it's our responsibility as a country but I Drive with my weapon every day that's not against the law that's where I'm gonna start because not surprisingly they manage to mess this up too and the problems with this sketch start immediately with the framing device for those of you unfamiliar with the series Adam ruins everything usually starts with some type of framing device to set the stage for Adam to come in and ruin everything so when he did the episode about how diamonds are a scam it would be two people shopping for an engagement ring Emily how sweet when he did the episode about how mattresses are really all owned by the same company the person would be at a mattress store maybe's Cathy Mauricio Lee single mother very busy always you following good because the framing device in this episode is so cringy so poorly thought-out that it actually produces a great number of negative racial and gender stereotypes so real quick this woman is married to this woman and this guy is one of their fathers and one of their father-in-law's now this YouTube channel is ultra progessive so we're not gonna assume which woman this man is the father of because honestly I have no idea I can't tell that's how woke and progressive I am so the way the scene is set up these two have been arguing since they were at the household in the course of the conversation the white woman makes a comment about how her wife left and she didn't seem too pleased about the direction of the conversation why did I even get all upset and just leave and we're gonna dub this stereotype number one overly emotional woman now this is all set up for Adam who is the host of the show to later hand over the show to this woman all right white Urkel I'll take it from here which leads us to stereotype number two one black person represents all black people and is knowledgeable about all black issues Adam according to the logic of the show ruins everything because he is the quote-unquote expert he's the intellectual but his knowledge is inferior to some random black woman because she happens to be black the presupposition that black people are automatically qualified to talk about quote-unquote black issues is racist you're saying that their race gives them some kind of inherent knowledge even though there's no basis for that which leads us to stereotype number three where Ava is angry that she is now expected to explain these issues to white people so we're not my responsibility to teach white people to own races s history now this wouldn't be a problem if the white people we were talking about in this scenario were anybody else except her actual family while it makes perfect sense to not want to engage in an uncomfortable conversation with random strangers getting angry at your wife aka the person you chose to marry for ask me how you think and feel about something makes you seem like an angry person in general hence the angry black woman stereotype which leads us to the final negative stereotype that truTV presents because they're trying to be so we're not my responsibility to teach white people do racist ass history all right white Urkel I'll take it from here after Ava says it's not her responsibility to teach white people their own racist history she then proceeds to take over the show to teach white people their own racist history so add a rational woman to the list of stereotypes presented by the woke people at truTV so woke you're actually pretty gosh-darn raices Bravo round of applause all right now that we've covered that we're gonna burn through the beginning part of this video a little bit because honestly it's in the mostly true category in the early years of our country many colonies and states had laws barring Native Americans and free black people from buying or owning guns yes a lot of the initial gun restrictions were put into place for racial reasons we've all heard about poll taxes which were meant to deter poor minorities from voting while gun permits originally served the same function oh yes many leftist policies are deeply rooted in the racist history of the Democratic Party and religious fears of black people that continued to inform our gun control laws in 1960s California the Black Panthers resisted police violence in Oakland by patrolling the city with guns lawmakers responded by passing a bill that banned open carry the bill applied to all Californians but it was meant to blatantly target the Black Panthers and that bill was signed by then California governor and NRA member Ronald Reagan Adam then just takes a shot at Ronald Reagan while minimizing the bombings and all the crimes of the Black Panthers because you know he's totally not pushing an agenda it's ridiculous it's cringy he also vaguely alludes to the fact that the NRA used to be in favor of gun control legislation which is true but I'm not a rookie I know that the point of this is not to point out how the NRA agenda has changed over time it's the set up for the fact that maybe they were racist in the past so then he can use a weak sauce argument to say that the NRA is racist now we're gonna address that later in the video don't you worry about it for years New York City had an official policy to stop black and brown people on the street just to see if they might have guns or drugs okay so the claim is New York City had an official policy of stopping black and brown people just in case they might have guns I'm gonna go with no and not really the policy she's referring to is stop question and frisk which became stopping for us under Michael Bloomberg now stop and frisk was done in conjunction with the nyp jeez crime tracking system CompStat well compsat allowed the NYPD to do was to use the crime data that they collected put it on a map and then send more officers to areas with higher crime so the NYPD's presence wasn't based on race it was based on data on top of the increased patrols in crime ridden areas the NYPD was also given the power to initiate Terry stops Terry stops come from the Supreme Court case Terry V Ohio where the Supreme Court ruled that you can frisk a person if you have reasonable suspicion that they have committed a crime or about to commit a crime or actively committing a crime and if you go just by the percentages black people were under targeted by stop and frisk according to the data black people were responsible for 70 percent of the shootings yet they only represented 55 percent of the stops now while 84 percent of the time in stop and first stops the suspect was black or Hispanic you have to remember that 95 percent of the shooting suspects in New York City were black or Hispanic in fact the vague term people of color represented 97% of all shooting suspects in the city of New York while white people represented only 3% of all shooting suspects and by the way white people were stopped 10% of the time so if anybody's being stopped disproportionately to the level of crime that they committed it's white people just saying now if I were a complete and total hack like the people who worked at truTV I would just leave it there and move along since I'm not a partisan hack and I'm actually trying to give you guys information I'm gonna tell you what was wrong with stop and frisk under Mayor Bloomberg and the problems with stop and frisk can be explained by this chart right here as you can see at the beginning of this chart there were about 94,000 stop question and frisk however as we got further into Mayor Bloomberg's term the amount of stops went up dramatically into the multiple hundreds of thousands the reason that this is a problem is that the rate of return the arrest rate went down as the number of stops went up remember what I told you about Terry V Ohio that stops and frisks of this nature require reasonable suspicion well when you dramatically increase the number of stops but the rate of arrest goes down it calls into question whether or not the YPG's expansionist version of stop-and-frisk fits the terry requirement for reasonable suspicion and it was this reason that federal courts ruled this version of stop and frisk unconstitutional it was too broad two expansion airy and obviously the NYPD wasn't really that concerned with reasonable suspicion for those of you who are a bit confused what I'm saying is is that stop and frisk under Bloomberg did have problems it was too expansionary and it didn't follow the tairy standard of reasonable suspicion however when you compare the rates of shooting suspects to the rates of people stopped by stop and frisk you find that it wasn't racially disproportionate now they have two examples in this one is a black person being stopped in for a set of barbeque stop so you're in a public place in you look you know dangerous it's ridiculous and absurd and another example is given by Ava here me and my family have gotten jaywalking tickets from the NYPD after they didn't find anything in a stop and frisk they weren't stopping criminals they would just type in black people but the problem with that is that the person was stopped for jaywalking because they were cited for jaywalking remember the standard for a Terry stop is reasonable suspicion that the person is committing a crime is about to commit a crime or just finished committing a crime if you're stopped for jaywalking even though it's petty and it's a violation that's still technically a crime so this search was not a violation of Terry V Ohio so why would you have this terrible example in your video there's a connection between the overly punitive gun sentencing laws that were passed in the 1970s 1980s and 1990s and the current crisis of mass incarceration a set of national gun control laws that could stop the flood of available guns we have local laws that penalize possession and those laws are mostly passed in cities so we've now shifted to a gun control expert who's made the claim that local gun control is racist but national gun control won't be racist which seems a little contradictory to what Ava said before when she was talking about the 80s analysis of ten years worth of federal guns things a lot of gun control laws really end up being about controlling black people in mm the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms perform 10 years of stings to combat gun crime a full analysis found that 91% of people arrested were people of color so which one is it our national gun control laws racist or not racist black people face the highest rates of deaths by guns but instead of protecting the families and neighborhoods who face the most gun violence our current gun laws just double down on destroying them yes black people are disproportionately the victims of shootings because black people are disproportionately the perpetrators of shootings so the laws that arrest black people for those shootings are not double destroying the community do you want the police to leave the murderers in the community like what are you arguing for also I want to point out once again that the reason we're being told this story by Ava instead of Adam who would normally host the show is because truTV thinks that ava is more representative of the community that they're talking about and we've already been told that local gun control laws are somehow racist but national ones aren't except when they are but let's stay on that local train for a section now for the most part Democrats are more in favor of gun control than Republican cities with the strictest gun control laws are almost exclusively run by Democrats these cities also tend to have a higher black population and black people tend to vote for Democrats and black women vote for Democrats in higher rates than black men and members of the LGBTQ community vote for Democrats higher than straights so trutv substituted Ava for Adam because they felt she would be more representative when Ava statistically is the person most likely to vote for candidate to support local gun control legislation didn't think that one through very well so at this point despite the numerous inaccuracies I pointed out truTV has actually made a case against gun control legislation however since the true purpose of this video is to virtue signal about race you can't really say conservatism right so now they're gonna backpedal and claim that gun rights don't extend to black people no dad that's something you need to realize too gun rights don't protect black people either take the Stand Your Ground law to enter it push legislators to pass in Florida again if you weren't sure that this was left-wing propaganda here's a pointless and clusion of the NRA right here no read push legislators to pass in Florida it says use of deadly force is justified to defend yourself in your home or car even if you could run away wrong incorrect inaccurate you are mistaken so the crack team of researchers at truTV managed to complete three completely different and separate pieces of legislation and passed them off as one first of all not having a duty to flee in your own home does not come from stand your ground it comes from the castle doctor the castle doctrine states that your home is your castle and when somebody breaks in you have the right to defend yourself with deadly force it has nothing to do with stand your ground states that don't have stand your ground have the castle doctrine and the reason it exists is because overzealous prosecutors would go after people for defending their own home with deadly force the second law that they're getting wrong in this presentation is Florida self defense law self-defense laws vary from state to state in some states you have a duty to flee in some states you don't have a duty to flee if you live in a state where you do in fact have a duty to flee what that means is even if you kill somebody in self-defense who was threatening your life you can still be found guilty of manslaughter or even murder if a prosecutor can argue that you had another way out of the situation New York would be an example where you have a duty to flee now Florida self defense law you do not have a duty to flee and what that means is that as long as you are in a place where you are legally allowed to be if you kill somebody in self-defense you cannot be prosecuted for that now the purpose of having a self defense law where you do not have the duty to flee is to prevent an overzealous prosecutor from nitpicking the circumstances of your self-defense case and the third ball that trutv has inaccurately molded into one is stand your ground now the San Your Ground law applies to obvious cases of self-defense it gives you a right to a stand-your-ground hearing which is a pre-trial hearing where judge examines the facts of the case and if it's obviously a self defense case the judge can dismiss all charges before trial happened now the reason this exists is again because overzealous prosecutors would prosecute obvious cases of self-defense and the person would be found not guilty but they would incur thousands of dollars in legal bills so stand your ground is just an extra protection for defendants against prosecutors so now that we've got their mischaracterization of what a Stand Your Ground law is out of the way go to the case that they brought up this not everyone gets to use it Marissa Alexander was sentenced to 20 years in prison just for firing a warning shot to defend herself against abusive husband stand your ground and help her so the argument here is because Marissa Alexander was convicted and sentenced to 20 years stand your ground doesn't apply to black people of course there's a bunch of things that true TV for some reason decided to leave out first of all Marissa Alexander was in her estranged husband's home not her own home though technically she was in his castle and she brought a gun into his home and it was argued by the prosecutor that that act of bringing a gun to the home was a premeditated act so those two factors alone make this not an obvious case of self-defense and that's why the Stand Your Ground hearing didn't work out in her favor now trutv states that she was convicted and sentenced to 20 years and that's true but it's not the whole truth another thing that truTV conveniently left out is that Marissa Alexander actually appealed that conviction and it got overturned and she was granted a new trial now in that new trial she actually pled guilty in exchange for time served but if she didn't live in Florida and she lived in a state where possession of that gun were illegal or she had a duty to flee she probably wouldn't have won that appeal so even though she was initially convicted the way the gun control laws were set up in Florida ended up helping her overturn that conviction and get a much better deal and she's out today and the final thing truTV left out as they're trying to use the Marissa Alexandra story to abolish Stand Your Ground is that Marissa Alexandra is an advocate for increased Stand Your Ground protections so great job through TV presenting her story to argue against her position our look at what happened to falando Castillo during a routine traffic pullover he informed the police officer that he had his gun on him in a cop shot and killed him in front of his girlfriend and her four-year-old daughter oh we're going to Philander Castillo now now before we get into the falando Castillo story I want to point out how we switch from facts figures and data to two isolated instances but I drive with my weapon every day that's not against the laws okay so imagine I'm a police officer pulling you over and you're falando Castile do you have your license and insurance yes officer I do have to tell I do have a firearm on me okay don't reach for it then I'm don't pull it out I'm not pulling it out he's not pulling it out don't pull it out hey Fett is the exact moment for Lando Casteel was shot that's how you're gonna present the file and Ocasio story really okay so a lot of people on the right automatically assert that falando Castillo was reaching for his gun I don't think that's the case obviously we can't see what happened in the car all we have is the dashcam footage and the live stream footage from falando Castillo his girlfriend that being said the most likely explanation for why falando Castillo was shot was that he was reaching for his wallet or his insurance or some such thing I'll link the dashcam video below because what you see and hear when watching it is a really panicked officer and what I would classify as a miscommunication that led to a bad shooting in fact is falando Castillo did announce that he had a gun in the car and the idea that he would then reach for the gun in an aggressive way doesn't make any sense can hear in the video the officer saying don't reach for it when he probably should have just asked Castillo to put his hands on the dash again I don't want to speak for Cassio because he is dead but my guests from his girlfriend statement was that he was reaching for his driver's license and he probably thought obviously I'm not reaching for it I'm just gonna get my information with all that being said this is one bad shooting where we don't have all the information and a hundred percent coverage with the video the idea that it doesn't happen to white people is ridiculous I did a whole video about how we had a hundred percent coverage on the video and the police shot a white person that they shouldn't have shot and in that video I said we would still be talking about Michael Brown and falando Castillo long after everybody's forgotten that guy he did everything they're responsible gun owners are supposed to do in the NRA didn't come to his defense for all that talk about protecting gun rights they sure are quiet when black people are gunned down for exercising them and again you see truTV trying to spin it to Club the NRA saying they didn't defend falando Castillo obviously they don't care about black people again this is ridiculous and they expose themselves and their agenda when they do this number one the dash cam evidence wasn't released to the public until after the police officers trial all we had initially was the girlfriends live stream after the shooting so was the NRA supposed to just defend Foligno Castillo based on that woman word secondly this wasn't really a gun rights case it was a wrongful death case at best seal wasn't denied a concealed weapons permit he wasn't arrested by a cop who ignored his concealed weapons permit he was shot by a cop who probably misinterpreted his action as reaching for a gun when he was reaching for his wallet the NRA didn't defend falando Castille is nothing but a meaningless left wing talking point because the NRA doesn't typically take up wrongful death cases furthermore the implication is that the NRA doesn't defend black people and their gun rights which is completely false in McDonald vs Chicago the NRA supported Otis McDonald who was a black man not the city of Chicago and their handgun ban McDonald vs Chicago overturned the Chicago handgun ban and affirmed Americans individual right to keep in bear arms in all 50 states when a black man was arrested for mistakenly thinking that his concealed weapons permit allowed him to carry over state lines the NRA also took up that case because they believed it was an honest mistake so the idea that the nra ssin of taking up a wrongful death case is ridiculous and the idea that they don't defend the Second Amendment rights of black people is also ridiculous and this video itself is ridiculous so true TV this is probably your worst episode of Adam ruins everything your attempts to seem woke and progressive just forwarded negative racial stereotypes and by the end like most left wingers you resulted to emotional Appeals and smearing the nra anyway that's all I really have for you guys today let me know what you think about this
