Just because I'm correcting you on the safety of firing into the air, doesn't make me anti gun. \n\nJust don't do it. It's unsafe. Please just take the time to learn. I'm not trying to dunk on you, Your misunderstanding could get someone hurt one day and that doesn't help our side at all.",

Simply changing the wording of the sentence a bit doesn't change the assumption. By saying 'You're black, so at least you should have informed yourself about this, shouldn't you?\", you are assuming that somebody who is black knows something based solely on their skin color.

Hence why the word credibility is used often in conjunction with a scandal or event in news media. It's a title that is stripped easily. If you make a mistake you are no longer credible. This happens all the time in the scientific community. Like the newest climate change report that the media went crazy over before they had to withdraw the report because it contradicted itself and was no longer credible. They have since released a new report that no longer has the multiple errors. They lost credibility and now anybody who questions climate science can go yeah but do you remember when X. You can be right 1000 times but if you are wrong once that is what people remember. Credibility is not some unassailable power. It's a temporary status you only keep by being very careful.

        "text": "@paulkiernan1852 Anyway, the things that are wrong with the video:\n\n\"was an incompetent baffoon who never set foot in America\"\nboy, calling someone incompetent and then not knowing what america means is laughable. \nHe landed on san salvador, just of the coast of cuba. Cuba being a country in America as any one with even a slight bit of geographic knowledge can tell you. \nSo the first thing he says is absolutly wrong.\n\n\"the earth is teeny tiny and shaped like a pear\" \nNo he never did. ( I found some of the sources he found btw) the source that referneces anything like this actually states he thought it was shaped as a ball with a breastlike protuberance. Missqouting your own sources, not a good start either.\n\nThen we get a quick segment with more pear shaped lies, always important to double down on a lie to make it seem more like a truth right?\n\n\"really sorry ... but columbus never set foot in Amerika\"\nI'm really sorry but he did, as we already established. Hell he even visited Jamaica.\n\nNext up we learn that Adam doesn't know what the term \"discovery means.\nApperently once something exists it can't be discovered anymore. Like we discovered the mount everest, sure it had some ver old tribes living in the erea, but it still was discovered multiple time by other civilizations on later dates. \nOr perhaps electricty, ancient egyprians knew about shocks form fish in the nile, but they aren't the discoverers of electricity.\n\nNext up, the population of Taino isn't given in his source material. What is given is a number of deaths. Howe ever the claim that this means that they all died and thus this was the number of inhabitants is made up by adam or his scriptwriters.\n\nThen we get this bit about bringing 1200 men to enslave the natives and steal their gold, happily omiting the fact that the natives had slaughtered the tiny village that Columbus left behind to keep up relations with the natives. It was an act of vengence, brought upon themselves, not a random act of violence and greed.\n\n\"he dind't disover america and he didn't prove the earth was round\"\nWell i feel like I'm repeating myself too often, but he did discover america. Bu he also wasn't trying to proof the earth to be round as that was common knowledge, he had absolutly no intent to prove the earth was round. Putting this as a negative is like saying he also didn't invent the airplane, he never had this as a goal.\n\nBeyond that i think it is important to note that Columbus thought well of them. Viewing them as good servants (as in servants of god, aka christians) Especially when one reads either the spanish or italian journals, and not the english ones.\nNot to mention that he actually admitted to disliking the way the natives ended up being treated in his letters. \n\nBut please do watch this video which explains all much better and with much more time put in. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEw8c6TmzGg",

Liberalism is also far from God, endorsing homosexuality, transgenderism, the murder of children through abortion, sex outside of wedlock and so on. Not to mention people like Antifa and BLM definitely do not adhere to Christ’s “do as you would be done by” as they slander, threaten, and beat people who disagree. I’m not saying that liberals can’t be Christian of course they can be and some are. Liberalism doesn’t make you a Christian. The Spirit of God in you does",

It takes years for an economy to recover and jobs to form which means Obama started the job growth. He wants to fight the border but forgets that 40% of illegal immigrants come to the U.S. on planes and overstay their visas. So if he won't take on ALL illegal immigrants then how is it wrong to assume he's not prejudicial toward Mexicans.

Get your GED; 2. Go to college and learn economics and political science; 3. Then start watching ALL the news stations. I'm sick and tired of everyone being so fucking sensitive. We have #metoo movements where the justice system means absolutely nothing and then instead of actually working on mental illness we just throw people in prison. You want me to agree with the bullshit that comes out of the trump administration? Start posting videos about how fucked up our prison system is. There are over 200,000 people in the federal system alone, many of which were convicted for \"ghost\" drugs or gun charges because the gun was made in another state and since the state DA couldn't make it stick they give it to a Federal DA because they'll throw so much time at the person that he'd rather take a plea for 15 years than face 30 at trial. To top it off illegal immigrants (not just Hispanics) have more rights than convicted felons. There's a speech from a valedictorian at a high school who tells everyone she's an undocumented immigrant yet she's going to be attending a prestigious university. I don't give a shit if you agree with me or not. I'm just tired of everyone focusing on one issue and ignoring the others. Who gives a shit if someone kneels for the national anthem. You can't proclaim freedom in one sentence then chastise it in the next.",

They'll pay with more police and military battling the increased cartel crimes as their avenues of smuggling go away with the wall. Trump never said exactly how Mexico will pay for the wall. (Well, a little tease now and then like after the trade agreement was signed. Trump said Mexico already is paying for the wall.)

The reason they are so expensive is not because they are some kind of technological marvel. It's because there is only a small number of them that are legally allowed to be owned. It's supply and demand. Nothing about a full-auto AR lower makes it inherently more expensive to manufacture. It just has one extra pin and a couple of extra parts. It's the fact that there are only a small amount that are legal to own and a LOT of people who want one. And just because you have one doesn't mean you have to mag dump every time you shoot it. 50 rounds of 9mm can be had for close to $10. Hell even .223 ammo can be had for cheap if you shoot steel cased. TONS of people go through a lot more than $10 of ammo in one shooting session anyway so I imagine that quite a few people could afford to go and do a couple of mag dumps each time.",

The whole point is to protect our rights of free speech, freedom of religion, and other personal freedoms we enjoy in this country. People always say that the government is never going to take our guns away. The government is not going to take every groups' guns away but it is not unreasonable to think that they wouldn't persecute certain groups. Look at what happened during the 30s in Germany. The Nazi controlled German government took guns and gun rights away from the Semitic people before it started murdering them by the millions. People think that government is this holy protector when in reality most governments in history have been horribly oppressive. The only reason that ours has been prevented from becoming that is because of the checks and balances and other measures like term limits. Look at other countries and how insane some of their laws are. I'm not even talking about \"bad\" countries. The guy known as Count Dankula was convicted of hate speech because he used the word Nazi. Not towards someone as hate speech. That's insane! So don't tell me that no one needs guns or automatic ones and that the government is never going to push its limits. We have these rights to keep them in check. It's a lot harder to quell a revolt against tyranny if the entire populace is armed.",

        "text": "@DavidHanks90 It also makes it easier and more likely that people with murderous intent will enact a higher casualty toll. Saying \"Why shouldn't we have the same small arms as the military?\" is along the same lines as 'Why shouldn't we have the same explosives of the military?' or 'Why shouldn't we have the same access to tanks as the military?' Because soldiers receive extensive training in discipline, the use of said weapons, and do not take initiative unless they have been given orders to. It's not like a soldier can just carry around an automatic weapon whenever they please! You have to check that shit with the quartermaster and by hell if you fire a bullet you better be ready to defend what reason you had to fire that bullet. When you are issued a weapon you are reminded that it is a great responsibility and should you fuck up, kiss your ass goodbye. Homeowners who have automatic weapons are not pressed with the same sense of care and respect for those weapons as soldiers do; do not have a calmer, more rational commander surveying their situation from a detached position, and do not have the discipline of soldiers... and before you say you or any free militia are as disciplined as any military, let me remind you that you CHOOSE to do the things you do, they are TOLD to do everything they do.\n\nBesides, you really need an AK-47 to stand as a check against government oppression? A localized militia with automatic weapons poses the same threat to an organized force as a localized militia with rifles. An entrenched homestead can be just as dangerous no matter what your using. But you know where it does make a big difference? Firing into a crowd of people, as automatic weapons are more threatening psychologically, especially to people who are not prepared for battle. Let me assure you, if the government comes for your guns, the troops carrying out the orders hold a handgun in the same respect as a fully automatic machine gun... both will kill you.\n\nI am a former Army 74B. My father, uncle, and both grandfathers have served in the Army, Air Force, and Navy... in case your wondering \"What the fuck does he know?\"",

Small arms are not the same as explosives or tanks so how exactly are those statements comparable, I am not sure. I agree that we should not have access to tanks or explosives. \n\nI don't think that we should just be handing them out either and that background checks should still be required to get an automatic weapon. You cannot also claim that a militia with just rifles is as effective as a militia with automatic weapons and then claim in the same paragraph that automatic weapons are much more effective against people. Which is it? Are they more or less effective? It can't be both.\n\nThe whole idea that a soldier should be allowed to have one because of the training and everything doesn't really stand either. By that same reasoning we shouldn't have any guns at all. Civilians still have to answer to any shot that is fired that shouldn't be. Unless you are shooting a target at a shooting range you better be prepared as a civilian to answer for every round you put down range and why. Having a commanding officer or not doesn't change that at all. \n\nAnd obviously if the full weight of the US military singles me out I'm gonna die in 5 seconds. But that's not what I am talking about. If they government were to turn on a the public at large or a group of people (not just some neighborhood that likes guns) they would have to deal with the fact that they are in for a long and arduous fight. Don't think so? Let's look at how effective guerrilla tactics in the Middle East have proven effective. Has the US military killed lots of them. Yup. For sure. Did we win anything. Nope. Because there a lot of them and they are still fighting.\n\nAnd that is the whole point. We should have these as a further deterrent to our government becoming tyrannical. The more they take away our right to bear arms, the easier that potential fight becomes for them. It's one more check and balance in our constitution and one that I think we should take more seriously.",

        "text": "@DavidHanks90 \"Small arms are not the same as explosives or tanks so how exactly are those statements comparable, I am not sure.\" You can kill more people with an automatic weapon than a claymore mine. And the tank was to drive the point home, the regular population does not need automatic weapons just like they don't need tanks.\n\"Which is it? Are they more or less effective? It can't be both.\" They are more effective against people who are not prepared for combat and not any more effective than any other firearm against someone who is. It can be both. If you are defending yourself against a trained fighting force, they will use the same amount of caution regardless of what kind of firearm you are using, all have the potential to kill equally well. The opposing force could have any kind of expertise with the weapons they carry, but a bullet from any of them could end you.\n\"Having a commanding officer or not doesn't change that at all.\" It does because soldiers don't own automatic weapons. Soldiers don't decide when and where they use the weapons they are issued. Soldiers don't carry weapons unless they are in a training exercise, an active warzone, or an on-duty MP. The simple fact you could take your weapon out to a buddies ranch and fire a couple of shots gives you far more freedom than any military unit... you don't have to return your weapon to a superior who will count the ammunition you returned and question you when there are missing bullets, then ruin your life if you cannot answer for that ammunition.\nThis whole idea you have of the military singling you out and dying in 5 seconds is ludicrous. Have you never heard of a measured response? Do you think you would be overrun? Combat is not like that. A moving force needs information. A lone gunman with skill could take multiple lives before being neutralized. That is unacceptable. Tactics like that will cause significant losses and deplete morale, causing even more losses. The reason I point this out is to give you an idea that the force you would be fighting would not be blindly walking into an ambush or stampeding across your home like a charging rhino. They will be cautious and wary, they will spend time gathering intel before moving. The weapon you are using is a footnote to things like: troop position, chokes, areas with cover, sniper vantages, fortified defenses. Not to mention, guerrilla warfare is more effective when the guerrilla's know more about the terrain than the trespassers. US Soldiers were not born in Afghanistan, if they were, you would see even fewer casualties. If, heaven forbid, they were called to fight a war on US soil; they can be as familiar with the area as you are and will probably have much better intel. As an example: the AK-47 is superior to the M5 in practically every conceivable way, yet the losses for the US are much smaller, and the Viet-Cong were so poorly equipped that some fought with nothing more than sharpened sticks... and they won that war.",

        "text": "Berning Sandwiches  I appreciate your reply, but there are several points I take with other.  I am much more concerned with the use of police force than our military, but that is only currently. Military over use is a natural conclusion of the repression of rights- something that does not happen instantly, but rather in small pieces over the course of decades if not centuries. \n\nI absolutely do want to live in a society where the combined power of the people is greater than that of the government. \n\nI also would like to point out that I am not a right winger, I am much more of a centrist- I don’t want you to misinterpret what I’m about to say next as being the ravings of a fanatic. \n\nWhat f***ing country are you from my man? Did you read anything about the American revolution? Do you understand why we have a f***ing constitution? It was because the government willfully violated the rights of its citizens. \n\nLaws were passed to ensure that would never happen again ( Bill of rights ), the second one was the right to bear arms. The first one was freedom of speech and religion and petition, and it carries no weight without the second.  \n\nWe are NOT a democracy. We are a representative republic which has a very specific series of checks and balances built into it to ensure that no one group of government ever gets power over the others, and that the government itself can never take power over from the states, and subsequently from the individuals\n\nThe entire purpose of the way that our constitution is structured is to maintain a balance of power, and if your federal government has a monopoly of that for us it will absolutely abuse it\n\nThat is a lesson that history has taught us and not some instances, but in every instance where the government has had a monopoly of power, abuse is a natural result. \n\nAgain, I do not want you to think that I am some far flung right wing nut job, I am a very progressive person in my politics, but one thing I will never, ever buy John, is reducing the power of the bill of rights, the power of the individual, the power of the individual versus the power of the government. \n\nThe government absolutely has used it’s monopoly of force in the form of Japanese interment  camps, slavery, and of course eminent domain.  These are just a few examples, I didn’t even have to look any of that up.  \n\n The people who have brought us every war, every war under the planet, you want them to have all the guns. Just remember that no war has ever been started by a private citizen in this country, they have all been started by the government.",

You don't need any sort of training to just let it lose in a crowd. And while it's true that any determined killer will find a way eventually, in alot of cases it's not a person thats knowledgeable about guns, how they work, or how to buy them on the black market that commits the massacre, it's the everyday troubled citizen that's had enough and used the first weapon they had access to.

It is something that has statistics that have been approved by people who study them. You don't know what's taught in school if you aren't a teacher. Math teachers teach math, history teachers teach history etc. It's actually illegal in MOST states to show any kind of political bias in your class. I had several teachers who weren't allowed to tell us who they were voting for because in their contract with the school they would be terminated if they did. Kids are finding this information online, not through teachers. \n\nI can't stand when people say facts aren't true because it goes against what they believe is true. Global Warming is A FACT. They have thermometers in the sea that track it's temperature just like they do in the air. \n\nAlso, they wouldn't have to make abortion illegal if they taught proper sex ed in schools instead of speakers coming in and trying to say that sex is a horrible thing that could kill you. Kid's don't fucking care they're gonna do it anyways, so at least teach them that if they do end up having sex, that they can prevent getting pregnant by using birth control or using condoms.",

        "text": "@jatbatman I think you misunderstood what Freud was saying. He was saying that our base instinct of wanting to be partners with a female comes from having a mother in the first place. Humans normally don't have sexual tendencies until puberty, and by then your brain understands the difference between family and non-family. He took his research waay waay too far to figure this out, but to some extent makes sense. If you're an atheist or an agnostic it makes some sense that you get your innate desire for females as a male from being with your mother. That's why you see a lot of people who will marry someone who is similar to the parent of the opposite gender, NOT ALWAYS, but a lot of the time you'll see similarities. It is also where you learn that kissing someone is intimate and a way to show someone you love them, and also that you hold hands with someone you care for. So yes, Sigmund Freud had and still does have a lot of credibility. But using a psychologist isn't the same thing as stating facts. Psychology is never 100% on one side or the either, there are and always will be outlying factors that change your results in a study. Having a study about people is one thing, but statistics themselves about anything else are hardly ever wrong, mainly because of the use of the scientific method. \n\nFor example, the amount of people killed by police is a sure thing that happened in the past, where no matter what the statistics will NOT CHANGE, but a study on mental health is a study that deals with the human body, which constantly changes and evolves, and does so differently depending on the person, which will result in statistics that are completely correct in the situation and controlled environment you do the test in, but will have altered results if you do it anywhere else.",

For instance there's been plenty of cases where the anti-gun side has cited violent crime statitics where the US includes all crimes with any violence, but other countries only include those with severe violence. Now if you compared apples to apples, then yes your argument about statistics is accurate. Many politically fueled statistics though compare apples to oranges.\n\nGood job though with the rebuttal.

Plus, my senior year I took a philosophy class where we were taught to take anything anyone says, sarcastic or not, and make a rebuttal using logic, because using sarcasm back will only result in each person not knowing whether the person they are debating is taking the debate seriously or not. \n\nI just wish that other people in these comments would actually try to have a debate instead of telling me that he is skewing his facts or that his facts are false then not showing or saying anything to back it up. No examples, nothing. I think some people see something that they have felt was true for so long, then see someone say that what they thought was true really wasn't, then go into denial and refuse to actually talk about it. \n\nMy favorite episode of Adam Ruins Everything actually explains this really well. Take the time to watch his episode on conspiracy theories, it actually goes into why they are damaging to the thought process of everyone. The best part is when he pulls in a psychologist to explain why people refuse to change their opinions, despite there being facts obviously saying that they are wrong. She says that it's because when you bombard someone like that with facts, they start to feel attacked personally, and will fight you regardless of whether what they are saying makes sense or not. I feel that this is why there is no progress happening with the gun debate in america. Nobody tries to even bother looking at the other side and realizing that maybe some of what they are saying is true, and picking out the things that aren't, they just immediately think that everything they are saying is false.",

Did you know that there was a time in history where businesses wanted to give their workers a raise but couldn't be cause the government legislated what people should be paid?  The government literally made it illegal to pay people more.  You obviously have no clue what makes business run.  Look at the tax cuts that recently happened.  What was the result?  People got raises.  What a novel concept.  You have been educated by people that, surprise surprise, use identity politics.  They take a couple bad examples of businesses doing bad things and say that it's an across the board issue.  That couldn't be further from the truth.  We need a true free market.

        "text": "@tylerdurden7690 Hi, also a gun owner here, come to help you with your understanding on a basic background check and the more intense background checks that are being proposed.\n\nNow, for some frame of reference, the United States is considered a First world Developed Nation, like most of Europe, Japan, and a few other counties. Now, compared to some of those other countries, we are practically giving away fire arms away to anyone that wants one. Japan, for instance, has an extremely rigorous process where any sort of red flag that pops up immediately stops the process and you are labeled ineligible to own a fire arm. And in Switzerland, if you have previously broken any law, even a minor one, you are also considered ineligible to possess a fire arm because it is considered that since you can't follow a simple law, then the ones around fire arms are way too complicated for you. \n\nNow, in regards with Backgrounds checks, I'm actually going to talk about my current job in retail. Now, I work at a corporate drug store, and part of the job (and being a cashier) is that we will have customers come in the buy cigarettes. No big deal. But part of the state laws of where I live and work, we have to look at the ID of everyone, regardless of how old they look. And have to check every time they come in, even if they are a regular, of a cclose friend. We also have to make sure that the ID is valid. If it's expired, it cannot be accepted. \n\nNow, all of that is important to set the premise of how I'm going to talk about background checks. Imagine what I said to buy cigarettes in my state is the base form of background checks that every gun owners have to go through when buying a fire arm. Sure it is a bit inconvenient, but it's something that is required, and if everything checks out, you are fine and can go about your business. Now for more detailed background checks, I see that similar as me asking for a second legitimate ID to make sure that the person is exactly who they say they are. With bother forms being up to date. If the information on the ID doesn't match, then I can with call my supervisor, or outright deny you sale. That's essentially what the more detailed background checks are. And if you are a law abiding citizen who has all the proper paperwork in order, you have nothing to worry about. But if you make a big fuss about the process, it will be seen with some scrutiny, because red flags will start going up. \n\nPart of this issue that also needs to be handled is interpersonal gifting of fire arms between family members and the selling at Gun/Hunting-Fishing shows. In both situations there HAS to be the same level of checks or at least paperwork that needs to be done so as to keep things consistent. If you are against that, then I propose that the original owner should be punished for any crimes committed with the fire arm. Similarly to how a car works. If you gift your cousin a firearm for their birthday and they went and shot up a school with that firearm, then you are held equally responsible. \n\nThere are a lot more points we can talk about, including the new law that is going through in NY regarding concealed carry permits. But I think I got my main point across.",

Very often we tend to glorify war as a source of entertainment, and introduce a very hyper masculine approach to it, while very rarely  deals with the actual consequences of war.

        "text": "Now that I'm back from work, will also refer to the statistics surrounding the suicide case. It would be useless to talk specifically about suicide by gun, since it makes no point; of course states with a higher gun ownership will have a higher suicide by gun rate. If you don't have a gun, you won't commit suicide with one; if a whole population has less guns, they're less likely to commit suicide with guns. What matters is the effect that guns have on suicide rate as a whole.\n\nAnd the answer is that gun ownership does seem to affect suicide rates greatly, although there are some exceptions to the correlation. Of the top 15 states in overall suicide rates, not a single one has a gun ownership lower than 30%. Of the bottom 15 states in overall suicide rates, only one has high gun ownership (Mississipi, with gun ownership of 55.3%), and other 5 have gun ownership higher than 30%. All the bottom 5 states in overall suicide rates have low or very low gun ownership (excluding D.C., but D.C. has the lowest suicide rate *and* the lowest gun ownership, but the highest gun murder rate, as we've seen before).\n\nThis means that there is a clear correlation between gun ownership and suicide rate, but it seems there is a way to get around it becoming very problematic (Mississipi, Minnesota, Virginia, Nebraska, North Carolina, Texas). Much like the case of gun murder rate, there are many other variables not being taken into account besides gun ownership and firearm laws.\n\nStill, we cannot ignore the fact that suicide becomes a huge problem when gun ownership rises.",

        "text": "@cardtrader15 Facts huh?  So answer me this then.  How come gun control laws only try to go after \"scary machine guns\" aka ar15 or hi cap mags when the majority of gun deaths are caused by handguns and not rifles?  Why hasn't anyone been screaming about banning handguns and keeping rifles?  You can't conceal a rifle like a handgun.  This would make everyone safer yes?  Because the truth of it is reactionary and one of fear.  Not based on facts.  Plain and simple.  If gun control actually went after what caused the problems then there would be an argument. Instead its a strait up strawman and loses all creditably and ones fear shines right through like a ray of sunshine. That's the problem. You have no creditably when you use the wrong terms and have no clue what you are talking about and ignore a huge stat and the #1 cause of all the deaths right off the top of it.   It goes after what non firearms supporters or owner are afraid of.  The guy in camo with a scary machine gun.  Not the 70 yo grandma with a .38 snub nose in her purse.   How does banning a pistol grip on a rifle make CA any safer?  Specially when almost all the deaths come from handguns.  That's like saying a Prius is causing 90% of all deaths in vehicles from them exploding but we are trying to ban F250's cause if those exploded man it sure would be horrible and scary.  It's a crazy fucking argument that has 0 basis just like the current laws getting pushed to cure a \"epidemic\"\n\nNow you talk about permitting ect and how is that going to stop criminals from using firearms?  Look at the percentages of gun violence against other people vs who committed it as a legal firearm owner vs a criminal who wouldn't be able to purchase one legally. We already have background checks for guns.  How does a law stop someone who doesn't follow laws?  What do you do about all the guns here and now?  What Australian buyback?  Look at how much that would cost with the amount of firearms we have in America.  How about enforcement? It keeps going and going.  You don't need a gun to defend yourself?  So you want to use a taser or pepper spray against someone with a firearm?  It seems you have a vast knowledge of firearms and self defense situations.  You should start by taking all the cops guns away.  I mean after all they have pepper spray and tasers.  They obv have no need for a firearm /s\n\nWhat I'm tired of is people who have about as much knowledge of this subject that would fit into a match tip.  Goggle a couple of webpages and now they have a solution and a basis of an argument.  \"Guns only purpose is murder\".  What about the 12 million registered hunters in the US?   To think we have let these 12 million murders go free for so long is just sickening.  You should start with them.  In fact I think you should all be the ones to go knock on their doors and ask to violate there constitutional rights.  Ofc in a castle law state.  Just make sure to bring pepper spray and you will be safe.\n\n\"\"It makes you dependent on your government for your basic human rights and if you're ok with, fine.\" that just makes no sense\"  ......yeah..........",

So I guess we have that in common, High Fives!\n\nAlso I want closing of loopholes like the boyfriend loophole, which lets people convicted of domestic violence buy and own guns provided they aren't with they person they domestic violenced and the gun show/private loophole which allows the buying and selling of guns from one person to another without a background check. On that point I would also like a national and searchable database of gun owners and their guns and for the CDC, which is banned from doing studies about guns for some reason, to do the thing that they currently aren't allowed to.\n\nI know I should say something about mental illness but it seems like the majority of people with mental illness are non-violent and are more likely to be victims of violence than the other way so I think any acts of violence committed by people with mental illness should be factors like everything else when doing background checks.\n\nI have some more on my wishlist but its late and I'm tired.",

He seems to think, along with the rest of his far left ilk, that anybody whose skin is darker than Khaki is basically doomed.\n\nAre we assuming the boyfriend in question would, if given access to a weapon, murder his ex? If so, why is this violent lunatic allowed in public where he could still acquire knives, or an ax, or a book of matches, and kill his ex in some way that doesn't involve a firearm? It seems a strange omission to be concerned about one weapon while still leaving access to every other conceivable weapon in existence, including rocks and pointy sticks. To paraphrase Archie Bunker, would you prefer thy were pushed out of windows? Treat him like the criminals above. Can he be trusted out in public to not kill people? Yes? What's the problem? No? Why is he out in public?\n\nHow would you effectively close the gun show loophole? What, precisely, stops me from selling my gun to some random guy? As for the ''without a background check'', you know at some point somebody had to get said background check done before the gun was handed over, right? While the final owner may not be on record, the FFL that bought it from the manufacturer would be, and they would have a record of who they sold the gun to, at which point the investigation can commence.\n\nA national and searchable database of gun owners? Why? To what end? I'd rather people not know where I live and what valuables I keep. Should we also let it be publicly known what hours I'm not home, and the combination to my safe? Do my 4th amendment rights to  security of my personal effects mean nothing?\n\nThe CDC published a study about gun violence in 2013. ''PRIORITIES FOR RESEARCH TO REDUCE THE THREAT OF\r FIREARM-RELATED VIOLENCE''. So that's one stricken from the list already. \n\nIt would be a good think to not open the kettle of worms that is proscribing what mental illnesses prevent one from owning a gun. Namely, if a judge were to crack open a copy of the DSM5, and flip to the entry on Gender Dysphoria, and poof, no firearms rights for transsexuals. Oh, what a shit storm that would stir.\n\nThe problem is, what you ask for doesn't just cut into 2nd amendment rights, but 1st, 4th, and 5th, and 14th as well. Do I have a right to association and assembly? Or am I not allowed to meet like winded people at a convention and trade items? Items in this instance being Constitutionally protected firearms. \n\nDo I have a right to privacy and security of my house, person, documents, and effects, or must those things be accessible at all times to government, and possibly public, inquest, due to my ownership of a firearm? What you propose sounds like treating gun owners the same way as we treat convicted sex offenders. Only it would double as a shopping list for criminals looking for free guns, if this list is publicly accessible.\n\nWhich brings me to the 5th. Proposing to strip me of the previous aforementioned rights, without due process or trial, because I own a firearm. \n\nAnd that violates the Equal Protection clause of the 14th amendment, because you propose to treat certain citizens, about 1/3 of them, differently, due to the free exercise of certain rights.",

Like when I bought up the boyfriend loophole you could've said something like \"Well most victims of abuse don't always report their abuser or go on the recant later or charges are never filed in the first place\" we could've gone from there but you didn't and for some reason you bought up knives and axes(?) like yeah, my dude, people can use those things to hurt and kill people but they can also not be used for those reasons while a gun is a tool designed expressly to kill someone/thing as quickly as easily as possible. Same with the gun show loophole I offer a solution (not a perfect one I'll admit) but it's a step towards hopefully stopping, or at least tracking grey area gun deals better. Maybe we could make background checks cheaper or offer some kind of incentive for private seller to preform background checks or even making big red flag information available quickly instead of waiting for the entire report. I don't know shit about the FFL and I'm too tired/lazy to look it up so I'll just cede the point.\n\nAs for the 2013 CDC study you're talking about fun fact: the first thing that came up about the study was a 2015 article by the Washington Post titled \"The study that gun-rights activists keep citing but completely misunderstand\" so I thought that was cute. Also it feels like you're kinda leaving out that for about 16 years up until that point the CDC was barred from doing studies into gun violence and it took, through executive order, for even that study to be conducted says there need to be more studies into gun violence. The Dickey Amendment, which is still on the books, basically makes it so they have to word their studies very carefully so they aren't used to \"promote or advocate for gun control\". They can study gun violence but they also can't because if they slip up that could be their careers so no one will risk it. I want the CDC, which is banned from doing studies into gun violence, to be able to do studies into gun violence.\n\nI don't know what's going on here. I specifically ignored talking about mental illness because I didn't want to open that \"kettle of worms (da faq?) but for some reason you go there and you use trans people and gender dysphoria which is hilarious cause I follow a ton of trans people and have the internet so I can say that gender dysphoria isn't a mental illness. It can, however lead to lower mental health because of the stress and anxiety it causes but it seems like it goes away once the person acknowledges they are trans and, if they decide, take the steps to transition.\n\nSo this part you say i cut into your 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 14th amendment rights but am I thought? So as I can see 1st and 2nd amendment, right to free speech, right to peaceful assembly, and the right to keep and bear arms and a well regulated militia which, while I'm not super down with, I'm ok with. Like my idea of it is that it's a bunch of local dude bros who get together and patrol their neighborhood and are like real into gun safety and offer to teach the new gun owners how to handle themselves in a relaxed setting like an open field or something and the police know them and maybe do like weekly/monthly check in to see if everything is going alright and offer assistance if something happens. I mean why would I or anyone care that you and your buds are talking about guns or going to a convention with guns IDGAF. The 4th... don't know why you bought it up since nothing I said directly affects them, as far as I can see, unless you committed a crime than, according to your 5th amendment you would be entitled to a trial and if found guilty you would probably be stripped of your gun so.. I guess I'm ok with that.\n\nLastly I don't know why you bought up sex offenders in regards to gun ownership but yeah I'm ok with them not having guns either provided they aren't the really bad sex offenders. I guess lastly the 14th amendment, which I feel like I covered when I was talking about the fifth but then you say about 1/3 of Americans have guns and according to a Pew Research study in 2017 77% of gun owners are in favor of background checks at gun shows, 54% are in favor of catching a federal database for tracking gun sales and 82% are in ok with not selling guns to people on the no-fly/watch lists. I'll say this again are not \"perfect\" or \"good\", I'm a very pie in the sky type of guy, but they are, to me, a step in a direction we could take or completely dismiss and try something different but going through your response to mine it doesn't really feel you want to do much as be right but for me to just be wrong. You bring up a lot of whataboutisms and deflections that don't really matter to the argument at hand and I have to wonder, did you really care or are you just being a troll? (small edit: after i thought about it a bit I felt bad about calling you a troll and I changed my mind I don't think you are a troll, I just think you're a centrist).",

A point by point response, gone. \n\nSuffice to say, I don't think you understood a lot of my points, especially when I brought up a determined abuser would just use a different method other than a gun, and you accused me of deflection and whataboutism when that was exactly what you did when I showed you the CDC study on gun violence, and never once acknowledge that you actually got what you wanted, only complained that you didn't get it sooner \n\nYou keep advocating for things that would have horrible repercussions. Like opening up the NICS system to everybody. You admit you don't know how FFL works, so you wouldn't know this, but the NICS system contains a great deal of privileged information, including social security numbers. Allowing literally anybody to put in a name and receive such information would be immediately abused.\n\nI know you want to do \"something\", but I would rather we do nothing rather than make a mistake which would only make things worse.",

I say doing \"something\" is better than doing nothing and you say you'd rather nothing get done because of a chance that mistakes would be made and I say if we don't make these small mistakes now, while we can control them and course correct, then later, when lets say something major happens and congress pushes through a rushed bill of some kind, a lot of innocent people could be caught up in the cross fire.\n\nYou seem to have made another mistake reading what I wrote because in my last reply I agreed with you that having database of guns searchable by anyone was a bad idea and changed to a federal database, specifically for police and government agent types.

I say you should read this Quora page its not like a government study or anything its just interesting (https://tinyurl.com/ybuzzs7b).\n\nThis is the last bit and I'm done. You say I never understand or acknowledge your points and I keep having to ask, what points? You never bring up any alternatives solutions to anything I say and you aren't willing to offer any sort of compromise either. It feels like I'm putting in all the work in this relationship and you're just finger wagging behind me going \"No no no we musn't do that\" all the while resorting to whataboutisms and slippy slope fallacies.

You're saying things that are factually incorrect. You claim the CDC cannot do research in gun violence, despite me telling you the exact name of their published findings, and you confuse the NCIC for the NICS.

In his video he said u can relocate easier (that is true), he said it avoids u being force to live in one house for the next 25 years (that is also true). \nHowever even when u r renting you cant just move from that rented home next week, because u have legal binding contract agreement with your landlord which u must honor or you will be sued for any outstanding costs n legal fees.\nTherefore if u are 3months in to a 12month legal rent contract)  you cant move out of that house early and just stop paying rent because u will suffer legal consequences (like being sued) \nAlso when renting it is not your house (its the landlords) u can be kicked out at any moment the rent contract ends. renting is less of a commitment but it is less of a reward n presents more risk to a comfortable n stable family life.",

If rent is 1k a month, and you rent for 10 years, that's 120k that's you've spent on housing that you will never see again. Whereas if you spent that on a house you have equity in it. And even if you have to move you can sell/rent out your purchased house for profit. \n\nYes there may be times where you won't be able to move on a whim because you own a house and you have to sell it first. But if you settle down and get a job that pays even remotely decently then purchase a house within a reasonable time, you eventually won't have to pay rent or housing payments. Which is imperative, along with investing money, for retirement. \n\nAre there corner case situations where one may get a short stick by purchasing a house? Sure, but there are far more people who would simply benefit from it. As a general rule is far better to purchase a house rather then rent.",

Adam actually mentions the Authority fallacy, in one of the podcasts if not one of the earlier episodes.\n\nEither way, you're not wrong in saying you shouldn't take citation at face value. It's a good thing that Adam encourages you to NOT do that. He gives transparency and invites you to look at the same sources he used. And, as I mentioned before, he isn't afraid to admit when he is wrong. There was a whole episode devoted to ruining Adam Ruins everything.\n\nOne of the biggest problems right now is that people can't admit when they are wrong. And a related issue is that we, the general populace, only want to trust people we view as infallible or always correct. Someone that admits they made a mistake suddenly loses all credibility. . even though anyone can make a mistake. We're all human.\n\nThat's why I like Adam Ruins everything. The point, which is lost on people like. . groan. . \"Actual Justice Warrior\". . isn't to just take Adam's word for it. He invites you to hear what he has to say, challenge it, look at where he got his information, and either debate him or make up your own mind.",

The first officer pounded on the door, declaring that he was a Phoenix PD, in a normal speaking voice. The resident opened the door, pistol in hand. The first officer drew his firearm and ordered the resident to drop his weapon. As the man was bending down to put his weapon on the ground, the other officer lined up his shot and executed the man. There was no media outrage, no marches, no riots, no politicians talking about how he was a good man, hell I don't even know the dude's name. But 1 black man gets killed by a panicking cop and his name is forever carved in stone.",

The results were similar from every source. Over 6700 officers were arrested between 2005 and 2011. 94.5% of these officers were male. I'm not sure about race, but statistically only 1.2% were arrested on grounds of civil rights violations (a.k.a prejudicely motivated crimes). I'm not sure why you would bring up an officer that beat a black person unless you're trying to make a point of officers being racist because otherwise his skin color wouldn't matter and you wouldn't have brought it up. I won't go on about exactly what the officers were arrested for but if you want more info you can simply search police corruption statistics like I did.",

        "text": "See, you're making some very bold - and dubious - assumptions here. \n\n\"Fear of being called racist\" is a very poor excuse, you must realize. And sounds awfully suspicious. You say they can't investigate or they risk being called racist? That's pretty much because police departments have a long and sordid history of BEING racist. You might dismiss this but I should remind you Stop and Frisk targeted almost entirely minorities. . . and yet failed to produce any serious results. I should also point out that police departments have been caught red headed with quotas, with secret programs that target African Americans, and with members who express views that would make the KKK or Neo Nazis proud. Not one offs, I should say. Hell, a paramedic was recently identified as someone who ran a hate podcast where he described minorities as 'animals'.\n\nI'd also direct you to the numerous recent cases where black people have been killed for next to no reason. The guy that stopped the potential mass shooter? SOMEONE THE NRA SHOULD'VE STOOD UP FOR BUT DIDN'T. . . Shot and killed by the police The guy sitting in his own home? Shot and killed by a police officer. .  whose department quickly pointed out there was weed in his house. This is a theme, by the way. . that police departments will highlight any negative of the black person shot while glamorizing the cop that shot them. . which I understand but it's still a dick move. Oh. And they love changing their stories. A lot. What about the little kid with the toy gun in the store? I've done that. I've NEVER had to worry about being shot. \n\nAnd before you say it, no, running and failure to immediately complying are not good excuses to shoot or kill someone. They're not. Especially in the circumstances that cops often do it with minorities. Fight, flight, or freeze is a powerful biological response to situations like these and people people panic. In the case of SWAT accidentally breaking into the wrong house or confronting people. . an instance where white people actually do stand a good chance of being shot. . people are uncooperative because they are disorientated, confused, and can't hear what the fuck is being said. Couple that with the fact that the odds of dying in a confrontation with police are higher for black people. . of course they are going to panic.\n\nThere was a neat little video I was watching that explained once upon a time police were asked to access a situation first. If they did this, a lot of lives would be spared.\n\nSo you ask me what police can do? They can do that. Maybe have some patience first. Better training. We argue back and forth about militarization but, really, if they are going to act like soldiers they may as well be trained like them. Troops typically have stricter ROE and restrain themselves accordingly.\n\nAnother solution would be doing something about poverty. Poverty causes crime. I can go into Red Lining with you and other racist policies that shaped the US over the last century or two. . . but I suspect you already have a full plate.",

        "text": "@Mahbu again I agree with you and I think you may have overlooked where I said there are bad cops. It was a vague sentence but yes I meant there's plenty of crooked shit that goes on so yes people will be suspicious. What I'm saying is in the primarily black neighborhoods, tensions are very high due to a combination of prejudice on both parts and the fact that unfortunately a lot of those neighborhoods have a lot of criminal activity as is. So even the good cops are uncomfortable and the blacks are uncomfortable. That's a bad scene already let alone throwing a shit person on either side into the fray. Honestly cops asking to enter a scene wouldn't do much anyway as most would deny them if they are the one causing an issue. This would only apply to things like domestic abuse or a victim coming to them already. I agree with a lot that you are saying but as for poverty that is unfortunately completely on the fault of the citizens. Nobody is telling them to stay in a bad neighborhood. Nobody is telling them to not look for work and homes outside of their town/city. Nobody is telling them to have children in a situation where they can't even take care of themselves, have unstable relationships, unstable wealth status, etc. Blacks in bad neighborhoods are their own undoing. They blame \"the white man\" for being in their situations because they believe they will always be behind because of racial history. There's plenty of people of color that live in decent conditions because they worked for it. There's plenty of them that didn't have daddy run away leaving a kid messed up. There's plenty that don't raise their kids to play in the ghettos. They are successful. They unfortunately lock themselves in those bad environments and blame everyone else and give no blame to themselves for remaining there. I know it's not exactly easy but many could but instead fall victim to the environments they make for themselves. Broken families, kids on the streets, violence, poverty, dependence on the government.",

        "text": "@Mahbu dipshit I clearly stated in my first post I don't agree with stop and frisk. Please read more carefully before trying to talk down to me. I also didn't state black on black crime, you put those words there. I said crime in primarily black neighborhoods are high. Most of the issues with racial topics like this are viewed at shitty locations. Nobody talks about the white on white crime because it never becomes a racial issue since they're white. It's only a racial thing when it involves people of color. I think labeling any race against any race crime is a bullshit topic. People can just generally be violent. Now unfortunately I will say this. Most primarily black neighborhoods aren't in good conditions or locations. Whereas primarily white neighborhoods vary between their good and their bad. It's not a racial thing to say they primarily live in violent neighborhoods, it's just a fact unfortunately. Again I've agreed with a lot of what you say and I'm trying to have an intellectual conversation but it seems like you just ignore all we agree on and have an aneurysm with one topic you disagree with. That is the issue with people today. They get offended when there is a difference of opinions rather than seeing both sides of the conversation",

The implication is there's only a handful but then it doesn't explain why this is such a frequent occurrence. And it's not JUST that there's bad cops. The problem is much larger than a few racist or corrupt cops. We are still recovering from decades of institutions and policy, from laws. . which were directly or indirectly aimed to target and persecute minorities, typically African Americans.\n\nAnd then you go with \"on both sides\". I used to like the middle ground approach. It seemed fair. . on the surface. But it's not. It fails the nuance test dramatically. Like when Trump said there were \"good people on both sides\" when called upon to denounce Nazi and KKK sympathizers. No. . there are not good people on both sides. One side believes that races are inferior or akin to animals and that genocide maybe isn't so bad. . and the other side wants them to GTFO.\n\nSame instance with what we have in black neighborhoods. Yes, the black community doesn't trust Police and holds prejudice against them. . . Because the Police have had a long history of abuse aimed at minorities. There are many documented cases where police have, historically, either been members of or sympathetic to the KKK and often failed to arrest or prosecute KKK members. Southern authorities were even directly involved in the murders of three civil rights workers during the Civil Rights period. Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner were detained by police unlawfully. . and later executed. And, also, as a reminder. . it was the police and fire department who attacked civil rights activists and marchers with fire houses, dogs, and worse. \n\nThat distrust isn't there for no reason.",

I thought the police were cool. Still do. Have many police buddies. But my friends of other ethnic backgrounds, especially Latino and African american or Caribbean descent, have a deep distrust of authority based on historical systemic and institutionalized racism.\n\nHave you seen the videos featuring white people calling police on black people for no apparent good reason? It seems like it's a sudden and new trend but, here's the surprise. . it's not. This has been going on for a long time. It's just that now people are willing to do something about it and also people recognize the power of technology to capture those moments and share them instantly.\n\nThe shootings of minorities or innocent civilians?

Needless to say it's not a new phenomena; it's just being reported more and more.\n\nGoing back to stop and frisk, it doesn't sound like a bad idea to people like you or I because we aren't impacted by it. On the surface it sounds great until you realize deep down inside you don't expect yourself to be stopped and frisked. And chances are you won't be. I won't be. Police will probably ignore us or wave.  Now consider the studies done that show overwhelmingly minorities were targeted and overwhelmingly the searches showed negative. It shows that A.) the measure was used to disproportionately target minorities and B.) was ineffective at the task it was designed to do. \n\nReally, police may not be the solution. . just. . a bandaid.\n\nThe problem with crime is it's intrinsically linked with poverty and lack of opportunity.

        "text": "So then. . Brianna, are you suggesting blacks are just. . . naturally more violent? I'm curious to know where you're going with this. You're using the same talking points as a lot of white nationalists so I'd just rather we not beat around the bush here. I'm curious what statistics you are using and I wonder allowed if they don't lead back to such. . . 'esteemed' organizations as the New Century Foundation who have a cheerful propensity of skewing statistics.\n\nYou mentioned that some disagreement over my assertion poverty causes crime. . but didn't. . really supply any sufficient rebuttal as to why not. Yes, you say that poor white and Asians communities aren't violent. . which. . frankly you're wrong. Having lived by some pretty shitty neighborhoods up and down the east coast, I can already tell you're wrong. Having familiarity with poor Asian communities. . I can already tell you're wrong.\n\nThat and looking over the data provided by our friends at the FBI. . which is incomplete but still. Honestly, I feel like you're conflating things.\n\nBut more importantly you neglect the very important detail that it's hard to find white communities that are as disadvantaged as the poorest black neighborhoods, all for the sake of making an equal and fair comparison. It's something noted in a lot of studies. I imagine a century of segregation and racial discrimination kinda puts you and your communities in really bad spots.\n\nAnd a lot of the data, by the way, is based on arrests, not convictions, which can. . be. . well, very contentious to say the least considering the unfortunate and I'm sure COMPLETELY UNFOUNDED accusations of racism in law enforcement and our judicial system. We haven't even touched that elephant in the room.\n\nAnyway, as far as studies go. . maybe it's not ironclad fact but it is a leading theory that a lot of studies back up. How about this, instead of saying \"poverty causes crime\", I will say \"crime is a symptom of poverty\".",

        "text": "@Mahbu Naturally more Violent? No, but look at the communities, the self feeding cycles, the lack of income in those areas. Its something that COULD potentially happen with any community but in this case its black communities, and here in lies the issue when DEALING with said issue. The fucking racism debate. The fucking victimhood complex, but mainly, the racism debate. The media can't help themselves from screaming racism. Everything is about racism. Are they poor? Oh its because of racism. Black guy got pulled over? Oh it HAS to be racism. Black guy robs a store and gets shot by the owner? HAS to be racism. Black kids committing crimes? Racism. A black guy gets criticized? Racism. It does not matter what the real reason is, everyone ASSUMES racism. Everyone RIDES that racism card, the media blows up and raises that racism flag and waves it around, gets the whole country all riled up. Has to be about racism. The cops are just targeting black people, all racism. They are committing crime because of racism. Black guy tried killing a cop, buuuut racism. So we need big movements and riots to combat this racism, cops need to go to jail because racism. Our country needs to fix this racism. Did I mention racism? yeah it was racism. WIth a side of racism with the desert of you guess it, racism. The entire country gets riled up over a imaginary issue. YES i said IMAGINARY, because Racism isn't the issue at all. Yet something cant happen to a black guy without racism being thrown in there. And people who ONLY see everything through the prism of \"because racism\" will never help the issue or communities. Yes racism exist, yes there are racist people. Are black people facing this extreme amount of racism thats causing all this? No. People need to STOP focusing on the racism bullshit and help these communities. Many of these black communities are stuck in a self feeding cycle. Young adult males being put in jail for committing crime, or killed by another black guy, leaving countless single mothers to raise kids in poor communities, and what happens when they grow older? They commit crime trying to get by, and said people knock up more women, and promptly get jailed or killed in this continuous cycle of living in these poor communities surounded by specific issues not being dealt with, voting for politicians that aren't helping these communities, but feeding the cycle thats keeping the whole thing afloat. ENCOURAGING reliance on the government, and again not helping these communities. And yet there are many successful black people out there. So its not like they are targeted because racism. Statistics tell the facts. Full statistics cant be racist. A significant portion of violent crime is done by black people, to OTHER black people. As stated in the video, more officers are sent to areas with higher crime rates, and yet its racism if a cop pulls over a black guy. The media and everyone else makes it extremely difficult to deal with these high crime rate communities. In todays day in age, cops are more HESITANT to shoot a black guy in a dire situation because of the fear of backlash, of being called a racist, and humiliated and losing there jobs.\n\nSo when people finally stop talking about racism, people can focus on the real issues of the communities and work together to solve them. Instead of focusing on issues that arent issues and wont solve THE issue.",

When I first saw Adam Ruins everything, it was about some innocuous issue and I thought the idea of the show was actually pretty interesting (also some of the visuals are actually pretty humorous, like the \"Black Panther\" riding in the toy Jeep in this episode for instance).  However in the second episode about the Electoral College, I immediately recognized a pretty significant political bias based in, as your correctly identified, how the issue of the episode is initially framed.  While the creators of the show would no doubt defend their choice of framing on the basis of \"artistic licence,\" it is always in my opinion the most simplistic and politically expedient framing in which to create a straw-man in order to demagogue the issue.  \n\nUnfortunately too many people take these types of superficially \"researched\" content as gospel, and fail to exercise any critical thinking whatsoever.  This is probably due to a lack of basic understanding or knowledge about the issue, which can be used to identify discrepancies which warrant further research on their own.",

Officers asking the person to hand them the firearm, or removing the firearm and then handing it back to the owner is dangerous for the officer but for some reason they still do this. I also believe that the cop in this case asked for the usual which was license and he also had to show his permit to carry. Thats why he reached for his wallet. Cop if he was jumpy should have asked for him to put his hands on the dash. Not draw and shoot on the poor guy. That case was a cop who was way over emotional about that stop. Perhaps he was racist. Who knows but it was legit a wrongful killing. He should face charges and no longer be a cop as should any of them who do this. I come from a family of law enforcement from cops to judges and there are very stupid people on both sides of the law.",

I give him a lot of credit for making fact based arguments, especially on a subject as taboo as black crime rate and those statistics. Most people can clearly see this correlation and have seen these correlations for decades but if you even try to debate about it or start discussion, you are privileged or unqualified to comment or whatever else the left uses to deflect actual debate and facts.\n\nSo yeah, would love to hear why people are downvoting. I stand by my statement. These people are cowards and know they can't handle a real debate, face to face, so they stay online, behind a screen, and make inflammatory social media posts and downvote videos that don't align with their ideology.\n\nAnd I'm here on YouTube doing almost the same but I made a promise to myself to get off Facebook for politics. If I post anything, I tell people I will on discuss this either one on one via direct message or face to face because all the online soapboxing and grandstanding and other people coming in and making side arguments that it almost turns into the equivalent of 20 people all trying to talk over each other at the same time. I feel like bringing it back old school face-to-face is the only way we are going to get political discussion back into a Humane state.\n\nI can't remember the exact phrase I read somewhere else but it goes something like it's hard to hate someone to their face. All the discussions I have with people face to face always end up way better then if I was arguing with those same people online or on Facebook.",

Nobody talks about it, but it's there.   A lot of people of color are seen as \"Threatening\", but nobody talks about it because the state has a very non-confrontational culture, as well as there aren't a lot of people of color in this state, once you get out of Minneapolis and Saint Paul.   \n\n\n\nAlso, before somebody says BuT YanEz wAS hiSPANiC....\n\n\nA lot of Hispanics consider themselves to be white, because, well...  in Hispanic cultures, light skinned Mestizos kind of are.    And Yanez is a light skinned Mestizo......  Who happens to also be culturally white and afforded some benefits of being culturally white....  Which Mr. Phil wasn't.   \n\n\nWhen you're culturally white, you're afforded certain cultural privileges you simply aren't given when you're \"Authentically a POC\".    Not as much as a white person, but in many circles, you're considered  \"white enough\" if you're a \"naturalized white\"..  Yanez was a naturalized white who shot an African American who is very much, culturally African American.",
