And Marcuse actually worked for the organization that once was the CIA.\n\nJudging from how few real political extremists ever truly appear in American politics, I think this is a reasonable assessment though not verifiable.\n\nWe are still living under the political philosophical influence of Isiah Berlin’s warning against „positive liberty movements“ as a danger to democracy.\n\nSo it seems reasonable that a government agency would create false players.\n\nThat said it might not always be the government. Judging from Jordan Peterson’s nonsensical political positions coming from a normally intelligent person it is a reasonable assumption he was hired by CATO or some other right wing think tank to be a political intellectual pundit.\n\nAnd strangely when you compare Marcuse to Peterson they have remarkable similarities. Both advocate, once again, a political revolution of the psyche not an actual one.\n\nAnd Peterson effectively took a once anti-semetic narrative and turned it into a scapegoating of dead postmodern philosophers. It seems a really cleaver trick which may have had some positive results. But still pollutes reasonable discourse.\n\nIt seems a reasonable stratedgy to maintain a popular discours of non-sense so a serious dscourse can't happen. In the past this might have been a logical thng to do, but when it  merely to maintain an oligarchy it becomes increasngly absurd.",

The 'I've personally seen this' arguement only goes so far.\n\nAs for fervent self loathing, it depends on your definition. Annouced self loathing of the type in this post might be more apparent in the left, as you see it. If I go to 4-chan or 8-chan though, I'll find plenty of clinical examples of self hatred commiserating under the guise of 'It's their fault!'. \n\nThere also exist online incel communities whose goal is to tell other incels why they'll never get laid. Other incels go there specifically for the self flagellation, which perpetuates the cycle. PS: credit to Contrapoints.\n\nFurther, one tactic used by the group 'Life after Hate' is showing those who want to leave that they really aren't inherent failures, that there are other (if you're lucky) options besides hating the dude or dudette next to you.\n\nIs there self announced loathing along the right? Probably not. Like most groups, they act like a locust swarm; if you don't tow the line you get eaten. The kind of self assessment seen here gets deemed as weakness PDQ, pretty much everywhere. I mean, there's a reason the VA has to push so hard to get vets into counseling, and why suicide rates are so high among them.",

Stating it relates to the original video without adding context generates miscommunications like this.\n\nAs for your examples of left, I haven't ignored them per se. I've specifically asked why they mattered. If they both present self-loathing, why does the expression among the left matter? Are you making a claim that proclaimed self loathing is a variant of virtue signalling?\n\nSide note: I'm deliberately avoiding  going through your specific examples for two reasons: 1) the false equivalence deviates from your original point, that leftists expressing self loathing is somehow a bad thing, and 2) going down that rabbit hole starts an endless debate about the human condition that this post can't possibly handle.\n\nAs for my being vet, believe what you will. By all means tell those that investigate it. They'll ask for my DD-214, then tell you to move on.\n\nI have served four years in the Marine Corps infantry, from '93 to '97, and lucked out. You're right, I don't have no combat experience. My unit didn't serve in a combat theater during that time, and no other veteran ever thought less of me for it. They have, in fact, commiserated with a fellow vet, over a drink in god knows how many bars, in VA waiting rooms, and in group counseling sessions, how there own experiences effected them and their families.\n\nMaybe this should end though. If you'd ignore the 'Life after Hate' example, defend your statement by claiming 'so does the left', and define what a real vet would do based solely on combat experience, I'm not sure I'll be able to get though to you.

Yeah, I'm aware that cultural shaming can lead to people hating themselves for traits which are considered 'undesirable' (often labeled wrong or evil) such as homosexuality, and thus why I asked the question, but I get this wall of text looming at me on that very premise. Also, I don't think that's why they think the left is self hating, I believe that reference is reserved predominantly for 'Male Feminists', particularly white ones. And before you get me the complete 2018 compendium of lectures on feminism and start reading them all off, I know that your operational definition of Male Feminist is obviously different than the one used by your political opponents on the Right. Male Feminist in this case is someone who embraces post-modernist feminism and believes that women should be given preferential treatment and superior rights over men, and thus must be self-hating.\n\nOh, and I'm a nihilist contrarian before you even ponder trying to label me. So yes, I will take the opposite position of anyone and never be a hypocrite.",

        "text": "@Kali In Order of how Irritated it made me:\n I do oppose you taking me completely out of context, you smarmy prick. Where it says 'In this case', I'm referring specifically to the context that I am using when I say, \"I don't think that's why they think the left is self hating, I believe that reference is typically reserved for 'Male Feminists'. I go on to elaborate that I know your operational definition for a Male Feminist will, yet another quote, \"obviously different from the one used by your political opponents on the Right\", and then go on to explain that the way I am using it, in my very own reply to you, is as such. And you somehow took that to mean that I think that you would somehow use the definition of the term used by your political opposition on the Right? Despite me saying exactly or as close to as possible the opposite of that statement? Can you take me through the process by which my words were somehow completely fucking inverted for you? \n\nAnticipation of Dissent is why I chose to throw out a personal label, because the lowest common denominator would immediately slander my position with an 'NPC' or 'Nazi' or 'Libtard' or 'Rethuglican' slur, and attempt to discredit my position using that. Ergo, to quickly diminish responses from the weakest possible arguments, I installed a brief but effective rebuttal. I didn't assume you specifically would try to label me, I simply removed the option from the table for anyone. \n\nYeah, I know, you did say I probably already know, and then you included it anyway, and I'd guess you did so to befuddle your actual point, which is, you're super woke, maybe the wokest person to ever wake. Honestly, do you think I'm in High School or Arkansas? Did you just learn about how social and cultural stigmas can lead to internalized shame and personal suffering, and you want to share one of the many facets of that with the world? Well thanks, and that's also the reason my first response to you started with, \"You really had to get that out of your system, huh?\" because it came out like a deluge. You want to share that stuff in case I don't know? Put a little *, and then at the bottom a corresponding * followed by the elaboration so people who are familiar with it don't have to slog through redundant information, and people who aren't will be able to find these elaborations more easily. The layout as it exists is offensive. \n\nAnd to a final point, Bravo on getting my attention with your self congratulatory pat on the back about how I'd 'chosen silence'. I didn't even see the notification for your first reply, and by virtue of it having been lost to the shuffle, you might've actually succeeded in showing me up, had you not mucked that all up. \n\nIf I come across as mean, short tempered, or inhospitable: Tough shit, life is hard.",

Sure, the changes in global avg. temperature is gradual, BUT there comes a point when something has to happen *on that day*, when we're dealing with living, breathing humans. Getting rid of property is not gradual, moving because continuing to live in an area that is flooded seasonally is not gradual, the moving truck won't slowly and gradually appear. Shapiro actually seem aware of this, that while climate is slow moving - the effect it'll have on large populations WILL be something that actually happens, and he is trying to flip this into a positive: They can sell their houses! Tho whom? Nobody nowhere is going to artificially reclaim the ammount of land that Ben is talking about, a 3 metre worst case submersion. Nobody - anywhere - ever. The reclamation you talk about in the Netherlands is an example of the most massive territorial reclamations in human history, and has gone on for centuries. Are you going to buy a bunch of drowned yards, so that you can make your money back 400 years from now? Maybe Ben is. He's talking out his ass.",

Let's assume that the predictions of rising sea levels are correct and your anylisis of the human cost is also correct.\nBen's position appears to be that as the change is gradual, the solutions will be gradual. Yes \"a moving truck will not slowly back up to the house\" but the decision to move, invest in costal defences or develop other solutions to the problem can happen gradually.\nNobody in these regions are going to suddenly find themselves underwater but they do know that it is a potential problem and they do have (roughly) 100 years to address the problem.\nI would propose that people have agency will take action to deal with the potential problem.\nI would argue that business look to provide products and services that there is a potential demand for and that they are likely to provide solutions to this problem.\nI would suggest that the hysterical \"we're all going to die\" narrative is simply a way to frighten people into handing over more power and money to government's who will, in turn, make ham fisted and inefficient attempts to fix the problem and fail.\n\nWhat solutions do you propose?",

I know he acknowledges that climate change is happening but believes that human activity being the main cause is overblown/the effects won't be as bad as scientists are making it out to be. He's still wrong.\n\nTo be honest, I find a lot of his writing hard to reconcile with itself, as though he states a belief or a counterpoint firmly and then never bothers to elaborate on its deeper implication. His evolving views on climate change are a good example of this, like when he tries to balance negatives with positives (arguing that human activity can shift inland and benefit heartland economies like agriculture or mining) that display a only cursory knowledge of the topic (he doesn't seem to know that heartlands will be hit hard by droughts and soil erosion).\n\nMy anger at him actually follows through on that idea - because of this awkwardness with large-scale thinking, Shapiro likes to compress all of his ideas in snappy rejoinders. He strikes me as someone who was an excellent debater in college, and mistook the theater of political debate as a substitute for serious, rigorous, interrogative reflection on ideas (including his own). He's usually very good at bringing up the only points he needs to sound like he has an airtight argument, but the 'sell your houses' clip stood out to me as a Yogi Berra-type line.\n\nMr. Shapiro does not think, he merely performs thought, and gave an underwhelming performance at that.",

We have so many people working within a highly organised system with plenty of checks and balances, taxpayer funded legal representation, oversight etc.\nYour argument appears to be\n\"There are propotionatly more of one race in prison than another race... therefore racism.\nThat's an assumption based on inadiquite information, it's not a convincing argument and it's neither proof of systematic racism nor of you having spent any real time reading or reasoning.",

And since you are British , mate, do you see or have you seen with your own white eyes, as I have, police treating Black people differently than they do white people? I don't think you have. Have you been on jury duty in an American court, as I have, where the prosecutor told us it would be the cop's testimony alone, not any physical or non police testimony, that we would have to base our decision on. Just because a cop is saying something happened, doesn't mean it's true without corroboration as far as I'm concerned. That's one human's perception of what happened. And many times an officer's written reports have been shown to not be infallible.\nSo what I am saying is, is that just because more blacks are convicted of crimes does not necessarily mean they did them. The Central Park Five would be a very prominent case of something like that. (Look it up). Being falsely accused and convicted is no proof of anything. Why does it happen, because the system is racist and has been since the reconstruction and even before that. John Roberts can assert we live in a post racial society, but that doesn't make it true. \nYou really need to research the role of prison labor in the US economy too really comprehend what I am saying. Don't be so snitty in your response.\nI never said you were a Sam Harris fan. I predicted you would behave as he does when someone confronts his world view. Turns out I was right.\nHe says things like \"you're taking me out of context\" or \"you just don't have the scientific understanding that I do\", all the time.\nI have a master's degree in mathematics. I deal in logical fallacy every day, and I know bullshit post hoc ergo promptor hoc pseudo logic when I see it.\nDon't fuck with me boy.\nCome at me with actual arguments it just say directly what you think and what your conclusions are instead of pussyfooting around.",

You can't draw conclusions from these things because we are subject to your own experiences and bias. How you personally see things is only representative of how you personally see things.\n\nWhat would it take for police bias to manifest itself in a conviction?\n\n1. A police officer or offices would have to be bias and a false allegation would need to be made.\n2. Their superior officers would have to be complicit or unaware.\n3. False evidence would need to be manufactured\n4. the crown prosecution would need to believe this false evidence and allow the case to go to court\n5. The accused legal representation would need to be unable or unwilling to disprove the false allegations and or question the false evidence\n6. The judge or jury would need to believe the false allegations and the false evidence beyond a reasonable doubt and convict.\n\nThere are so many people involved in this process. There are so many checks and balances to ensure that no one, as far as reasonably possible, is convicted of a crime they did not commit.\n\nAs a side note. You said: \"see through your white eyes\".\nHow is my race relevant to this conversation? Can you make assumptions about me based on my race?",

You were so vague that the same comment with changed name and one word applies to you.\n\nOur ideas already worked for hundreds millions of people. Life in USSR, China, Cuba, and pretty much any other communist country improved when compared to how it would be if no action was taken.\n\n\"Nature is inherently cruel and immoral. Human societies are inherently cruel and immoral. Attempts to make them otherwise, as communist nations have, have ended disastrously, and even a communist sympathizer such as Three Arrows ought to acknowledge that. \"\n\nNo one has to acknowledge that. Hell, as a capitalist, you yourself agree with system that improved humanity. Look back a hundred years, and you will see rampant racism and sexism, look a hundred more, you will see slavery and death everywhere, a thousand more, and you have societies where majority of population worked their entire lives with almost no free time.\n\nHumans aren't cruel, they  simply act out of survival, just as the rest of nature. That's why altruism exists, even in animals. That's why we are able to live in society we live in today. And why in the future we will live in even better society.\n\n\"The only reason guys listen to the likes of mexie and her YouTubette counterparts is because they (presumably) have a pussy and a pair of tits\"\nThat's pure bullshit. If tits and pussy are so important, then tell my, why Three Arrows has more views? Badmouse? And ton of other members of left wing of Youtube that don't have a pussy?\n\nThis assertion has as much reason as that the only reason anyone ever listens to you is because you have a dick. \n\nHope you and other dick sycophants won't turn our society into an-cap shithole.\n\n\"Also, just as a demonstration of your stupidity, you said fast-food jobs, i.e. burger flippers, are necessary. Except that automation is going to put a lot of people out of work, especially people like fast-food workers, because it's not cost-effective to pay high school age stoners or minorities to do a job that machines can do with greater efficiency and less maintenance.\"\n\nI do know that eventually fast fooders will be replaced by robots, but that is absolutely not important in any way to this discussion. Eventually, pretty much EVERY job will be replaced by robots. AI can think faster and can remember more than any human ever can. Currently it isn't advanced enough to replace everything, but it eventually will be. \n\nIf you think your job is an exceptions, then you are the one proving your stupidity.\n\n\nAs a side note, you say we are impossible to reason with, yet you yourself act only in arogance and overuse ad hominems. If anything, YOU are the unreasonable one here. \n\nPropably because you have no valid arguments of your own, so you try to protect your weak views by attacking everyone.",

The only negative I can ascertain is the 'wasted' natural resources that developing nations can use to further their goals of becoming industrialized. The world body wouldn't necessarily need to punish those nations who are using fossil fuels. They could instead incentivize the creation of safer healthier means of power. \n\nThe same could be done for auto manufacturers and the very people polluting the environment with the extraction of fossil fuels from the earth and sea. Most of these businesses already have subsidies any how the government would only need to prioritize their funds better. \n\nI'm not going to sit here and say I have all the answers but doing nothing will only dig us deeper into this hole. Additionally let's say that your right for arguments sake. What if CO2 levels do shift throughout history. How does increasing or continuing to extract fossil fuels at all make things even marginally better. Maybe that's a straw man but I've read verbatim from people espousing the 'natural climate change' argument. While wholly ignoring collected data since the turn of the 20th century.",

With conventional power we don’t have these issues.\n\nThe only other real alternative energy we have right now is nuclear energy, it produces no air pollution (if you don’t consider non-radioactive water vapour pollution) remember 1kg of uranium is equal to 14 000 kgs of coal. The only pollution it does make can be stored safely in the ground somewhere where it doesn’t hurt anything. Unfortunately people have a irrational fear of nuclear energy from movies or from watching the simpsons and they get triggered when they hear the mention of it. I have no problems with hydro power.",

Fracking receives numerous tax breaks and low-interest government loans precisely because it has enabled the USG, in turn, to have a hand on the lever on international oil markets.

It would _not,_ unlike a 100% renewables grid, result in undue expansion of land use, mining, or reduction in apex predators. Mining in particular would have to explode in output to keep up with the need for rare earths, heavy metals, copper, and concrete for basemats and foundations. \n\nThe revival of a heavy industry like nuclear would bring back to some extent, a working class that has had to endure decades of austerity and disenfranchisement from wage growth; as well as industry offshoring.\n\nWhich is to say it would never happen.

As far as science can tell pretty much all of current climate change is man made, based on the natural cycles of warming and cooling of the planet by the earth's changes in orbit and tilt we should actually be in a period of cooling, likewise the degree of warming we've experienced within the timeframe of the last 100-150 years is incomparable to any observed rate of change in all of the earth's history\n\n2. We can build more nuclear plants in the first world, block tax breaks/subsidies/grants to fossil fuel industries, put those funds back towards renewable developments and updating our energy infrastructure, and develop carbon capture and reforestation projects. The costs for this up front will be large, the low ball projections for the costs of dealing with climate change are many times larger than these initiatives so short term high cost, mid term technically profitable, long term neutral (financially speaking of course, if speaking of social costs or costs to well being and lifestyle these are negligible to take action and massive with inaction)\n\n3. China and India are the most rapidly industrializing nations - right now - but the US has put out more pollution into the world than any other nation directly on its own even if you just start counting from 1900, and our industrial record goes back past that. The first world already industrialized it is ludicrous to assert we can or should stop other nations from doing so, though I am certainly in favor of the first world providing direct, no strings attached aid in speeding up this process past its most egregious phases where more places can employ nuclear and renewables effectively.\nLastly it can't be understated that India and China's pollution is in part the first world's as most of their industry is in service to those nations or part of the value chain of those nation's companies. IE they are polluting for us\n\nIt does not. It may make you a \"climate skeptic\" but hopefully with the basic information presented to you that may change as the position of the skeptic is simply one of ignorance, not in the condescending way simply that the information hasn't been in your life to observe.\nIf you deny the validity of the science then you are a denier.\nIf you don't deny the science and support \"alternative solutions\" like eugenics and cleansings then you would be a monster.",

There always is … The figures indeed are proof that the election was practically free” (‘Why Hitler Triumphed’, Plebs, April 1933, quoted in R Palme Dutt, op. cit. p.128).\n\nAn exactly similar view was expressed by Maxton, the Chairman of the Independent Labour Party:\n\nIn this way Social Democracy attempted to cover its subservience to fascism by the barely-disguised device of first ignoring the conditions of terror under which the election of 5 March was held, and then use this mockery of an election as providing a legitimate mandate for the fascist regime.\n\nSocial Democracy’s disgraceful, degrading and despicable line was to continue after the election in a vain attempt to curry favour with fascism. The speech of the Social Democratic leader, Wels, at the opening of the Reichstag on 23 March, was an important expression of this line. He, as the leader of the party, openly resigned form the Executive Committee of the Second International, accusing the latter of spreading “atrocity stories” against the fascists. The leadership of the trade unions declared its readiness to co-operate with the Nazis, hailed in their press as the fascist “revolution”, as a triumphant “continuation of the 1918 revolution”. It stressed that the common enemy was communism, and that their ‘socialism’ was a “German affair” (Sozial Demokratischer Pressedient, 9 March, 1933, quoted by R Palme Dutt, op. cit. p.129). Reaching the depths of degradation and treachery to the working class, on this basis, the central executive committee of the trade unions gave an official call to the workers to participate in Hitler’s May Day.\n\n“The trade union leaders have sealed their reconciliation with the new rulers of Germany,” wrote the Daily Herald of 24 April 1933.\n\nThe attempt by the reformists of Social Democracy to play the role of a recognised tolerated adjunct to fascism failed, in part owing to the fact that a huge number of workers in the big factories rejected their leaders’ calls and stayed away from the Nazi May Day parades. Once it was crystal clear that the Social-democratic leadership’s grip on the workers was inadequate to serve fascist ends, straight away on 2 May, the Nazis seized the unions, amalgamated them into their own labour front, marched their leaders into prison, and in their place appointed Nazi functionaries.\n\n“The Leiparts and the Grassmanns”, declared Dr Ley, the leader of the Nazi Labour front, “may profess their devotion to Hitler; but they are better in prison” (quoted in R Palme Dutt, op. cit. p.129).\n\nFor its part, the Social Democratic Party traversed the same path of humiliation, degradation and capitulation, followed by dissolution. On 17 May all its members in the Reichstag voted for the fascist government’s resolution and joined in unanimous acclamation of Hitler. Much good did this grovelling do for them! All the property of the Social Democratic Party was confiscated, and on 22 June the organisation itself was declared ‘dissolved’.\n\nWith this, Social Democracy was compelled by the bourgeoisie to continue its disruptive work in the conditions of illegality - conditions in which it could be of greater use to the ruling class in the event of a revolutionary upheaval than if it were to closely and openly identified with fascism.\"",

Gauss Dude, the theory of social fascism kind of made sense back in the Weimar Republic (although it was flawed back then as well), but after knowing what fascism does entail when it comes to power it is totally out of place as well as just obfuscating. You're not going to win any revolutions by sticking to the ideas of 1924.\nA clear distinction between social democracy and fascism is absolutely necessairy. The unwillingness to work with the SPD on any grounds at all is part of what led to the fascist power grab. Yes, there were good reasons for keeping a distance to the SPD and yes, the SPD bares no small part of the blame, but the theory of social fascism was what among other things led to the KPD at times cooperating (!) on local levels with the NSDAP for a short time, even if they were always seen as antagonistic, because for the KPD there was functionally little difference between SPD and NSDAP and ending the WR justified the means in the eyes of the KPD. Your account of the actions of the SPD regarding the NSDAP and Hitler are also very onesided and leave out many important factors, like the SPD being the only ones voting against the Ermächtigungsgesetz, (ineffectively) suing illegitemate practices by von Papen in 1932 that enabled the fall of the WR and other things.\nAgain, the SPD, did many things wrong, among these a not nearly strong enough resistance against fascism, but your  rethoric isn't helpful.

She even started a newspaper for that explicit purpose. And, not to forget, if you go by election results from the time she also did not have a majority of popular support behind her revolution. \n\n\"Civil war is just another word for class struggle and the thought of implementing socialism without class struggle by a parliamentary majority is a ridiculous petit-bourgeois Illusion.\"\n\nSo the SPD tried to stop a brewing civil war, especially under the impressions of the terror of civil war and revolution going on in Russia at the time, while not actually having control over the military. That all collapsed due to the end of WW1. So the SPD tenously allied itself with the only game in town, reactionary left-over military units, basically \"rogue\" military, which was a shitty thing to do. And those murdered Luxemburg and Liebknecht, which was a horrific crime. But not really a surprise for the thought leaders of one side in a civil war.\n\nAnyway TL;DR: A lot more than just \"dissent\"",

    "text": "I agree with what you're saying about the limitations US government power, as opposed to \"private\" power, being used to regulate hate speech. I just wanted to add a bit of context about the SPLC and the role of nonprofit organizations in the US political system, at the risk of telling you something you might already know.\n\nMy main issue with your analysis is referring to these groups as \"private sector\" organizations, but this might just be a cultural/linguistic difference. In the US, the phrase \"private sector\" is used almost exclusively to refer to for-profit companies and entities that do not have providing public services as a primary part of their mission statement, whereas the \"public sector\" refers to governmental entities. However, the \"nonprofit sector\" is quite different in its social and economic role in the US and refers to charitable organizations. It includes everything from the Red Cross to the National Rifle Association.\n\nThe SPLC is a 501(c)3 charitable organization, referring to the legal code for the tax-exempt status conferred on charities. These groups \"must be organized and operated exclusively for exempt purposes set forth in section 501(c)(3), and none of its earnings may inure to any private shareholder or individual. In addition, it may not be an action organization, i.e., it may not attempt to influence legislation as a substantial part of its activities and it may not participate in any campaign activity for or against political candidates.\" They are also legally required to collect as much donor information as possible and to disclose all that information and their complete financial reports for each fiscal year. (Source: https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/exemption-requirements-section-501c3-organizations)\n\nSPLC reported an operating budget of just over $44 million and nearly $450 million in total assets for FY 2017 (Source: https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/103117_afs.pdf) This arguably makes SPLC a mid-sized charity by US standards, with the largest foundations dwarfing these numbers by an order of magnitude (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wealthiest_charitable_foundations). The median salary for nonprofit CEOs is $123,000 annually in 2014, though there were 76 organizations with CEO compensation over $500,000, including 10 that were over $1 million. (Source: https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/2016+CEO+Comp+Study/2016+CEO+Compensation+Study.pdf)\n\nThe nonprofit sector is vital to the functionality of society in the US, as the federal government and many state governments are loathe to allocate funds for and/or to directly provide social services, as I'm sure you know. I just felt the need to add this context for anyone who cares. Again, I'm sorry if I'm repeating stuff that people already know and for the long comment, but this distinction is quite salient to the understanding the functions of US society.\n\nBig fan here. Keep up the great work!",

It's not really a fair caricature of the right, or every encounter I've had with conservatives. I urge you to find more progressive youtube channels as they often will debate right leaning folks and even someone like Steven Crowder is afraid to debate Sam Seder, how are you suppose to find the correct ideology when that rhetoric isn't being challenged? Although I will say luckily there are many conservatives willing to debate thank god. I'm thinking of going to a politicon to watch some for myself.

        "text": "​@iantodoyle7876 It is very hard to make valid criticisms of Peterson because he rarely says anything falsifiable .\n\nWhenever he said something like that thou, he is  almost always lying or wrong.\n\nThe most simple thing to point is the fact that he constantly uses correlations and talks about them as if they are causality.\n\nAnother thing is the fact that he constantly references books which he most likely never read (judging by the volume of misquoting he does).  For instance, he most certainly never read Marx (not that I am a fan, I am just trying to be honest) \n\nHe also  holds this weird opinion that if men who are not capable of finding a woman lose all stake in society and they become violent.  He says that because he is using one of the most annoying fallacies - the idea that you can tell a reasonably sounding evolutionary tale about how things would work if we followed evolutionary principles and by that you will be doing science. \nThat's bullshit. And also the study he shared on the topic disagreed with him. So I guess he never even fucking read it. The study concluded that if you differentiate men on the amount of sex they are having, there aren't less violent men than the people who never had sex. (We are talking about adult men, it's not a statistical issue brought by the fact that they are also selecting kids)\n\nAnother annoying lie was when he pretended it is a scientific fact that IQ is causal for income. The biggest study on the topic is getting the opposite results through regression analysis. And he referenced no study when he spoke (he almost never does and when he does it seems he never read it or is intentionally misleading)\n\nThe idea is that I can continue forever with this. He is lying/wrong every time when he says anything falsifiable . If you are searching for valid criticism just read any of the books he is referencing. We are not at the point in which we can criticize his logic or something. He is simply completely dishonest, there is no statement to debate past that.",

        "text": "A very interesting thread, with different voices. Thank you all. My take away is be careful, check sources. I like the correlation isn't causation. That he doesn't quote his sources unless its an old book. It is notable that an angry woman feeling blamed and shamed can't see the actual discussion. Decades ago feminists were not using make up for the reasons he mentioned. Its not new to me. Men's dress code at work is highly regulated and not designed to set off super-signals. I have over the years seen many women unconscious of their sexual signaling through dress or make up. And often v aware of it. I did help a friend deal with unwanted attention. It was simple, don't smile, step away, drop the eye contact, say something to clearly express the displeasure, move away. It was very effective. Her interpretation of doing the opposite was that she was being nice, and he should get it. I am v careful with my interactions, that I am clear and with boundaries. I am not blaming anyone. And I talk to men about the confusing signals some women give and our need not to play out our inner dramas but do personal development, therapy, personal transformation which will bring about better behavior which will stick in the long run. Codifying behaviours helps. I am staggered at young peoples free and easy relationship to intimacy, and lack of awareness of consequences. But we all learn the hard way, I certainly have. The grievance studies hoax is quite a revelation, which hopefully will help things get back on track. I like old school equity feminism. And I am involved in men's work which is respectful towards women, yet not what is termed cucks. How do we get there? Delving into our shadows, owning our shit, reframing into positive masculinity in its many forms. I am v wary of any ideology, and its attendant religiousosity which seems to be a human trait across history. And will continue to discern what's useful (as best I can) and drop the rest. go well.",

But that discrimination is defined as \"to deny services, employment, accommodation and similar benefits to individuals, based on their identity(sex, race, religion,  etc), to matters within federal jurisdiction, such as the federal government, federal services to the public, or a federally regulated industry.\"  The University of Toronto talked to JP about his conduct because he was being an asshole, which is not illegal, but does probably break their code of conduct.  It would go againist the CRHA if JP refused to teach someone based on their gender expression; an action which should be illegal, just as it is with sex, race, religion, etc.\n\nBecause the bill amended an existing legislation, it gets all of the ruling of that legislation; Hatred, and therefore Hate Speech as an act of performing Hatred, in regards to the Criminal Code and the Canadian Bill of Rights, is defined as \"predicated on destruction, and hatred against identifiable groups therefore thrives on insensitivity, bigotry and destruction of both the target group and of the values of our society.   Hatred in this sense is a most extreme emotion that belies reason; an emotion that, if exercised against members of an identifiable group, implies that those individuals are to be despised, scorned, denied respect and made subject to ill-treatment on the basis of group affiliation.\"(R v Keegstra, Chief Justice Dickson). So using a racial slur, or intentionally misgendering someone, would not be considered Hate Speech (though maybe hateful in the non-legal sense), but calling for the death of all black people, or teaching your students that there is a vast conspiracy Jews out to destroy the world, for example, do fall under Hatred.\n\nWhich article?",

Also, the article which explained that misgendering was unlikely to be considered hate speech presented a legal opinion, as there has not been any case dealing with it yet. The problem was that the law already had the effect of making his university try to censor him, as they feared that even discussion of the topic might create an environment triggering corporate liability. So the law already had a provable negative effect. The other point is that people already argue that criticizing this ideology is equivalent to \"denying trans people's humanity\" and therefore arguing for their non-existence or extinction. No need to convince me that this argument is ludicrous, but google and you will find it. Unscientific ideology should never be enshrined into law is all I'm really pointing towards.

        "text": "I see the EC as a pointless middleman. There are 340 million Americans. It shouldn't matter what state you live in when voting on the national level. It also flips votes in states that are winner-take-all. An example is my state, Ohio. Trump won something like 51% of the state, but gets all the EC votes, essentially flipping everyone who didnt vote for him. My vote for Jill Stein basically didn't matter....that that it would matter anyway. Part of the problem with the 2 state party is they determine who can even participate in the debates, with Stein and Gary Johnson being left out entirely. As others have pointed out, this means we can have a very lively debate in the box created by the two broken parties (the Democrats suffering a schism after Bernie Sanders was screwed by the DNC in favor of Clinton, with the progressives vs the corporate centrists, and the various factions within the GOP at odds with each other, from the Alt right to Christian fundamentalists to the Ancaps in the \"libertarian\" party/section). Representative democracy (if you even want to call it democracy) can only work if the representatives do the job they were elected to do: represent their consituents. \nInstead, it looks like top-down concentrated government cannot help but corrupt people, like Tolkien's \"one ring\", and we are left with illusions of democracy while a democratically elected aristocracy tries to balance public interest with their own interests.",

It argued that among Muslim immigrants (a broad swath that spans from Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa), esp their children, the tendency toward in-group identification was related to their ability to take part in their host country's life (seeking employment, education, meeting people and making friends, travel, generally feeling welcome, etc). \n\nAs I mention here in America with the Irish, that is exactly what we saw. When we did everything we could to push them away, they turned inward. We saw the same with Latin American and South American immigrants as well. Believe it or not, prior to 9/11, Middle Easterners were integrating into the US quite well. Then the witch hunts and villification started. We reap what we have sewn, and I do not want to see Europe make the same mistake. Pushing immigrants away only serves to turn the most dire outcomes into self-fulfilling prophecies.\n\nAnother lesson from America: it is a fools errand to control immigration. Nothing really controls the flow of immigration apart from how well your country is doing economically. Only thing quotas do is push more of it underground. If your country has economic opportunity, people will get in by hook or by crook. Trying to hold it back is like trying to hold back a river. Even dams work by re-directing water flow. And people are more uncontrollable than water.\n\nI won't lie and say it will be easy. It won't. Nor will it be free of violence and bloodshed along the way. It won't. Watch Gangs of New York when you get the chance. While it is a movie, reality wasn't too far off. That's how bad it was along the way in assimilating the Irish. What we have the benefit of hindsight; use it. The less you fight it, the more you facilitate it, the faster the violent phase can be gotten through.\n\nIn addition, as they change, so too will your countries change. No, rest assured most do not want Sharia (apart from jobs, they usually come to get away from that too). But expect African and Middle Eastern food to become part of the national palette, mosques to become common as churches and synagogues, and for words to be loaned in both directions.\n\nAnother thing to accept; assimilation will never be 100%.",

        "text": "@alexgroot2508 Frankly, speaking as someone who lives in America, I think Europe should be concerned with their own homegrown theocrats. The American Religious Right is bad, it has damn near destroyed my country...but, for the time being, it appears to be in a kind of decline. They don't shape the Right's agenda and rhetoric like they used to. This is because Christianity's universalist message, even when filtered through RW politics, doesn't play well with immigration restriction. While it always played second fiddle to the interests of money, it now play third fiddle in the big scheme of the Right. It exists now as a kind of dog whistle for racial notions, much like the word \"Christendom\" in more distant times.\n\nI think what held back an outright theocratic takeover was the actions of a fairly vigorous and active secularist movement(s) that arouse during the 70's and stretched on through to the last decade. We rightly mock today's \"skeptics\", but not long ago it was a noble title held by people worthy of it. While not completely successful, in the long term they did de-legitimize outright religious appeals. To say nothing of how secularism is explicitly enshrined in the Constitution. Slaveholders though they may have been, the Founders wisely understood the dangers of state sponsored religion. I know this also created fertile ground for fundamentalism to arise, a pox that has slowly spread across the Atlantic. Having a national church does, paradoxically, have a way of moderating religious fervor. However, just as constitutional secularism ultimately also stopped the Religious Right by holding their theocratic agenda against an ideal of secularism, so too does Europe's national churches make them vulnerable to a theocratic takeover.\n\nThat's because, over a very long period of time, maintaining national churches legitimizes the presence of religion in politics. The de facto secularism of Europe is the result of historical contingency, of faithful being battered by modernity and coming to terms with it. It's something, as an American, I don't fully understand. But I do understand this; de facto secularism is something with an expiration date. And while the fundamentalism is our fault, the fact remains is that now it's beginning to infect your population and you are all blindsided.",

So far so obvious, its rather unfortunate that from that succes they got it into their silly little heads that they were qualified to talk about actually complicated social issues (without actually reading up on what feminism, islam, immigration etc entailed).\n\n\nThat caveat aside, I personally disagree at least so far as western Europe is concerned. You're not wrong for eastern Europe, where religion is still a very strong factor. But for all that neo-fascists decry 'islam is the fasted growing ideology in the west!' (presuming that is inherently bad) they are plain wrong: irreligiousness is the fasted growing religion in Western Europe. The only reason our largest national Christian party stays afloat is on account of its hardline nationalist rhetoric, not on its religious roots, and even then it has to be considered that the combined share of all Christian parties in parliament is some 30 out of 150; and by all accounts that stands to decline further.",

If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.—In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be most unwise. But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols. We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant.\"\nKarl Popper",

Why would coal miners who are descendants of traditional unionists vote for Trump?\n\nGo back in history, the first Red Scare was more frightening because they hung people and tar and feathered and various other brutalities. And it was directed at labor not Hollywood movie stars.\n\nWhat the left in the USA does not get is to what degree leftist ideas were stamped out in the early 19th century.\n\nAnd the left forget the political logic. The philosophy was generally Anarchists who questioned illegitimate authority including big government but also big industry.\n\nI think the anarchists socialists ideology eventually may have even warped into modern day libertarianism who only question big government and not big industry.\n\nBut the libertarians of the 19th century were very left wing.\n\nJust as the left of today has become mainly identity politics rather than income inequality and labor issues.\n\nEven the narrative spun against “trump supporters being racist” is suspicious. Anti-immigration was a left wing union talking point for over one hundred years because immigration destroyed union collective labor bargaining. That idea is Marxism 101 in regards to an oversupply of labor.\n\nBut instead of the left recognizing that trump supporters might be speaking the language of old school union labor the modern left spins the narrative that “they are all racists”.\n\nThat is how absurd and twisted and ineffective left politics have become.\n\nHow different would it be if so-called academic left studied Marx and cooperatives and union history and educated laborers and the poor in West Virginia? Instead they are called deplorable by Hillary Clinton who has no clue in regards to labor.",

Respecting, protecting and promoting the rights of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes and properties as stipulated in UN resolution 194.\" The claim to a so-called \"right of return\" for Palestinian refugees from the 1948 war *and their descendants* (who now number in the millions) is almost universally understood as advocating for a so-called \"One-State\" solution. I don't want to get into a legal or ethical argument about how to interpret resolution 194, but it is pretty clear that the movement seeks to eliminate Israel as a Jewish State.  You misrepresented this fact at the 10:45 mark. Of course, one can argue that states ought to be completely neutral with respect to the rights of their citizens, but that is certainly not the case elsewhere in the Arab world (or, for that matter, in much of Europe).",

Both systems are 100% about free speech. But they still work way differently. The latter still ends up suppressing hate based positions, since such positions have no logical support, and the former is always allowed to be corrupted by money, because it's a marketplace, and therefore always about purchasing power.",

In principle, it may open the door to a general unhealthy interest in curving the pursuit of historical knowledge. \nRecently, a law was passed in France to equate anti-zionism and anti-semitism, and the prominent argument for it was that it was a continuation of those laws, although it means basically that criticizing the state of Israel - or at least its legitimacy - is now illegal. \nI also think that banning nazi literature such as \"Mein Kampf\" is a strategic mistake : it gives this text a sort of mystical aura, as if it contained a forbidden arcane... whereas it's actually extremely stuffy, boring and preposterous, and would probably appear so even to a racist far-right leaning reader. \nAnyway I enjoy your videos a lot.

If I may politely disagree on one theme - I believe you are too optimistic about our ability as a country to somehow arrive at reasonable solutions. Your criticism of the Koch brothers and the undue influence of money on politics is spot on. And while I think climate change is a real thing, the Right's criticism of some on the Left seeing it as a means of advancing a decidedly non-Capitalist financial agenda is also quite true.  BOTH sides have politicized the issue to the point where the average voter is frightened to vote either way. Do I want corporate greed or do I want to be taxed to death? What a lousy choice to have to make.  I don't expect to change your mind, and your command of the facts is probably superior to mine, but in my heart of hearts, I believe it's true, because it is human nature to wield both facts and lies as cudgels much like the proto-humans at the start of \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" wielded the bones of animals in a fight over the water hole. That's us. That's a fact. All else being equal both things can be true - both the political Right and the political Left (as defined in the US) are on the wrong side of things. The reasonable folks who think that both sides can have the occasional good idea and would like to use what works (as opposed to what The Party espouses) are squeezed out in their vice-like grip.\n\n\nAll that said (sorry for the rant!)

    "text": "I'm something of an idealistic libertarian-minded type, so my first reaction to a lot of what you are saying is \"no no no no no!\".  But pushing past my first gut reactions, you touched on my biggest concern - encroaching oligarchy on the democratic system.  I feel at conflict with myself as ideally the government should not be aggressing upon either individual or business that is not engaging in violent behavior. However, businesses and individuals should not be interfering with the democratic process or abusing it, such as large corporations effectively bribing or blackmailing politicians into giving them corporate welfare.\n\nAnd funny, I did not know Marco Rubio had done that... I am strongly against BDS (the movement at it's core is driven by antisemitism, imo) but even more strongly against such government interference. Didn't like him much before, I like him a lot less now.\n\nThank you for your informative and thoughtful videos, even the ones that challenge what I strongly believe.",

        "text": "LGBTQ Conservative:  Well, firstly, I would suggest you might be making the mistake of looking at social/political structures and economic structures as separate things.  They aren't.  The government is always involved in the economy, by definition, because the government is (or should be) the agent of the people, and people are obviously part of the economy.  Even by not \"intervening\" in the economy at all, the government is making a choice about how the interests of people are represented in their economy.  So every choice the government makes, or refrains from making, has economic impact.  To paraphrase Geddy Lee, If you choose not to intervene in the economy, you still have intervened in the economy.\n\nSecondly, now that you're studying macroeconomics, I suggest you focus sharply on the distinction between private and public goods.  There are huge sections of our economy that are just structurally not suited to private sector control.  There will never be a way to make a profit building roads, maintaining a military, educating poor children, protecting the environment, or giving healthcare to the elderly and indigent.  Yet those things are at the beating heart of our economy.  That's what government is for.  In fact, I would state that even more strongly -- the very purpose of government is to intervene in the economy.  The alternative is anarcho-capitalism.  So called \"crony capitalism\" is just a political dysfunction.  If that's your concern, we need to focus on getting the money out of politics, not getting the politicians out of the economy.",

        "text": "@Revelwoodie I know and as for building roads and the environment I agree. As for military, education, and healthcare we do most of those now with Private security companies, private schools, and our current healthcare system. I will first address military because personally I don't think it should be in the private sector. Then for schools I think private schools are better because they are more beholden to parents because parents want the best for their children and would remove their child from a private school that doesn't provide the education that was promised, though having public education run by the government would be fine if parents who don't send their children to public schools didn't have to pay for them in taxes. The healthcare system in the US is ok, but could use some work, personally I think a dual option would be better where there is a single-payer system, but people can opt-out if they don't want to be apart of a government run healthcare system. I agree with the environment safety standards being under government because everyone agree that we shouldn't polluting.\n\n\nWhile I agree that money should be out of politics honestly that won't happen until we get the old guard out of DC which all congressmen/women who have been in congress for more than 12 years need to be voted out and some fresh blood voted in.",

It states 3 things: 1) \"Ending the occupation and colonization of all Arab lands\", which can mean both the West Bank and Gaza AND sovereign Israeli territory. They don't specify which lands they consider \"colonized.\n\n2) Recognize full equality between Arabs and Jews. Which is fine, but here's the catch:\n\n3) Respecting and protecting the rights of all Palestinian Arab refugees to \"return to their homes and properties as stipulated in UN resolution 194\". A resolution from 1949.\n\nPut the three of those aspects together, and you will notice why the BDS rejects saying there is a need for a two state solution, because what the BDS wants is to end the Jewish State, be it with one or two Arab states that replace it. The \"return\" of refugees, which they consider descendents of refugees included, would overnight end Jewish majority in Israel. Considering number 2, which forces the preservation of Israel's democratic rights to Arabs, it means the vast majority of the population would become Arab, thus ending the Jewish State.\n\nIn other words, supporting the BDS is a rejection of the Two State solution, and a rejection of the basis of UN resolution 242 that is the basis of all the peace process. They are essentially supporting the thesis of Hamas. This is why the first point, the \"ending the occupation and colonization of all Arab lands\", is associated with the Hamas thesis that Tel Aviv is also a colonization project and should be razed to the ground. At the very least, it should be returned as \"Tell al Rabiya\", whatever that is.\n\nThis is sneaky and full of dogwhistles of denying Jews the right for self determination, which means denying Jews a human right, being that inherently antisemitic.
