  "description": "https://www.gofundme.com/lets-show-the-chicago-victim-love\nSupport the victim\n\nFollow me on the twitter @iamsean90\n\nThis is an update the accused have been charged with a hate crime\nThe accused in this case are in custody, and the victim has been identified as a mentally ill youth. The four attackers bound and beat the victim, repeatedly mocked them and broadcast it with FaceBook Live. \n\nMy rant was related to the incident, the ideology that I believe inspired it, misinformation, the misattribution of blame, and why Social Justice types seem to attack themselves.\n\nNews Source: http://www.fox32chicago.com/news/crime/227116738-story\n\n\nFAIR USE NOTICE\nThis video may contain copyrighted material; the use of which has not been specifically authorized by the copyright owner.
