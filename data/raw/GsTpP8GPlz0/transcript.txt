what's up guys the actual justice warrior here and I just want to get right into it in my last video I talked about the Chicago kidnapping and torture of a mentally disabled person because he was white and therefore a trump supporter Donald Trump now that was a quick rant and I didn't really have very many edits in it it was just me getting some stuff off my chest unfortunately there were some audio issues and some people on mobile couldn't hear it so I'm gonna give you a quick recap and then I'm gonna talk about the fallout and a way to help the victim for those you who are unaware for black people kidnapped a white disabled person held him for 48 hours tortured him including partially scalping him filmed it and put it on Facebook live now in my last video I criticized certain people who were saying black lives matter kidnapping or black lives matter kidnapped this kid and the reason I did that is because there was not enough evidence at that point to condemn black lives matter for this action and I talked about the difference between something being inspired by an organization or inspired by an ideology and something being done or sanctioned by the ideology there's new information coming in but as of right now there's still no link between black lives matter the organization either in an inspirational role or in a direct role in my last video I did talk about how social justice warriors have felt kind of emboldened since the Trump election to film themselves doing horrible [ __ ] and then posting it online and I have no doubt in my mind that they were inspired by some of the less anti Trump rhetoric they kept calling him a trump supporter or saying [ __ ] Donald Trump while they were beating him as if that justified it and as I pointed out in my video I felt like the reason why they kept saying [ __ ] Donald Trump or [ __ ] white people but specifically Trump is because the media has been demonizing Trump and his supporters so they thought if they said [ __ ] Donald Trump they would rally people to their cause fortunately for the rest of society even the people commenting on the video as it was live-streaming we're like what the [ __ ] are you doing what's wrong with so most people when they saw this recognize that it was in fact wrong however despite the fact that these people targeted a mentally disabled person based on the color of his skin people are debating whether or not this is a racially based hate crime the four assailants have been charged with a hate crime but it's unclear whether or not they were charged because the victim was disabled or because it was a racial attack now of course the social justice warrior side of the left has been either supporting him or trying to downplay whether or not this was a hate crime because you know black people can't be racist in their crazy world black racists what even an that while those are just random people on Twitter the most egregious thing that I saw was the CNN coverage of this incident Simone Sanders who's a Democratic strategist and activists had this to say about the incident so this is absolutely sickening but I'm gonna say something that's probably not very popular we cannot callously go about classifying things as a hate crime motive here matters so was this for hate of Donald Trump the president-elect because the things that he said or was this for pure hate of white people that matters hate crimes are because of a person's racial ethnicity all the crime has to involve I just I just want to remind folks that we cannot sit here and ignore that for at least for the last year on very public display the worst parts of America have been brought from the fringe into the mainstream so that affects people on both sides we've talked about white nationalists and white supremacists and the KKK but there are also this when this inflammatory rhetoric is out there when someone is repeatedly telling you that your community is the worst of the worst it brings out the worst of the worst in people wait what she [ __ ] blamed Donald Trump for an attack on somebody when the attackers were yelling [ __ ] Donald Trump Donald Trump I swear to [ __ ] god yo liberals will blame Trump for [ __ ] anything something bad can happen to Trump and the attacker could say [ __ ] Donald Trump and they'll still figure out a way to blame him for the violence obviously these people if they lean to any political direction it was the one that's away from Donald Trump but anyway I'm tired of talking about the attackers and the people who tacitly support or defend them I actually want to talk about a way that you can help the victim I happened to stumble across a legitimate GoFundMe page for the victim of this incident I'm gonna put the link in the description below and if you want to donate and help out please do so when I last checked they had raised about $15,000 and instead of sharing this video or liking this video which you should totally do it's more important that you actually share that link I'm not a doctor or anything but when somebody cuts so deep into your scalp that you can see the [ __ ] skull I would assume that there is a long recovery after that so anything that you can do to help the victim would be greatly appreciated I'm sure by him and the family that's all the information I have for you guys today if you want to like or subscribe or leave a comment please do so if you want to share that video go ahead this has been the actual justice warrior until next time
