[Music] hello wonderful people I I brought you all here to talk about we could we can make it an overarching discussion if you want about in general like these like leaving the left Pipelines um and we can also talk about who recently left the left who I told y'all I told y'all that that was the plan I just want to say it's crazy to me because when people don't like me and they want to disrespect me it be loud it be viral everybody be talking plenty [ __ ] and it's crazy cuz I told everybody this is obviously a step in the obvious plan for Hal I said that so I just want to say nobody told nobody no apologies no nothing so I'm here to tell everybody I told y'all so I told say this you know you never you always wait at least I do I wait for like the people to say I was wrong and you were right it just never happened so that's how you got to say it but but for I think people like us who are in this business at least for me there's I'm constantly chasing the high of being right like that is truly better than any drug that I've um ever experimented with uh and in the end it's like a hollow feeling cuz I want people to be like yeah Emma was right the whole time and just never comes like those Biden Dropout people or when we were saying that he had to drop out and that KLA Harris would have a better chance in the race and they were all saying no she'd Creator to Trump completely didn't think I did not think it was possible that that man was dropping out of oh yeah mik we get a we get a we were right moment CU we were on that we were on that podcast specifically all right although I will say from my original video I put out like two videos of just like me talking on my comma thoughts like when she first like she first became the nominee and after right and I made my my second one was like okay maybe I was wrong yeah yeah I just want to say all literally all my cynicism checked out it's literally all of it checked out the the black community constantly attacking her Blackness less black support and and worried about like lower turnout because of foolishness like that and you know what's crazy I wish that I never I went when I made my La I made a video for in my show O squar this week talking about um uh the the black male vote right so I did the stats on on the de the racial demographics for like the last four elections and you know what I confirmed white people don't ever support the Democratic candidate white or black but certainly never so I was like the sheare amount of white women that were mad as [ __ ] that I said white women will never vote for her when I am absolutely correct they acted like I was just t i was if I had seen the stats like with my eyes I wouldn't even have been like like nice about it like the second I was like okay maybe I was wrong maybe they all going to go no they're not they don't go out no they're not so I just say I mean I hate to I hate to burst your synesis in bubble but I think right now she's polling better with white women then I think she's going to win I think she I think she might win but I don't think she's getting majority of any white people certainly win saying she not majority of any that's my point in the black in the that's my point she's not actually you see how we like change the bar when it comes to like white people CU you know there's no such thing as getting the majority of the white vote as any kind of democrat or Progressive like when just getting more white people like more white people is like a win like oh she's getting them no she's not not technically if only 40% of black people were supporting somebody no one would say they got the black vote but with white people it's like they're getting it no they're not but it's never framed that right like you don't hear this thing where it's like hey we have to reach out to male white men because they're being sexist for not voting for like camea Harris and I'm like but they're they're overwhelmingly the demographic that you should be worrying about when talking about this issue right right yeah this is true I and this is true I I also am of the mind that like people can deal with things in house like in the case of Obama making the remarks like other people making the remarks and I agree with people who think it's like negligent of Obama to make those comments in a platform where he knows that like white people are going to take it and run with it and make this like overarching fine but generally I think like it's okay to be like yeah like other people are worse you know other racial demographics might be worse but it's still not untrue that sexism is motivating like it press very well alive in our community and motivating why there's less support for her so it's like I don't love when when it becomes okay because white men are worse on this and all these other people are worse on this then we're not also like bad on this like we still are sexism is incredibly you know present so I think like it's okay for black people to be like like in the case of Obama I'm thinking about black people and in and in the case of Obama I think and I made this like argument in my video o squar I think what makes this different is he knows that she's not going to win the white male vote she's not going to win the white vote the Democrats don't win the white vote how Obama won Obama did not win the white vote Obama won because of historic black voter turnout you know and he got and he got the overwhelming majority so Obama's concern is not that like he's not trying to say that the majority of black people don't support the Democrats or aren't going to support kamla he is commenting on his worry that less black people are going to turn out for KLA as they turned out for him which was essential to his win and he thinks a lot of the reason motivating why there's less turnout in interest is cuz black there are a lot of black men who are being sexist and I think that's a I think that's a fair take like I know like it's very controversial to folk but I think it's I think what makes a lot of people recoil Gavin and I included we were talking about this a lot like obviously we're two white guys from the Midwest but when you look at a poll that says 76% support from black men for commo like across the general election pretty difficult for anybody that's being honest with themselves to be like oh she's really struggling with this demographic so from my POV that's kind of how I look at it and then you see people who like you know potentially the later subject of this episode writing a substack article talking about how the black male support is surging with Donald Trump and like what is he doing to uniquely message to these individuals and it's like dude nothing well nothing you know successful he's getting like 20% support and you're acting like it's historic because you want to validate that you want to make it look like oh my gosh all these black men in Michigan are going to vote for Trump so that in six weeks I can vilify them and talk about like this is why the black community is like divided and this is why homelessness is a problem and all those like you know pre contrived narratives that you were already married to in advance you know what I mean so I think a lot of us on the outside where I'm like hey dude like let's not create problems where they don't exist let's not create even more hysteria when we're already fighting back against this tie raid right and I happen to be of the opinion and I saw uh Emma did a great segment with Dave Wile about this the other day like yo I think that we're going to actually see a way bigger turnout for kamla than we're expecting uh and I think it probably is going to come from people of color largely from black communities right and I think it will kind of I think you're dead wrong have you seen poly Market have you been looking at Poly Market all right the stats don't lie come on yeah oh those are that's that's what's so FR I think sorry to to cut you off Olay but just just to that point about Trump is not getting 20% of the blackmail yeah he's not that's no chance we had we they did this last time they did this in 2020 oh he's surging in Black communities ex like there's this Dynamic where Republicans always think they're going to win and they act in that manner and Democrats are always panicking that they're going to lose I mean that's there's it's asymmetrical Warfare to a degree because Republicans don't believe in government they like the fact that Trump's a troll that gives a middle finger to the libs and triggers them and if he doesn't win yeah the Q and on folks are going to be hysterical but for the most part they're nihilistic about politics and what politics provide for people anyway so it's just like whatever [ __ ] out of luck for Democrats they panic and So like um I I I think that that number is just way inflated right now in polling yeah to compare to the Obama Coalition it's just fascinating because Obama turned out a lot of low propensity voters and that was a coalition that was both uh there was a difference in education a wide variety of people voted for Obama back in 2008 and that Coalition has fractured Harris and Biden had targeted High propensity voters and those and the stratification among college educated versus non-college educated is Extreme this election I don't know what it says in the future about the constituency that the Democrats need to cultivate because they need workingclass people in their Coalition but in terms of Voters who are most likely to go out and support them the Democrats are driving up numbers with likely voters that's their strategy right now and so when I see these things like this is the closest election in the world I really don't buy it and I think there's a lot of like out this whole poly Market garbage this Wall Street Journal article about how someone dumped $30 million in crypto four accounts into poly Market to boost Trump's odds and so it has people thinking like oh man he's he's the favorite in this race he's not the favorite in this race and which might not even actually help him overall sometimes if people feel like it does set the stage for claiming the election was stolen though right they can always be like all the poly markets were showing that his numbers were like outrageous and all this kind of stuff I don't put that past them at all oh yeah no I think it's already part of the play and I think that this does bolster that I I hadn't thought of that but yeah yeah but at point I think at the end of the day like if we're talking about um reaching out in demographics like can we also [ __ ] on the Democrats a little bit for like why are you appealing so much to Republicans why do we have to hear about war criminals being like Oh there's a big tent it's going to be a brat summer Dick Cheney Bernie Sanders you can't like that stuff is terrible it alienates the base it pisses everyone off and Republicans are already calling her like a communist dictator they they're they're not looking for like oh yeah I can't wait to have you know her in power because first of all I think the country is not as Progressive as we like to pretend it is I I just think like I've seen this in a lot of our like commentaries or whatever over the months like we be wanting like politicians to say all the leftist things as though that will not make them an unelectable candidate like I think that's one we have to be honest about what America is and I really don't think we are um two I think in the case of and I actually heard Sam Cedar talking about this on the Vanguard I I I became a Vanguard member last night to listen to Sam finish what he was saying very nice um and Sam I think what Sam was saying I think was like very spoton because KLA is black it doesn't matter how moderate we know she is and all of that and y y y because KLA is a black woman they go and they like that is equivalent to being a a radical she's woke she's this she's that she's that which the rest of the country does not like like they don't want the idea of a black woman that they think is a radical and is woke in all these different things so that's why like she's trying to go out of her way to signal to them that she's not the leftist radical black woman because that is not that is not even an elect that wouldn't even be that wouldn't even appeal to black people you know what I mean you can do that without praising a war criminal though like is not popular with anybody with anybody you know let me just back up what Ole is saying a little bit because it it feels contrary to our it's contrary to our politics and it's not for us right so there was the pre-convention strategy which was getting the Bas excited talking about price gouging talking about the expanded child tax credit and then the selection of Tim Walls who was the most Progressive pick that she could have made then at the convention she goes I'm AA I'm tough on the border I prosecute transnational criminal organizations dealing in guns drugs and human beings I can say it over and over in my he she repeats it so many times because it's exactly what o is saying she's a woman and so she's overcompensating by trying to be as tough as humanly possible now um there's an argument that I think you can be that can be made is like when it says that her polling liability is that she's too liberal that's what they the all the data people working on her campaign or telling her what does is that really connected to policy I'm not sure I think mostly it means people people say woman woman of color California and that's when they think too liberal right so how do you combat that perception I don't like the Embrace of Dick Cheney it makes me want to vomit but the Liz Cheney part is key because Independence like 63 68% depending on polling think that Biden won the 2020 election fair and square when you bring Liz Cheney out it's she's an avatar for these like moderate Republican voters who are again High propensity voters they're trying to grab for somebody who is representative of the election denialism on the right I don't know abortion is an incredibly Salient issue this election but January 6 may be end up being more important because it really is something that strikes at the heart of these Independents that they're trying to Target and so you know it it hurts because it's like I if this was a movement campaign Like Bernie Sanders of course this strategy would be horrible but she's just a standard Democrat who feels that she has a tiny fraction of time to uh character herself to a public that we underestimate how many people don't know anything about her so they're doing this speed running thing to alleviate people's concerns and I'm just not convinced that it's bad strategy even if I don't like it from a political perspective exactly I definitely know what you're saying and I think it's like the right strategy to reach across the aisle and even pandering to Republicans is something that we should all expect from any Democrat in an election season what I do think makes the Cheney aspect of this specifically repulsive and I think a little bit misguided is think about one of the reasons why Trump did so well in 2016 he was able to run against the bush era establishment of his own party he called out George Bush on the GOP debate stage you know he was able to make himself an antagonist of that sort of neocon agenda that the American people were sick of and I think they still are sick of that and I think that the Democrats in any way suggesting that oh now we're the neocon party now we're the George Bush and Dick Cheney party I mean it just it just gives Trump such a layup and lets him he can't the ball so it gives him they pass him the ball he's wide open and he's in the paint but he doesn't have the he doesn't have the dexterity he's he's do not the he's the guy going out there and saying that we got to start war with Iran he's lost his mind on this front that's why I think oh go ahead sorry no I'm just saying your Point's on your Point's exactly right but Trump can't finish so that's the that's the issue is like this would work if Trump was able to do the be the 2016 Trump but he's not that anymore do you know what keeps sticking out in my brain and maybe this is a little off based cuz it's kind of a wonky analogy but I really think that kind of like how the Democrats learned the wrong lesson even though they got in the white house and got re-election it was kind of devastating for you know the country for the time in the 1992 presidential election right Bill Clinton ran a really horrible strategy he basically ran the kind of strategy that KLA Harris is running where he became a republican right he was a new democrat right it's the economy should open all that kind of [ __ ] and he would have lost he would have gotten beat badly to George Herbert Walker Bush who had pissed off the Republican base massively by finally raising taxes because the country was going broke after basically 12 years of reaganism at that point right and so Ross perau who was a billionaire with a stick up his ass decided he was going to spend a small fortune to get 18% of the popular vote in 1992 and what did the Democrats learn from that when Bill Clinton was sworn in in that January that they could completely run to the right that they could become the NAFTA left they could pass all the legislation that you know George Herbert Walker Bush and Ronald Reagan had only dreamed of right and it devastated the economy even though they were winning and I think to Lance's Point Emma what a lot of people are really worried about is of course this is sound strategy but if you lie down with dogs you get fleas right and the Democratic party is going to be cratering their support right now when they would have had just as much of an opportunity going after first second generation Latino voters right here effec straty for Hillary like I think Hillary was doing a very similar thing when she was trying to reach out to say Romney and saying that we need to be able to have like a strong party you need a strong Republican party in order to have a strong Democratic party that strategy I I just don't see it playing out in the sense that like Emma I I would love if that's true if if centrists and moderates suddenly they're convinced by having someone who seems incredibly you know aggressive on geopolitics very very um you know these the strong implications that this person is not going to let the country fall towards weakness and stuff like that that appeals to moderate voters January 6 appeals to moderate voters um I am more worried though just if that strategy backfires in the same way like I think Hillary is more unlikable I I think she is isable har I was about to say like I don't think Hillary and kamla's um campaigns were at all similar I like I like in my personal experience and I guess like being here um I think on on on a few different levels one I think Hillary didn't campaign in the swings dates and I think KLA is is is all through the swing States that's one I think funny enough Hillary was criticized a lot for like when I think of like how deplorables went down and how the the response to that which would be the kind of thing that we leftist would we would beg for in a present day like oh say that coma is not doing anything like that she is not alienating th that those people in that way and I also think something that she she has done that I think has played well to people who not to people who are who are going to be against her regardless but to other people who want to see a certain level of sweat I think there have been numerous different times throughout her campaigns she has shown that she's willing to like listen to feedback or critique whether it be genuine or not right like we don't need it to be genuine in her hard like if she is she's listening to to the left or who are her voter base I think she's shown that a few times and I think that works to her her credit I also think what I also think it's like not negligible the previous existing hate for Hillary Clinton that existed you know I mean Hillary Clinton brings out a certain level she's like the beacon of like like PE people feel a deep way about Hillary and I think like you know KLA has to like combat like I am a black woman and but I still think Hillary the previous hate for Hillary outweighs that and I also um think that Hillary Hillary leaned a lot on being the first woman president like in a way that they could get her like I don't think it's funny as much people say it is exactly as much as people like to talk about identity politics but KLA Harris has not been playing into identity politics at all that has not been coming out of her mouth like she's a black woman people are saying I'm actually hearing that a lot more like I'm hearing the green party like we got a Muslim and a and and a and a Jew on the ticket and blah blah blah I'm hearing identity politics a lot more from everybody else but KLA Harris she isn't doing it you don't hear her talking about being the first black woman president not being the woman none of that and I think that also plays her Advantage so I think her and Hillary's campaigns to me are very different do you think there's not like a a danger in saying consistently that like project 2025 is a blueprint for fascism it's very bad I agree with that and also saying earlier that like Trump is trying to move into quoting Hitler fascistic territory talking so strongly about how the Republican party is an inherent danger to democracy to America and also we want to work with him I want a republican on my cabinet also like we have to reach across the aisle we need a big tent that kind of strategy I I just feel that specifically can be really alienating to people who might otherwise be not just you know undecided voters the the biggest perverse sios in in the electorate but like people who are actually on board perhaps and now we're kind of alienated by that feels like a miser politics though that I feel like we can't like you can't be like sure that might happen but I think that is like there's only so much you can do you can't like avoid everything someone is going to be upset and like by the nature of politicking and like the amount of people like how many people are in America how many millions and millions and millions of people right like I think there's an understanding a lot of people even though we don't like it I don't think it makes sense I don't think it makes sense for us to like expect to truly get the like outright denunciation of like I'm not working with Republicans Republicans or all this and you and even within like communities of people of color right like when I think of older black people who vote more than younger black people right they don't want to hear that you don't want to work with just you're somebody who can't work with others they do not want to hear that like that is not that that is an unelectable position so I think there is some level of the average American wanting to believe that you believe that there's still something valid or decent about every different kind of you know what I mean they want the idea of like we can go back to where this was more reasonable we're working together I think there's like a net they they they're okay with a certain level of condemning the craziest Republican because a lot of Republicans even people on the right agree with that too they don't like like these like more Fringe rights so they can like do that but they still want her to be like not against me though you know what I mean like not you know I'm reasonable I think you're right Olay and and you know Lance this is I your analysis is something that I've I've made that case like in other elections right I just think that this is a very specific circumstance given the speedrun campaign that she's engaged in she had like wasn't the nominee until this few months ago and so it's like this I'm not trying to be an apologist for the strategy but I think we underestimate how difficult it is to after you know most times you have two years to get the public comfortable with who you are and then there's all these added difficulties of her being a black woman and the fact that basically she's taken over the entire campaign infrastructure from and wasn't able to start from scratch with I don't know some of her own operations so they do all this very targeted voter data stuff and they already had that pre-existing data mine of who they were going to Target with Biden which are exactly who she's targeting these moderate Republicans who like patriotism who believe that when they say Liz Cheney you know again I hate it but what does when when an average person who just pays attention to politics think of Liz Cheney they don't think of the fact that she said one time uh a bunch of times Democrats report post birth abortion she said that like four [ __ ] years ago it's ridiculous but she does she's a standin she's like a mascot for the extremism of the Republicans that's the what she serves so it's a Shand for January 6 and you know I talked to Dave wiel who was on the ground in Arizona and the campaign was touting oh John McCain would have supported me and we hear that kind of crap we're like oh God but that made the news in local Arizona and there's all these retirees who love John McCain oh he's a Maverick he works acoss because John McCain was beloved in Arizona Liz Cheney just lost in Wyoming she doesn't really have any base of support I I I think that's a really fair point I just think that it's about that the January 6 case in particular and she'll probably be like yeah I I just feel like to properly Pander to the right wing you need to find someone who right- Wingers actually like like I totally it's not the right wing though I would it's not the right wing it's these disaffected Nikki Haley voters who they're targeting and and there's and there is evidence that that that they are you think anti-trump Republicans aren't going to vote for Trump by their very nature I I I think that there's a chance and they're they're looking for these high propensity suburbanite white people in the states that they need to win in Pennsylvania in Michigan and Wisconsin and that's where they think Liz Cheney has value and again this is contrary to all of my politics but I think that the strategy has that is what makes sense about it uh I feel like And all I'll say is just to wrap up this part is just that Tim Walls it wasn't that long ago when she selected him like we should put this into the context of like she still understands that the left is a real constituency and you know I don't think it's natural for her to go out there and be like yeah like like I love Republicans I mean she's the part of why she's struggled is because she's not selling it well she's better in adversarial context and like the debate and and and you know even in that interview with Fox News with Brett Bear so all I'm saying is is that like there there were positive signs when she was trying to appeal to the Bas this is a very mercenary cynical strategy that I don't want people to just like you know take as the entirety of what the campaign will have to offer I think that it we're going to basically just have to wait and see uh when the results come out because I think that there if if there is something to this undercounted comma vote and new registrations are going to bump up her numbers or abortion brings out more women I think that there is something to that but I do feel like the strategy has been a demonstrable failure uh and I and I say that because I looked at swing State polling comparing Biden and Clinton at the same point and the Clinton 2016 poll numbers were off but for the most part kamla is doing worse than both Biden and Clinton at the same point in the race in every single swing state and I feel like that is evidence that you you can't keep tacking to the right because it's failing and I think that I thinking I was she is winning over some of those moderate voters but I think it's a balancing act you have to walk that fine line and I don't think that she's doing it well can I just say something about the polling methodology in 2016 they were they failed that's objectively true and then they corrected in 2018 they were kind of on point 2020 Biden did like it did it overestimated Biden by a few points but they basically indicated that this was because it was in the pandemic and when they were doing polling the voters that were more likely the respond to pollsters were Democrats who were Sheltering in place or not that's not the right phrase but who were staying home and isolating and that's why it was overcorrected a little bit there and there were more the the Biden won by less than the polling said that initially he would in the aggregate the the a lot of the advanced polling metrics have shown that this is much more like 2022 in the way that the polling has been fairly consistent uh and there hasn't been much derivation in that regard so all I'm saying is is just like I I think it's more of a she's running an incumbency campaign as a new Figure Head Right This is a Biden term run but with her at the head of it in terms of the campaign infrastructure in terms of a lot of what they're advocating um and so that's the why the strategy feels more conservative and then in terms of the big mistake though to run like it's a second Biden term instead of saying we're actually going to move run she keep saying we're going forward not backward but I think you're totally right Emma that she is running as a continuation of we're not all she would Brak up as something that she would do differently than Joe Biden is oh I guess I would hire a republican to work for me it's like what the [ __ ] like I get the strategy but that's all you can come up with that's the only thing you can say is better than you than Joe Biden is that you're more of a republican than him like come on I think she's released like literally several agenda plans and she's talked about like multiple things that I like that are different Optics I I don't like how it comes off if you watch that interview on The View I agree her I agree with what you're saying I genuinely don't think it seems to come off this way to anybody other than a certain populace of the of the left who who it feels that way for me like what I'm and I get it and I understand but I don't and I don't and by the left I don't mean like all the Liberals and da d d that are technically on this side of whatever but I'm like the only people that I I truly see like feeling like she's running a terrible campaign are like leftists who were going to be against this like they perceive us being a part of this Administration or are anti-democrat anti- whatever or whatever again I don't see that coming from other people um I think she has a I said this from the beginning KLA Harris has an incredibly uphill battle like she has an uphill battle and I don't think it's reasonable considering all the different factors to like immediately think she's running a bad campaign because of the ways in which she has that uphill battle I don't think she's running a bad campaign I actually think kamla Harris is running a way better better campaign that I thought she was cap capable of running like Lance and Mike could tell you the last thing I was like no [ __ ] way there's no world in which it was com I was talking big [ __ ] I was talking big [ __ ] so I just I'd be lying if I didn't say she the [ __ ] out of me also I wanted to show you a thing I bought the other day I was I think it was in North Carolina and and and then in Pennsylvania and then I saw these things like around by like Anonymous publisher and they're just like like in the stores like you know little manifestos on why you should vote for Trump you know what I mean and like look at it the American comeback story like all around like find this on like I've never seen this in New York like I had to buy it because it was Pennsylvania and then I found some like and I went and looked into it like Anonymous of like fora too but like the majority of them like Trump and all littered throughout me going to like North Carolina through Pennsylvania and like uh I don't remember what other place Illinois you know and I'm like y'all see what's happening like I I also I I do think there's a lot of like I think there's a lot of like media I think a lot of the media I don't and I don't I don't know how we study a child with their level of like Bots and also just like right-wing media influence and yada yada y I feel like we are intentionally seeing a lot to make people deflated because I don't think to make people feel like she's going to lose or Trump certain and all this again because I think we underestimate like the value of making people feel like is something is a loss so that less people come out you know what I mean I think that's what it always is wants a close race for their own purpose I mean and yes by the metrics it is close but you know again I'm a I'm a religious reader of my guy Josh Joshua Cohen at mum and people should subscribe to his suback where he's been on point this whole election cycle in analys in analyzing the polling data really here and um since 2020 there have been an influx of junk Republican pollsters some of them literally run by guys out of a high school uh where they started to uh so Trump gets to post a graphic on TR social like I'm up seven in North Carolina and the methodology is total crap and I um you know a lot of the aggregators do sometimes wait those based on partisanship but some of them don't and those are the ones that tend to show a more favorable environment for Trump so you know I hear what you guys are saying I think a lot of stuff I some things could have been done differently and the fact that they basically abandoned the housing policy after the convention talking about that they really didn't say much anymore oh yeah the $225,000 or whatever $50,000 what was it going to be yeah like the home buyer stuff is like I don't love that but I do like the idea of then also building 3 million homes and uh the the price gouging with those U major algorithmic landlords that she said she was gonna tackle like what we should beemp littleit to the Home Ownership thing I mean obviously Gavin and I aren't on the coast right we're flyover kids we're in Kansas City so you can still buy a home for a reasonable price here like if you gave somebody like a $225,000 tax rebate on you know the first year their home buyer uh buying process right you combine that with like an FHA you know what I mean where you're putting down a smaller percentage of the payment you could see seriously get a a new single family home in a way that obviously that would sound like an impossibility if you're in New York or LA or you know Seattle or whatever so I I wish that there was more of a re like a re-emphasis on that when it or it wasn't just but but again like I think what Olay is talking about here is just the reality of H having doing a a a f Monon long campaign where a lot of when she entered the race 22% of the American public said they had no opinion of her and to get from that point to the point where she wins an election in November is very it's a it's a tall order um and so I guess I have a level of Sympathy for the the the like I'm such a conservative I have a Glock strategy oh no and this is the other point I want to make I know I've been talking a lot I apologize but um this is also a strategy for Texas when she says I I have a Glock she wants Callin all Red's numbers to go up a point when she uh talks about the Border in that way this is about GGO as well although he doesn't really need her help running against Carri Lake they're worried about the Senate and so I I and also you know Florida when she said she supports uh marijuana legalization you know what's on the ballot in Florida as well it's a ballot measure so I'm just that's that's my read on the strategy strategy is a lot more defensible actually like not from a moral perspective necessarily but I understand why she's run to the right on immigration because it's actually popular to be tough on that issue it's popular to sound like a right winger on that issue the only issue have with the Liz Cheney thing is again it's like if you're going to Pander to right Wingers find a popular right- Winger to Pander with the least popular one that just lost their election there's movies with Christian Bale I get finding some even like like if some you know governor who was a republican endorsed K Harris like Brian kimp I would totally understand her touting that endorsement I just think that is uniquely un I do want to say one one quick little thing about all this this is the reason why I love debating friends and lefties on these issues because like no one here is looking to destroy each other and I'm learning a lot of things though I feel like this is exactly the kind of I know but I felt like I've been hogging the mic so you guys very happy all this knowledge I'm instinctively in Doomer mode all the time and I'm trying to put aside my own biases because when I see KLA Harris talk about the most lethal fighting force in the world I I'm try to and reass because the has been right we lost so many times in the past years so if it works it works I'm for the winning strategy so if it turns out that this is the correct strategy I'm all for it uh so I'm trying to put that aside but I'm still skeptical because you know and it's hard to read anything from the numbers because there's a plethora of factors that go into why she's winning or losing so it's hard her net favorables have been going up to Point uh about her running a good race so it's tough but I'm I'm trying to put aside my own biases and try to try to just gauge this from the Normie Democrat or the Normie American position uh and it's really hard it's you have to untrain yourself but at the same time after the selection I feel like we all should go look at the numbers and then make an assessment based on that cuz it's so hard to tell I see Arguments for both sides but you all have Emma and oay made me feel a little bit better because after doing the poll video and spending all all day looking at the numbers I'm like oh she's going to lose uh it's over uh no she's going to win don't worry I'm not even kidding I honestly look and and you're making me knock on wood over here I mean dude listen guys look the left has a serious problem I I I think it was Olay or somebody touched on that right we have to we need to start projecting confidence guys we need to start being the winners we need to start letting everybody know this is a team to ride with [ __ ] Donald Trump this guy is's a loser he is a loser right Gavin and I were the most cical people on the aot most disaffected we were the two most disaffected voices of the Gen Z left and we were we had you either decide look dude we're in this for the Long Haul we're going to do this for our whole [ __ ] lives and we're going to fight for what's better or we're going to give up after four months like everybody El and what you have to do is you have to keep reminding yourself right that hey this let's let's do a reality check for a second you know let's have the Baseline confidence that we are putting out a better message than this geriatric cheeseball you know what I mean this guy who's completely out touch they can't even form words like we have come so far by replacing Joe Biden with KLA Harris somebody who is capable and regardless of what we did do exactly so and she got Tim Waltz and I believe that she would be doing even better right now if she would have you know really married herself to a couple of key policies that Tim Waltz would have anchored such as like free breakfast for everybody like run against free breakfast for everybody you'll look like an even more of an evil bastard than you already I want you to know how mean spirited like the I I I I'm like y'all need a good like moderate prosecutor friend or something to talk to so you you be shocked the kind of [ __ ] people say in private like people might not go say on our media stuff that they have a problem with that but I know a [ __ ] ton of friends even like progressives who will argue against like uh student loan forgiveness for everybody they'd be like no it shouldn't even for themselves like I'd be like no I should still have the pay I know many like free breakfast like free breakfast was a black panther initiative that got them put on your terrorist group like think you think everybody likes that [ __ ] but I could just hear them talking about look at this woke black woman trying to turn this into a a welfare state oh she's trying to I'm telling you I really like I want you to put like y'all never have to exist as a public figure as a black woman but I'm but I do and let me tell you something people do not listen to what the [ __ ] you say like you have no idea how much of view they look at and they come to conclusions and they upset and whatever about you there are people who going to turn this on why people see my nails and immediately enemy of the people you know what I mean they they didn't hear what you said I could have been here defending KLA me and EM could be and the comment you see this [ __ ] immigrant tether [ __ ] here trying to ruin our elections I'm telling you you really are not taking for granted like what she's up against like they're not just listening to her a white man yeah a white man politician can come and be like this is what I want specifically this is what I every English he doesn't speak English and he's still the president it makes no sense every day I'm like how did this happen again it's amazing but that's that's what o is saying is is like every time she's like I love Republicans so much that is a harm mitigation uh strategy and and all the polling indicates generic Democrat who isn't Joe Biden that's what I was I've been screaming about to get him to drop out after that debate beats Trump no matter what so they're going don't make a headline don't do [ __ ] don't do anything to make them you're a communist you're a liberal you're all that kind of stuff socialist a movement candidate we have 20 days or less than that at this point just don't make a [ __ ] headline she hears that every morning she hears that every morning right I'm sure and so that's what they're trying to do and I don't think it's I I I I have yet to see in my view EV compelling evidence that it's not effective or the most effective route she could have gone given the set of circumstances that she's that she's uh in and again yeah it would be one thing if it was a movement campaign right but this is it's it's it's what it is it's a generic Democratic campaign and every gen generic Democratic campaign of my lifetime has had this pivot to the center it's just that we were so excited about Tim Walls and like in many ways the party is in a better position right the part's in a better position in my view to take on and be more and deliver more things for the American people like Biden let's go back to 2020 and think about how he ran an an immigration activist uh went and and confronted him at his event and he was like don't vote for me then go vote for Trump like we were so outraged by how rightwing Biden was and he was the most right-wing Democrat in that primary to come out and he ended up beating Trump yes and what did we get honestly it's a it's a function of frankly Elizabeth Warren's really strong inside game because she pedal a lot of influence to get Lena Khan to be the FTC chair and the Bernie movement which created a labor a resurgent Labor uh environment that he worked with behind the SC cuz they're actually friends from their time in the Senate together Bernie and Biden worked together to make a more friendly nlrb and to promote unions throughout the country with the most conservative Democrat who ran in that primary race so Kamala was more Progressive than Biden in that race and for me it just shows like the party is in a better healthier position and we can do good things if we get her elected let's not get distracted by this very cynical mercenary strategy with 19 I don't know how that's a really important Point Emma is that Kalo won before and try and did the I'm going to be a progressive black candidate strategy and not only did every like not only did white people and everybody hate it but black people did not support her immediately and it rung Hollow it rung disingenuous you know what I mean like it only like allowed like the bolster of all of these different things so I I think like if you saw how quickly like when commo ran the first time I was like I told my best friend like Mark this is going to go down in sales immediately black people are not going to support it and immediately that was the case she was the first person to drop out she was not supported and so I I recognize she knows why she's doing an entirely different thing she's tried it out before she's done what we're telling her to do it brought her no support and it didn't even make her likable like you said she started off despite the fact that K has held all these uh um positions of power she's literally the vice president what first black woman vice president what most people started out this uh her campaign saying they have no opinion of her so it didn't she got doing the progressive thing and trying to speak to those things and trying to be a part of like what we wanted her to say didn't help her and it didn't even gain her any like likeability staying power popularity or anything so I recognize why what's happening is happening and I think it's a mistake sometimes for us to like I noticed a lot of us be watching this election as so like we want to like Kamala like you're we like you're trying to connect with her or something and I'm like why are we doing that like we're normies like I don't understand that like like we know what like we all felt really good getting all lived up in July and now it's I'm so bured now I'm in any of that my position has been the same all the time like I'm never going to be like a comma fan girl I have issues with noty you're picking your enemy you're selecting you're selecting your enemy from a character select screen if you're an American and you're voting in this who who is going to be easier to push up against cuz neither actually a representing your interest yes and one has sh me repeatedly she here to push up a gangs comma switches her tune on on things fairly quickly when she gets a a [ __ ] done she be okay oh [ __ ] K you know what I mean so right you know still conscious right we haven't had a conscious president since Barack Obama left the White House guys let's think about that for a second Barack Obama left the White House in 2017 in a cold day in January we have had a brainless you know unfunctional presidency that is [ __ ] years nobody ever bothered to push these people to the right because it with one ear out the other Donald Trump was eating cheeseburgers drinking diet coke and watching Fox and Friends and you know Joe Biden may have tried his damn disc but he had half a [ __ ] Campbell Soup can for brains uh and and and that was the way the cookie crumbled right now we'll have somebody like KLA Harris who does look at the polling who does have people talking to her right even if we have like a proxy you know prosecutor Jeb Bartlett kind of a standin right where she's really serious about getting the Jeb or the job done right like at least we'll have somebody who can be you know mobilized right if a fuckload of people show up outside the White House and say no dude we are bringing housing prices down by hook her by crook it's going to [ __ ] happen that's a bipartisan movement she would respond to that it would be impossible for her not to and she's not in uh a Zionist who's been baked in Washington for 50 [ __ ] years I just want to remind people of who Joe Biden is on this on this particular regard like Harris is I'm not saying she's like a free Palestine liberal far from it she's a standard Democrat but Biden is not a standard Democrat in this regard um there was reporting from Peter binard that uh at one point Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Obama wanted to get a little tougher on Netanyahu because he was uh basically sticking in the middle finger and Biden went around them and was like BB don't worry I've got your back um he has a long history monster of racism um both in like in this uh it was part of why Obama selected him uh eulogizing STM Thurman at one point floated a constitutional amendment to ban integration by busing earlier in his career and so since that period frankly he's been baked in Zionist anti-palestinian propaganda and took pride in during his time on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in leadership throughout his career being the most one of the most pro-israel Democrats throughout uh Congress and so Harris yeah she's a senator from California she goes to APAC fundraisers I mean that's to be expected if you're not a really a true Progressive just a standard Democrat but she's not at least in my view a reflexive anti-arab and anti-palestinian racist it just is about pressure a pressure campaign that it's going to take it's not going to be fixed overnight and should you eyes support Israel all that kind of stuff but in terms of somebody who's more who's less ideological about Israel that's also what gives me hope because Biden in his bones feels like Israel is reparations for the Holocaust and his mind is putting so he can't necessarily he he can't change his racism at this point in his 80s it's just not happening yeah right yeah I think like what's important like about KLA and I want to be clear you always have to say it and preface it a million times KLA is not somebody who is representative of my viewpoints I am not anybody's Comm Fang girl or anything like that but if you just look at her record factually objectively throughout her career from what prosecutor to now like all throughout like being AG being a senator all of this kamla has gotten prog like far more Progressive she has changed with the times change with critique and she like she just has and for our stand like our standing what we need is we know the Democrats are not what we want we know that we know that all of these politicians and who we have in office are not what we want we're trying to persuade them to do some of what we want to help us accomplish some of what we want like we're passing the Baton right we do all the ground like the work on the ground and I just think it's objectively true that commis record demonstrates that we are far more likely to get her to to switch up on different positions right like it just is so I think like it's a no-brainer like it just it just is well give it the alternative yeah I agree with that yeah 100% yeah and I just know it a it's not in her best interest to like be perceived as as as listen as somebody who like the New York Post only what they need to say about me is my slander is the article is woke lawyer I'm TI here to tell you as a black woman that's enough like that's enough like they they they that that is something they deeply want you to try to be away from you know what I mean like there's a there's a lot of a lot of slander on that front so I don't ever look I never want a politician that I want want to win I never want them to say the thing that a li me goes wo if I go wo they're not getting elected I feel like that lost you're down bad whenever politicians who I really like call me and they're like uh and and and we have a meeting what I tell them is I'm not going to publicly say I love you or something or that you align with My Views that won't help you what I'll do is [ __ ] on your opposition I'll make them aware of who's running but I will not come out and like say I love you because it will hurt you it will hurt you to be branded as like oh the radical black left and whatever like all the people call they can call us liberal as much as they want online out there in America they are calling me the radical black la like so I I know this to say like it doesn't help them to like be saying all the things we want if KLA got up there and gave a speech at that convention that all of us were like they would have they have ran her out that [ __ ] with pitchforks like are you crazy what about like I agree that KLA doesn't need to sound more agressive in the way that we are progressive but I do think there's been missed opportunities for her to sound more populist that have uh like been proven strategies for example Tim Walls basically got the job going on MSNBC and CNN and pioneered the whole their weird line against I that it for me against J Vance but then they abandoned the strategy they're basically not letting him go with that anymore because they think it's too divisive and I'm like I I agree about what you're seeing with kamla Harris herself she needs to make sure that she's not branded as woke or Progressive or radical or whatever but when it comes to the campaign as a whole I do think they're missing opportunities specifically with Tim Walls to be more aggressive in general I heard their opponents I heard yall say that last night in the career like I said I watch y ho video um like that y'all feel like they should be using Tim Walls more I think Tim Walls okay let me give you like walking through my thought process on this because a little bit of examples and Stor my best friend Mark call me white guy standard liberal um and Mark is like like super worried that about the debate with kamla and and and Trump and I was like it is so offensive that you think this black woman litigator prosecutor who like does this like you it's a [ __ ] offensive that you're worried and I would and and and sure enough Kam approved to me was obvious you know what I mean it was like there was no reason to feel this worry and yet I didn't no one felt that worry before I didn't get that same thing expressed to me from any of my w froms any of my progressives when wals was going into debate to the debate and I thought that was interesting and funny like you're not worried about this white man who goes up there and he stumbles he stumbles you know what I mean he was [ __ ] stumbling he was St stumbling had a black woman do not that way whatever so I said is to say Tim Walls is somebody Tim Walls I see is a symbolic for us to feel good about him he's for me to feel good and for us to know he's good and he's like my Care Bear in the back but you might not want him W to talk that much you know what I mean like he clearly is not she's she thrives in attack mode and he thrives in selling policy to I think the the point that you guys are making he's not being deployed right now to sell policy why cuz all they want to do is say I've got a glock I'm tough on the border I'm tough on criminals and so I think that they could be doing both and they could be deploying him more smartly like the Border thing backfires Z or Gavin said it no these people hate immigrants as an immigrant as an immigrant they hate immigrants everybody not just white people black people everybody the Democrats have unfor and I I I I put this at the feet of Joe Biden as the leader of the party and the president have seed the entire territory of immigration to the Republicans and it's reflected in the polling they haven't provided an alternate more Humane Vision since Obama was talking about dreamers in 2012 because everybody hates IM because they hate immigrants too everybody hates immigrants it's so sad but it's true imigrants in the UK too like in Europe This is not just a domestic issue oh I can I can speak for Canada anti-immigrant sentiment espe politics a thing it's it's at an alltime high like I'm telling you in the last like several years even amongst like I'm tell I I've never experienced hate and constant like if you even look even with a lot of like the black people I get to like oh they don't like Eric Adams it if you look at why what they're saying in the comments it's cuz he with the immigrants he helped the immigrants they blah blah blah like people hate they have been very successful because no one has checked it because like I said it's always been Democrats don't like immigrants either nobody in America likes immigrants nobody understands immigrate is insane because we're a nation of immigrants everybody here people Everyone of me was an immigrant an immigrant and yet they switch up how they feel about a [ __ ] with immigration with immigrant status is very different like it's very different I could read you comments I got like just this morning like just this morning about like I wake up to a hundred of those like literally the hatred is real so like I get it because I even as a black immigrant who even like a lot of black people like hate my stinking guts for that reason and will not just me saying immigrant just me saying that I'm an immigrant they hear my accent and they act like is a it is a nasty secret they discovered like I'm telling you I I understand like it's [ __ ] up I hate it with all my [ __ ] heart I really get it but I think they they they've allowed all this xenophobia and anti-immigrant hate to reach a maximum this entire last like the whole time even' been a term so they can't pick now to try and say the Dem left to vacuum to your point it's a failure it's a failure of long-term strategy by the Democrats don't think that KLA can correct it in one election cycle but yeah I mean but and and I again this is a global right is like the global left and like again Liberals are not the left but the global right is very well organized and they've been trying to incorporate these Victor Orban style protectionist politics uh across right-wing campaigns in the west and they've had great success in that regard I think J South Central America too Turning Point USA was doing things in Brazil they're doing things in Turkey like they're cross collaborating with rightwing movements globally like Georgia Malone's uh you know a success story for that insane politics in Italy but I will say this is what we're seeing I think hopefully we're doing what happened in France and even to a lesser extent in the UK elections it's a Centrist and liberal alliance with the left to beat Fascism and um I do feel that people fundamentally understand that but the French example means liberals will deny you well I mean in the end there will be hurdles but but from a pure just like uh we don't have a parliamentary system so we can't call elections just like it's staing off fascism in terms of the executive branch for the next four years but I understand that all all I can really say though is cu everyone didn't agree with my takes on this uh I'm leaving the left we're going to make a lot of videos about yeah you're a small YouTube channel that's going to make a lot of videos on Emma's like look I like successfully veed us totally away from this topic look what you're doing know that's true the whole hour you're not on aligned you're a person who on align that's true that's true that's true I am a person this whole thing has been really um it's been eye opening if I did the Dave Ruben pivot Russia could have been paying me so much money to be like actually it's the it's the democr rats who are the least tolerant of homosexuals I know as a homosexual that's true you would have been a great token Mike right on Fox News talk about how actually that policy is not homophobic and no I don't think that it's homophobic to call me the F continue like hey there's a pretty wide Lane for white guy too Mark I'll just start mik I'll just start doing TR T and you know drinking a lot on the job smoking cigars you know doing the fake Russian accent in America everybody hates America we love Russia I do try I swear I swear I do be trying to I do I do try to be empathetic to like look at and like this like what Anna's doing and all that different stuff and the light most favorable to her right like like okay like I don't like I'm indifferent to you like you pissed me like that was crazy but I knew what she was doing like I said it from then like I never thought it was personal I always thought it was a part of this obvious long-term strategy right and I understand I get like she's a person right like everybody else and I so I understand like being frustrated like being personally offended by being like jumped on or feeling like everybody's against you or feeling like people are dismissing your entire record cuz of now like I get feeling frustrated I get being like mad when you when I'm feeling irrational like when I'm real upset in my apartment and stuff like before I like smoke and chill out and take my meds and talk to my like loved ones and like vented out you know what I mean like I get feeling like [ __ ] D the internet left is making me so mad like I it's not that I don't understand or I've never experienced like how she's feeling with her frustration we all hate the left sometimes I you know who hates the left the left that's what I'm saying hat left sometimes I do just arguing on Twitter with the [ __ ] leftist I fully get like hating people who've made videos talking about you like I even I'm not even somebody who's critical of Anna not like wanting to engage people who talk [ __ ] about her I fully get that [ __ ] you I'm not pling you been you on my show I like understand all of that I just think you I think it's incumbent on you to like try like and I work on this like to try to have the responsibility to go let me chill out now hold on let me take a step back you know what I mean like I'm whing and like lucky for me if I'm whing and a r my boyfriend will kind of look at me with the that's not so Progressive you know what I mean look like you know I mean and I know okay okay let me let me chill out um I think I think what it is too I also like she might not be like she might not be going out in the world and like able to like appreciate like who likes her and me I I say this as somebody who doesn't go out but when it does happen like last night like yesterday on the subway one of like someone came up to me and they were like are you Lam me Lauren the movement lawyer I was like yes and and they were like I really really love you BL and then they and then they whispered to me they were like I'm trans but I'm not out so I really appreciate you and I was like oh my heart I was like if I had thought about becoming an anti-trans rightwing grifter you saved me I I was saying like you sometimes like need those moments of like you know cuz I think I think you could be getting like it's easy to like it's easy to feel like you have millions there are millions of subscribers or whatever have you and like you're focusing on the negativity in these little but I get it as a person whose brain focuses on the negativity you know what I mean like I can see how like on the internet the love doesn't feel real but the hate feels real and you're not going out into the world I get that now that being said an has obviously fallen off a cliff like you know what I mean but like I'm like all right like and it's the other things it's like when she goes in these other interviews and she's like I don't want to talk to black people and blah blah blah all these different things is like what you know what I mean and I yeah I'm a go well no I'll just say like so all this makes me it makes me so squeamish cuz like I I I think I've purposefully avoided like a lot of it uh just because it it makes me bummed out to be honest um so I just I I saw the headline um for the substack and then I didn't really read anything else about it um but yeah no it's it's a bummer because obviously we had a personal relationship super supportive of my career I'll always be grateful for that but like it it became quite clear that she's going in a different direction politically and what's a just frustrating and sad about it is like you know she knows better and because the Dave Rubin track is we mocked it all the time uh both publicly and you know like it and I think that she's she's smart and so she knows that that uh that that she had been very critical of Ruben's why I left the left track before so she's trying to come at it from a different angle but the reality is is that you can't really come at this with a different angle the point is just that it's about a personal grievance it's about something where you feel like the left didn't treat you right or you got criticism on the Internet or they weren't sensitive enough to you and in my view it's just like a fundamental misunderstanding of what your role is a commentator and a convenient one because there's more money on the right and um you know uh I'm I I I if I were in this for money you know I I I don't think I would be even in this I was supposed to go to law school and I thought about that I was like I could make a lot more money doing that and I ended up uh getting that internship at tyt and I never looked back and I was lucky to get hired by Sam who has a very similar mindset as as I do about this kind of stuff where it's just more like it's not about um it's really not about you it's not about how the left treated you it's not about if you were yelled at online it's not about even your personal experiences because you have to have a fundamental understanding that those are anecdotal it's about broad social movements and creating change and doing the hard work of standing your ground even in like as you we were talking about immigration before um the fact that we're in a very anti-immigration public atmosphere right now doesn't mean that I tailor my message to that I say hey the Democrats have dropped the ball in this regard but we stand firm in our belief that yes our immigration system needs to be reformed so we can process people more adequately so we can have a system where there aren't millions of undocumented workers who are under the boot of our government and are used basically for their labor with the threat of deportation if they dare to ask for for wage increases and that kind of thing I mean that is a real leftist perspective on that and that's independent of where the Dem so I feel that's unaligned from the Democratic party right it's just a leftist perspective and so when you have that Ballance and again like I grew up um with both parents that are very uh politically conscious and uh I don't think I've ever actually ever said this on air before but my grandfather was on my mom's side he was a socialist my uh my mom grew up uh pretty poor and um he he had that IDE ology even though you know he struggled to maintain a job and that kind of thing um and it was it's an interesting uh whatever it's it's it's very deep it Le ingrained in me I think about him all the time and um that's I some some people just don't have leftist roots and it's more easily changed when you feel sensitive or you feel criticized or you feel like hey I'm not making enough money in the way that I should and I you know I also think it's a little bit of an LA thing like here New York there's just a lot of you know uh left there's a lot more of a leftist I feel like Community uh by my stand on my stance on Anna is like I'm not so concerned by her changing her opinion obviously everyone's like you know they have the right to evolve on things or you know go a different direction what I think is so weird is how she's postured herself towards and against the left in the context of that ideological Evolution she's experienced it's like she can't just have her ideological Evolution she then has to take it out on all of her former leftwing colleagues and friends for pointing it out and for pushing back I mean Lance you literally contributed to The Young Turks and and that all ended because of the fact that you decided to speak out and yeah but I I did it in the most respectful fashion like I was accused of calling them a Nazi they were like oh they're just going right to calling us Nazis I was like I never once called you Nazi I very respectively pointed out that these are rightwing culture War talking points having on Binny to discuss that and actually hash out uh what the difference of opinion was it's like she just wants to act as if everyone on the left is trying to cancel her and that's the imaginable the most that's the big danger of of of having people who say that they're allies towards like the lgbtqq plus community and then say like well we disagreed on 1% of things and you weren't willing to accept the other 99 that shouldn't be the reason why you're advocating for the civil rights of a group especially a group you're not a part of right like you should be doing that fundamentally because you want them to have equal rights not because some people online are mean to me or some people disagree with me or I'm not agreeing with 99% well then what then just cast them all astray like I've seen that happen so many times when people are like I was an ally to the community until they just got they were asking for too much and I was like but the you're regurgitating right-wing talking points these aren't things that they're asking for they're not trying to erase what a woman is and say no one can refer to women as women or things like that right just about being a fundamentally like decent person in a social setting like we played you know that that uh the daily wire was making fun of that documentary that will frell and his trans friend Harper steel are doing where they go around the country and uh there's a person at a bar in somewhere that seems like it's in the South who misgenders Harper and she corrects uh she corrects that person says oh actually it's she her and they go oh I'm sorry and then that interaction ends and the right-wing daily wire host was like look at this like they're lying about there being any transphobia I'm like okay the point is that no this is just how are in if you're called a birthing person or you're called some gender inclusive uh term just why why do you care like it for me it it it uh the idea that that would in any way bother me that and actually I if I were to see that on the medical form or someplace where I was a patron of I would go it makes me feel good that this place is inclusive towards other people and so I it's just it's no skin off people's back and it just fundamentally I think is a reactionary worldview that clearly you know she's been coming to for for some period of time and maybe I made some mistakes maybe I should have spoken you know to her privately about some of this stuff before you we had IM I tried criticizing and so I feel like all three of you guys tried and all three of you were her colleagues they she knew you she respected you she would have had you on to discuss this kind of stuff if she was actually interested in having a conversation if she was actually interested in defending her opinions or hashing out a disagreement with people that she respected guys didn't try to cancel her all you did is laugh when Olay said coddle the white woman or whatever and then now it's over I don't even remember it I just feel OD weren there for that maybe but still it was ridiculous I I we had a we had real friendship all that kind of stuff but yeah it's more just based on like there aren't a ton of women in the space and so you know very appreciative of her for all that kind of stuff but you know there's a lot of really ol you're a really strong woman in voice on this Franchesca fantini is somebody who also has like a leftist roots and just like a fundamental ideology who I feel like I can trust her inherently on this kind of she's awesome crystal crystal ball is a phenomenal Talent like I I I every time I see a video of her I'm like Crystal Nails it there's a lot of really really smart leftist women it's just that we're very few and far between um and it's unfortunate that just to to wrap up really my thoughts on this is just that I know Anna knows better she saw Dave ruin do it we made fun of it she's doing the kind of the same thing and hey I'm sure there's more money in it right I I've try I tell you I really really really really be trying like even like I tried to look at in Anna's favor I swear to you I'd be trying to come out on Anna side but like I can't ever really decide if I'm like like in my heart of hearts the only thing that makes sense is that it's a a like an obvious like grift right but at the same like as I try to give you know space to like all right I understand what it is like when Anna was when when the internet was mad at Anna everybody was [ __ ] on Anna like that is true she was getting like a lot of like everybody's tweeting about it everybody's this everybody's that and like when someone when something's not about you it's easy to dismiss like whatever you know way through find the good faith and I don't personally love how people do that like expect you like oh find the good faith criticism amongst the seup so I like try to give Grace a Grace to that and maybe like you know maybe she wasn't in the space to receive like even her friends reaching out cuz she's already like hot and like you know what I mean about whatever whatever but at the same time like and for me my issue with with Anna's comments was never that she like it's not even about the fact that she doesn't want to be called the birthing person like it's not about that it's about the fact that I felt like it's a fake controversy the right is pretending and and it's something that they we know that they are using to like blow up an attack against the community we didn't speak to it so it just felt like you were trying to give and it was the way she declared it the way she everything about how she gave it up was very that it was very much so the beginning to exactly the moment that we're in now and the only thing I could really think is to what Emma was saying saying like maybe when you're not really deeply rooted in these values because I think that's what it what what it is like as somebody like I get attacked every day from like like a specific like the the [ __ ] like FBA brand of black people black Americans that hate non-american black people like they attack me a lot and it is really really really upsetting and if I wasn't somebody who was deeply rooted in my values that this is xenophobia and this kind of this is also anti-blackness and white supremacy and blah blah blah if I didn't truly believe that and make myself step out of that I could easily see me feeling like well every day they tell me I'm not black I'm not one of them shut up they don't want me advocating for their causes then [ __ ] it I could get how you could get there if you don't believe in the thing so I that's that's the only way I could see it being is that on one on one level you must not have been that deeply rooted in the views like you you were a part of this community and you went with it you know what I mean and advocated for it firstly when it made sense but when you like when it start you started not liking how it was feeling you Dro that or don't you think that's kind of a cop out for Anna though right cuz you look at you guys like I'm trying to be nice cuz they always say I hate you guys right just to be straight for a second right between me and Gavin if anybody on this panel was mean to Anna [ __ ] for sure it was us right and we did it happily we were going to roast her you make a job sitting on your ass for a living I'm not going to feel obligated to kiss it for you right that's always been our approach to podcasting you know what I mean you should be so grateful that you have 6 million subscribers and you get to get your message out to everybody do you think I make a video about everybody who cries and pisses and moans about how I hurt their feelings of course not go on talk about me move on right that's kind of our philosophy right here but Gavin and I I mean my grandpa wasn't a socialist he was a Ronald Reagan Republican right he owned a pawn shop he was a nice guy but he was a racist right you know what I mean like like both of my parents are like you know um addicts and [ __ ] right but I feel like that's a pretty common you know cause Across America it doesn't make you like an oppressed class so we don't have any real you know commitment to this I mean Gavin's parents are college professors I know they raised you to be a Democrat you could probably talk about that but outside of that we're just regular [ __ ] it's like not that hard to walk out into the world and be like I have a conscience I read books I understand how the world is supposed to work I don't want people to be subjugated I don't want people to be oppressed oh hey bro you [ __ ] up and people don't want to be called that anymore you should call just playing defense at this is fully I swear to God it's like fully on to because I'm not on her like you know but for some reason I'm not like invested in the friender and I was about to be like but how much like active effort do you make to like keep up with your principles cuz like not for nothing like I make myself like let let me go read books let me go try to be like I'm going on Tuesdays to [ __ ] CI to Shadow like Alex Vitalis class I go to this end of policing seminar just so I could try to feel like I'm actively being a learned leftist to stay there and like do this work whatever like I'm sure like how much of that you're you doing versus how much is I end up doing of that that's my only my only that's a argument I have Gavin's point back about how you know she was railing against the left and that being part of her move to the right that's one thing that really was a sticking point for me because she made a tweet a couple of months ago about how you should really take people at face value and not assume the worst and I thought well that's a wonderful sentiment but we know you're talking about right wiers and not about your own leftist allies and it bus me because I did try to reach out to her I I commented in the original birthing person tweet and she came after me and I'm like okay maybe I shouldn't have done that so I I just I reached out to her and I said listen I have a non-binary cousin and they've never asked me to call them a birthing person and I get that which is super weird but it's just for forms like it's it's never going to be something that comes up we don't even talk about these kind of things when we're together we we talk about video games and [ __ ] and she was like oh okay I get it and I and I told her that we there was the video about her person with the capacity for pregnancy where she defended Professor Kiara Bridges when Josh Holly came after and I was trying to remind her like this is just a distraction this is the point that you made and she even referenced like us talking in in the show and then it just like all went in one ear and out the other and I just feel like okay why are you putting so much Credence into what the right says but not your own friends and allies on the left and I wasn't as close with Anna as Emma was but I mean we kind of trauma bonded over the Tulsi years uh when we were both kind of getting backlash I know I reached out to Emma during that point in time as well and I just felt like this is somebody who genuinely cares about trying to get it right and so the fact that you're you're so smart and you still aren't doing better it to me it took me a while but I've kind of come to the conclusion that I do feel like it's it's a little bit grifty it's like 50% gri 50% legitimate grievance because I just feel like you can't be that smart and have such a long career as a leftist and not know these things like you shouldn't have to be explained why outing a trans child in school is bad but in one of her videos she said that that was something that was legitimate for Republicans that you know teachers should tell students so I just feel like it's that's what frustrates me well if you don't have that that that background ideologically I think and again to to uh Zach and Gavin's Point like it doesn't have to be how you grew up but or it could be just how you came across these kinds of things and it's just something that you really believe in like um if you're in this space it's not this is one thing if you're having a conversation privately but I do feel very strongly that we have a responsibility editorially to to to cover stories that are relevant to uplifting people and groups that are marginalized to fighting iic inequality to standing up against the genocide in Palestinians go on and on but you I always come at it from that perspective and if you don't share that perspective you might say like oh I'm going to be on aligned and I'll take this crime statistic at face value or I'll take this oh so you don't cover Venezuelan gangs you don't cover that every single day so everyone can see that that's that's that's the thing I've never understood is like no one's on the other side of that no one's like oh I Am pro the person who runs around town punching grandmothers I'm actually on that team it's like at the end of the day if you focus on these I yeah sorry I for I don't think she believes any of like what she's saying on that front only because like I've seen her reason you know what I mean like I've seen her before she like started like reasoning like this like and I know she has sense you know what I mean like she knew how to like arrive a conclusion so like that's the thing that makes me I'm like I try I want to I want to be nicer because I'm trying to be nicer in my in my old age and like be consider and be like oh it's not a but that's the only thing I could see it is old age you're younger than me I'm 31 and stressed out with three chronic illnesses busting my ass I feel like 72y old lady
