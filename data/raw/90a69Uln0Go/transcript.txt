yeah so i thought we'd uh we'd go through uh some of the things that posted to a twitter account called uh libs of tick tock which is generation zed leftists on tiktok explaining how the world works and uh we don't know how the world works obviously so we need to take to our moral authorities of tick tock uh to explain to us what right and wrong are and how the world operates let's play the first one hey and thank you for asking so my pronouns are she her i also wanted to let you all know that i'm comfortable with both masculine and feminine gendered terms for those who that don't know what gendered terms are some examples of masculine gendered terms are like dude or man so saying like hey dude or what's up man and some examples of feminine gendered terms are like hey girl hey queen that kind of stuff and as a side note i know some people use these in a gender-neutral way used to use dude a lot in a gender-neutral way but it's important to remember even if you're planning on using them in a gender-neutral way they are still gendered terms so some people may not be comfortable being called them it's always best to ask second side note even though i'm comfortable being called feminine gendered terms please don't call me cis if you're not another indigenous person unless i've invited you to cis is a term of endearment within the indigenous community that we use to identify each other so i'm not comfortable being called it by non-indigenous people never call me cis in a sarcastic way you uh you listening callum are you taking that lesson from her i found that really funny and she said even though you mean it this way that doesn't matter yeah the context doesn't matter yeah i love that i mean every black rapper going to jail for racism cause that's how that works but the the term dude i'm actually really annoyed that this has been co-opted by leftists and saying oh no this is a gendered parent no it's not like sorry you know i i realize that you're 12 years old and you just realize the world exists but things existed long before you and i was one of those things and i was using the term dude for everyone you know when i was basically your age so shut up kid and honestly you look like an actual explosion in a paint factory like sorry yeah i mean that's the thing like i don't know why there are so many tick tockers let's say it just looks such a mess just looks like oh look my new paint kit's arrived like they make big reds look conservative yes they do anyway let's go on to the next one being rich is a crime against humanity my greed has always been considered good we could distribute the things that everybody needs so no one has more wealth than any person should here's a story about a guy named dooley mordak a property owner in medieval switzerland he threw his weight around and only ever had his own back and said he could do whatever he wanted with his land well an old lady stopped to get some water one day but julie noticed she was on his property so he beat her up and went to court and lied through his teeth and laughed about it with his friends later that week now today his wealth might be desirable but back then he was a villain and a crook so the people of the town got together one night and murdered him and then got off the hook that's justice that's left is justice hmm i love this every form of socialism is just which group of people do we murder to fix the world's problems murder is good if you're a communist there's a bunch of people we need to murder and it's the witch because being rich is a crime against humanity don't you know yeah amazing you get that with a class socialist but the race socialists just kill the white people gendered socialists just kill all the men yeah and then everything will be fixed yeah there is a group of people that they need to kill and uh they're not shy about telling you who they are and they're going to sit there in a soviet union t-shirt and say hey we should murder people listen this story about someone getting murdered this is good that's such an evil thing this is like they like they don't understand the very act of murdering someone is in his in and of itself evil well they're not murdering someone in their mind either i mean like the nazis who murdered the jews they're like no they're rodents or something they're not people they're parasites because they've committed crimes against fantasy yeah that's exactly exactly what i was thinking of john the simpsons in sunscreen yeah where literally just exploded in her face how to be a tick tocker starter pack [Laughter] anyway uh let's play the next one let's talk about black crime rates black neighborhoods are over police so of course they have higher rates of crime and white perpetrators are higher so of course they have lower rates of crime and all of those stupid stats you keep using are operating off a small sample size so shut up shut up shut up shut up shut up shut up shut up cope cope i mean the this thing most people look at is not black crime in general but black murders and we can take the murderers go through case by case and you tell me which one is totally innocent well that's the thing in america these are the fbi crime statistics when they're like well you're using small sample size what the entire population of the united states i think that's a big enough sample size and uh the black communities don't have higher rates of crime because they're overpoliced that's not how crime works no no strangely enough the police don't make the crime usually white communities don't have lower rates of crime because they're underpoliced that's just not how that works uh massive massive cope from generation zed take doctors i wonder how this rule works like if you put a thousand police officers in one neighborhood does everyone just start killing each other exactly exactly it's riots and yeah things exploding and gunshots ringing out just happy families just start murdering each other why i stole a policeman it's like some sort of frank herbert novel or something anyway let's let's go on to the next one next up we have ace flux so ace flux is your person uh they're going to fluctuate between asexuality and allosexual so like uh it's your person that one day they could be like fully asexual and then the next it could totally change so this is a person whose sexuality is gonna fluctuate on a daily basis one day they could have crushes on somebody one day they could be sexually attracted to somebody in some form or degree and the next day they could be completely just not interested not wanting anything to do with so this is your person that's going to be asexual one day in some form or degree of sexual the next i think that's really interesting that's very cool and i love learning about these things as i go along so if you know anybody who's on the ace flux or anything please tag them let them know share it like comment thank you i love the way this is framed as a sexuality right but what have they actually described there well some days i'm horny some days i'm not yeah sometimes i've got a headache just not in the mood some days i'm up for it i see you're right though this stuff should be spammed to every member of the equality department another leftist who's arguing for a recognition act or whatever absolutely she's like right how do you stand against this yeah so are you an allosexual or are you a tyrannosaurus i love that joke anyway uh let's go on to homelessness i think it is what if we stopped staying homeless we stopped seeing people experiencing houselessness and said people displaced by capitalism big brain thought how do we explain people who are homeless during feudalism how do we explain people are homeless and soviet union how do we explain people who are homeless before the invention of houses how do we explain the one country that did end homelessness north korea and how did they do it they made sure that you couldn't buy food you had to have a residence but seriously so the capitalism to them is some sort of overarching evil god that existed even before houses existed and must have therefore been responsible for the entire population of the earth being homeless i live in a capital society if i go home and slip my throat capitalism did this yes it's like no you did this right well let's uh let's get on some cope about why the black community hates asians the widespread animosity between asian people and black people is probably one of the sneakiest tricks ever pulled to uphold white supremacy i've seen a lot of black people scoff at the idea that the black community should stand in solidarity and support of the asian community right now and to justify this they say oh asian people don't like us they don't help us why should we help them and the answer is quite simple because white people don't want us to it's the same reason that white people pit black men against black women or light-skinned people against dark-skinned people because we're a lot easier to control when we're divided the anti-black and anti-asian sentiments in our respective communities didn't develop organically they were put there they are the product of systems of white supremacy specifically designed to keep people of color disenfranchised in this country we need to build bridges and stand with the asian american community and to start dismantling the anti-asian hatred within ourselves because it gets us nowhere it weakens us both and there is no question that we would all be stronger together why did you beat up this asian grandma well you know redlining in the 40s let me talk to you about jim crow so i mean that is just a massive cope i love about that it's like right so why people did this it didn't happen organically somehow they introduced it but it is all within us and we've got our reasons for hating asian people it's because they don't like us that's why we hate them i wonder what his position was on the blacks who keep attacking jews as well well i imagine that the white supremacy has a lot to answer for callum i love the you know white people don't want us to get along no they really do they really do they really would like you all to just be nice and polite and follow the rules if i mean you know i'm not a white american but i'm guessing that almost all of them would agree to that i swear to god anyway let's uh also just one thing to mention like i know this is just like young people yeah it was just people on college campuses wasn't it these goddamn morons of their ideology currently infest every institution in the west and it's not gonna get better is it the army the government every corporation everywhere you go and we have to have legal decisions to say that actually you're allowed to believe that women have the vaginas yeah but the current government is currently a why is it like 2012 tumblr yeah yeah that clock of progress isn't going to stop no they've got a lot of catching up to do eventually we'll uh we'll get things like this i describe myself as agender because internally when i think of me i don't associate me with any gender and not in a way that's like i could go anyway i'm cool with all pronouns i am specifically no thank you to gender this is a lot of people would say it's useful sometimes i grew up my hair this long because i've been a performer for six years and i found that i got better tips when i flipped my hair around so i look that way but when i think inside and i introspect about what i want from gender powerful intimidating biblically accurate angel i don't really feel gender euphoria at all i just don't want it for me gender isn't a part of my identity gender is a tool that i use to get what i want if you're following along and questioning your identity at home take a second to think about what exactly you want from gender and what part of it gives you euphoria and like and follow for more gender [ __ ] from this series this week as we talk about movement and gender presentation and the moment that i started questioning my gender obviously a woman don't care what your opinion on gender is god i only grow my hair out for my uh my work like yeah but you're doing take talks that's not work and you're still doing all the female signatures i think she might have been a stripper or something and so howard very empowered we're sex positive around here calum but but obviously i love this the term gender euphoria now as i understand that that's meant to be some sort of uh pleasurable feeling that you get from when you're recognized as a gender or something like this and it's like okay don't care like you're obviously a woman and even if you know you you're not like oh i'm thrilled about being a woman it doesn't matter anyway moving on apparently you're that non-asexual aromantic and allosexual aromantic are not always interchangeable non-asexual aromantic includes identities such as my own i'm not asexual but i'm not allowed sexual either my experiences are going to be very different from an allosexual aromantic person's totally different i think it's just important if you're an ally who's talking about aromantic issues if you're talking about allosexual aromantic issues make sure to say allosexual aromantic there's nothing wrong with that term just saying non-asexual and romantic also includes other aromantic people who might not experience sexual attraction but still don't identify as asexual just something to keep in mind breaking new frontiers in identity important stuff oh i know we're totally different totally different i know that we might seem exactly the same in every single way but we're totally different guys and this is really important moral legislation from a child you know what really hurts is everyone's thinking it all right when their parents see that they're just gonna be right i gotta teach my child some lessons you know what's been sad i bet they're in california and i bet the parents are like stunning and brave of course they are uh for anyone who is wondering i looked up what allosexual means there's actually nothing to do with dinosaurs so i'm not interested in it but it refers to people who do not identify as asexual that is people who are regularly people who regularly experience sexual attraction regardless of their sexual orientation asexual in contrast refers to people who experience little or no sexual attraction as a counterpart to asexual the word allosexual helps normalize and destigmatize asexuality in society so i've come away from that not knowing what the hell they're supposed to be it's a subversion term it is just to make normal people not the norm because i just want to make chaos don't i yes that's why i call them the cult chaos like the whole 40k like scene like the the chaos faction does actually work absolutely you know god save the emperor anyway let's let's hear about what being demisexual is i'm demisexual i only feel sexual attraction when i form an emotional connection if there's no strong bond it's not an option get to know me i'm demisexual [Music] so normal is that right-wing meme i don't know it's kind of like super straight where it's like is she is she is this a troll yeah i only want to have sex with someone i'm in love with like a traditional woman i'm woman sexual i mean we've literally returned to tradition by demisexuality anyway let's get electron misogyny okay you guys know how we talked about how white people have all been psychologically conditioned to be racist and they have to actively unlearn that conditioning to be anti-racist the same thing applies with cisgendered men all men have been psychologically conditioned to be misogynistic under our patriarchal society which is why they struggle to see women as multi-faceted human beings why you see those men who change once they have a daughter they're like oh yeah we really need to protect women i have a daughter because their daughter breaks out of the madonna complex isn't viewed as like a mammy figure but also isn't viewed as a war but then again let's go even deeper the daughter still viewed as something that can be controlled and once those daughters start to break out of that control and think for themselves often they get mistreated by their fathers because now his manhood is threatened by her intelligence and that's just one example men need to actively unlearn their misogyny what the f like if you have a daughter and you're careful about you don't want her to get raped that's you being intimidated by her intelligence that's her undermining your masculinity with her intelligence you know this reminds me of you know that scene from gta 5 where i think it's at franklin's house like his mother and his uh jogging partner goes out and they're like we are women we are strong and then um trevor just turns up and goes shut up yeah that's basically how i felt about it and uh just to be clear um i don't know what she's withering about but uh if your daughter's doing something which you disprove as a father you should stop her doing it don't make your children don't make yourself hate your children no and don't allow your children to be taken away by this stuff and uh it's tough they don't like it but anyway uh the real the real question of the hour is what is a woman here's one tick tocker to help us with that okay can someone help me out with this because i'm confused i am a woman i identify as a woman i feel comfortable in being a woman but like what the [ __ ] is a woman like if someone asked me what does being a woman mean to you i wouldn't have an answer don't even try to tell me that well being a woman is being empathetic and kind and compassionate because that could be anybody anybody could be those things don't even bother being transphobic in my comments saying that oh being a woman is having a uterus and having kids because no no don't even bother saying that being a woman means having bitties and having a vagine because no also no wrong so i'll ask the question again what is a woman like i feel so comfortable identifying as a woman but is that only because that's just what i've always been that's what people always told me that i was so i just went with it and the thing that's frustrating with this question is that everyone's answer is always well it depends on the person and i get that i know but i'm trying to figure it out for myself and i don't know and i mean i'm a gender abolitionist so like abolish gender you know but some people feel very validated in their labels and in their genders so i'm strictly speaking for myself i don't know what being a woman means to me anyone else so i don't know what a woman is i'm going to refuse any biological connection to a person's body uh with a womanhood but i know the intersectional versions don't make any sense they don't make any sense and i can't understand from their view what a woman is because they don't define what a woman is also i want to abolish what a woman is well she wanted to abolish all gender yes so what he's transitioning then yes but also what's a woman if you want to abolish it what's the point in worrying about what the definition is if you're getting rid of it well so she's a woman i mean abolish yourself first yeah exactly she'd have to abolish it herself but that's that's the point isn't it this these these poor people have been left totally unable to form a coherent view of the world around them and there are probably millions upon millions of these poor souls at this point oh yeah absolutely like this isn't just the rule of the tick tock the meme of the tumblr fringe like jesus christ there are these people keep coming out of the woodwork in every scandal in public life now there's always somebody yeah yeah but anyway let's uh let's hear about a lecture about about capitalism but if they raise the minimum wage how do i keep my business open then go out of business that's capitalism it's the free market supply and demand where is your demand baby girl sorry no one wants to racist 50s americana that's right capitalism is when the government ruins you capitalism is when the government means that you're you can't afford to hire people peak capitalism much capitalism is the most capitalism in fact when the government has more interference than anything else in your business that's capitalism according to millennials on tick-tock most capitalist country in existence absolutely north korea is the peak example of capitalism yeah but china for capitalism i guess so china china actually has successful businesses in it that's not capitalism yeah anyway and of course communism is wonderful yeah so this guy asked for a video on why communism is good and in a part two comment he said that he thinks a lot of people just equate communism with north korea ussr stuff like that and that's a bad thing you also don't have to apologize for any ignorance for being liberal i grew up christian conservative before i found leftism communism is good because true marxist communism is as close to a utopia as we can get the reason you equate communism with north korea and that that's a bad thing is because of western propaganda capitalism mccarthyism red scare the capitalists over your head want you to think that it's bad so they can keep their capitalism the marxist definition of communism is a stateless classless moneyless society that definition has never been reached in the real world unless you count all of human history up to the last couple thousand years no working 60 hours a week to have food in your stomach and a roof over your head accessible health care and free to do anything you want to do without the change of money all right i've probably consumed more north korean propaganda than anyone in this office than north koreans and the north koreans are very very explicit about how socialist they are what i love about this is he's again fantasizing rousseau style about the the wonderful condition of mankind before civilization occurred you know money trade property all those sort of things uh you know people didn't work 60 hour weeks calum they didn't i mean they they buried sort of like three out of five children but they didn't work 60-hour weeks and they also starved the children yeah yeah absolutely they would also starve to death get eaten by wild animals etc etc but they could dig up their corpses and eat them as well but they weren't capitalists so at least they were free at least they were free yeah amazing gotta love tick-tock i just i feel bad for what's happened to these children and they are children because it's kind of thing like i'm agreeing with michael mouse at this point but it's sort of just like well i don't think sport because oh yeah you look at the next generation it's this this ideology shows no signs of stopping no and the people who have been indoctrinated into it have not got the tools to understand why the things are happening to them are happening and so everything no imagination not even not even that no constructive thinking so they can't look at something and extrapolate like any kind of theory from it they have they've been indoctrinated into theory and have to project that onto everything that happens so now hunter-gatherers are the peak communists so the senegal sentinelese of peak communists and you know capitalism is uh you know the iphone he's recording that on is a form of oppression the workers party of korea capitalist yeah yeah socialist congress capitalist and and but it's it's these people who are going to suffer when this all comes crashing down because this is going to last forever if you enjoyed this segment from the podcast of the lotus eaters you can watch the full broadcast live every weekday at 1pm uk time on
