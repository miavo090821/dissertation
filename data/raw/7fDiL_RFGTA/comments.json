Watch the movie \"Sleepers\" the whole film revolves around the physical and sexual abuse of a group of young lads, every SINGLE abuser is a white male prison guard, the only prison guard who ever defends the boys is a steely eyed black, moral man who tends to growl things at the evil white, evil, racist white guards like \"HEY knock this shit off\" Try naming a film of the last 3 decades where the psychopathic, torturous rapist / murderer was black?!

        "text": "@curiouser-and-curiouser Every democracy or republic starts off with the right to vote restricted somehow, usually to land owning male citizens.  \n\nThe reason for this is so that those that help decide the fate of the nation have proven themselves to be basically competent and loyal.  It takes a certain amount of brain power and initiative to earn, hold onto, and make a living from your property.  It also means the voter has skin in the game.  He can't afford to just pull up stakes and move on if things go south.  The safety and success of him and his household is directly linked to the safety and success of the nation in a more intimate way than someone on the dole, a merchant, or laborer.  \n\nWhen you examine history, in every instance where a polity extended the franchise beyond this, it begins to degrade.  It becomes fiscally irresponsible, engages in needless military adventures, grows a bloated welfare state, and sees an explosion in the number of laws which restrict the people and empower the state.  Civic virtue fades, while corruption and incompetence flourishes.  Kind of like  what we see now.\n\nIf you want to have a government run by the people, you better make sure the people casting the votes are not selfish, petty, short sighted morons.  Since the 80-20 rule applies to IQ and wisdom, a civilization keen on long term survival and success would do well to not give power to people who lack intelligence and wisdom.  Giving just anyone the vote is no better than letting a retarded child play with a loaded gun.",

On top of that, the writer (Tyson) who had recorded several interviews with her decades later and claimed that she admitted to lying about the details of her story ended up being investigated by the FBI, which found that his claim was unfounded. He had recorded all the interviews, and none of the recordings contained such an admission. Her daughter-in-law was also present for the interviews and confirmed that no admission had ever been made. My guess is that Tyson made it up to take advantage of the recent wave of race-grifting so he could generate publicity for his book. \n\nAt the end of the day, there has never been a reason for Carolyn Bryant to be arrested.",
