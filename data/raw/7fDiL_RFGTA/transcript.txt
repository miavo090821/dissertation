i've covered the real talk on this channel for a long time at this point and some of your guys's favorite videos by view counts by likes by engagement are my responses to the real talk and their craziest takes but here's the thing as i was looking into that show everything's gonna be all white and i was looking into some of the horrible takes and the horrible anti-white racism on display in that show my girlfriend who is absolutely wonderful in every way told me that one of the chicks in that show used to be on the real talk and the real talk used to be so much worse than it is now and i had to see it for myself so i actually went back in time to a video around the time when jesse smallett was indicted for the second time and watched this take that is just amazing in every possible way because this chick amanda seals actually makes every other crazy person on the real talk except for lonnie who's the most reasonable we've already decided that seem sensible seem logical her takes are so off the wall terrible on the jesse smallet hoax that we have to go into it we have to dive into it we have to talk about it and we have to laugh about it and that's what we're going to do today but before we heat up this situation and discuss whatever whatever we're talking about i have a new sponsor we're gonna transition to them and then we're gonna come back over here and be stunned and awed by how horrible this woman actually is the hottest temperatures of the year are right around the corner this means costlier electric bills for you trying to air condition your whole entire house this is why i highly recommend you guys go over to easysummercool.com and grab yourself one of these nifty four in one portable air conditioners i was actually legitimately surprised by how well this thing cools it's recommended that you put ice water in it and then you turn the power on i put in lukewarm water and it was pretty solid in its cooling efforts let me give it a little power turn on let me turn it on right quick so you guys can hear it there you go with the blue light that's where it's on maximum fan and i'm not even sure if this microphone is actually picking it up this is perfect as an easy quick cheap cooler right by your bed or for rooms that have windows that are too small for an air conditioner unit like one of my closest friends has and right now you can get it for fifty percent off if you go over to easysummercool.com that's right fifty percent off four and one cool air conditioner save money on your power easysummercool.com jessie smaller is back in the news you guys yesterday after an investigation by special prosecutor dan webb jesse was indicted by a grand jury on six felony charges which include filing false police reports and staging a hate crime so that's the setup again we're going back in time in order to discuss this video because it's so outrageous but as you guys should already know jesse was ultimately convicted of five of those six counts because he did in fact stage the hate crime he did file false police reports he did lie to the police now we're going to hear this woman the howl lady the hate woman talk for a little bit and he faces up to three years in prison if convicted again if convicted so what are you guys thoughts about honestly this confuses me yeah i'm so confused and she's going to tell us of course about how she's confused because she never knows what's going on in any situation it's like they don't even brief her it's like they don't have a producer in her ear telling her to stop being so ignorant about everything they talk about and again we need to save the real so we could cherish the memories with her and we could say how and hate multiple different times on this channel honestly this confuses me yeah i'm so confused you're always confused you never know what's going on at all whatsoever and the reason this is happening or the reason this happened in this way is because corruption in the chicago district attorney's office the cook county district attorney's office from kim fox who's a sean king george soros back district attorney who's not interested in prosecuting anything led to the charges being dropped and after they called a special prosecutor because kim fox did not actually recuse herself and there was all these different political considerations in dropping the charges against smallet they found evidence of a crime they indicted smallet again and smallett was ultimately convicted for that crime and he's not facing three years he got 150 days and he was released after three because he had mental breakdown after mental breakdown and then they filed an appeal because justice can never be served against a wealthy black lgbtq celebrity who obviously staged the hoax for his own personal benefit but that's not going to be said throughout the course of this video lonnie is the closest one to actually representing the truth and considering this was two years ago and what side these people are obviously on i give her some credit for again being the most reasonable however there's somebody in this panel there's somebody on that stage there is a woman who is in place in this knockoff knockoff of the view that we must save save the real that is going to bring the most terrible lists of all takes yeah like i don't think this is about jesse i think it's about kim fox who is the cook county state attorney which is the second largest prosecutor in the country um she originally um dropped the 16 charges and she's up for re-election in 30 days so i think this is more about her now again this is true they were pissed that they spent all this time and money investigating this hoax they found out it was in fact a hoax and then due to corruption and political considerations they dropped the charges against small lead and we can't pretend that her election being so close to the re-indictment had nothing to do with anything obviously people were taking their shot at kim fox which by the way they should have the only problem is this shot didn't hit and she's unfortunately still in office when they could and when she was the most vulnerable and i appreciate them for doing so because this is a horrible district attorney and this case is representative of her practice in that office in not prosecuting crimes thus leading to spikes in crime in cook county specifically in the city of chicago so we're still in the side where they don't want to talk about this they don't want to condemn jesse fully they want to hide behind the ambiguity of the situation or their perceived ambiguity of the situation but at least they're analyzing the politics in a reasonable way it's not the best way it's not the most accurate way but again you take into account that this is at the time and you give people breaks when they deserve breaks we're not here on this channel to viciously go after everybody who's wrong on everything we are here to save the real hashtag save the real please for the love of god june 3rd is far too soon for this show to end save the reel and even though that could be true it was confusing when all of a sudden the charges were just dropped so we don't have a verdict and for me i'm very passionate about this because to this day there are people in the lgbtq community risking their lives and getting hurt harmed or killed on the daily for just living their life in real life and i've actually lost friends to these attacks in san francisco so i just want to say if he really did do this to manifest it for attention then it is a heinous thing to do and he has to pay the price right so here we have this asian woman and you'll remember her from one of my earliest videos on the real talk where she was using the attacks on asians across the country by black people as a way to talk about the racism against black people from the asians that were being victimized but right here on point in this moment she's saying it is a hedonist act it's horrific it's disgusting and jessie should pay the consequences now years later when jesse was actually convicted if you'll remember my video on that topic she was among the ladies in the choir singing jesse's praises and talking about how he needed mercy but right here in this moment she is being accurate she's overstating the victimization of lgbtq double x-iip people in the community but overall she's saying look this is horrible just doing for this attention is horrible and he should be punished for that so she's on the right track at least in part in this sentence again one of the crazier members of the real talk crew sounding reasonable related to this story and don't think that is going to carry through everybody because lonnie right here talks about how jesse didn't admit to anything he is he is now if he didn't and if he did it he hasn't admitted to that right and if he didn't then he is owed an apology because he's getting dragged through this why aren't they um why aren't they bringing charges against the the two brothers so the idea that jesse smallett didn't admit to staging this hate crime and that somehow should have any weight in your considerations is absurd in every possible way if we waited for confessions for all crimes we'd have virtually no people in jail no people convicted in this nation jesse ultimately ended up being convicted he still denies it to this day but now this is going to take a dark turn and now we're in normal real talk talk where they're like oh if he didn't do it then he's owed an apology and you know ambiguity blah blah this lady is confused because she's always confused but now we're going to go into the hyper-regressive section of the show and i just gotta play it for you i think aren't they bringing charges against all the white people that call the cops for bs every single day and there's that too the whole issue every single day what about white people what about white people what about the white people that call the cops over bs every single day why aren't they arrested first of all some of them do in fact get arrested but typically the reason that they don't get arrested is because what you call bs every single day is actually a reasonable reason to contact the police and thus no crime was being committed there's a reason why an ultra regressive cities they're trying to criminalize white people calling the police because those cities are racist those cities are ridiculous and because we know for a fact that current laws do not cover this because these aren't false police reports they're calls based on suspicion they happen all the time white people aren't the only ones who do them i've talked about on this channel multiple different times that i used to have a neighbor that was pakistani and he would call the police on me for anything that was wrong in his home one time he actually called the police on me because an apple was found in his front yard and he assumed that was me trying to vandalize his property so i've been through this it sucks it's terrible he was never arrested even though i think he was going above and beyond and he was not only harassing me as a kid but this was due in part to him harassing my mother but that's a whole other situation i don't want to get into and yeah it happens it's not just white people calling the police it's not just black people having the police called on them for no reason if you're a young man and you were outside in the world this has likely happened to you a couple of times for me it happened multiple different times to the point where i was actually wrongfully arrested in a completely different incident and the person behind that was an asian person so all races call the police all the time white people call the police over nonsense on white people all the time or what is perceived to be nonsense because this is how our society works if you see something and you're suspicious of it then you're likely to call the police and it's better than personally getting involved in those situations honestly so the situation of black people doing something wrong or being perceived to do something wrong and the police being called is no big deal it's overstated all the examples that they have are non-crimes or worse examples where the black person was doing the exact thing that the white person called the police on them for and this is why she has nothing and the applause and the cheers and the jeers in the audience for this line is absurd because she's deflecting two white people when in this instance no white people are involved and this was a hoax against them specifically the only thing i just want to avoid is that this has to be laid to rest because we cannot put a culture out there where it becomes harder for us to believe victims that this is related so this is a standard point that people make all the time and just because it's standard doesn't mean it's not true the fact of the matter is victim status is praised in this nation there's a reason why that this horrible woman who's rolling her eyes while she's talking insanely rude by the way is trying to point the finger at white people and claim minority victim status even in a situation where it's obviously a racial hoax against white people and we should be skeptical by the way of claims of victimhood because we've elevated victims to the point in our society where this is a coveted status so obviously it incentivizes people like jesse smallett which was always more interesting than his idiotic hoax the fact that he knew that this would work and he knew that this would give him positive attention and something that we should be concerned about but again she's gonna eye roll again she's gonna think of something stupid to say and we're gonna have to go into it because when all these other women are being reasonable obviously the crazy person is just too crazy for them let's hear what's going to go down they're just using justice come on y'all it was no victims they can't really prove it everything was first of all there was nobody actually hurt in this scenario but there were victims jesse smallett put a smear out against people he opposed politically and people he didn't like racially that is a huge problem the idea that there being no victims in this case thus makes it okay imagine if we were in a situation where there were two unfortunate white people walking around in the area and the police arrested those two white people and they brought jesse smallard in to say whether or not those people who would have just happened to have been in the area were in fact guilty do you think jesse smollette would have actually pointed the finger at them i definitely do especially when suspicion of the hate hoax was so public remember in the long absurd string of defenses put forward by jesse smollett's legal team they actually tried to point the finger at a redhead even though the osindaro brothers were already acknowledging that they were in fact behind the attack at that portion they acknowledged that they were there they acknowledged that this was a plan and yet the lawyer still tried to point the finger at some random ginger that they found on a surveillance camera somewhere because this would have been the tactic this would have been what they would have done and what do you think would have happened to that average citizen who would have been implicated by jesse smallett do you think that they would have been given the benefit of the doubt or do you think that they would have been fired immediately and dubbed racist by society and their faces and their families faces would have been plastered all over the world so no wrong incorrect there were victims in this scenario what jesse did was wrong and they can prove it which is why they did prove it and why jesse smallette was in fact convicted even if it was a hoax this is really happening all the time even if this was a hoax this is happening all the time no it isn't and in fact what is happening all the time and what is happening very frequently and i've been covering these stories going back in our history and covering how absurd they are are hoaxes repeatedly time and time again because people want attention and they all say the same thing that it's happening all the time so you shouldn't worry about it or whatever whatever but this lady is actually gonna take it one step further she's going to say something so outrageous so insane so anti-white so hateful so regressive that i actually did not believe this clip existed out there on the internet.com but it is still up on the real talks channel right now and i'm going to link it in the description so that you guys can find it and even if it was a hoax for the sake of bringing attention to this then i'm like that's low-key noble and even if it was a hoax for the sake of bringing attention to this then i'm like that's loki noble yes that is her position yes that is what she said live on television and she was moved on to a documentary called everything's going to be all white and we're supposed to take this person for anything other than a hateful evil racist woman who can't stand white people more than anything else in the world what the hell is wrong with this woman that is low-key noble justy jesse smollett doing a hoax on himself sowing racial division in this nation making up a ridiculous narrative that damages actual victims of crimes in this nation while simultaneously promoting himself is low-key noble this is a woman that is so desperate for victimhood this is a woman who is so desperate for marginalized people to be perceived as victims that she doesn't care about anybody else she doesn't care about who is actually victimized in that scenario imagine again if those two white people would have just been randomly in the area and they would have been picked up by the police she would have been the one sharing the images of their family she would have been the one potentially throwing up their address she would have been the one potentially hinting at or outright calling for violence because she truly believes that jesse small smallhead staging this hoax jesse smollette who by the way this is so common in the united states of america needed to stage his hoax and he couldn't even find white people to be involved in the staging of this hoax even though it's definitely super common in the united states of america thinks that that's a noble act she thinks that's that's not only something that isn't a big deal or not representative of society she actually thinks it's virtuous it's honorable it's something to be respected that's how foregone this person is and again you could see how she makes everybody on this panel even the how chick that never knows what's going on seem reasonable with how hateful and disgusting that she actually is like i'm just i'm at my wife's end about us centering situations like this and wanting to make people have to pay and it's like emmett till's accuser was a lot it's i think she's still alive and this young man died and she announced that she was lying about it they should have put the shackles on her that day and she's walking around so just think about how dumb brain dead and incoherent that take actually is first and foremost the woman didn't actually say that the whole emmett till whistling thing didn't actually happen it was implied and it was reported that she said that but i've looked into it and it's not actually confirmed now what happened to emmett till was still horrible however she just finished telling us that this is something that happens all the time in this country but what did she do what example did she go for did she go from example maybe the week before or the day before you know this happens every day but she pulled up an example that happened same day because remember this happens all the time and justy smallett was being noble bringing attention to this thing that happened all the time no she went back to an example from the 1950s that's the closest example she could find for something that happens all the time that's the compare and contrast just a total denial of the concept of linear time in this situation what about emmett till anytime a black person does something wrong let's just bring up emmett till because he was a black person who had something bad happen to him and yes it was horrible but again 1950s versus the story of the day why aren't we still talking about emmett till what's wrong with us and by the way obviously they should arrest her they should punish her because lying in a trial is perjury and we shouldn't have a statute of limitations on certain things now that being said there probably was a statute of limitations and that's not the issue at hand the issue at hand is her saying jesse is noble for staging a hate hoax because it happens all the time and the first example she could pull up is emmett till from the 1950s no one was hurt in this situation nobody you know what they're mad about their time their resources being money the taxpayers resources taxpayers resources are being used every day to imprison people who have done nothing but be an addict so i don't want to hear about jessie smallhead why are you complaining about the wasting of taxpayer resources here's some other ways that taxpayer resources are wasted that i don't like therefore two wrongs makes it no big deal don't worry about it it's not an issue just just fine fine terrible line of argumentation from a horrible person and from a person lacking all semblance of intelligence okay what i do about people that feel that well what if a hate crime really happens to me and now because of what jesse smaller said now they don't believe if this is this one instance is what makes them not believe you baby that's a lie that they're telling ourselves we have lived in a nation where they don't believe hate crimes every day again it all shifts into we're actually the victims white people are the bad people because she views the world in this racially polarized way where white people are in fact evil but the thing is as we documented multiple different times on this channel hate crimes are often believed even when they have even worse evidence than the justice smallett case go through any of my videos where i've documented these cases the police spend lots of resources it happens at a university they institute punishments and even when it turns out to be a hoax like in the taco incident that i talked about recently on this channel the punishments and the implications of that are still in effect even when the hoaxer committed the hoax for the sole purpose of getting racial equity and crt into the curriculum all the remnants of the hoax still remain so the idea that we don't believe hate hoaxes enough is absurd people are condemned and shamed for questioning them and those big ones that end up in the media the ones that happen all the time often turn out to be false so you guys have created a society where no matter how ridiculous it is your evil white racist if you question it and now you're having to deal with the consequences and you're just freaking out and still trying to cling to that victim status but it's okay even if it was a hoax it was noble so you don't really care anyway whether it's true or not you just want the message to take over so if it was a hoax what do you think is the correct punishment and do or do you think he should be murderers on probation sure sure but i'm asking about jesse smallett i'm asking about that because you said it where's loki noble i just she literally should be like she should be applauded damn and by the way she got her wish jesse smollette got a slap on the wrist he was treated with kid gloves throughout the process and even though he was convicted on five felonies he only served a couple of days in terms of a 150 day sentence when each of those felonies could have resulted in a multiple year sentence per felony plotted damn they got smacks on the wrist for all these people and they can't give a smack on a wrist that jesse smallett like because they're saying that it's a whole big thing i'm just i i don't believe it we look at black men who are constantly getting the book thrown at them all the time and this part ira played because it's crucial because the reason why she wants jessie to get a slap on the wrist is because she thinks that the cosmic scales are out of balance and black people were treated so bad therefore we need to let black criminals off more easily that actually commit crimes because of the way that black people were treated when they didn't commit crimes or when they didn't commit that much serious crimes or because white people being treated she doesn't want a fair system she wants black people to be privileged to respond to what she perceives to be evil white racist privilege that's who this person is that's how horrible she is and yes the real talk used to be significantly worse although the rest of the panelists looked more reasonable by comparison but hey those are just my thoughts let me know your thoughts down in the comments below if you liked
