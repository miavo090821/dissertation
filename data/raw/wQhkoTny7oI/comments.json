    "text": "Epigenetics is the coping strategy of Mendelism-Morganism (genetic determinism) to the  obvious failures of their theory and the obvious practical correctness of Lysenkoism. The computational context is as much in the cytoplasm as in the genes. Lysenkoism in the USSR was incredibly practically successful and led to a revolution in agriculture and agronomy.  Lysenko's work is incredibly important because Mendelism-Morganism in its fundamentalist form especially is the foundation of eugenics and the rationalisation of Malthusian attacks on workers. Also the way Lysenkoism was fought bitterly against by Western science and even by the revisionist trend in the USSR shows that science is not class neutral. Bourgeois science is only science some of the time. Much of the time it is pseudoscience serving Capital. This will be a large part of the working class struggle in our current era. No Marxist movement that cowtows to corrupt bourgeois science will succeed IMO. Thus Lysenko's writings are critical for modern Marxists to read and understand. I suggest \"Soviet Biology\" (1948) and \"Heredity and Variability\" (1953).   I disagree with your assessment of China. It seems pretty clear that it is rife with revisionism and is heading towards the restoration of capitalism.  It has a birthrate of 1.0 children per woman, i.e population halving every generation.All respect to the Chinese people for their achievements and their challenge to US hegemony but the Chinese bourgeoisie has incredible power now and has agents at every level in the CPC. As a result the CPC now has built an entire ideology around 'Market-based solutions'.  What is this but the road to the restoration of capitalism? Commodity production and markets leads to capitalism. Despite this China remains a huge anti-imperialist force against US hegemony. So love and respect to China but DPRK is a far better example of what we will need to emulate in spirit and attitude to overcome imperialism in our own nations.",

China shouldn’t even appear on this list of candidates. In today’s world, the only countries that are genuinely socialist are North Korea and Cuba. In today’s China, there is a small group of Maoists（毛左） who oppose the CCP starting from the Deng era. They label it “revisionist” and only recognize China during Mao‘s period as genuinely socialist.",

THat is why more than 2 millions has fled the country and that is why the majority of Cubans wants to flee the island but they cannot. Even those who are align to the regime, wants to go to USA, some of them even managed to get there.",
