I'm not saying that's what happened with her, but poverty takes a toll on people physically and a recent study came out claiming that stress was as bad for our health as smoking. I don't know if THAT is accurate, but I definitely know stress is bad. It leads to inflammation of the body's systems and causes our brain to release different amounts of chemicals. Apart from that, I think being in the public eye leads people to tend more to their physical health and appearance, especially if future work/roles might depend on it. She could also just be lucky. I agree she looks great. Jealous! Haha.",

Looking forward to more great interviews. I'm always excited to learn new things or think about something in a different way.

This is one of the best interviews I've seen in a LONG time. About to go pull up OitNB right now so I can watch her work!!",

She was amazing in it and it's worth it to look at any clips of her in that or later when VH1 had a flash in the pan moment when they decided to let her host a make over show with two other trans women--TRANSformation or something like that. I wasn't out as a trans person but she was one of the figures that made me feel so much for trans women, because honestly she was funny, entertaining and fabulous--like, she was so charming in that Bush era of the 00s and even in the early 10s. I pretty much watched OITNB for her. She'll always be a welcome icon and personality for me, like she's always been way more than an actress though I hope she still lands some roles. I think she'd kill it in voice over work, personally!",

May she rest in peace 🕊\n\nEDIT: Now that I'm done let me just say that trans IS beautiful! For all the reasons Laverne mentioned sure, but also because of the light in her spirit that she embodies is truly incredible. She shares this characteristic with my other fave Alok Menon, and there's something to be said about it.

    "text": "Laverne Cox has been such an inspiration to me for such a long time. I came out at the end of 2012 and then to see this gorgeous, elegant woman be so unapologetically prominent and authentic has been something that has always been aspirational for me. Even when people were asking her horrendous and invasive questions in interviews, she would just curve their bs and refocus the conversation on what actually matters. \nAnd this convo proves that she's still the same woman as she was back then. <3",
