this is a tweet from Abby Martin citing uh the 972 magazine and here's a quote um from an Israeli intelligence who admits that nothing happens by accident and everything is intentional so when you hear the zionists tell you uh people like Ted Cruz uh people like um Anthony blinkin and others when you hear them tell you Israel does everything it can to not Target civilians Israel has never targeted a civilian as uh RFK and others are fond of saying this is Israel intelligence itself admitting nothing happens by accident when a three-year-old girl is killed in in a home in Gaza it's because someone in the Army decided it wasn't a big deal for for her to be killed that it was a price worth paying for in order to hit another Target we are not Hamas these are not random Rockets everything is intentional we know exactly how much collateral damage there is in every home uh they're admitting that the you know 20,000 people they've killed which is a extremely low number because there's so many people under the rubble that you know could be twice as much easily more oh and starvation what what like what grandmother could sustain it's uh so they're admitting it they're admitting it so the the the people that um did I get to pull up the Tweet Danny or was I just uh speaking without the screen up oh no there's no screen if you could uh put it up for sure I thought I had it up but the people that have um the the people that have just been reiterating this lie that Israel doesn't Target civilian Ian Israel itself admits it does that it considers its attacks so-called proportional it's absurd it's it's criminal it's a violation of international law it spits in the face of of of the UN and its whole purpose the fact that Netanyahu is not being tried by the IC um and that Israel is not being condemned on an everyday basis um and and forced to to stop but so uh that's that I um I have another story but uh Danny do you have any lingering comments on on that one no
