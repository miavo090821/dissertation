    "text": "Do we need any more evidence that the January 6th “insurrection” was an inside job? Why aren’t there traitors bodies hanging from the gallows on the Washington Monument lawn? From the FBI admitting agents were in he crowd provoking, to Ray Epps, to the main footage used in the media being recorded by a BLM/ANTIFA activist, the medias constant and continuous lies about police officers being slaughtered by MAGA “rioters”, just the misinformation and lies in general (see also AOC “where is she” fairy tale)…. \n\nThe lawmakers and intelligence agencies claim that of Americans knew what the government really hides from us we’d lose all trust in them….. we already don’t trust them and we know they do nothing but lie and steal. \n\nI mean this kid was hand selected to place these bombs because the FBI never had any intention of actually investigating it. Just get someone who looks “white” in a hoodie and mask. \n\nThey hate us! They hate us. Let’s admit they want to see us extinct and replaced.",
