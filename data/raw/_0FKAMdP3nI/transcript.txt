hello everyone eddie smith here from midwestern marx wanted to hop on this morning and do a quick video talking about iran um obviously the trump administration we made it through four years without starting another war we did it baby this might be the first four years in u.s history where we haven't started a war i hope i don't sound like a trump supporter there because uh he definitely wasn't good um he strangled countries with sanctions he escalated tensions around the world he acted as the world police as of course the u.s empire always does regardless of who the president heading the empire is um probably the worst thing trump did as far as foreign policy though was allow uh neocons leftovers from the bush administration like eliot abrams and john bolton into his administration these war hawks who are obsessed with war and the crown jewel of the neocon warhawks in the u.s administration right now the the war they want more than anything is the people's republic of iran the u.s has obviously had an extremely long history of intervention in iran iran has had a long history of stifling the us and keeping them out of their country and and keeping iran an independent country with its own independent form of governance um obviously they're not a socialist country so iran isn't you know i would like to see the today party it's spelled t-u-d-e-h party take over iran it's um or not take it over but win power in iran it's the communist party but right now their economic system is what they call islam they say it's not capitalism it's not socialist it's it's what we do with iran and of course um as socialist self-determination comes first right so you don't we don't want to do socialist imperialism we don't want to force our form of government on other countries every country and their people have a right to self-determination so of course i think the proper position of socialists is to um support iran's right to self-determination um uh and then obviously support uh ending uh foreign intervention in iran so right now trump is a lame duck president right we're we're in a period a two month or so period here where joe biden has won the election trump's kind of finally getting over the hoax thing you know his lawsuits have failed um he's accepted that he's lost the election so now he's a lame duck president he doesn't have to run for re-election again so he can basically do anything he wants which is really scary considering the recent news that's coming out of iran so there was a meeting between i believe israel and the us um a few days before the recent assassination of an iranian nuclear scientist um and iran has accused israel obviously israel receives 13 million dollars a day in military funding from the us so that obviously ties back to the us which iran has put a bounty on trump's head following the assassination of qasim solimani their general obviously an enormous escalation between the two countries these terrorist attacks are another escalation coming at a time when trump's a lame duck um and then of course of course the worst thing trump did was pull out of the iran deal so the iran deal forced the u.s to give iran back money that they give iran back their money that we stole from them and as a res and in return iran would allow 24 7 surveillance of their nuclear program by the international atomic energy agency so the international atomic energy agency has been patrolling iran 24 7 since the nuclear deal was signed and not once have they accused iran of creating a nuclear weapon iran uses their nuclear program to make energy and power for electricity for their people and they have uranium which they use to it create medical isotopes and if you look into it it's very well documented that they're not making weapons you can see everything iran is doing it's actually very cool you know iran's a great country with a lot of great academics really rich intellectual history and they're continuing that by pushing the edge with creating new medical isotopes and creating creating these things using uh using uranium and nuclear power it's not nuclear weapons but if you look in u.s media right now you would think that the person the the scientist the professor from iran who just got assassinated is was cooking up a nuclear warhead which he was planning to launch into the us at any second you know it's like the the head of iran's nuclear terror program has been taken out and all these articles uh saying joe biden needs to just just be a little bit smarter about his foreign policy and realize we need to go to war with iran they're saying this isn't the iran you dealt with with uh joe biden this is a new iran a more evil iran which obviously is crazy that the media is pushing this not crazy but um it's just sad to see how bad the ruling class wants war with with this sovereign nation of it you know really a beautiful country iran is beautiful cities like i said uh um great intellectual history um pushing the edge as far as science and technology as in the medical field uh and and we might just destroy their whole country for for oil and mineral wealth um so it's really scary times so yeah you see the u.s media pushing these narratives of iran as a dangerous country and it's not true iran hasn't been a dangerous country so after trump pulled out of the iran deal iran committed two still following the deal right so the u.s is no longer going to pay back the money they stole the u.s is out of the deal because they claimed it was a bad deal when you listen to trump talk about the iran deal it made no sense okay you know he didn't know what he was talking about john bolton wanted him to pull out of the out of the deal so we can go further towards war with iran and trump would just say it was a bad deal it's a horrible deal i got out of it he doesn't know what was in the deal okay the deal was one of the best deals that that any u.s president has signed in the past hundred years you know obviously can't stand obama but this was the one great thing that obama probably did during his presidency as far as foreign policy after he overthrew libya and destroyed syria so ira iran continues to follow this but now after the execution of solemani after after the pulling out of the iran deal after the repeated assassinations of academics and professors the far right is growing in iran not even the far right just a group of people in iran who are saying why are we still trusting the us why are we still following the iran deal that the u.s pulled out of why do we continue to try and make peace with this country who's constantly trying to murder our great country you know our great our islamic republic that that we created in the 1979 revolution when we overthrew the u.s backed shaw who was put in in 1953 after overthrowing our democratically elected muhammad mosadek so of course the us has had a long history of intervention and iranians are fed up with it and now this is allowing for a far right uh to grow in iran and a bill is being signed by the conservative portions of the iranian parliament who want to stop following the iran deal who say let's get these international observers out of our country the west hates us they want to kill us let's make nukes so we can defend ourselves from the west and how do you blame them i mean if i was iranian i don't know what side i would be on i might be thinking forget the us let's make nukes before they come in here and murder my family so so for those of us privileged enough to be living in the us and not in iran where we where we don't you know face the threat of devastating all-out warfare from the world's largest superpower we need to be against this we need to be against this right now because trump is a lame duck president he can do whatever he wants and you know the neocons are in his ear trying to push him to blow up the beautiful country of iran no war with the run stand with the people of iran stand with peace i don't know all right peace [Music] so
