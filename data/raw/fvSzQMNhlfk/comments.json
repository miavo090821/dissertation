    "text": "Let me say up front that both Conscious Lee and Olay have presented topics and discussions to me that challeneged my fundamental understandings about issues (from the white, southern frame of reference) and i genuinely appreciate both of yall's work.\n\nI do have a question for anyone. I'm just now getting into really trying to educate myself on all these different topics. I've picked up books from various white authors who present a word I already know and can identify well, i.e. white authors (Marx, Lenin, Naomi Klein, and some others.) However after reading Angela Davis's \"Freedom is a Constant Struggle\" and really being introduced to the intersectionality, and the ways these issues that i focus on from my frame of reference need to be fought with the people from all struggles. Her explanation of the way in which each struggle intersects drove me to read something else outside of my comfort zone. Thus, I'm currently reading \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\" and whew it is so far beyond my comfort zone! That said, I love hearing his perspective on a world I cannot understand, and I'm doing my best to listen and learn. \n\nI say all that wayyyy too much exposition to ask, you mentioned Huey P. Newton and others during your conversations. What are some their works (or whatever you, the reader of this comment, think is an important) that I can read to further educate myself? \n\nThanks again for the amazing discussions!",

While the holocaust is acknowledged in a lot of places as an a gross injustice, that doesn't necessarily lead straight into the idea that therefore the ideas that fueled the holocaust are equally totally repudiated.

I don't think they're uniquely semitic because Jewish people are semites but so are the Palestinians.\n\nEdit: Oh he said because the phrasing antisemitism was created only for Jewish people. But I'd argue that it's misleading and purposefully left out other semites. Like why did they choose semitic instead of anti-jew. Why choose semitic unless they wanted to frame them as the only semites?",
