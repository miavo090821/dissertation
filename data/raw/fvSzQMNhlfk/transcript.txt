the first thing I have to ask you conscious is who is an icon to [Music] you like do it got to be modern or do it got to be history like you just got certain time period both ways for me like historically he p Newton is the icon that changed my life forever and then right now in the status quo I feel like I go back and forth between uh tab at the brown Okay and isay like to me them two are like the modern day icons if I was if I was able to actualize you feel me uh the capital and the influence of consciously it would I wanted to look something like what you know what I'm saying with with Tabitha and Isa is doing they to me they Liv in social media dream that's funny cuz huie and Isa are both um on my list as well like huy huy listen to die for the people is the reason why I had my Rikers rally like I had that because I was reading it and he was talking a lot about what the Black Panthers did and one of the programs uh the Endeavors that they took part in was that they would bust people to the to the prisons because what people don't realize is that prisons and jails are intentionally made inconvenient to access right for two different reasons one it keeps people if you don't see it's out of sight out of mind you don't see prison you don't see jail it removes those people from the the Consciousness that feels like like Beyond you and two it keeps them isolated from Community from their families and that help then which which is a form of torture and to to make it harder for those people to rehabilitate back into society and that way it keeps Generations locked in that so that's funniest on my list and Issa Issa is my production dreams like yeah definitely so I have your ha conscious in this formal capacity because I want you to get your flowers and I also want one body of work where we really get to know like the man behind you let's let's George how consciously came to be yeah so how' you how did you develop your platform how'd you end up on social media uh I ended up on social media um taking it seriously two weeks after my daughter was born uh my wife has always been like in the nursing field and when she saying she had my daughter she had to take off a leave um as a result you know what I'm saying we had to make some money at that at that time I was a debater and I was you know what I'm saying doing my I was a debate coach um and I went and I had to go coach debate or teach debate to high schoolers in University of Texas two weeks after my daughter was born and left a nasty taste in my mouth like damn it's it's it's it's far as out here they ain't really trying to be with they kid and I'm trying to be there and I I really felt it really made me feel type of way that my daughter was only two weeks old and I had to leave you know what I'm saying to make some money you feel me so uh at that same time I had came across this article you feel me I don't remember who what the article was or even who wrote it but it says something like the average American had a phone in their hand for eight hours out the day and I think five of those hours was on like social media you feel me at that time I used to wake up and go see what they posted on uh hip-hop you know what I'm saying World Star Hip Hop or they post on ESPN and thought like what would it look like for somebody to wake up and be like I wonder what George Lee conscious Lee is posting and recognize that I wanted to be able to dictate my time and my value to make it where I can be the best father husband man I can be and feel like [ __ ] social media I feel like I feel like in 20 16 I already identify social media as being a vehicle that can give me the type of of autonomy that I'm looking for that's word I'll use that is interesting that you say that because I think sometimes people when people perceive you as a talking head they think that you're just espousing you know philosophies that you don't relate to or you haven't lived like I know at me people like to be like oh when you experience crime as though you have it so I think is it's beautiful that it it kind of shows how you started from the same struggles that you're speaking to and recogniz that we have a system in this capitalist society that we live in that doesn't prioritize or value family raising that they don't give you that that you don't have the ability to take the time that you should be entitled to in order to be with your family and so that's how you ended up and then and the other thing too is I was already doing public speaking I was already doing workshops and facilitations and Keynotes and panels before I got on social media before I was consciously and my mindset was the reason why I'm not getting booked the way I want to be booked or the reason I'm not getting opport unities the way I want them to because I'm not doing the marketing and the campaigning and the promoting that I need to do so I saw the two reasons why I did I started doing the platform and taking it more serious you feel me was being able to dictate more of my time effort and energy by I'm saying promoting my services you feel me while also being able to you know turn it into something I ain't going to cap what it's turned into I didn't fully expect to turn into this right I wake up every day and be hella grateful that like damn My Country Ass from small BR Texas got all these people that know who I am this St and the other sometimes it feel unreal you know what I'm saying so I a't respected to proliferate the way it did but I definitely was being intentional about promoting and advertising the skills like how the conscious le.com I do workshop for all that still you know what I'm saying educational Consulting blah blah blah blah blah blah and what do you think made it pop the way it did what do you think about you or about your platform and when when did it um really really hit I think that it first started growing um I started taking social media Series in 2016 I was um lost in sauce huh oh you been on here yeah but I was lost in the sauce though and only trying to build locally you feel me so I was only making content I was busting my ass making content I spent five six hours on a video but I will only post it to Facebook you feel me Facebook where in Brian Texas they ain't trying to hear about no homophobia transphobia white supremacy racism like that you feel me so I got discouraged and feel like damn the people around me that I know and love they they don't want to support me you know what I'm saying so I took it personal now I understand like if you're going to do this work you got to accept that you know I mean the biggest you know supporter is probably going to be a stranger and somebody you know and love is probably going to be your biggest hater if you don't take that personal and take it on you probably do this work if you can't it's not impossible but it's going to make it very difficult you know what I'm saying if you can take it as a truism uh that's how I started though like I started doing on YouTube very very very unsuccessful on both of these platforms and then I started making uh content on on Instagram it wasn't until 2019 the summer that I discovered Tik Tok and me being on Tik Tok for two months everybody was dancing and seeing and doing comedy nobody was talking about social issues yeah once I started talking about social issues I literally went from having I feel like [ __ ] 200 followers to having like 10,000 damn there overnight and at that time like that that number was big for me because I barely had probably like 5,000 6,000 followers on Instagram and I had been on there for five or six years you know what I'm saying so that's that's that's that's that's that's how it started oh that is for you know I didn't know your origin I didn't know your origin story you know by the time I knew you you were already consciously like you you already much bigger than we how did you come up with with consciously in the first place like going by consciously cuz that's excellent that's the most beautiful branding I actually got the name from my uh my uh one of my best friends in my college policy debate partner from East Oakland his I'm his his his uh he was raised by a black panther his grandma um he he started you feel me uh playing with me and throwing a word throwing a name around conscious with me and I felt like I liked it so I took it you know what I'm saying I feel me and uh when I was in college debate I used to rock daiki and Jordans every debate tournament every debate round I love it as a result you feel me I'm 61 61 and a half with locks I'm rocking I got I got a real stigma of being a hotel yeah I can imagine that and it was something that I I used to reject but flirt with cuz I got it you know what I'm saying pay africanist you feel me I do I'm saying I do rock with pay African and black nationalism I don't me wrong I would say a new age I ain't with the misogyny patriarchy transphobia [ __ ] but I get it you know what I'm saying so I started to dabble in the conscious Community yeah you know what I'm saying and I felt like [ __ ] in the conscious Community they went moving consciously you know what I'm saying so my mind is like a play a play on words and uh the uh the uh the eyes of RA I got the wings of Raod tattooed on my arm and it uh it stand for like you know the power and Consciousness so like I was already kind of flirting with it you know what I'm saying I just owned it but when I first started doing social media on like Twitter my first Twitter name was like G Le the great G Le the great is hard but that made my big sister goes by Abby the empress on social media that's what that reminds me of yeah um what was I gonna say it oh for what I I had something in my brain but while age um I had it and then I forgot the minute you said g Le the great I got stuck on not like oh that's popping um oh I was I know I remember I was going to say boom cuz we said g lead to great and talking about the conscious Community what do you think about how do you feel about this effort to like demonize Consciousness like the way people will call you like you know if you Google woke lawyer right now because that's what the post calling me my name comes up and like or and this effort to make it feel like that's innately this bad thing or this disparaging this disparaging thing that people should be like I feel like people expect us to want to run away from that like I should be issuing like oh I'm not a w lawyer or you know I mean I'm not conscious how do you feel about that um you know we talked about Hue P Newton I start all my speeches usually with a little quote he got about power in my mind that th those things are how the alt-right how the conservatives how white supremacy attempts to define the phenomenon and make it act in desire Mana for y that don't know that's what Hue P Newton defines power as the ability to define the phenomenon and make it act in desire manner I think the way that mainstream tries to bastardize Concepts and words that come uniquely from the black community try to make us distance ourselves from it I think it's like a part of the the the the the social fabric of the country and I think that uh the the the the bigger issue for me is when people in our community pick up on those speaking points that trivialize wokeness or Consciousness or you feel me being Progressive and it's like hey y'all are y'all are paing the same speaking points and [ __ ] that come from people that's anti you but you hate people in your community so much you linking up with the white supremacist is I'm almost like you hate people in your community more than you hate white supremacy and that's the reason why we be having beef because it's like a lot of the things they try to say about being woke to you that New York Times said to you I would argue that a lot of people on like Twitter or YouTube try to use that same herish thinking to try to push words especially like being woke you feel me or being conscious you know what I'm saying I can't tell you how many times I've had somebody else try to universalize their particular understanding of Consciousness and it's they perception of me and they don't recognize that I see is just that that's your perception of me it's not the reality of who consciously is or how I'm moving you feel me I recognize the more you push back from it the more folks get mad at it and the more those individuals start to pick up on the speaking points that's made by the white supremist yeah how do you how do you deal with that like with the cuz in the work that we do and the work that you do is centered around helping black people and a love for black people and Community how do you deal with the reality that there are a lot of black people that unwittingly you know don't recognize it but they have internalized a lot of these tenants of white supremacy and they and it's a lot so you end up getting a lot of black people pushing back and fighting you and make in in some ways making you the enemy you know what I mean like you're doing what's wrong and what you're advocating how do you deal with that I I've learned how to compartmentalize the booze in the cheers and I've learned how to make it where my my my production and my my my my hope you feel me and my you know what I'm saying like the [ __ ] I believe in is not fueled by the engagement or the haters or the affirmation um what I know is that uh separate the noise from the sounds and not always try to make it where all of the the criticisms is just I'm saying noise or it's coming from haters you feel me I don't like what content creators can't face the funk when it comes to criticisms and can't really address them because you feel like everybody's criticizing you they all haters so what I've learned how to do is I feel like move with complexity I know how to now discern the noise from the sounds and recognize that I don't need to respond to all the noise you feel me I should be listening for the sounds and also acknowledging that I should never try to uh Gaslight my supporters that's being critical of me I think that I've done a good job of cultivating a community virtually that's not on no [ __ ] [ __ ] it's like if they think that I'm being immoral or unethical I think that I've cultivated an audience that can call me out on it and I'm very receptive to that you know what I'm saying so just being able to decipher you feel me I feel like intentions and like that sound from the noise but that's really how how I learn how to do it and being real I I I I've I've started to tell people around me because you know now I'm getting bigger now where people start to go after sisters and wives and daddies and cousins you know what I'm saying so what I've learned I've taught them and I I I learned it first it's like you let let's not let the haters Define your experience on social media or let's not let strangers perception of you define you so much but I start S get to myself so I've learned to just be like man I don't know you from a can of pain I don't know you you feel me like boy [ __ ] you it's really hard to learn being real like man [ __ ] you I ain't got or or it's like okay that's fine move on like that's how I feel how how did you so that gives me two questions right because the first thing I want to ask is like how do you how did you get to that like when was the time you felt like your community called you out and you or called you in rather and you felt receptive to that like okay they were right and I I maybe need to look at something differently and two in terms of how them coming after your family and people now how do you deal with that cuz that is a a thing I'm I'm myself trying to to navigate and also to anticipate because like I my partner my boyfriend I'm ready to fight if somebody would to say something about my boyfriend on social media I'm telling you one I posted I've really only ever seen one cuz I I only even recently started even posting pictures of my boyfriend and I've been with my boyfriend um and so I only give you know the occasional picture I really don't talk about my relationship because to me once you start talking that's when everybody feel like they could offer some they they'll say you invited it and so no sir so I don't I don't I don't talk at all but I even one time I posted just like a picture of me and my boyfriend we have the cutest Christmas photos I posted one and one of my followers came with like oh my God ol I'm not going to lie this is horrifying or something and I think it's just because like my boyfriend was like his head was above me you know on some of them green lines type [ __ ] like the opposite of that like when acting like and I was like blocked like blocked I'm blocked I blocked them no I blocked them I block for the [ __ ] out of me like like what like so how's that something you deal with because you get a lot of lot of I see people they and they don't and people don't tell the truth that's another thing is like people don't care about the truth they will literally just make [ __ ] up when people don't like you or whatever they will twist it and I see that happen a lot to you when it comes to family perception online so how are you dealing uh man I I feel like I sometimes it bother me most times it don't being real with you um I I know that it's certain people that's inest Ed into discrediting my work I'm a former debat I make a lot of analysis I make a lot of arguments folks ain't good at uh responding to arguments and Analysis they got to make character assassinations they got to attack the debater so for me it's like [ __ ] I I was a I'm a I'm a Hall of Fame College policy debator you feel me from 2010 to 2020 I'm ranked in the top 20 in the decade through the whole country as an individual person and as a pair me and my partner I'm saying rashed Campbell a lot of the ways that people try to comfort me I already dealt with it in a different perspective and sometimes the same perspective at the highest level of competitive policy debate you can think of so for me it's really laughable a lot of times when people try to come with me with these old surface level arguments and surface level jaring about red herrings and this it's like listen man I'm a season policy debated as a Hall of Famer and I also won a national championship as a debate coach yeah I know how to mean what I say and say what I mean and being real with you the first job I had after I graduated college was being a debate coach where I eventually became the director of debate I made a living off of being disagreed with I made a living off of making competing interpretations I made a living off of dealing with folks that's playing with me my name my perspective my framework I made a living off of that you feel me what folks do on Twitter it ain't a lot of difference you know what I'm saying how they did in college policy debate when I was busting their ass in cross-examination so for me it's like now I'm learning how to mitigate the educator and the and and and the debater and you know what I'm saying when I'm ready to let you see George Lee from the west side of Brian Texas now I'm trying to be much more strategic in how I do that because I don't think everybody every everybody don't deserve you feel me my time effort and energy and everybody's downst don't deserve to meet George Lee you feel me you know consciously that's most people know that's what you know you don't know George you know what I'm saying so sometimes though I think it's very important to let George come out and let people know like listen don't get it twisted with the big words and the degrees this that and the other I'm from the same environment that you from so if you going to pop your [ __ ] like that just know you feel me like I'm going to pop my [ __ ] as well and whatever you down with once I'm there I'm going be down with it too and I know I me learning I me learning I got ADHD madebe where now I can be much more mindful of my emotions you feel me I ain't gonna let no I I ain't gonna let my executive dysfunctioning go to the point where I'm just ready to you know what I'm saying crash out how he say in the hood and I know that on social media that's really folks want you clout chasing you want to get some engagement you want to you want to you want to piggy back off of the visibility of they want you to acknowledge them so they can use your name and people going through it or whatever in order to gain traction and when they talk about you if you respond that puts them above the regular haters cuz now they can make it like y'all and them are in a feud of back and forth I realized that that's why let me tell you something when I really can't stand on [ __ ] they talk about me on YouTube they make or whatever hate video they will never have proof that I know about it because I'm not GNA help you gain traffic on your thing and sometimes I'll [ __ ] let me say you if I see you trying to make a hate video about you about being that you've named in a way to like bounce off the algorithm one of my videos you don't know how fast your girl will change the name the the the thumbnail the everything your video will die definely um definitely when was the time you felt like your audience called you in and you were receptive to that like you you went back to the draum board and thought ah I got I got this one wrong I I got I got three different examples I go with the more recent one uh I go I go with the more recent one you feel me and two cuz I'm curious to your perspective cuz I definitely want to be a part of that conversation the recent one is me being able to decipher the haters the red pill blue pill alpha male pan for male validation dudes from the people that's genuinely care about black women and concerned about black women that feel like hey the way they wrot said it happen didn't happen that way you feel me so me being able to be receptive and being like all right I see y' perspective and what y'all what y'all feel like happen you know what I'm saying I'm going off on the media headlines being that this girl made it up completely when you read the article it actually says that it didn't go down the way she said now that's two different things did she make the whole entire thing up or did it not go that way she said it did so me making my video was about you know what I'm saying hey consciously the the police said she made it all up y' ain't read the article I read the article and the article said that [ __ ] she wasn't hit with a brick she was hit with a bottle I think that me being able to be receptive of like hey but you got to but you do got to address that the way she said it happened ain't the way she said it happened even if you don't want to call her a lie you got to address that for me it was like okay I see I I see y concern and I see why y'all you know what I'm saying feeling some type of way about the analysis so I was able to go back and apologize and admit hey two things can be true at the same time she was in fact a hit by a grown ass man with an object but her story wasn't the way she said it was you know what I'm saying she she lied about how it happened but she still was hit though yeah yeah okay beautiful it took it took a lot of it took it took it took it took I feel like [ __ ] about about three 4 days for me to come around to it but you know what I'm saying that's one that's what happened and then [ __ ] when I first started getting big um and Tik Tok you know what I'm saying Tik Tok start become more popular there was this like I I thought it was a a a a trans woman making content just know what I'm saying being a comedian you feel me yeah apparently it was a white dude that that that that that that that that does it was like you know that o goalie [ __ ] it's called ay whatever it's called Ogle it was some platform people was using on on on Tik Tok that make it where me and you on there R people just pop up you just talk to people right he would he would show up you know what I'm saying visit visibly as you know I'm saying a film you know I'm saying as as a woman basically and then he let the dude talk you know I'm saying and then she he he'll bust out you know I'm saying [ __ ] with his deep voice I I I have mean for relationships with trans people with trans women particularly and I know some of them to play like that you know what I'm saying so I laughed you feel me in the comment section but to me that wasn't that wasn't the big big issue right the big big issue was there were like two or three people you know what I'm saying two or three of my trans followers that seen it and there was like in the comment section like damn this really hurt my feelings X Y and Z instead of me taking time to really think about what was going on I jumped into defense mode like what right you know what I'm saying I don't know like almost like because I I'm not fully aware of how I offended you but I'm gonna apologize I see I offend you and I literally said that in you know what I'm saying the [ __ ] so it came disingenuous you know what I'm saying I was able to have some conversations with people around me and I was able to be like all right I see I see if I want to be a public Ally for the trans community need to be able to be called out in any instance you know what I'm saying when I ain't coming when I when I a't pulling my fair share to work or when I'm not meeting up to what I say what I'm doing if I can't take the criticism I'm no I'm no better than the white liberal that jump in his feelings when [ __ ] tell him you ain't doing right oh no don't do that you know what I'm saying so that's really how I was a to do it and then and then [ __ ] the last example was uh and the reason why I care about [ __ ] what's going on you know what I'm saying O over y so much is that two years ago Hamas had attacked you know what I'm saying you Israel or not yeah I made my video about you know what I'm saying the I feel like I made the uh intellectual fallacy a lot of folks was making when they was trying to you know what I'm saying think deeply about shallow [ __ ] I tried to frame Palestinian people as being uniquely citic people yeah so if you cared about anti-Semitism and you didn't care about them I said you were anti-semitic of course the Jewish and Zionist community did not like that at all and I was able to learn and be schooled on the history of anti-Semitism and having a conversation with this uh this uh this black Jewish woman and this anti-zionist you know what I'm saying a Jewish dude you know what I'm saying and Sh we was able to have us a nice little conversation but I think that those are three times is that the craziest take I don't know if that's the craziest take but I don't know I'm not the expert and I feel like I got to go have a separate conversation with Mark like was your initial take like wild no my initial take wasn't like I didn't didn't like crazy like like no like conspiracy theories about the economy what saying like the argument of itself itself doesn't seem that that that crazy to me but I'm also not the expert on these issues to me be I'll be honest with I'll be honest with you seeing what's going on now now I'm well like now I'm more well versed I would say that I still stand on the apology because I acknowledge that it was empirically false the word the the the word anti-Semitism was uniquely made and manufactured in opposition to the Jewish identity not everybody that's you know what I'm saying submited like I did the research I had the conversation right I do think as well though the way that that conversation folded and made it where Palestinian where if her identity was not on a thing and I had to literally only talk about anti-Semitism to prove my anti-semitic I think that I I would say now that it's definitely a part of the Zionist move to make it where you can never ever think about criticizing the state of Israel you know what I'm saying yeah I think that two things can be true at the same time though I was false I made a false claim a false analysis about anti-Semitism and you feel me I was pigon hold into uh islamophobia in my mind you feel me cuz I like like like I was basically like I make sure people don't think I'm anti-semitic [ __ ] you pales it's Dam that what I did you know what I'm saying and and you know and and that's real right because when I when October 7th happened I wanted to do uh an oay in Fr I ended up put another video about Palestine and but that was GST advice everybody was like no that XYZ this is and the next thing like in particular black people because there were some harsh consequences um how did you decide that you would speak on it anyway we start this conversation talking about Hue P Newton you know what I'm saying I do like my like I feel like when I was 17 years old one of my home boys one of my best friends named Stacy he told me hey George Lee you got to be a man of principle and not pressure you feel me meaning you going to always stand on pressure and always stand on principle and never fall under pressure for me on principle I'm a type of dude that's about purpose of a popularity you see what I'm saying like yeah I'm like like like I I'm I'm I'm cool with being the bad guy as long as I think I'm on the right side of morals and ethics you know what I'm saying and I already had made my mind up that because I'm going move unapologetically in this space it's going to be certain opportunities and resources that I'm not going to get because you got me [ __ ] up you know what I'm saying free Palestine you know what I'm saying all power to the people all you know what I mean so it's like for me it was like [ __ ] it is what it is you know what I'm saying it is what it is and for me it was like you can't say you well versed and you care about oppressed people out the world if you going to allow for the missed opportunities or resources of being a content creator making what you Sil on this genocide so for me it was like in the same year I was able to make history in my hood ain't nobody I I I have to look it up but I know for show for show black people ain't no black folks from Brian Texas getting invited to the White House yeah so in the same year I got invited to the White House for using my platform talking about you know what I'm saying voting against Trump and making sure we ditch that and the other is the same the same year I lost White House clearance and and and and all type of different opportunities because hey you know what I'm saying [ __ ] hey you anti-semitic or hey you you anti-israel you know what I'm saying at this point it's like [ __ ] like it is what it is man free Palestine and I'm cool with whatever consequences you give me as a [ __ ] I think you already give it to me anyway so for me it's like I can identify like Hey listen uh George Floyd was no [ __ ] content creator right you know what I'm saying Amar Au didn't have no following you know what I'm saying them folks y'all killing over there in Gaza and West Bank and Lebanon they ain't got no following no [ __ ] like that so for me it's like y'all kill people for any reason anyway right I'm not going to make it where if I do X Y and Z the fear of what potentially could happen G to stop me like no I I I grew up in debate one of the first literature bases I fell in love with was whiteness but the one that took my debate career to the next level was afro pessimism and at heart I'm really an afro pessimist so it's like [ __ ] man like I'm I'm I'm cool like it is what it is I I know you go you always go up for afro pessimism so there's no way we're going to have interview and you don't Define that for the people see afro pessimism is a literature base about how the world is situated upon uh black suffering you feel me uh afro pessimists contend that the uh Middle Passage was they use a fancy ass word you know what I'm saying ontological death it really just mean the origin of your being they argument is that these the Middle Passage created a whole new being of what it means to be black what they make saying distinction they make we talking about the Jewish identity they talk about the way that an Blackness renders black people separate from their flesh and we become a black body and not human the afro pessimist say you know I'm saying the end this rant that Jews went into the Holocaust as Jew and left as Jew the worst of the world didn't buy in to the ways that the Nazis viewed them in terms of them being captive anti-blackness and afro pessimist contend the African got on the boat as African and got off the boat as black as slave the entire world bought into viewing the black body the way the slave master did whether you had means to own a Slave or you did not own means or you not have the means to own a slave and then it's like [ __ ] structures afro pessimism is about seeing the world as it is structured and recognizeing we can reform it up we can we can we can we can we can we can pray it up we can do X Y and Z afro pessimist contend that the structure of anti-blackness is where we got to get at and everything else is just you know uh uh uh little bitty ways to try to treat the symptoms but anti-blackness is structal how do you how do you get exposed to afro pessimism and how does it inform the work that you do uh afro pessimism came I came across afro pessimism uh first from uh Fernando and Ben cson they they used to be Debaters at uh at a talson university shout out to my people in Baltimore East Baltimore West Baltimore they really had introduced it I feel like to the debate to the debate Community you know what I'm saying but that was the first people I see really just do it and then uh it's these [ __ ] that went to Bronx law that was one year younger than me too but it was their name was deir and Miguel the these was these was like these was like the first time in my debate career I seen like some like some freshman especially they talk about like race come on the scene and just murder [ __ ] and they did it with afro pessimism so once you know like competition all competition is breed copycat you know what I'm saying once somebody win once once Phil Jackson and Jordan start winning with the triangle everybody want to do the triangle so [ __ ] you I start winning with it in order for me to beat y I got to understand what's going on but also too it went that many of us so I picked it up then but afro pessimism and form my work now about how I'm really able to parch through a lot of the nonsense and [ __ ] a lot of people will try to try to try try to conflate consciously with a Derek Jackson yeah you know what I'm saying or or or being the opposite of a Kevin Samuels or you know what I'm saying Andrew Tate afro pessimism give me the way to make structural analysis and show people that the way you lost in the sauce of individuality or interpersonal [ __ ] it don't really matter like that my my when it comes to my politics and my analysis I'm not I'm not telling you about no relationships or uh marriage expert or you know what I'm saying [ __ ] it informs my work by being able to make these analysis by talking about impacts and by being able to Center blackness in black people so if I talk about trans people I'm talking about black Trans people talking about disabled black disabled you feel me poor black poor I don't wrong everything else that matters and exists too but I'm starting from the framework of black and that's how afro pessimism you know what I'm saying informs that [ __ ] how have you reconciled I can imagine you have a huge audience conscious and like you said there are a lot of people a lot of black people and probably black men that perceive you as a hotap or think that you're gonna speak to or a a more traditional um kind of philosophy versus you are a core Ally of the black the LGBT uh Q community in general but specifically the black the black lgbtq uh community and you are always and for women and you always speaking out on those things and bringing that and you get a lot of ey for it how do you how do you reconcile that both those communities and representing those different things and deal with like having people that expect you cuz our audiences expect us to speak to what they believe right like not so much like even though they say they follow you because they want to learn from you and blah blah blah until they disagree with you or you say something that uniquely goes against their worldview or what idea they've made for you so how do you deal with that to be honest with you I'm still working through it like it it it still blows my mind that the same people that will affirm the research and the analysis and the VAC when I'm talking about white supremacy and antiblackness it be the same people that literally try to be anti-intellectual when I start applying the same analysis and research and you know what I'm saying vernacular they talking about sexism or heteronormativity I'm able to deal with it by feeling like [ __ ] right is right and wrong is wrong and it's being like when it come down to it I'm really a debater I don't think I'm going lose a debate on it and I feel like that's how I'm able to hang my hat on to it and it's just like it is what it is if some of us ain't free then none of us ain't free I think that a lot of people that oppose me they lost in the sauce of Plantation Patriot they want to be like the slave master they want to emulate and perform their masculinity the same way you know what I'm saying the slave master did and as a result they only view black people through the lens of productivity meaning that they feel you unproductive you're not value you you know also thought thought that the goddamn slave master I'm trying I'm so wor I'm talking FY I'm trying to slow down I'm trying to slow down I'm trying to I'm so I'm so wored what I'll say is these days I be asking the question of where are the red pill blue pill uh uh podcast bro Patriarchs when the white supremist in my comment section saying I only make content about racing I only make content about being a victim I only make content being a race Hustler I be worrying thinking like damn where the hell y'all at when y'all when these when these videos come out and these folks in the comment section cuz y'all claim I only make videos about sexism and feminism according to y'all the only reason why I have a platform is because I Pander and sip the women whole time it's like hey it's like that that is a picture of of me as a YouTube black content creator class of 2022 you think them white folks reached out to me because I was pandering come on man it's like it's like it's like it's like when I'm nominated for NAACP image Awards you think that that organization with all it pretige reached out to me because I'm pandering to black women right to me to me it becomes off as being disingenuous and it come off as like [ __ ] y'all transactable y'all y'all y'all is y'all so transaction with women y'all feel like all dudes is y'all quit proor y'all the type of dude say if you buy a woman a drink at at at the bar you got to chase her around because you she she owe you something y'all feel like because I'm talking about gender equity and gender progression that I want something to return so as a result it make it where when straight men you feel me want to talk about progression and gender Equity you got to worry about the the the the the the the the the accusations of pandering and to me it's like okay do you care more about your ego or you care about the livelihood of women and it's ego it's it's the former it's and for me it's like [ __ ] I'm willing to I'm willing to not allow for my ego to structure how I respond to dudes and and and how I respond to my work you know what I'm saying I'm not going to be egotistical to the point where I think that my masculinity being questioned is more important than me using my platform my voice my my my intellect to be able to speak truth to power about gender violence and what it come down to is [ __ ] be mad like you you feel like I'm dishonoring my black masculinity because I'm not saying [ __ ] these hoes [ __ ] these [ __ ] know your place that's really what I think right and and dead ass and and dead ass I I feel like I get so much of this too like every time these people who will follow you and they and they Champion you when you are speaking squarely for the black s straight person you know what I mean like and and only them and the minute anything beyond that they start saying things that are just patently false like people will literally be in my comments saying things like oh black Trans be you don't need to say anything for people or whatever they're not doing nothing for you or or gay people they're not standing with us and I'm just like you know what's crazy I am a person it's funny to me right like you'll have or they'll be like we don't have time for this or we don't have the capacity to do for this we need to worry about us and it it's always people who in no way do this work like they're black they don't do any work they're not Advocates they're not doing any they're in no way working towards any Collective good of any kind they have no idea what like what that actually looks like on the ground Who's involved who's doing work because I'm like in real life I know nothing but black wh people doing doing advoc like like more than I know black straight people doing it oh God if you're being real you keeping it a stack and it's just like me me making those claims in public that that is what they indict as pandarin or simping you feel me if there if there is any type of empirical truth that you can present that disavows how M masculinity is constructed then you sing and you pandering even almost in the video I'm about to get ready to drop it's like [ __ ] I literally make the point like it's like y'all Define simping and pandering as a man acknowledging the human decency of a woman and saying maybe sexual objectification is wrong simping pan like all right bro whatever my [ __ ] instantly inant homm man homm homophobia it's funny because I feel like on on on the end of black men that's what they do right you simping you Pander and you this right or blah blah blah um but then as a black woman every time every time I open my mouth is yo you angry you hate black men you know you're not going to I know you single I know you sing the way they scream that in the comments I literally was just read like I was actually just reading another let me just show the kind of things a comment my boyfriend saying funny enough this this person said on my Eric Adams interview black man boo embarrassing Ali meurin you are a disgrace there is a time and place for everything she's just a hoty prideful bitter nose in the air think her [ __ ] don't stink man-hating argumentative woman probably single guess that's why she's a lawyer just probably single guess that's why she's a lawyer she just used her fast loud talking points to gain attention and she thinks she did something did it solve anything no did it get people talking yes of course it did mission accomp accomplished perpetuating the same stereotype as the Angry Black bitter woman and I know she don't have a man who would want to put up with that meanwhile my man in the house with the with the pom boms like I'm being derogatory i' I've come now to see all type of comments like that like when they say it to me it's like I feel like you dick pulling right now like in my mind you coming off it's like you are being almost like you you you you you you jealous is you jealous that my wife get my time and my attention you want something in my mind like I want to be like damn you acting like you want to come over here and do something to me you know what I'm saying like trying to rub my ass or something eat my ass or something move around around move around my mind like why why did you need to say I don't have a man four five times in this tweet do you want my man that's what it sound like right now you want my man it's like it's crazy or they just like they just it's it's it's really to me it can be incredibly painful I don't care about what white supremacist and racist and white people say in general like I don't care what non black people have to say about anything I don't care like that's fine feel good bad whatever I expect there're whatever they're going to be on but there is something so disheartening about feeling like you're like because it makes you feel like you're taking licks from all sides like obviously white people not by every The Establishment the majority is against you and then you have your community kicking your back in and and and pedling the same stereotypes white supremacist what at you like this idea I'm an angry black woman single angry black woman woman who hates black men and all this [ __ ] and it just be like and it's funny because like you said to your earlier why aren't the why where are these people who say you only make comment content about women and LGBT saying when when these white supremacists is are saying this because not for nothing the white supremacist saying all I care about is black men black men criminals and I only want the black man criminal there's a group of black women on the internet that hate on me and say I I I hate women all I care about is black male criminals and this and next thing meanwhile it's black men saying I hate black men I be like which which is that I'm constantly getting criticized for saying that I coddle the black man and and all I care about is the criminal and then there's a whole group of people saying oh I'm anti I'm like could y'all speak with each other y talk and pick a narrative what hey when I talk about women's issues I'm trying to get some cat and that's what I'm looking for talk about the LGBT community I'm down low and I'm closeted oh yeah some call me trans to day you know what I'm saying or or it's like hey you never disagree with women you never push back on women this that together whole time having whole ass conversation losing all type of followers because I said cisgender is not a slur and transform women so it's almost like you it's like it's like to me just come up as being like disingenuous and you don't realize but like the algorithm telling on you it's telling me that you have a very resentful cathartic relationship to the content you consume and the algorithm know that [ __ ] too that's the reason why I make I make my my all my [ __ ] is intersectional and interdisciplinary you only coming across the the the content that's us in the feminist analysis about gender this says more about you than it says about me right I I make I I literally was in the Rolling Stone Al jaer Mother Jones CNN for talking about Palestine and being one of the content creators that was invited to the White House that's now being critical on Biden because of Palestine those same people that's like literally I'm talking about you you are politically ill you you are politically illiterate you lack the ability to read and write situations about politics those folks to be like consciously is a Fed consciously is a agent consciously works for the government whole time the government got me excavated like talking about to your point it's like I'm getting it on all sides but I've learned like in debate it was like the debate for me you feel me like so I kind normalized and when I was in college debate I had to debate against Harvard I had to debate against where the [ __ ] was at at Townson the next tournament next round might be against some trans women at Idaho State the next debate might be and I feel like that's how it's just like [ __ ] it is what it is and going back to the other question you asked this how afro pessimism informs my work I know that antiblackness manifests itself in many different ways and I think that I have a I I have a good understanding of the literature and and I feel like a good range to be able to talk about and think about how the way that people know I'm saying had this Victory all towards black Trans women that's anti-blackness the way that black men respond to me and how I advocate for black women that's anti-blackness you know what I'm saying just like it make it where antiblackness the world is anti-black I would never sit my black ass in the house and cry because the world is antiblack hey dogs bark and 2 plus two is 42 these are all truisms I'm not going to sit around and cry about truisms you feel me so for me the world is anti-black I would never be surprised when a dog BK that what it's their nature they BK the world is nature is anti-black so you feel me I think it to me I think it' be dumb for me to believe that people in an anti-black world gonna be immune from anti-blackness or me thinking I'm going to be immune for antiblack and live in an antiblack world that's how I'm able to resolve it we all anti-black the question is do you know how anti black are you you know I'm saying you are or and next question is what are you willing to do about it that's how that's how I sit away with the [ __ ] it's like you know what I mean that's how I know I really I I can't wait till one of these Half Baked no reading ass Negroes come to me and I can really show them then I can better tell them I'm can't wait to like hey you can pick when I speak first and last you can even configurate the topic I got all the money on me I'mma intellectually bust your ass and have whoever State you in going to be looking for me because they feel like I intellectually assaulted your ass because you a you could do nothing with me you know that that actually makes all the sense in the world why you say education is elevation I think less people are realizing why that you're an educator tell the people conscious I got a master's degree in adult and higher education I have a master's degree in human relations I have a master's graduate certificate in human diversity and development I have another graduate certificate in women and gender studies I have a total of five pieces of paper you feel me for some reason a lot of people like to play with me and my expertise and belie believe a Google search amount to The Blood Sweat and Tears out and put in doing this [ __ ] or that them being able to uh Mass a couple likes or a couple hearts on a tweet that all of a sudden it negates the research your personal experience don't negate these patterns baby it's because you didn't experience post brutality don't mean that [ __ ] it's because you didn't experience it's like that's what no yeah yeah you're absolutely correct what do you have what do you what does your year look like conscious what do you have the works also oh while I have you I have to say I have I don't think I've had an opportunity to congratulate you on your podcast with Franchesca yeah you got to tell the people about your podcast yes yes yes hey black history for real it's a a podcast that's on wondery and uh through Amazon um the people have been doing real real real real nice to me um right now the uh black history for real is a top 20 well last time I check was a top 20 ranked History Podcast across all podcast platforms it's a scripted podcast with me and the great uh Franchesca Ramsey and we really just get into the movers and shakers of history and talk about black history you probably Ain know about you know what I'm saying um the first series was about uh the women of the Black Panther Party aad Shakur AI Shakur Kathleen Cleaver and and Elaine Brown you know what I'm saying which I let I say that you seen that [ __ ] about Elaine Brown them boys tried to play with me about that elain Brown being asent oh man I made I made a video advertising and promoting the series and talking about Elaine Brown being the first black woman to be you know what I'm saying the leader of you the first one to be oh I did see this when they was trying to call her a op so I got it called an OP because apparently conscious Lee always get calls out for leaving stuff out he didn't say this like in this video I'm telling you to go watch a scripted podcast that's based off of research in ela's brown own accountants where I have an in-depth conversation uniquely with her relationship that she had with this informant yeah me and Francesca even had a conversation whether or not we thought she was informed or not but y'all think I left it out the way I people be pissing me the [ __ ] off when you make a whole long form content and they don't watch it and start jumping down your [ __ ] throat for what they think it says or doesn't say son son yeah like but like but like just people going to be willingly ignorant and what I know is like it's certain [ __ ] that's irrational you know what I'm saying and Papa said [ __ ] Li George you run your ass crazy trying to make some [ __ ] rational that's irrational I ain't got time for it it's irrational I'm I'mma leave it at that I ain't going to try to make sense of it it's it doesn't make any sense but I love the podcast and I love um I how did how did that get started you and francheska such a beautiful pairing I don't know who chose that but that was right be honest with you the uh the people at Amazon and wonder reached out to us you know what I'm saying we had like some little some some some some some little testings and [ __ ] you know the I think that because me and her were mutuals already we was familiar with each other content and and and I've learned too you feel me us being in our love pseudo signs we both Sagittariuses you know what I'm saying I feel like that that that that Sagittarius energy us both we get each it work it work and I think the contrast I'm a country ass you know what I'm saying like very rugged around the way in certain instances and [ __ ] Franchesca is much more you feel me proper much much more fluent background like the contrast in my mind and make it where we account for so much [ __ ] and it's so dope and it is so dope I like listen I love I love to see it and I I saw you and Francesca put up your cute little video dancing which makes me um want to talk about that positive light aspect of your platform right because you don't just give people uh news and education that you also give people like let's dance I try to dance I try to bust jokes in my mind I try to make it where I don't never want nobody to Pigeon ho hold me into always being something you know what I'm saying I'm impulsive and you know what I mean I'm multifaceted I like the dance and smile Kik too so I feel like when you in my mind I'm cultivating the Channel all my all my platforms and channels you would get burnt out on the channel if it's always about oppression and violence and crazy [ __ ] you know what I'm saying and I would get burnt out on it sometimes I really don't want to think about it I want to just dance and for me I think it's important that black men especially straight sender black men are seen in public spaces having enjoying ourselves and not having to worry about judgment the way we enjoy ourselves you know what I'm saying and that's what I'll be thinking of but also it's like [ __ ] that's what I like to do what was what was a moment in the work that you've been doing across your career where you f i feel like you get a few moments where you feel like oh I'm doing something meaningful this has impact when was that man one time that really come to mind is when I was uh in Norman Oklahoma as a professor and uh the Julius Jones Foundation reached out to me and I ended up actually being already cool with one of his people that's like his I'm saying his best friend uh people that don't know Julius Jones is a black man that was wrongly wrongfully convicted for you know what I'm saying murder in Oklahoma City and um [ __ ] he was on death rad um me me me being able to be a part of that and how how emotional and how how how much they you know what I'm saying told me how much they I'm saying preacher how was able to contribute it made me realize like damn outside of like the accolades and [ __ ] like this the reason one of the reason why I built this platform is to be able to give breath and air to stories that should be you know what I'm saying and it made me feel good that I was able to be a part of something that literally saved somebody's life people that don't know the governor Kevin stit didn't call off the you know what I'm saying the the the execution literally until like hours as a matter of fact if you go to my Tik Tok you probably can see do videos in in in in in their bathroom still I'm I'm I'm I'm holding back emotions right now cuz it really take me there I was crying booh cuz I was thinking like they kill this man I don't know how I'm going to respond because it was like [ __ ] we got all the evidence we got all this that and the other it was like that was the first time I realized like man I'm doing something good I'm doing something that is contributing to the materiality of folks and it's not just symbolic you feel me when I was able to talk to Julius J on the phone he was able to like hey bro I appreciate W like you know what I'm saying was it was it was it was it was it was different you know what I'm saying and then sh just like doing that when I started having different political organizations reach out to me like hey I know you ain't around here but we got this candidate up here you ain't even got to endorse no Democrat [ __ ] because we know that ain't you but would you put us a little hit piece together on this Republican like sh anyway hell yeah you know what I'm saying that and then really the thing that the thing that took me there that's more like symbolic you know what I'm saying is is is is during the pandemic the same weekend the first time I got invited to the BET Awards to to do like my podcast I the on like the on red carpet Wayne Brady had hit me up on Tik Tok and he had hit me up like four five months before I even seen this [ __ ] so I'm hitting rain Brady like months later like hey bro just seeing this long story short me and Wayne Brady exchang numbers bro invite me out to his house you know what I'm saying with his partner I'm I'm out Mal with the Mansion you know what I'm saying for me it's like growing up in Texas and when you try to think about this world that we in right now growing up down here it's like I used to feel like I have to be in in LA or New York to be able to get any type of not this that and the other so the fact that I've never lived there before and I was able to be in La go from the BET Awards to Wayne bird's house was like all right y your your work is not only impacting the livelihood of people it's also reaching people that you didn't even dream of and and and like [ __ ] they they really think you something and you are something you really really are something conscious like of of there a lot of people in this space but you are you listen you you've been my friend since I don't even remember when we first connected I really genely don't even remember like the first time I came to New York I was like hey where you at you was [ __ ] it was like we already knew each other yeah come to the crib like I'm like no was we locked in yeah no there really are some people in these spaces that I'm like no no no that's my brother like you say something like someone say something about you instant instant block banish I won't be a part of that like that's my boy I'm saying wait with that we ain't going for no OA we ain't going for no OA slander over here goam take you take that trauma binding [ __ ] with the suckers you trying to trauma bind with somewhere else I'm like over there I'm like not my brother I'm like trying to recruit the I I hate consciously I ho a click you trying to you trying you trying to build a click off of hat to me you got feeling real good right now man goddamn I don't know about you you got to appreciate and celebrate the people in the space that like are really about what they say they're about you know what I mean like who who really are that and you're not just that online but like in real life like you are somebody I'm like sometimes I like I never take for granted that my friends and the people I could bring on o and friends and I could do stuff with are people that are in high demand themselves like these are busy [ __ ] with their own huge platforms and stuff when I say hey ques come be on land for an man come on come on right quick let's talk about this or whatever I I I I ain't doing nothing I'm free yeah yeah we can do it man we can do it I think I think that it's important that people in our space Network in way where we trying to create relationships with people that you know what I'm saying is around what we doing you know what I mean and not always try to you know latch on to people that's already been in the industry for hell long as our girl EA Ray as we put it full circle thinking about it I was thinking about it I was thinking about build with who's with us not trying to just try to jump up here like build with the team we got and and we create great things when we do that right like and it shows how many of us there are I think like what I the part I love the most about us all collaborating together is we're all always being gaslit that there is no not only that there's no space for any of us that there can only be one but we're always being we're simultaneously told that there can only be one and also that there's a scarcity that they can't find anybody to fill that one right and it's like that's crazy cuz I know nothing but I know I know 200 people right now I said right now I can find six different Negroes for every episode like right now but I think that when the first time I ever dealt with the entire internet dumping on my ass you know I got a platform on every I got I got got a platform on every platform yeah first time I really dealt with it is when the entire internet decided they wanted to trivialize what Roose said she been through you know what I'm saying the episode that y'all did was if y' ain't check this [ __ ] out y'all better go check it out they got some rich Nuance you know what I'm saying points in there and you know what I'm saying a lot of y'all is really running with narratives that ain't really true you know what I'm saying but the first time I dealt with being dumped on I'm talking about every app I opened consciously pandering brick lady consciously black feminist can't that was the first time I thought like damn these folks hate me so much maybe I should get this [ __ ] up and maybe I go back this that and the other and that's what they want me to do so I don't want to do it but damn these people are so loud about hating me are they Justified is this the perception that everybody has of me I think that for me like I'm not the most I'm not religious at all but I feel like I'm you know what I'm saying conscious and spiritual I feel like I'm blessed and highly favored and in my mind that was the ancestors you feel me really G cheing my ass and giving me a reality check cuz start it's real easy to start drinking your own Kool-Aid start chucking your own horn was able to bring me out of you feel me uh having anxiety or being a little depressed or being like God damn with these folks just that and the other is when I got to really go out in the world like I was booked and busy all February when I was able to go to University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa I'm walking down that little strip a [ __ ] seen me [ __ ] almost dropped his beard oh my God conscious it's like and it's a black man so for me it's like hey don't allow for the suckers on the internet to Define how you think all black men all black men relate to you cuz it's not true there are a lot of black men that love and [ __ ] with you and going to different I went to Colorado University I went to I went to like 12 different cities in February and all the people that came to the event was there to to to to give me my flowers in and tell me they value my work yeah yeah let let me tell you some what was some lifechanging [ __ ] for me and I feel like I I always feel like I got to impart this with everybody I gave the staff to too right I think we people don't appreciate what a disadvantage we are at as people who have whether or not you consider as public figures especially as as the bigger it gets or whatever where they see you as a celebrity or see you as visible what they don't appreciate is we're not like rappers who have concerts with all our fans and we get to see all our fans and realize blah blah I'm like you see in the numbers we're not there we built these followings from our homes with the same lies and friends we don't see those people so we can't appreciate truly all these people who [ __ ] with us and you don't ha the the love is not what's most vocal online hate is what's vocal online right and if you're us right like like in my case I started my platform started coming to be in 2020 like in the pandemic I'm living in my basement apartment I'm building this whatever I don't see nobody I have the same friends and life that I I have so if you're getting internet and and also too the bigger because you never see those people you never see those numbers the bigger numbers you reach the less you can appreciate like the Lesser number you know what I me even if they're huge numbers right and so what really made me realize that I feel like on the rare occasion I step out my house like I'm in New York City where I New York City is there are 10 million people in this city and many of them are famous and people whatever love so I'm never in my life do I ever expect like anybody to know me and I never leave my house now and people aren't like Army and but what really made me realize appreciate like finally come to realize just how much people we reach and talk to was last year when I went to Beyonce's concert when I went to Renaissance right listen to me I want you to understand as much as I love Beyonce I didn't take in I did not see that concert the entire concert I was staring at the crowd I could not every time the light would flash and that c I could not comprehend how many [ __ ] people that was in real life and I googled it right I'm like Google there are 60,000 people in this Stadium right and I'm looking at how many [ __ ] people 60,000 is I'm like there's no way to do something saying something whatever this this many [ __ ] people and it not have this is massive a reverberating fact and then I think about I'm like I have more than double that amount of followers on Twitter on one platform like I don't consider that I get 60,000 views on a video essay and I feel like I have a flop you know what I mean like I'm like I'm not appreciating like dead ass I swear to you dead ass and I'm like I have to like I swear to God I always have to like try to remind myself at that moment like remember how many [ __ ] people that is like yeah yeah make think too the the during the pandemic when the pandemic happened I already had like 300,000 followers on Tik Tok but I was able to hit to the million Mark in that the first time I stepped out during the pandemic me and my wife went to New Orleans for our anniversary um I'm a country [ __ ] from from I ain't I'm from smile you know what I mean I never dreamed of going to cities that I seen growing up and people being like consciously so the first time I stepped out in outside like man I'm in New Orleans I'm being spotted by like I'm talking about man the first person I got spotted by was this this this uh this uh this young gay man obviously with this old white trick man he made he made his white trick take pictures of it this that this that the other then I run into this group of women they they talking about they I'm taking pictures then I ran into this group of like I'm talking about like some real New Orleans [ __ ] I'm talking about you know you know and it was just like this is crazy and then when I met when when I got there to meet you in person I'm I'm I was there because I got to do partnership with is's company for my little short film the last scene that we doing is in Harlem it's this dude that came outside tripping with the staff because he mad because we in front of the sto you feel me hey this black woman came and when I say cleared that [ __ ] out two things happened at the same time this black woman came you know who that is right there that's consciously all these [ __ ] come here don't do [ __ ] for us you say nothing to them he actually do [ __ ] for us I'm talking about it went off you feel me then so much the [ __ ] said I don't even live here then the girl went off you more you don't even live here woo at that same time while the camera rolling I post my social media this dude that I found out now he like he modeling [ __ ] he walking down walking down the street he see me but he played cool he turned around he consciously I'm talking about the call and I was like man I've never been in New York City in my life this my first time here and they know you and y'all know me little old me it was like it's to be honest with you it's something I'm still getting used to like when I go out in Houston people see me in Houston it's like you know what I mean depending like you know what I'm saying I'm still getting used to it's something that it's something that I you know what I mean I feel like take getting used to and I and and and I and I get that and I feel that but I'm like we need to we need to remember to have those moments like sometimes I was L just saying I wish we went out more as funny because we're all the kind of people it's funny people on the internet will make you out to be like you're a clo Chaser you want to be visible you want to be this but I'm like well all of us are the most reclusive ass [ __ ] I know like all of us like literally every just reclus and I'm like if we went out more I think we would be able to like really really appreciate just how much like good we're doing and how many people really really [ __ ] with us and feel the the positive like someone told me I I put I don't remember which one of my friends was I had on an episode with you and they were like ah I was Fang Girling on the quiet like a I love it like you know what I mean so it's I just wanted to my he I feel like all right bro be be be be regular bro don't act don't act weird you know what I'm saying this that that's what Maris said about Mark lont Hill on on the last episode he was like I was in there like Marill told me he was GNA be there but when I got there I still was like I'm talking about doing the internal work like all right act act regular don't don't don't don't do cuz for me him uniquely Mark L my Hill came to University of Oklahoma to speak at the George McLaren it's a conference in Oklahoma that's named after the first black student to be accepted into the university yeah I think that I was school so I'm going say it's like 2015 2014 um Mark lont Hill had came to University of Oklahoma and he did his [ __ ] thing you know what I'm saying yeah you know people in com people that was in the stand hating on him like oh he did this I went I seen him up here but to me it was like it was inspiring it was empowering I found out how much he got paid I was like damn best F he got paid for that too but I already knew who he was I never forget this I'm still George Le the great on Twitter I reached out to him and I asked him a question like hey if I was trying to be like a public intellectual like you like what advice you give me his response to me was you got to do the work do do the work and this that and the other this was like this was 10 years ago you know what I'm saying so for me it was like I'm sure Mark lont Dr Hill speak to Hell [ __ ] on there I'm saying remember that I don't think he remember that you know what I'm saying but it's like [ __ ] it stuck with me though you know what I'm saying and for me it was like Mark Mark lont Hill and Michael Eric Dyson was the first two [ __ ] in Academia that I can identifi with that came from where I come from you know what I'm saying that I felt like you didn't experience sleep for dinner or you didn't came from the mud and you didn't you feel me them two people was the first people that really made me feel like I can be in Academia and I can be in education and I don't got to sound like them I can sound like me so me seeing marking my head was like damn yeah um you know what I'm saying and I knew it too because it was like [ __ ] when you send me the little Clips I'm seeing myself as I'm talking and I'm thinking about what I was thinking about I'm thinking like damn every time I made a point I'm looking at markk like is he [ __ ] with that is he [ __ ] with he disagree so it was some [ __ ] man you know what's funny Mar Maris said I had I love Maris was in the red box in our last episode for those who ain't seen it Maris all Maris friends were like tagging him I seen the tag like oh my God you want only friend and I was like have did I create something that people people will congratulate you for being on like the I was like bed by that it's a big deal I told you my my homeboy dammo he did his little research and found that for most most YouTubers to hit the 100,000 subscribers Mark yeah you have to have at least a thousand videos that's like one of the things that's very consistent you have like 60,000 subscribers and you got less than 75 videos yeah me thinking about the uniqueness in your engagement specifically on YouTube and is the number speaks for themselves thank you thank you know I really felt like listen I have been doing every that I do is for black people like that is my I tell people every time you ask you from go if you go back to my first appearance whether it be mainstream Independent Media I say it's for black people for black people I talk about everything everything is from a a black lens like uniquely directly like not made to be white gays like oing friends is a black show all black people we talk about everything from the lens of how it affects the black community right and yet by the virt by virtue of like being an attorney starting out in that space you know what I mean as a lawyer blah blah blah being on mainstream news it's like I've always had this really really large white audience and black people were not aware of me in the same way like I have a I obviously have black people in my audience but there's overwhelmingly white audience you know um but I've and and it really made me feel good I feel like I've been actively trying to okay I need to build on Instagram I need to build in the places where black people are and I feel like when this Eric Adams interview came out and my oay and friends coming out that same weekend and people black people I finally have the black audience it it really kind of confirmed for me yep I've been making black ass content the whole time we just needed the black eyes on like to see black people discover o and friends and they're like I love this this 90ss this I'm like yeah I created that that's I love it yeah definitely and and to me every time a major celebrity get into one of my mutuals I always think about how the world is changing so much and about how a lot of us have proliferated on social media and now we have the same capital and visibility of you know I'm saying some of the I'm saying some of the biggest stars it's a double Ed sword you feel me it's good and it's bad and it's got some pros and it's got some cons but it make me think about like sh we got to build together and about how like hey man like I ain't trying to cost no [ __ ] but listen two two two people that actually Ops both of them then found their ways into having personal beefs with like people on Tik Tok yeah Hardy B and Nicki Minaj for me when that happened as a content creator some people that like Dam you [ __ ] with the mutual like why is you know what I'm saying and me think like media literacy is something that doesn't just because you've been in media don't mean you got media literacy yeah and like you know uh all all followings ain't created equal I I I I I say it that I say that no that's real that's real that like that is very real
