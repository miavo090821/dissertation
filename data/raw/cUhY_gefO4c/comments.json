    "text": "This reminds me of the missing indigenous girls and women in Canada. So many of their killers could have been caught quickly, but the police were and still are so racist that they dismissed their families for not speaking their colonial language of English and the centuries of dehumanisation of the indigenous people by them. And that actually is what caused those serial killers to dehumanise those indigenous women by kidnapping them, raping them and killing them, because it started with ordinary people dehumanising them to justify the violence they would make them endure centuries ago",

It's something like the person had to kill 3 people with a cooling off period of less than three weeks, but there has to be some time in between victims; otherwise they're a spree killer and not a serial killer. Then I saw cops and news calling people serial killers when they were obviously spree killers or double m**derers, and I was quite confused, but now, thinking of it in terms of copaganda, it makes more sense - more serial killers equals more value to have police about, so that equals more money and status for cops.",

Sometimes the political and social climate drain police resources, which can prevent proper investigations. Such as DC in the 70s with mass arrests and protests.\nIf this is meant to be a \"gotchya\" then its absolutely piss poor. Because if you actually read more about true crime cases outside a few notable ones in the mainstream, you'd have a more nuanced opinion. For every poorly handled investigation there is a thorough one.\nColin Pitchfork, Aileen Wuornos, Jerry Watson, John Bittrolff. All examples of efficiently investigated cases. To simply rule out all police as useless is to ignore the good ones that brought people to justice and families closure.",

Because they won’t “snitch” on each other, they end up in a death cycle. Shooting one another to punish a prior shooting. And we’ve seen what happened when the cops stopped back to Alli community organisers to fix it. An 8 year gang war in metro Atlanta. Pretty sure that’s what happened in Chicago and Florida too. All 3 only quietened when the law swung in with RICOs. There’s entire disciplines devoted to the study of the criminal mind and how to pre-cog them.

Especially since some people are much more easily dehumanized than others, which can lead to those in marginalized groups receiving much harsher sentences, being convicted for crimes they didn't commit. It also can lead to people in more privileged groups getting off with light sentences or even getting away with the very same crimes.

Recognizing a rapists humanity is NOT saying that we should just forgive that man/person and let them back into ordinary society. A rapist did a monstrous crime, is a f*cking asshole, and deserves punishment. Recognising that rapists humanity means to recognize WHY he felt comfortable to do the things he did, recognising the fact that we live in a world that FACILITATED the idea in his head that he could rape a child/another human being, recognizing the patriarchy deeply embedded in the collective consciousness of our society, the media we are exposed to, the graphic pornography that young boys are often exposed to, that leads men into thinking that rape is okay, that consent isnt necessary, that he can do whatever he wants. Recognising the rapists humanity is recognising that the same society that raised him and led him to do that monstrous crime, is the same society that is right now raising young boys, that need i remind you, are YOUNG HUMAN BEINGS, to be exposed to the same ideas and beliefs that he was exposed to, that will eventually lead to them doing the same crime. Calling a rapist a monster, is a convenient way to say \"he simply is the way he is\" and put him in jail(which yes he deserves) and do nothing else. Recognising his humanity will involve having to reckon with the society that raised him that allowed him to think he could do that, and work on dismantling the very deep rooted systems and beliefs that keep the patriarchy and rape culture running. Calling him a monster and doing nothing about the society that let a human become monstrous is simply continuing the society that encourages SEVERAL OTHER YOUNG BOYS BEING RAISED RIGHT NOW TO CONTINUE TO DO WHAT THAT MAN DID. Thinking that simply calling the rapist a monster and putting him in jail, and doing nothing to prevent very possible future monstrous crimes by others isnt just deserved retribution, it is society enabling these crimes by negligence. And recognising that rapists humanity is not forgiving him of the atrocities he committed, nor saying that we dont punish him at all, its realising that if put under the similar circumstances, childhood, upbringing, patriarchal and rape culture media brainwashing as the rapist's, that you or me might as well have done such a monstrous crime. And yes, this applies for all people who've committed rape and SA, not just men, and applies to other heinous crimes such as serial killing as well.",

Allowing us create actionable changes ( in our own lives, through whatever roles we play in relation to the world around us) that allows ppl who had hard experiences or other precursors to actually get some support ( ex.mental health, community, resources) so harmful acts like this does not happen. but only if we see ppl and support them ( stop creating victim/abuser cycles, on a macro and micro scale) we can create a life of symbiosis by recognizing each others humanities.",

When i look at the IRL pictures I don't see similarities and I'm someone who struggles to differentiate people (idk why).\n\nIt's not casting \"ugly people\" that i want, which this conversation also just ties imo into ableism, but i want average actors to be casted. But that's a problem within Hollywood as a whole, that's what i took away from that criticism, which confused me because i never heard \"the actors are pretty and famous therefore we should cast ugly people\", it was always pretty privilege and elitism in Hollywood mixed with the \"sympathy because of the pretty look of the ACTOR\" and I would argue, the script.",

Because deformity and ugliness are unsettling to look at, in a vacuum. And, on the other hand, babies are known to like and respond to beautiful faces. So, not to say this isn’t a massive issue for all of us to work on—but it also, very clearly, goes beyond conditioning.\n\nLike, we don’t associate negative traits to “ugly” because of tropes in media—we have tropes in media BECAUSE our brains are already making those associations. \n\nAgain, very sad, and something to work on—but we must grapple with the fact that we are animals, and as such we want to stay alive. We evolved to appreciate open, friendly faces that are easy to read and pleasant to look at. If you run into a person with intense facial assymmetry, mottled sallow skin, an eye facing the other way, etc etc—your monkey brains is sending a bunch of micro alarms to be wary of disease or unpredictable behavior—you will, at the very least, take pause, or feel a jolt of caution and alertness. The opposite is true with beauty, which practically has a gravitational pull and a blurring filter to any bad traits. \n\nI mean, it’s interesting. We know that beauty does correlate with health markers and predictors we are driven to select—but broadly speaking, beauty is an amoral evolutionary feature meant to encourage reproduction, but also, now there are certain parasites that literally will make a person more beautiful as an adaptation strategy to encourage its spreading.",

Because at the same time it’s not as if disabled people and non conventionally attractive people’s children are suffering or see their own parents and are constantly scared of them? I think there’s a difference between someone looking safe or unsafe vs just not being beautiful (I guess ugliness is a really broad spectrum. Fatness for example is under the umbrella of ugly, I wouldn’t expect a fat face would register to an infant as dangerous, or how many participants in the studies were fat folks). Lookism is exactly relying on monkey brain to make life altering decisions, but we are much more evolved than monkey brain. I really believe if we can refrain from immediately having s*x with strangers we are attracted to in public or physically fighting someone who intimidates us, we can unpack and hopefully leave our lookism in our sociobiological past.",

He was driving so erratically, I thought he was a drunk until his lights came on. He tried to claim he'd clocked me at near 90 in a 65 when I knew for a fact I hadn't gone over 68 (you know, digital speedometers kind of make it obvious). He was a DOUCHE to me the entire stop, and when I was reading the ticket after he went back to his patrol car, he got on his loud speaker to force me along. Which is illegal (my degree is a Bachelor's lol). \n\nSo I challenged the ticket. Showed up to court, and the prick literally called me out into the hall to try to intimidate me 😂 Little did he know I'm neurodivergent as hell so when he said, \"You should probably just leave, you're not going to win\" - my only response was, \"Why would I leave? I'm already here???\" it wasn't until after I sat back down that my processor kicked in lmao\n\nI couldn't prove my speed because I didn't have a recording, but I was honestly shocked at how much the judge let me say. It was definitely that complexion protection hard at work. I basically said, \"I can't prove I didn't go that speed, but I do know how a proper traffic stop is done and he did NONE OF THAT.\" \n\nI had to pay the fine, but the trooper had to go get retraining on radar protocol so to me that's a win 🤣🤣🤣 In that case, I was happy to pay the state $120 to retrain his ass. He needed it 💀",

Like gaslighting in the non trendy internet way but in the “no matter what you say or do I will find a way to make you the bad guy,” narcissistic parent way. And my father literally barely spoke to me and solitary confinement was my “punishment,” along with other crazy manipulative stuff that has fried my brain in many ways. I was one of those angry kids that was mean because I was so depressed and I felt trapped. I think the thing that helped me was having adults that believed me and even stood up for me. It made me feel less invisible and feel “safer” to connect to my emotions and trust my discomfort. I found out later that I am autistic so that was a MAJOR part of my confusion and depression. It also helped me understand that I was also being bullied, by my peers and my father, for behaviors I could not control as well. I was not violent but I can imagine that if I had my childhood experiences, my continued lack of understanding from not being diagnosed, and physical abuse; that someone with my temperament could end up being a violent criminal. \n\nThis by no means justifies it because I know I reached a point where I personally was tired of being angry all the time. So there always is some level of personal choice. However, I am a person who was born with a brain difference that never got the help I needed. And was dealing with a father that would literally would be in solitary confinement for entire weekends with him and his wife repeating, “If you’d lie, you’ll steal, and if you’d steal, you’ll kill,” when I was getting in trouble for literally nothing. So I can imagine someone in my situation + violence seeing themselves becoming a violent criminal that just said “fuck it,” and gave into their impulses but truly being confused and wanting answers.",

Specifically if is an autistic person with my specific profile where it impacts you emotionally (it’s called alexithymia). We already have a hard time connecting to our emotions and internal body cues and that’s not even touching the other issues we deal with like the world being too loud at time. Then you add trauma that adds even more confusion to the mix. We’re also very ritualistic, regimented, and as I mentioned struggle with social cues.

I have no idea what you're talking about when you say I'm not “not understanding another perspective.” I was corroborating what you said. So ease up on the gas peddle. \n\n 2.  I said: \"No one needs to see what the worst of us is capable of, in my honest opinion. I want to learn from the folks who didn't need to find out.\" \n a) That's it. I didn't make a moral judgment about violence as a whole. I didn't say that any/everyone who is forced to commit violence is “bad” or “wrong.” I said we don't need to know what the worst of us is capable of.\n b) To take that quote and read \"No one needs to understand the complexity and nuance of interpersonal violence\" is WILD because those are not even close to the same statement. \n\n 3.  I never made any comments about neurodivergence. I never said that people who are ND can't be forced/coerced into violence. *I* am ND. I said in one of my OPs that I'm, quote, “neurodivergent as hell.”\n\n 4. You don't know what my brother, or I, for that matter, dealt with. So, with respect, please don't speak about him as if you do. If you need to make assumptions, at least I'm alive and can say something back. Leave the dead to rest. I've already given more details about him than I probably should have. I also didn't say he was perfect. I straight up told you he intentionally destroyed my family's property whenever he got mad. That IS violence. \n\n 5. Read my original reply again. In that comment, I said, “If we'd had a more violent childhood THAN WE DID...” right there is my admission that our childhood was, in fact, quite violent. \n\n 6. NONE of anything either of us has describe is even close to the level of what Dahmer et al. were doing. The person I was responding to said that Dahmer was “interesting” because he was “a lot more self aware than most killers.” So when I responded with “blah blah blah...the worst of us...” I WAS TALKING ABOUT LITERAL SERIAL KILLERS NOT ANYONE WITH ND WTH??? 🤦",

        "text": "@SirSpenaceI misread your reply as offering destroying property as a “better” option than violent crime. And I think I’m coming off wrong. So let me clarify. \n\nThis is not a morality check nor am I saying that you were insinuating saying that people should remove all nuance. I was simply pushing back on your opinion by pointing out that your brother’s path may have been an option for him because he did not have other factors that cause others to choose a different path. \n\nI also know that you’re talking about serial killers specifically but I don’t think they’re specifically “worse” when compared to other violent criminals. In fact many of these serial killers perpetrated other violent crimes prior to killing. Which is why I wanted to push  back a little bit. Most of the people who commit violent crimes have extenuating circumstances and issues that may have required more systematic support that they never received.\n\nThis was meant to be a challenge to your opinion (not a question of your moral standing) because a lot of violent criminals do not even have the tools to self assess in the way Jeffery did. The part I’m assuming your brother was missing is that part. About 40% of all people in state prisons have a learning, cognitive, and developmental disabilities. And as someone who is a part of that disability list I was simply sharing that there’s a part of my decision making that intimately tied to the ableism I dealt with. Ableism without an explanation of why you’re experiencing makes you feel like something is fundamentally wrong with you and can make you feel like you’re destined to be fucked up anyway. Finding out why my brain wasn’t “working right” gave me the tools to understand and process my emotions. People with ADHD may learn tips to help with impulse control. Or I think about my best friend who literally had done some interesting/ impulsive shit she couldn’t control nor take back before she knew she needed to take mood stabilizers.\n\nI’m simply proposing that looking at the worst of us, and adjusting resources to prevent others in similar circumstances from going down that path, may be the most comprehensive option.",

You're welcome to disagree, but I think you're still giving them too much credit.\n\nEspecially these days, cops realize that media storms are more of a hindrance than they will ever be a help. Now we only hear about serial killers after they're caught. By then, they've usually have \"linked\" a number of cases to them, many of which are later proven untrue.\n\nThe phenomenon you're referring to where cops don't believe people is just called Picking Your Targets Well. Cops are known to not respond to certain calls/to certain people well. TV paints cops as always wanting to \"catch the bad guy,\" when that couldn't be further from the truth. The last thing most ever want is to be called to the scene of a body. Even if there's no suspicion of a crime, you're still strapped with shit tons of paperwork and then have to go tell next of kin that someone is gone. It's not glamorous or rewarding, in any way. Add on top of that that most serial killers know to target sex workers or Black women because they're often blamed for their own assaults, and it's amazing we know about any of them.\n\nAnd it's not like we have long-running TV shows like Unsolved Mysteries, To Catch a Predator, or America's Most Wanted on TV to keep us in the loop, either. Now we're lucky to hear about it at all lol \n\nSo anyway when are they going to charge the kid that shot Kirk?",

And if you need a video to understand why this is a bad thing,  here you are.  \n\nI am very sorry for your brother,  and he probably deserved more attention. \n\nBut tilt it back and forth all you like,  Dahmer was interesting in that aspect. Most serious offenders (with \"serious\" being a lot less grim still then Dahmer) will deny (some of) their actions,  shift blame to other people and or society,  try to be sympathetic. Dahmer didn't. He was very honest about the fact,  that he did all of that himself and that he doesn't have anyone or anything to blame but himself.  \n\nDon't f-ing mistake that for symphathy, because you do that by your words. It's  not the case to say the least.  \n\nOther then that,  I do understand that you are fed up, that the brother you loved never received any attention,  but a horrible serial killer did.  That's life.  Do you give even half a damn about my childhood friend, that got killed due to DUI (not by him)? You don't either,  and I'm  not mad about that fact at all. There are 6 billion people ALIVE out there and many many more dead.  You will only ever be remembered (long time),  if you do something remarkable - good *or* evil. Ghandi and moustache man,  basically.  Nobody knows your brother, like my childhood friend,  because both were - just like myself or you - in the grand scheme of things unremarkable. Dahmer WAS remarkable. And as I've said before,  that can be both very good or very bad.",

A lot of the outrage about the way their relationship is portrayed has to do with sexualization.

In this era, when people are on a Believe Men kick, not out of genuine care, but to divert attention from the trauma and abuse women habitually suffer, and White Men victim cosplay to justify total power, a ton of the folks who disbelieved the Menendez story are now treating their abuse as unassailable fact and society shifts around this.",

They don’t want to think that their neighbor who just lost his job, his wife, and is running out of money has the potential to be a mass murderer, so they have to find a reason to distance their neighbor from the “evil criminal.” \n\nIf you truly watch true crime, and I don’t mess the Netflix specials. But documentaries that families put together, you’ll see how many of these families solve the murder before the officers. Most of the time the families already know who the suspect may be and put it together based on their loved one’s whereabouts. The officers will arrogantly say they couldn’t use the family’s leads because they were hearsay but mysteriously always end up following their leads for other reasons later. The families are able to find these suspects faster because these suspects are humans. They have habits, people that they live near, and personalities. There’s someone who will notices changes in their routine, or major life changes, and if we as a society could identify those and tie them to the root cause we could prevent crimes. \n\nThere’s a reason crimes are tied to poverty. All crime is usually tied to access. Access to necessities, access to resources, access to information.",

        "text": "Yes, I've been saying this for years upon years. People compare serial killers to non-human animals or monsters when what makes their actions so atrocious is that they AREN'T non-human animals or monsters (creatures with built in excuses for brutality). Other animals and monsters have very little control over how they live and what they can do, acting mostly on instinct, in response to outside stimuli, and/or as means of survival. Only humans are uniquely capable of evil (which I would define as having the ability not to harm others, but choosing to do so anyway). Evil requires intention, be it the intent to harm directly, for the sake of causing harm, or the intent to do something you know will cause others harm, but simply not caring that they're harmed.\n\nHowever, given that definition, the vast majority of humans are evil. Nobody wants to look inward. If the average person thinks we're speaking in reference to pedophiles, they'll vehemently agree that it is fundamentally wrong and even evil to ruin anybody's life just to use their body, and may even agree to extreme punishment such as the death penalty, castration, or life-imprisonment for those that act on those desires. Yet, the same person would vehemently disagree with the same exact statement and sentiment if it was about meat-eaters, and insist they be allowed to continue their harmful behaviour without interference.\n\n Just as the pedo views a child as inferior and expendable, they view non-human animals as inferior and expendable, both operating off the same supremacist ideology of \"I am the most important being in the universe, thus anyone I can't see myself in is inferior and unimportant.\" Sadly, most people will their whole lives rejecting the idea that they could ever have anything in common with those they've deemed to be monsters, despite the basic fundamentals of why they operate as they do being largely the same. It's likely people will lash out at me even bringing it up here. (Somewhat humorously, I often find people both insisting that humans are inherently more valuable than non-human animals, while labelling any humans they don't like as monsters or wild animals. It's the circular logic of \"Humans are worthy of compassion, thus if I see a human as unworthy of compassion, that means they're not human.)\n\nIt's much like the people in America today who are openly supporting a fascist regime, but truly believe they have nothing in common with Nazis. They've been (understandably) taught that Nazis are monsters, thus believe \"normal people\" like them could never have anything in common with them. They've lived their whole lives believing it can't happen here because, in their opinion, they're not monsters.",

Forgiveness and attempts at criminal rehabilitation don't always work, because not all criminals are 'suffering' or care about your 'morals'- some are laughing at your pain and gullibility. When you give extreme criminals second chances, you engage in another kind of moral hypocrisy, because you're saying the dignity, humanity, and emotions victims no longer 'matter', and most cannot conceptualise what some victims (especially in cases of sexual violence) have actually been through. It's easy for all of these commenters to talk about how these people aren't 'monsters' or 'need help' when they're not the one being victimised or degraded.",

But acknowledging those failures should not slide into reframing Dahmer himself as “intelligent,” misunderstood, or primarily a product of social conditions. He was not uncaught because of brilliance; he was uncaught because he murdered people society already treated as disposable. The focus must remain on the murderer and the crime, not on rehabilitating his image through pseudo-intellectualization. When critique of institutions turns into softening the moral clarity of mass murder, it ceases to be justice-oriented and becomes morally confused.

He was so charismatic as a teen that he managed to get clearance for him and two classmates to visit the White House while on a high school field trip to Washington D.C. according to the graphic novel “My Friend Dahmer,” written by Dahmer’s former classmate Derf Backderf. Despite his intelligence and confidence, Dahmer didn’t succeed professionally. He was discharged from the army due to a drinking problem. Later, he was fired from his night shift job at a chocolate factory.\n\n“A lot of high people with high IQ in society seem to have a problem with motivation,” Rosewood explained. “Dahmer and Bundy might not have been successful in the eyes of society but they were certainly above average in what motivated them - killing.”\n\nAuthorities believe that Dahmer killed 17 men and boys and Bundy killed 36 (although police believe he may have killed around 100) young women. But, the American serial killer with the most confirmed kills and who evaded police for decades was someone with a reportedly IQ of just 82, which is considered on the low side: Gary Ridgway.”",

        "text": "@marajroblox4583 Most psychopaths that end up going down this route are ostensibly not intelligent. It is a common media trope to incorrectly portray serial killer psychopaths as smart. Usually their IQ is lowered, they had bad childhoods in one aspect or another and they're willing to risk their lives for whatever they find entertaining for their poorly stimulated brains. They have low impulse control and are prone to shallow emotional expression.\n\nMore intelligent and stable psychopaths don't do this kind of thing. They manipulate or gain power in socially accepted or at least legal ways. They rightfully calculate something like \"hmm, I wonder what a persons guts look like. I want to know, but if I do that, I risk going to jail and I'd have to spend all my time on this hiding evidence, risking things with cops and that could be fun, but eh, I have other shit to do. I'll just look it up online.\"\nBecause they are ego centric and only have capacity to care about themselves. They lack empathy. But the smart ones realize they live in society and how society is doing affects them. Killing people destabilizes society, makes people paranoid, increases reactionary violence and promotes dysfunction. They do not benefit from a dysfunctional society because they live in it too. They need water, food, shelter, electricity and somewhat competent politicians. They realize even with out the empathetic anchor that as much as they'd like to be, they aren't an island independent from societies workings.",

Society should be aware of this and not think that cruelty and horrific acts come from nothing. There is a cause and our best course of action is quarantine the individual until we can assess what the cause is. \nRetribution and this twisted justice model doesn't help anyone. It just satisfies ego to torture those who hurt others. Especially in cases where the cause isn't always clear cut choice.\n\nBut that opens up a can of worms about autonomy and personal free-will that people do not want questioned. Easier to say someone is a monster and chose to be one in every single case.\n\nAnd I'm not saying that if someone isn't at fault that everything shouldn't be done to protect others. I can't stand that limp accusation to even come to the conclusion of. Viruses don't intent to kill. They're just programs who replicate and their replication comes at the cost of health. We don't lock that in a cell and want to watch its public execution. We simply deal with the issue. Either by removing it and studying it and in best case scenario, converting it to be symbiotic or finding another use. Or we eradicate it. In both scenarios, you still eliminate it's ability to cause harm as best you can. Unstable dangerous individuals are the same thing. It's more important to prevent victims in the first place than to feel vindication or sadism when terrible people have terrible things happen to them.\nWe have backwards priorities when it comes to this.",

First of all, learn how to listen, because you're making things up to be mad about and trying to attribute them to the wrong people. Secondly, learn the difference between justice and just wanting to cause pain to someone else because you felt horrible pain that is never really going to leave. That is how the cycle perpetuates. I get how you feel. And it takes work to stop thinking only about yourself. Our system is so deeply flawed that it's feeding itself. I didn't say to let everyone out of prison. I said to help them. A smart person would realize that bringing cognition to horrible acts might be considered a form of torture in itself. But, we need to bring humanity and shared reality to the forefront, either way. Because while you're picturing your abusers face on that person being abused in prison, voting for them to suffer, there's a chance that you're taking it out on an INNOCENT frickin person because our system IS NOT PERFECT. You became the bad guy. Maybe try to fix that before you do something (else) incredibly stupid. Hopefully, you meet more people that have worked past where you are, because you're in the mire and don't seem to notice the harm YOU cause.",

Police only usually get to know there is a serial killer when there are bodies and the killings are similar across victims. If there are no bodies, then no killer (that's why they never looked for dahmer,  gacy as killers cause there were no bodies found till after they were caught for other things. On the contrary, the Yorkshire ripper, richard ramirez left bodies so they looked for them. Most of littlest victims were never even reported missing so the police didn't even have it in their systems that they were possible murder victims and that's why about half of them have never been identified till this day.

        "text": "@yellothekunt6826 From a Black feminist perspective, this argument fundamentally misunderstands both accountability and structural critique, while reproducing the very logics that have historically harmed Black communities, especially Black women.\r\n\r\nFirst, Black feminism does not deny crime or excuse violence. Black women have been among the loudest critics of gang violence, misogyny, and hypermasculine posturing because they are disproportionately harmed by it, as victims of domestic violence, sexual coercion, community instability, and the emotional labor of holding families together when men are incarcerated or killed. To claim that opposing dehumanization equals defending criminals is a false equivalence.\r\n\r\nSecond, rejecting dehumanization is not about sympathy for “murderers”; it is about resisting a system that has always used dehumanization to justify collective punishment of Black people. Historically, the language of criminality has never stayed neatly confined to those who commit crimes. It expands, first to “criminals,” then to “suspects,” then to entire neighborhoods, then to Blackness itself. Black feminism understands this because Black women have lived it: respectability has never protected us from violence or neglect.\r\n\r\nThird, the glorification of “gangsta culture” is not a progressive invention, it is a market-driven caricature of Black masculinity produced and consumed largely by institutions outside the community. Black feminists critique this relentlessly, precisely because it traps Black men in a narrow, violent script while leaving Black women to absorb the fallout. But critique is not the same as erasure. You cannot dismantle destructive masculinities by declaring the people shaped by them “weak-minded” and disposable.\r\n\r\nFourth, Black feminism rejects the idea that recognizing structural forces means denying agency. Agency exists within constraint. Poverty, segregation, surveillance, and racialized policing shape probabilities, not destinies, but pretending those forces don’t matter is intellectually dishonest and politically convenient for the state. It shifts blame downward while absolving systems that profit from incarceration and social abandonment.\r\n\r\nFinally, Black feminism refuses the framing that pits “good” Black people against “bad” ones as a prerequisite for dignity. That logic has always been used to fracture Black solidarity and silence critique. The point is not that “racism is bad only when it’s toward criminals”; the point is that humanity is not earned through moral perfection, and once it is treated that way, no one is safe. Especially Black women, who are policed, punished, and dismissed even when they follow every rule.\r\n\r\nIn short, Black feminism says this:\r\nYou can condemn violence without worshiping punishment.\r\nYou can demand accountability without endorsing dehumanization.\r\nAnd you can reject harmful cultural glorification without becoming an ally of the same systems that have never distinguished criminals from the rest of us.\r\n\r\nThat is not insanity. That is historical awareness.",

Based on personal experience, most victims are huge advocates for children. At worst, they suffer from their trauma so much, they put themselves in bad situations— getting addicted to drugs or doing sex work— and find themselves being revictimized. I just think it’s dangerous to say these things if the studies they are based on are skewed. Victims are already treated with so much contempt by society.",

Yes, csa survivors absolutely suffer through their lives. But is it so unreasonable to say this may also damage some part of their sexual development to where they may also become abusers?

Someone who never offends is obviously better and if there's people who never did, and died never having done anything then thats good, I don't necessarily feel \"hatred\" towards those individuals who've never done anything.

They seem incredibly normal,  just average Joes for the most part,  if you didn't know why they were there, you would likely never guess that they murdered multiple people.   That's the terrifying part.\nYes,  it ruins the  \"romanticization of serial killers\" that a lot of true crime lovers tend to be guilty of,  but that's what's so scary.

One gets the general impression of a man who is intellectually normal, but with the schizoid apathy.\" Schizoid apathy was also used to describe Dahmer.\n\nHe would say this a few days before his execution; \n\"My conscience compels me to make the following declaration. In the solitude of my prison cell, I have come to the bitter recognition that I have sinned gravely against humanity. As Commandant of Auschwitz, I was responsible for carrying out part of the cruel plans of the \"Third Reich\" for human destruction. In so doing I have inflicted terrible wounds on humanity. I caused unspeakable suffering for the Polish people in particular. I am to pay for this with my life. May the Lord God forgive one day what I have done. I ask the Polish people for forgiveness. In Polish prisons I experienced for the first time what human kindness is. Despite all that has happened I have experienced humane treatment which I could never have expected, and which has deeply shamed me. May the facts which are now coming out about the horrible crimes against humanity make the repetition of such cruel acts impossible for all time.\"",

Instead of looking into why these behaviors happen and are accepted, it simply changes the definition of manhood.\r\n\r\nThis approach seems like a solution, but it still suggests there is a “correct” way to be a man. This idea has been used in the past not to stop harm, but to excuse it. Men who act violently are seen as exceptions, rather than as part of a culture that encourages being dominant and entitled, or that allows silence from others.\r\n\r\nIt also avoids looking at bigger issues. If abusers are just labeled as “not real men,” then we don’t have to think about masculinity itself, only individual problems. This makes it harder to hold people accountable because it treats harmful actions as personal mistakes instead of things supported by culture and society.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this way of thinking can backfire. Calling someone “not a real man” often makes them defensive or angry, and can lead them to adopt even more extreme views of masculinity. It changes criticism into policing identities.\r\n\r\nIt’s important to reject harmful behavior. But changing the definition of manhood to exclude those who act badly doesn’t address the reasons behind the behavior; it just protects the ideal of manhood without deeper understanding.",

Once again, if you only think about these shows as some sort of weird fetish content that crazy teenage girls or women like instead of engaging with the material, you are missing the point. I agree that the Menendez show sexualized them but that show in my opinion was not what this video or thesis based on at all. The point is y'all love to sit on this morally superior stance that we need to stop talking or engaging with these shows because somehow that is dishonoring the victims when in reality some of y'all need a reality check that there are way more Dahmers or \"lonely/detached\" man than y'all realize and a lot of these men while not violent to the extent he was are still in existence and we need to stop acting like the circumstances that lead to his creation are somehow unique or special when that is most teenage boys now.",

This entire video is about how it’s important to show that these killers were nothing more or less than human.  Sexualizing them is one way of making them less than human.  And again, no one said the main thesis of the entire video was that the main problem of all these shows was sexualization.  It’s just one of several ways that Ryan Murphy himself seems to miss the point of what is important in how these killers ought to be portrayed and just inserts some unnecessarily sensationalist stuff into them to drive up viewer interest or what not.  I agree that judging from this video that the most frequent way he does this is not necessarily by sexualizing them, but in the Menendez show he absolutely does and it’s very weird and yes, as per the original comment you replied to, he DOES sexualize trauma, even if there were only ONE example of that (though it is NOT the only example).  It was perfectly valid for that original commenter to point out that that is weird and problematic because Olurinatti did the EXACT same thing.  You said y’all need to watch the video before commenting to someone who watched the video and commented on a specific part of the video! So they clearly DID watch the video!!! Do you police someone who watches a movie and comments on a particular scene afterward just because it wasn’t the most pivotal scene of the entire movie in your opinion?  Also, I have no idea what you’re on about in the latter half of your reply.  Who implied that Dahmer was exceptional?  That’s just a whole-ass brand new discussion no one here seems to be having except you.",

        "text": "​​​@play-fool That explanation does not seem remotely plausible. First of all, that's not how the data collection works. For instance, Radford university's serial killer database doesn't just look for who has been labeled a serial killer in a respective country. They start with a definition, and they look at how many cases fit that definition. \"Serial killer\" isn't something people get charged with, they just get charged with multiple murder counts. Even if what you're saying was an actual problem for serial killers, criminologists would already know about it because this is a problem with other types of crimes, especially things like rape, where legal definitions vary a lot. Legal definitions of murder don't tend to vary that much. It's why murder rates are the strongest form of data to work with in the field. If what you were describing was an actual problem with serial killing, and it wasn't being accounted for already, that research would be completely mocked. Moreover, I don't see how a methodology problem can't explain the sheer degree of difference between the US and the rest of the world. According to Radford university's database, as of 2016 there have been 3,204 identified serial killers in the United States. In second place, England had 166 identified serial killers. I do not know of any practice (or lack thereof) in England that would account for that gap just due to documentation.\n\nEdit: I did realize these were absolute measurements and considering differences in population between the United States and England I thought I should also standardize it a bit. So of the identified serial killers in the database as of 2016, they make up roughly 9.9% of the population in the United States, and roughly 3% of the population in England. (Just in case you were going to tell me the US has a bigger population than England so of course there's more...)",

They were convicted when I was 8 years old and my siblings and I were placed back in their care after about two years. \n\nMy siblings and I no longer speak to them for good reasons, but it wasn’t lack of belief that they could be better than who they were. \n\nI made a lot of excuses for my parents before cutting them out of my life. It’s really hard to hold what my parents had done, what they continued to do, and who they were as parents in the same mind.\n\nIt’s been ten years since I spoke to them and I still have trouble dealing with this cognitive hardship. I have kids now and I’ll have extreme moments of empathy for my mother as I have to confront how difficult parenting is. And yet I have to remind myself that a growth in understanding on my side is not the same as my parents growing on their own. \n\nThis is really simplified. I’m mostly commenting to engage. I will say, by all accounts of those who knew my father, he had a normal childhood given what we count as acceptable. And he still became a very tucked up person who did a lot of harm to a lot of people. Honestly, watching this has given me some perspective on his life. I think I always wanted there to be some kind of tragedy that no one knew about. I never considered that he could have just been a miserable lonely boy who grew into a convoluted world view and a destructive man….. I’m still thinking through these thoughts.\n\nI’m not planning on ever talking to them again and I would die before introducing them to my children’s lives, but I do hope they get the help they need.\n\nEdit: thank you all 💕 I do want to add the reason I shared: because of what my parents have done and who they are, they would very much be considered “monsters.” I wanted to add a perspective that supports Olay’s main point: that humans commit these acts. My parents were not at all times the people who said and did the horrible things they did. That, (mixed with incompetence of the legal system in this case too) is why it had gone on for so long. My parents absolutely benefited from a legal system that had no interest in acting until they were forced to. And even after that, there was no interest in ensuring that my siblings and I were safe. My dad spent a whole ass 60 days in prison for the things they did which were caught. He is white and there was very much an aura that these acts were a one time thing. They were not.",

There is racism in this scenario, but it comes from the societal racism of seeing murdered POC as “the less dead”, which is in no way exclusive to Dahmer as plenty of killers(Gary Ridgeway, Robert Pickton,etc) preyed on black sex workers because they were the least investigated cases.\n\nUnless we find some hidden journals detailing otherwise, there’s nothing to suggest that Dahmer was particularly racist or that there’s anything for his father to deconstruct. It’s all related more specifically to severe mental illness,internalized homophobia, and societal racism/classism.",

At best it’s just fuel for POC to hate him more because it adds the context of racism into his motives, but even then it’s just a barebones posthumous analysis with no basis in evidence that’s specific to Dahmer. \n\nWe can agree that every white person likely has some degree of internalized racism, but again, it adds no true depth of understanding to this situation that can help us prevent further atrocity. \n\nAt a base, someone preying on others will always go for easy prey, and if a mentally sick person has the ability to act out their desires with success and minimal accountability due to their proximity to marginalized groups, they’re going to take advantage of it regardless of race. In this case and in many others today(a big example being Indigenous women), POC just happen to be the easiest prey due to specifically structural racism, not so much personal racism.\n\nNot saying to never consider it for criminal cases, just that there’s next to no reason to apply it to this case given the very real evidence and analysis we have of Dahmer’s life.",

They didn't find any drugs on him but still kept on destroying his house while \"searching\".\n\nMeanwhile the son (who was white) had been spoken to like the cops and him were friends (they weren't) joking and laughing, asking if they could make a quick pat down to check for drugs and even that was done lazily and calmly.\nAt the end they dragged the friend out of his house and pushed him on the car while \"interrogating\" the son.\n\nThey didn't find shit and still wanted to get the Arabic friend into police custody (I don't remember if they succeeded or not).\n\nAt the end the son told his mom that he had the drugs on him and that they were in his pocket, the police just didn't search him well enough nor cared to do their job properly while he tried to get his friend out of their grip.",

    "text": "When you talked about Dahmer's change in prison, I thought of Karla Faye Tucker, whom George W. Bush had killed when he was governor of Texas. I followed that story closely when it was happening. There was a huge outcry over her impending death, and it seemed as if something might be done to stop it. I vividly recall that after months of news coverage, she was killed. The next day there were short news stories confirming the execution. Then the mass media forgot her completely - she vanished from public consciousness overnight. It was yet another confirmation to me of how much our society loves death.\n\nAnd I had no idea about any of the changes in Dahmer that you recount. Though I lived in Milwaukee when he was committing his crimes, and he had lived less than a mile from where I was living at the time, I was too horrified to want to give him close attention.\n\nThanks for showing the humanity of people like this. It will do little good in the short term. But eventually we live have to learn better. We deny our own humanity when we deny theirs.",

He said it just came naturally to want to manipulate for his own benefit. He also talked about how \"love\" for him was very different than the average person.

It’s ok to sympathize with how these people became who they are, and recognized that they’ve committed crimes that are unforgivable. It doesn’t take away from the fact that there are indeed victims and what has happened to the victims is horrible. Also, the sexualization, obsession and deification of murderers is SICK. And very different from humanizing them. \n\nAlso the highlight on the reporting that wanted to mention Jeffrey’s intelligent to evade the police’s failure to do their job, perfect. Racism and homophobia being the reason they didn’t want to be bothered by saving people.  Thank you, Olay.",

Whether they were gay men, sex workers, indigenous women or the un-housed law enforcement and the public did not care. This is one reason why so many of these killers could continue their crimes for years in the same location. We need to extend humanity to every person so that we cannot only catch perpetrators but also support and rehabilitate them. We need to extend humanity to all of the victims and listen to the communities that are being harmed so that they can get the help they deserve. \n\nThank you for this enlightening video. I hope it helps people consider the humanity in us all.",

    "text": "ive actually never been more excited by the first line of a video 💞💞 because my main criticism to the discussion of serial killers (and murderers and violent criminals in general) has always been not humanizing them but villainizing them to a cartoonish extent, to the point where we can consider them as “separate” from “us”. don’t try to lessen their actions or impact, but also don’t characterize them as something More Than Human because it’s more comfortable for both the writers and the audience to have that distance from the circumstances that result in real human people committing these types of atrocities. that kind of “these types of people are born not made” depiction and mindset only serves to ensure the continuation of a larger cycle of systemic abuse and anger and dehumanization and anti-empathy that leads these people away from points of intervention before recidivism in the first place. sorry i dont usually comment before ive seen the whole video i just got so immediately pumped to hear your take on this topic 🥰",
