It does not mean hostile, unfriendly or opposed and it does not mean a political enemy. \nThe text starts with making war against the US, which gives us the meaning of enemy as the opponent in a war.\n\n Foreign governments and armies cannot commit treason, only persons subject to the authority of the US can commit treason.  \n\nTreason is war against the US or adhering to those who make war against the US \"giving them aid and comfort.\n\nThe court has given some deference to the Congress in interpreting these provisions gradually moving away from a narrow requirement of actual hostilities and recognizing the rise of non-state actors as the hostile party. \n\nEven so enemy is still seen in the context of a war or warlike action. For these Somalis to be guilty of treason Al-Shabaab would need to be in fact an enemy of US in the sense of an active armed threat to the US not to Somalia, and the Somalis would have to be shown to have loyalty to Al-Shabaab. Sending money to Somalia would not be sufficient proof. You would have to show that each person knew the money was going to Al-Shabaab and that they knew Al-Shabaab was an enemy of the US.  Al-Shabaab is on an administrative terrorist organization list but for criminal prosecution it could well be that you would have to show that it is actively in support of or engaged in hostile action against the US.",

The aid and comfort clause is not a free standing crime. There has been some interpretation by the courts, but SCOTUS has not yet made aid and comfort in and of itself a crime and enemies does not mean whomever the DOJ calls an enemy.  You may recall the old Attorney General's list of subversive organizations, an enemies list if ever there was one. No one was ever charged with treason for membership and membership without some criminal act or conspiracy to commit a crime cannot be itself a crime because of the 1st Amendment.\n\nDefrauding the US is a crime under 18USC but it is not treason.",

That said I do think our criminal system could use a shakeup The social and restorative justice neo-Marxists have been far too successful in reducing the risk of committing a crime. This has over the past few decades this idea of oppressed and therefore guiltless groups has spread and the ideas of Marcuse have spread from universities to grade schools from economics and law to history and teacher education. \n\nThere have always been some corrupt judges and some overtly partisan judges and some incompetent judges. We the people elect them or the people who appoint them and we the people can reform them, but what usually happens is we vote the same old same old and the express outrage when something goes wrong.\n\nI live in a small town, I can meet with the mayor or the council members or the staff if I make the effort. I can attend and speak at council meetings, and I have done so several times. Quite often the council and staff outnumber the people in the audience. In all of the town's existence no council member has ever been recalled and only one lost an election because of well-founded evidence of corruption. But most people most of the time pay no attention to how the town is governed. As we go up to higher levels the disconnect is even greater. There is no chance of my meeting a Senator and my Representative will fob me off on one of his staff. Perhaps there is an upper limit to a well functioning representative government.",
