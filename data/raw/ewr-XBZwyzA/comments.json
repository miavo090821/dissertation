Leftists have been building up for a long time now, it didnt just happen. In the Colleges, in public schools, in democrat areas, and they have even infiltrated a bunch of Conservative areas. Their goal is to see people like us no longer exist, until then they will not stop, anything and everything is OK, nothing to them is off limits. They will keep using their fake virtue signaling and fake morality and slowly but surely gain 100% control eventually, they use our good nature and laws against us. We have to fight fire with fire.",

For these Somalis to be guilty of treason Al-Shabaab would need to be in fact an enemy of US in the sense of an active armed threat to the US not to Somalia, and the Somalis would have to be shown to have loyalty to Al-Shabaab.

The aid and comfort clause is not a free standing crime. There has been some interpretation by the courts, but SCOTUS has not yet made aid and comfort in and of itself a crime and enemies does not mean whomever the DOJ calls an enemy.  You may recall the old Attorney General's list of subversive organizations, an enemies list if ever there was one. No one was ever charged with treason for membership and membership without some criminal act or conspiracy to commit a crime cannot be itself a crime because of the 1st Amendment.\n\nDefrauding the US is a crime under 18USC but it is not treason.",

That said I do think our criminal system could use a shakeup The social and restorative justice neo-Marxists have been far too successful in reducing the risk of committing a crime. This has over the past few decades this idea of oppressed and therefore guiltless groups has spread and the ideas of Marcuse have spread from universities to grade schools from economics and law to history and teacher education. \n\nThere have always been some corrupt judges and some overtly partisan judges and some incompetent judges. We the people elect them or the people who appoint them and we the people can reform them, but what usually happens is we vote the same old same old and the express outrage when something goes wrong.\n\nI live in a small town, I can meet with the mayor or the council members or the staff if I make the effort. I can attend and speak at council meetings, and I have done so several times. Quite often the council and staff outnumber the people in the audience. In all of the town's existence no council member has ever been recalled and only one lost an election because of well-founded evidence of corruption. But most people most of the time pay no attention to how the town is governed. As we go up to higher levels the disconnect is even greater. There is no chance of my meeting a Senator and my Representative will fob me off on one of his staff. Perhaps there is an upper limit to a well functioning representative government.",

Up early and out digging ditches or filling in yesterday's ditch. When I reported in at Ft Hood HQ there was a man cutting the grass and behind him was a man with a shotgun. I asked the officer who took my orders about the two by the flagpole. The CG thinks it might remind people that in the army you can be jailed for a \"minor\" offense. I've been inside a military prison twice and they are orderly and quiet, amazingly so when compared with a county jail or some state prisons.  Why not set up prisons in the Mohave using tents, It was good enough for thousands of GIs in WW2, surely it should be good enough for a felon. Cheap to build, and in the right location escape might be made very difficult without requiring an army of expensive guards.",
