Although this guy I guess is a Trotskyist because why, he claimed that he believed in order for communism to be fully realized required an internationalist perspective? Cope 😂",

But claiming he is from the video is just as bad as the right calling the Democratic Party Marxist. It’s reactionary.",

        "text": "@jeremywingard7043Yes yes we’re all reactionary fascists or whatever sure. But if you had listened to the video, he said things that are very indicative of someone who holds Trotsyist beliefs (e.g “revolution everywhere all at the same time not in one country at a time”). I didn’t just say it for no reason and I’m sure neither did the rest of the people who commented.\n\nAnd yes, your response was clearly intended to be obnoxious— as you included several crying laughing emojis and said “cope”. I understand for a person like you this might seem tame, as I’m sure you’re used to reacting even more juvenile in most instances. So I don’t know why you would be surprised that I would say you sound like a jerk. But, you clearly have antisocial tendencies so it’s not worth my time. Good luck.",
