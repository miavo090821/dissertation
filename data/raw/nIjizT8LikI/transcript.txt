hello comrades uh how's everyone doing thank you for clicking on the video and watching it i am carlos garrido from midwest remarks um i just recorded this video i did a 40 minute video and i realized that in that midway through the 40 minute video i tapped my laptop because i'm a very touchy speaker i like to touch stuff when i'm talking um and the new microphone that i got disconnected um so half of the video was gone so i i was faced with the question of whether continue from from that half or restarting and i think it'd probably be a good exercise to restart and maybe we would uh cut down some of the some of the time and and allow you to see a shorter video with with the same essential uh things that were being said um so what was that original video that's now dead uh about well it was about a controversy uh in in marx right uh so we know marx is someone and marxism overall is is is a theoretical uh perspective that is very commonly misunderstood um by well-intentioned people um and it's often misconstrued by not so well-intentioned people by people who are hostile to marxism but the uniqueness of the topic i'm going to talk about is that even people who who are not just young marxist militants they're not hostile to marxism but people who have been some of the great minds of of the 20th century and in terms of marxist thought have bought into um now i i want to say ahead of time that this this critique and anyone that i might mention who had who bought into that or anyone that pops into your mind who bought into this i'm not saying that they're stupid i am not saying that they're not marxist i'm not saying that um that they're wrong but that they're partially right um and that they didn't have the full scope of of marx because there wasn't the documents that that we have now that have been published for for the first time ever um at least in spanish they haven't been published in english so uh for those of you that don't read spanish uh maybe maybe at some point they'll get published in english um so what the hell am i talking about i've been beating around the bush for two and a half minutes this was supposed to be a shorter run and i haven't gotten to the point yet um i'm talking about the unilateral theory of history which is something that's central and thinking about how socialism comes about right so the unilateral theory of history first appears in the german ideology it's a text that's written by marx and engels in 1846 it's a very pivotal text in in in the body of work of marxism right when when altocera talks about an epistemic break which i don't buy it but uh when you talk about the young and the old marks that break is in the german ideology uh that's where he discovers historical and dialectical materialism and he begins to develop it afterwards right although english is the one that more systematically develops it uh marx is really just using it and angles is the one laying out the method right uh but he lays out a unilateral theory of history these different stages that history goes through right and he devises these different stages through the method of historical and dialectical materialism right uh which it's it's historical materialism is is based on how human relations to in production uh have developed and how out of those development in in the relationships of production we define the epochs right so there was a historians that were defining epochs by these great figures there was the historians and the philosophers that were defining epochs by by ideas right mark says no before you can even have an idea uh you you need to have the material conditions in order to uh survive right in that same text he talks about hunger being the first act the first act ever the first historical act is a productive act and only after then can we start to think and do all of these things right um this is something that's confirmed by anthropology again this is confirmed by anthropology as a statement i'm going to say a few times throughout the video but i recommend you to read the part played by labor and the development from ape to man it's a text written by by angles uh stephen j gold does a respond to it uh who who's a famous scientist um talking about how if if scientists would have paid attention to angles uh we would have been 100 years ahead um because now they're finding out what english wrote about in uh in the 70s i believe late 70s uh but back to the central point right uh there's this unilateral theory of history that's based on the different stages of human development which are based on the sorts of relationships the class relationships that are taking place in in the process of production the process of a society producing the things that it needs to subsist sometimes a little more well always a little more once it's in class society because that's how class society comes about right class society is a result of a surplus of stuff made and who decides what to do with that surplus is what uh leads to the beginning of the dynamic between uh between classes um and and there's also more stuff that goes on monogamy and and all of that but that's not the topic of of today um so uh what what is the point here um the point is that uh there was this theory of unilateral development of different stages through which humanity had gone through uh and and out of this theory we devised the necessity of socialism right socialism comes as a result of the capitalist mode of production developing forces to an extent never before seen but in in doing so creating the modern proletariat in in socializing uh how things are produced not just people working individually it's one factory with a bunch of people but yet the factory's still owned by one person right um so it was seen that this capitalist development creates the conditions for socialism and it does so by creating the modern proletariat the historical revolutionary agents if you're lucox the the subject object right um that in immense emancipating itself emancipates it emancipates the rest of humanity it destroys uh distinctions of class and and creates the possibility for for a classless society now uh i wanted to to talk about this topic because um this is something that marx writes in in 46 in the german ideology this is a view that he holds i mean we see it in in the communist manifesto uh he's thinking of socialism as something that happens and that's going to happen in the industrialized nations uh because those nations are the ones that have the conditions because of the stage they're in in history for having socialism this is something that sticks to this day you have uh people who are hostile to marxism that say that marxism is wrong marx theorized that uh socialism was going to happen in the industrialized nations of europe it was going to happen in england and in germany and in america and it didn't happen that way it happened in these other countries and then you have marxist themselves who would admit to saying you know what maybe marx was wrong about that um and because socialism ended up taking place in in what we call the third world and not the the metropolitan not in in europe um what i'm gonna do in this video is show you that no marx wasn't wrong marx was marx was right uh and we're gonna show you when he was right and how he was right and how he came to be right right so this all comes from a study that i did a few years ago on this precise topic i looked at the unilateral theory of history and it didn't really make much sense with the development of marx's philosophical materialism so we have on one hand a materialism that doesn't want to interpret men from the things they think of themselves but it wants to interpret men from what they actually do what are the real relationships that are going on um so in order to do that in order to talk about a unilateral or in order to talk about human development you have to study the actual material conditions of what the hell is going on in a specific place so i took myself upon the task of reading all of the articles that marx and angles had written on mexico on india on china on russia all throughout the 50s the stuff that they write while they're writing for the new york daily tribute that was a big newspaper in the u.s that that uh it was a leftist newspaper published all sorts of things from anarchism to transcendentalist to marx a lot of the articles that marx wrote were really written by engels and and under the name of marx because uh marx wasn't too comfortable with writing in english yet um or so some some documents say um so what i found was that marx was talking about india he was talking about uh mexico or mexico is more so at angles we talked a bit more um they were talking about these different countries but they they weren't talking about it with sources from those countries their source on those countries was the west right uh it was uh in the case of india britain in the case of mexico is the u.s right um and i felt that was wrong right because if we think about things today what would our perspective of china venezuela cuba bolivia b if all we listened to was the news that comes from the empire uh it'd be really really far from the truth right that's listening to what the metropole says uh is is a good way to know that you're not going to be engaging with the truth very often we know this now right uh now marx was extremely critical of the stuff that he would read he would pull it he would pull it to shreds and he would pull out the hypocrisy of of of capitalism and these enlightenment values and he would criticize the living hell of it uh but he was still using that source only right it's not a problem if it uses that source like we still read stuff that's come coming from the west but we have to be able to juxtapose it with the stuff that comes from the place that is actually being talked about marx wasn't doing that uh so i thought that was perhaps not not correct so in in doing that the way that these people are talking about these civilizations is by exporting concepts that are from the west onto these different places um and those and thus the grasp of the non-western european world that marx had uh was largely seen through you know what edward saeed and stuff would call through an orientalist um we're seeing through the lands of the west through through the lands of the master through the lands of the colonizer um i didn't think that was correct and i thought even even more than that i thought that was against the marx's method uh because the the method teaches that we have to interpret things um historically we need to understand the context out of which things arise and the relationships that are taking place in those contexts and in order to do that we need to have a fair interpretation we can't just listen to it what the the theorist from the country that's exploiting uh the laborers and expropriating the resources say right we need to have another conception but uh that's beyond the point uh the point is that we have this unilateral theory of history that goes through uh primitive societies there's one primitive society and then you jump into slave society and then you jump into feudal society then you have capitalism and then you have socialism and communism right or or if you want to talk about it how he postulates it in the gotha program you have the lower and the higher phase of communism so four or five different stages right whatever you want to talk whatever you want to call it um this is something that is prevalent in 20th century marxism right stalin writes historical dialectical historical materialism uh in 1938 and he's giving the five steps the unilateral theory of history and what's the problem with this well the problem is that in in other countries that are not in the west that have different material relations uh going on uh you're expecting a proletariat to arise in order to then have the conditions for socialism right and that that's not necessarily usually the case so that uh that affected how some of the communist parties in latin america engage with with uh uh with these different sort of semi peasants right uh communities right because they uh they sought to proletarianize them and that perhaps might have not been uh the route that marx the later marks would have taken so i'll explain more about this later on but even the concepts trying to uh talk about them as semi-feudal or feudal right what we're doing is exporting concepts that are specific to investigations that happen in europe to the rest of the world i want to make this very clear though this doesn't mean the method is wrong right the results of the method and the method itself are two different things there's a problem when we get the results of the method being applied in one place and abstracted to another right uh that's what marx talks about the metaphysical mentality right that just reifies things and separates it from context that's that's an undialectical way of thinking um but that's not saying that the method itself is not universally appliable right so i want to turn to a book that i have right here um history and class consciousness by lukaks and the first page of what is orthodox marxism orthodox marxism does not imply the uncritical acceptance of the results of marx's investigation it is not the belief in this or that thesis nor the exodus of a sacred book on the contrary orthodoxy refers exclusively to the method all right so in order to be honest to the method we have to apply it in these different areas we can't just say we applied it here and boom the supply is for everywhere else right and that was the problem that that i had that was the inconsistency that i saw in marx when when i saw him talk about uh the unilateral theory of history um he doesn't call it that but the way he goes through the steps it's it's those five steps uh um i had a problem with that i felt like you had to apply the method in these other areas in order to then talk about uh how those different epochs developed whether they were different whether they were the same uh yeah so um now capitalism is special because capitalism expands so from the moment we have mercantilism to the moment we have imperialism we have a universalization of a system a system that seeks to impose itself on the rest of the world the other systems are not necessarily like that right that's why the universalizability of capitalism is something that that um that still holds true that uh content uh that result of investigation still holds true because it's been proven that it expands all over the place that's what we're seeing right now right um but the other stages are not necessarily that way right um so what what uh does marx change his mind uh and this is a very important question because remember that from the unilateral theory of history we devise how socialism arises socialism doesn't arise from a lead from slavery to slow to socialism or from primitive society or primitive communism if you want to call it that just so to advance uh socialism no it has to pass through capitalism because capitalism develops the forces of production um and creates the modern proletariat which is the the agent that has the conditions to emancipate itself and the rest of humanity and achieve socialism so from the way we think about the development the epochs we devise how we think about the coming of socialism so uh there's a problem then if we're analyzing epochs that are specific to western europe as uh epochs that are just universal f box that that it's this way that it developed all over the world um so there's a few texts that that show marx breaking with this unilateral theory of history um i don't want to call them texts they're writings uh they're a letter specifically i'm going to talk about the letter is known people have known about the letter but it's not too well known and then there's a document that had never been published it became published for the first time ever in in bolivia in 2015 i got a hold of the book and i was able to read it um and and what that one is is a a notebook that marx had of notes on one of his friends uh book who was an anthropologist i'll talk about that just in just a minute but where do we begin to see a shift right in 57 we see the grand dress uh he writes the grand griez of course he doesn't publish them uh that's the sort of first run at writing capital and what we see in the grand res is an interesting uh development of a concept which is pre-capitalist formations and pre-capitalist formations and the development of those pre-capitalist formations is basically analyzing uh how that unilateral theory of history really was before capitalism and and here we begin to see certain distinctions that weren't made before uh we don't see this sort of essentialism of each stage so he talks about the germanic tribes and how they worked and how they were different from perhaps other primitive societies and stuff like that so already in the primitive uh side of it we begin to see a change um and of course there's also uh the stuff that he writes about the asiatic mode of production which seems to exist sort of outside of that unilateral theory of history or to the side of it many people have tried to interpret that as a form of feudalism but i don't think that would be uh doing it correctly i'd be exporting a concept of western uh context to to the east um more specifically the clear development comes about or or the process of formulating a multilateral theory of history begins to develop through their engagement with anthropology anthropology largely confirms a lot of the thesis in marxism as one of the things that i've mentioned before uh there's this fantastic text by uh by henry lewis morgan called ancient societies he was an american anthropologist and in this text he's dispelling some of the bigger myths of of liberal uh theory of capitalist theory um and and these are thesis again that the marks and angles are formulating already in the 40s and this book is written a couple decades after right um this book serves as the inspiration for uh for englishes the origins of the family private property and the state and what we see already in this text is angles is not just saying there's this one primitive community no he's distinguishing between different forms of primitive communities he calls barbarians savage and there's sort of pejorative terms maybe but um he's distinguishing that it's not just this one different uh similar stage that takes place uh in the same way and in different places right he talks about the irish he talks about uh the germans he talks about i believe the iroquois as well we'll do a segment on this text uh coming up um uh uh but but yeah so we we see here in the origins the beginning of uh of or the the formal writing of a sort of development of a non-unilateral theory of history but uh um the place where we see it most clearly and most explicitly that's that's that's very important because there's stuff that's implicit that you sort of abstract from it that might carry with some ambiguity then there's the stuff that's made explicit right um the place where we see it the most explicitly is in two places the first one is a letter a letter from vera sasulich she was a russian revolutionary and she communicates with marx at the beginning of the 1880s i remember march dies in 1883 at the beginning of the year so this is right before the man's about to drop um and she tells them in this one letter she's like hey we have what we feel like is a revolutionary condition here you know the the people want socialism we are struggling for it and we have these marxists that are talking about how we can have socialism because we gotta pass by uh we gotta pass through capitalism and capitalism through capitalism is the only way that we can have socialism and they say that this is what you say i mean is this true or what what do you have to say and marx bean marx he writes a 45 page response and then he scratches it and he writes a 30-something page response scratches and and does two more scratches those and he ends up sending a four to five page uh letter as a response and what he says and i'm paraphrasing here but what he says is that the studies of the stages that i did were specific to western europe and he quotes capital remember that capital it's it's basically um the only really major text that's that's published in his life besides uh some of the political texts and and the manifesto um so he quotes capital and he says i am specific here specifically here talking about western europe now what does this mean in terms of russia he says from my studies of russia i see that you have completely different conditions to europe you have a peasantry community that has a collective spirit a communistic spirit uh they're not indoctrinated by by the individualism that that sort of was already spreading within working-class circles um and thus in your struggle against uh against the developing form of capitalism you can achieve socialism you don't have to wait for capitalism to develop and for things to get to a certain stage and then you know you in your struggle from where you're at you can develop socialism because of the conditions uh that are in the community uh they're they're conditions of of of of uh of socialism already we have a socialistic mentality so why not struggle for it now capitalism has had already sort of developed right the the good that capitalism brings along is that it develops the the forces of production like never before in history but he had already done that in europe right um so it was just a matter of implementing those developments in in these socialistic communities right or at least it was seen like that um you didn't have to wait through the capitalist stage and i mean what we found in practice is that socialism specifically in russian the soviet union uh was able to develop uh to industrialize uh as good if not better than capitalism it definitely did so a lot quicker and without having to to to commit genocide to to natives and to um to go around the world colonizing but that's beyond the point that's another topic so he tells her you guys have a communistic spirited peasantry he doesn't use those exact words those are words that are more uh closer to maria therefore in your struggle you can achieve socialism you don't have to pass through capitalism that stage development was specific to my studies in western europe so that's in 1881 two years before he dies around the same time he's engaging with another anthropologist a russian uh by the name of kovalevsky and kovalevsky i believe he was also a student of morgan uh i'm not too sure though but kovalevsky was a good friend of of the marks and angles duo he was always in the house he was always invited for dinner um after marx dies kovalevsky publishes on him which is something that you know a lot of his closest uh friends did and relatives um so kovalevsky was an anthropologist amongst other things and and what kovalevsky did was study these different communities uh anthropologically and what we have the second document that sort of undo's that unilateral theory of history is his notebooks while he's reading kovalevsky's work so his annotations on the margins and and all of that which is the same the same thing that we get with like lenin's philosophical notebooks right it's it's for those of you that are familiar with that basically the same thing uh is what we get with the kovalevsky notebooks right so in spanish it's called la cuarenos covalevsky uh so what is he saying here well he's reaffirming what he wrote in the letters to varus sewelich and what was implicit already in his studies uh that transcended that unilateral five five four to five stage development that he had started theorizing already in in 46 with the german ideology and its implications which as in the communist manifesto we'll see that uh it means that you need that kind of that socialism is going to come about in in in the industrialized nations so uh england uh germany france uh and the us now what is he saying in these notebooks what he's saying is very interesting and it's it's quite controversial and it is that from the spirit of the community in these in these different uh studies that kovalevsky is doing he's saying that they already have the communistic spirit and that in their interaction with the expansive nature of capital if they are victorious they will achieve socialism they don't have to wait for capitalism to implement itself and to fully develop and then you know if they beat capitalism right when they encounter it right when it expands into their area um they can achieve socialism because the community the socialist spirit is already there uh all that's needed is the material development that capitalism was able to to create thanks to exploitation and um but once they interact with that they should be good now this is this is uh this is shattering uh to a lot of uh dogmas that that you know the only way to have a revolution is through the revolutionary agent and the only revolutionary agent is the proletariat right now this might hold true for industrialized countries this might hold true for europe who had a very specific development part of our project is a return to the working class as the revolutionary agent but that's because we're in the us um we don't have the indigenous communities to the same scale that other countries do we don't have a genuine concept of el pueblo we don't have the communes that china had we don't have the peasantry that that russia had and the china had so we have completely different conditions so in our conditions and in the conditions of europe those thesis that he formulated from europe still hold true right but what he saw is that in other places with different developments different sets of relationships the proletariat doesn't have to be the revolutionary agent you don't have to wait for this communistic spirited community to proletarianize develop individualistic values and then wait for them to achieve class consciousness to then have a revolution that they can achieve their own revolution and perhaps even before proletarian revolutions happen because proletarian revolutions in order to happen they require an ideological transformation they require class consciousness which is not just consciousness that yeah we're all workers right it's it's it's a very specific form of consciousness that we're workers and we're historical agents uh uh uh raisins of history emancipating not just ourselves but emancipating humanity um so this is ground shattering because we have a new revolutionary agent uh in a new context right so the thesis that certain communist parties had that you needed to proletarianize these communities in order for them to then achieve socialism uh is not something that wasn't marx at least not in the it marks how he finishes his mature thought now what do we find in the 20th century where has socialism taking place russia with a peasantry china with a peasantry uh cuba with a not a peasantry but it was a semi-peasantry it was this concept of pueblo right it wasn't just the working class it was farmers and uh a campaign that's that's the word in spanish um so what we have found is that socialism has taken place in these third world countries and the agents that have been at the heart of the revolution has not just been the working class the working class has obviously taken a role in it but the revolutionary agent wasn't just a working class a lot of times the the key pivotal class was uh with some other class some more uh feudalistic if you wish to call it uh class um yeah so this is this is dogma shattering information um this is something that that two very important people from latin america uh arrive at without having read that latter marx one of them is maria tegui it's a famous uh peruvian theorist communist the founder of the communist party in peru and perhaps the biggest marxist theorist and latin american 20th century the other one is che guevara who developed the same the same theory that socialism is going to come about through the third world and when the third world doesn't let the metropole continue to expropriate resources from them it's going to create the conditions so that the center the empire metropole whatever you want to call it uh can have its its own its own development towards socialism so instead of being from the west out it goes from the third world in and the empire collapses and i mean we're looking at a world right now where power is shifting east uh specifically east uh to to a country that's had by a communist party uh that a few years ago or a few decades ago would have been considered a third world country and that we're very near seeing it as the most developed nation on the planet on the history of the planet too so um perhaps this thesis it ends up being correct we don't know right we don't want to talk about the the future that much because we'll interpret it uh uh as it comes right we don't want to speculate uh but we if we speculate it has to be based on how things look now um and those are how things look now so uh marx wasn't wrong uh maybe the early marx was but uh as as all human beings we develop and change our perspective and it's uh it's how we end that that usually matters right and and how we end was a marx that understood the world in a much more complex way in a way that was more honest to the method that that he devised the method that allowed for the discovery of of the laws of human history um and and and he ends up with with a complex uh theory of of how we're going to arrive at socialism a multilateral theory that sees that different areas had different forms of primitive communities and out of those different forms of primitive communities different stages arise those different stages took different lengths in order to develop and that they didn't necessarily have to pass through a stage another part of the world pass through in order to achieve the common end of a classless society um yes i uh uh i i hope you enjoyed this material uh this was a research project that i had done uh about a year ago uh and that i took itself almost a year doing um but yes i i if you made it this long i wanted to thank you for for for for sticking along if you want to support our project um last month we we averaged out a hundred thousand monthly readers which is it's pretty insane uh but uh we want to thank you for the support that you've been showing us uh and you can always support us by sharing our material liking the video sharing it subscribing to our channel and if you want to help us financially uh you can sign up for our patreon um there's a three dollar scale and a ten dollar scale so however much you feel like you can that would be helpful as well because we do have a print project and that's uh some exciting stuff that's coming up next month next month we will be releasing our journal of american socialist studies where we're analyzing the history of socialist america through different ways we're analyzing anti-imperialist struggles uh and we're analyzing this history of america that's not toad right on the surface america presents itself as as the the beacon of democracy the first step in every process of radicalization is realizing that that's and behind that is a murderous empire uh but there's an even further step which is the one that sees that behind that murderous empire is history a long history of americans who have fought against it and that's the history we're trying to bring back to light because as good marxist materialists we realize that socialism is not this abstract thing that if socialism were to happen in the us or when it happens in the us is going to be socialism with american characteristics it's going to be specific to our context to our history to our culture um and yeah the same way that socialism in china is seen as socialism with chinese characteristics and socialism in cuba with so with with cuban characteristics right uh there's no abstract form of socialism so that's our project i think it's an unprecedented project i haven't seen anyone do that before at least no one's doing it now um so it's something very special and there's a lot of stuff that i'm pretty sure that no one or not many people have have seen that that we're writing about so that's going to come out in march so uh be on the lookout for more news for when that that comes out and beyond that we also have exciting news that that's going to be coming after the publication of of the journal so um if you want to help us financially uh through our printing jobs and and to help our graphic designers once once we have everything printed and stuff uh the patreon ready really does help um so yeah if you stuck to the end thank you for watching this video like i said i i basically did this video twice this is the second time of me going over it uh the first time i touched the mic and it ended up messing up and the audio was completely off there was no audio so i got pretty mad when i when i was looking back at the video and i saw that happen but that's life i hope that this one uh was good enough though and that i was able to um to maybe uh teach something that that uh or help you think through stuff and and if you disagree with it and if you think that there's material that that goes against me please show me uh as as a marxist i'm not dogmatic if if you think that stuff goes against my my the thesis and and my rating of parts i'm open to to talk about it so yes thank you for watching and we'll see you next time
