I've been chronically ill with endometriosis as well as 51/50'd--it's crazy what people don't know if they haven't been institutionalized or seen the systemic errors of the medical system.\n\nOn average it takes 10 years to get diagnosed with endometriosis--I was \"lucky\" and it took 4 years at least, five at most.\nMy GPs gave me the run around until one day my birth control implant mainly there to stop my period (their only treatment for Endo so far is to stop your period from making it worse)--I menstruated for about a month or more and was literally told I had to wait a month to see someone about taking it out. \"You have to wait it out\" they said, as if it hadn't been working fine until post COVID with pandemic stresses during work. I had to quit my job.\n\nFinally I get a laproscopy. Finally I learn you get implants before you get scar tissue; endometriosis is when your endometrium has ended up outside of your uterus, which they call an implant.\nDuring the laproscopy the surgeon can burn off any scar tissue... They did nothing about that implant, without any good explanation.\n\nIt took another three to four years to see not a gynocologist but a Urogynocoligist to find out it's been my pelvic floor giving me an absolute world of pain. Birth control helps with extreme symptoms like nausea and feeling menstrual outside of PMS and menstruation (truly hell on earth) but I still had very persistent pelvic pain. Not abdominal, but I've had my stomach checked so many times they decided to check on my peeing.\n\nI now know the urogynocoligist knows about the pelvic floor because they're concerned about you passing waist; the gyno couldn't tell me jack or shit about anything because they not only mostly deal with pregnant woman but pregnancy related conditions--they don't have as much expertise about reproductive issues like PMDD or anything unrelated to being pregnant. The urogyno had experience because that's where you get asked if your uterus is falling out--they deal with people who are having trouble.\n\nI just had to rant because it's such bullshit how doctors can speak to you like they know better than a person repeatedly telling them a lot of endometriosis tells and that they're in daily pain. They suck with pain but in general the GPs kinda are almost there to block the door to specialists who know what they're talking about by eliminating all of their possiblities--problem is, this isn't done within a few appointments, it's done with a lot of reminding them WHAT YOUR ISSUE HAS BEEN over the course of monthly visits.\n\nI kinda think a lot of doctors especially GPs were never taught bedside manner because it doesn't exist for certain people.",

Just lifestyle changes, blood tests, change your medication, you would hate a laproscopy and I'm only going to say that as early as possible\n\nI don't remember the GPs mentioning a laproscopy but if they did they made it sound like an invasive surgery with a long recovery time just by their tone. I had to be told by a gyno about the laproscopy, not the GPs who kept sending me to get ultrasounds...\n\nFun fact. Ultrasounds at best can find cysts. You NEED surgery to see Endo because it doesn't show up on current scanners.",

Like you both stated, we'll all be disabled at some point in our lives, and yet we shy away from that language, believing claiming it will be a curse upon us rather than a reason to accommodate and that is absolutely because of our unhealthy relationship to work that has been perpetuated by the patriarchy, the church, and capitalists.\n\nI always love hearing people discuss disability rights, even though the conversation itself revolves around so many difficult, sad, and genuinely infuriating topics.

I had other things present as I was able to fully become myself and having an Autistic kid they wanted to test my other kids and I thought to get tested myself. Suddenly EVERYTHING made sense. \n\nI had no idea though that racism in mental health systems meant BIPOC folk were far more likely to be given behavioral disorder diagnosis over developmental disorder diagnosis. \n\nI've dedicated my life now through whatever position I am working at the time to bettering our accessibility at those work places.

    "text": "Oh, y'all got into such an interesting facet of this topic at the end; I was thinking earlier about the role religion plays in the hyper-individualist nightmare in which we live, which is essentially that it fabricates moral \"disabilities\" that encourage us to marginalize certain groups. Our economy demands an underclass to motivate people to do more than they reasonably/healthily can, under threat of starvation/illness/exposure. Individuals are responsible for meeting our own basic needs, on a daily basis, for as long as we may live. In some cases, disabled people serve as the \"example\" for those who fail to lift their own weight, and people feel more or less comfortable viewing disabled people as a \"societal burden\"- as if we are incapable of meeting everyone's needs if disabled people contribute less. Well- the problem is that that's not true, and most of us are aware of that to some degree. Capitalism as we know it, aka multi-generational wealth recreating a thinly-veiled feudalism, rewards the owning class for taking the lion's share and making the rest of us fight for scraps.\nEnter religion:\nGiven certain dogma, people feel morally superior to the people \"tainted by sin,\" or sometimes it's truly just a patronizing \"oh you poor [lost] lamb.\" Or the demons thing- not the first time I've heard someone dismiss their family member's condition as such. These justify a person's desire to revoke a person's humanity/autonomy, as those people are \"not fit\" to govern themselves, positioning the pious as a worthy authority. From there, people crusade against \"degenerates,\" stripping away basic rights in exchange for votes, then praise the laymen for taking \"personal responsibility.\" Empathy is antithetical to their goals, because they want to rule, not represent. Even if the faithful don't anticipate personally being at the top of the food chain, for them it's enough if they can ensure they aren't at the very bottom- and their party assures them that they're better than xyz minority- non-white, immigrants, disabled, queer, impoverished, etc. \nHowever, such gains are temporary and shortsighted. As long as we stay fighting each other, we are letting the people with the most power and destructive influence to get away with all kinds of inhumanity. Scarcity is manufactured in more ways than one, and some people have lost all faith in their ability to change the system, to the point that we sometimes run to the conveniences of modern living that are part of the problem, and the spiritual practices that distract us from it, like buying a lottery ticket with the last of your money, because we just might get a miracle. Wanting only what's best for ourselves, we leave every marginalized person in the dust, and disabled people are the first people we abandon.",

(I’m my friend’s live in care attendant so his other care attendant is over visiting to help). It’s a humbling experience when your quadriplegic friend says sit your ass down and use your wheelchair around the house lol. I’m used to caring for everyone  else, either as an adultified child or professionally as a PCA/hospice aide/ service industry. I’m trying to listen earlier to my body saying sit your butt down before my body makes that decision for me. It’s a hard lesson to keep learning over and over that I have to take care of myself or else I’m not able to take care of anyone else, but also accept the situations in which I CAN receive care. Anyways that was a whole ramble but thank you thank you for putting words to things and helping to help me name things and release them, I’m sure many MANY people can say the same. I hope you both have some joyful and restful moments!",

It made heavy rounds on disabled / autistic twitter, but didn't seem to break through to most leftist circles. Lots of people outside of disabled / autistic circles defended those policies. \n\nLove to see two of my favorite creators have this beautiful and informative exhange. ❤❤❤",

One of the MANY takeaways for me was the reality that 'if we live long enough, we will have a disability' - that was a word! The other was around language; similar to you Olay, I thought that 'had autism' was the appropriate phrasing as opposed to 'autistic', as I Iikened it to how I was taught to discuss disability:  'people who live with a disability vs. disabled people'.

She had physical & mental/emotional disabilities, before her journey with dementia*. \n\nAdditionally I am caring for my older brother who is neurodiverse, has CPTSD & other emotional disabilities, along with some physical. Yet he is not seen as disabled enough to recieve benefits. We are hoing throuhh the hoops, but it is hard. \n\nNot to mention my own aging body & disabilities (mostly invisible), while ensuring a stable life for my partner & our son. \n\nIt scares me to think of what might happen to my brother (Black male who has reactions like a 12-16 year old boy with conflict avoidance). I fear for any interactions with police or anyone else who thinks he's a threat just because of how he looks (disheveled by society standards).\n\nAgain, i am so pleased that you two have come together & look forward to more collaborative adventures & the changes we can all make for those who are not seen, heard, or cared for with the respect every human deserves! \n\nI love you 💜🙌🏾🌈✊🏾💜",

    "text": "This was such a great interview! Serious stuff, but still had me giggling a lot 😆 I've been thinking about this topic a ton lately and it's a relief to hear people talk about it more. I watched this right after watching the new Contra Tangent on her Patreon about granola fascism and they basically work as companion videos the way they fit together. It has been tough trying to get my mum to just accept that I'm sick and unable to live the life she wanted for me because of that. I'm figuring out how to be okay with it, but she's into a ton of pseudo-medicine and new-agey evangelical stuff so believes in the law of attraction etc. It makes it so she can't help but frame my health problems as a failure on my part, like, something I've been doing wrong that would get better if I just tried and believed harder. She's always looking for something to blame be it literal demons, me bringing it on myself through negative thoughts, my resistance to go to quacks instead of doctors, or my eating habits. It's sad 'cause it stresses her out and creates tension between us, but I don't know how to get her to see the reality and accept it because her whole worldview is built around magical, unfalsifiable beliefs 😅 It worries me that if genuinely caring parents are willing to see their kids as the cause of their own illnesses and disabilities, it's gonna be an uphill battle to get strangers to humanise us more 😬 That said, I'm so glad people like Imani and Olay are making people more aware of this stuff so we have a better chance of changing minds for the better! ❤ It gives me hope and motivation, so I really hope we get to see Imani again on the pod 😍 She's so funny and has regular guest/co-host energy haha",
