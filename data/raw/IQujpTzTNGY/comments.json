Well, it's corruption because the more people that have a hand in your pie (eg building a new housing unit), the more people can make money off your efforts.  Long ago, some politician needed more tax funding or needed to get his friends and supporters employed.  So make new permits and taxes which also comes with new government organizations to oversee those.  Then reward trusted people and supporters to those government jobs created to administer those fees and permits.  More friends need more jobs, no problem, increase the fee/permit cost and create an investigation group to be staffed for administering and inspecting for those fees/permits.",

A couple prominent California companies did publicly leave California for Texas or Florida, but I don't think that had a measurable impact to either states' GDP. The difference is that the median income vs cost of living in major economic sectors of California (LA, SF) vs Texas (Austin, DFW) is dramatically different... The median income is like 5-10% lower in Texas while the cost of living is on average 15-20% lower. In other words, you make _slightly_ less in Texas, but everything costs _dramatically_ less.",

If you don't want to pay or wait until the next scheduled inspection you get a B. A C rating though is something completely different. That place had messed up bad. \n\nSean did talk about something that happened to us once in a different fashion. We had a keg line burst (in the keg room so it was not to bad to clean up) while he was there. He wanted us to shut down the whole restaurant and threw a huge fit.

Only City Maintenance was allowed to do the work because it was Owned by the City, however, she was told that she would be Monetarily Responsible.  Absolutely Criminal Racketeering!",

This is a far better system than requiring a homeowner to do work underneath the street for tens of thousands of dollars. Also, if I were him I would have uprooted that tree when it was planted if its care and maintenance was going to be left for me down the line. Knowing that this is CA they will probably require you to use a cruelty-free arborist for 3x the cost and post notice for the tree to correct its root system too.",

Crazy socialists. I want the freedom to choose contractors, where some brilliant guy can invent something to fix my connection at 20% the cost of the next guy. Or I can borrow my buddy's excavator and trench shields to do the work myself.\n\nThat tree certainly predates this guy's ownership. No city is going to allow that tree's removal. Not even at the homeowner's expense. In fact, I bet they ding him if the dumb thing dies because of his neglect. Maybe a city would permit it if the thing was perfectly centered over a sewer line and causing issues, where CA versus WY also would play a role in the city's reasonableness. Some kind of public notice for 30 days or something is common so that your neighbors can intervene on behalf of the tree. Either hypothetical city would probably require you to plant a replacement or two. I would suggest a male Ginkgo tree.\n\nThe typical tree stuff by cities is quite reasonable, in my opinion. Tree lined streets looks nice, and I don't want my neighborhood's aesthetic wrecked by some jerk neighbor who gets a bug up his ssa about \"his\" trees. Those trees belong to the neighborhood. Pruning the roots sounds like a nice cheap work around for the city to bless, assuming it actually works.",

Typically, the party building has to pay for Right of way permits, pay fees to the public for the closing of any public infrastructure like streets, sidewalks ect. Anytime asphalt or concrete is involved its expensive, in my experience. You need all the equipment, plumbers, an excavation crew, a paving crew, flagging crew, and if there's a sidewalk, you will need concrete finishers. It gets really expensive and fast. My larger question is why didnt gram look into using a sewer packer to make the repair? Where i worked, we would try and use packers when wver possible as if it can be used will save a ton of money and resources. Maybe LA doesnt allow those kinds of repairs which could save millions of dollars.",

Those eleven suddenly passed.\nThe inspector smoked while in the house.\nThe inspector broke my sprinklers and refused to fix them.  The only reason I got them to admit it was when I let them know I had them on camera.  Broke the sprinkler head, and in doing so jacked up the control box.  I fixed it myself for 100 bucks, but it took me three hours to fix.\nThe inspector looked at the main house and filed a complaint that I had an illegal septic.  (I didnt) Took me three months to get it straightened out.  Apparently, the burden of proof was on me.\nAfter the final inspection, received a letter telling me that my property taxes were going up 9K a year because of the added value to my property, and that I owed them 27K in back property taxes because the value of the house had gone up SINCE THE TIME OF PURCHASE TEN YEARS PRIOR.\n\nA 42K project ended up costing me an additional 44K in administrative costs.  People that did absolutely NOTHING on my project were my greatest cost.  Well, I guess the county employees need to get their bonuses from somewhere.  \n\nAll the while, homeless people are smoking meth a mile away from my house and pooping on the street.

There was no way to widen the driveway (which he has been using for the ~30 years he owned the home) short of removing about 6” of his house.\n\nIt took them over a year to get the CoA and it was ONLY because the parking and vehicle access laws around ADUs changed.",
