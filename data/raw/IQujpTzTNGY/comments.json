Well, it's corruption because the more people that have a hand in your pie (eg building a new housing unit), the more people can make money off your efforts.  Long ago, some politician needed more tax funding or needed to get his friends and supporters employed.  So make new permits and taxes which also comes with new government organizations to oversee those.  Then reward trusted people and supporters to those government jobs created to administer those fees and permits.  More friends need more jobs, no problem, increase the fee/permit cost and create an investigation group to be staffed for administering and inspecting for those fees/permits.",

A couple prominent California companies did publicly leave California for Texas or Florida, but I don't think that had a measurable impact to either states' GDP. The difference is that the median income vs cost of living in major economic sectors of California (LA, SF) vs Texas (Austin, DFW) is dramatically different... The median income is like 5-10% lower in Texas while the cost of living is on average 15-20% lower. In other words, you make _slightly_ less in Texas, but everything costs _dramatically_ less.",

Ever try coming in for a blood draw near the end of the day on a Friday? Honestly, the assumption that the inspectors are honest and faithful is a good assumption, nothing would work without it. There just needs to be a culture where the inspectors call each other out rather than cooperatively protecting each other even if they know their fellow union members did something wrong. Probably need some dog eat dog promotion and pay structure where you can get the fired person's position if you can provide the evidence that brings them to justice.

The place we were looking at was abandoned and completely dilapidated. In our naivety we thought we’d get the place at a decent price which would leave us plenty of money for renovations. We started looking into who owned the building and how much they were looking to unload it for.  Turns out the company which owned it left it that way on purpose and used it to report it at a loss for tax write-off purposes.  So the tax codes are so ass-backward that it was more financially advantageous for the company which owned the building to keep it empty and in ruinous condition than it would have been to invest money into it and collect rent from tenants.

This is a far better system than requiring a homeowner to do work underneath the street for tens of thousands of dollars. Also, if I were him I would have uprooted that tree when it was planted if its care and maintenance was going to be left for me down the line. Knowing that this is CA they will probably require you to use a cruelty-free arborist for 3x the cost and post notice for the tree to correct its root system too.",

        "text": "@josephspezia5769, I checked 5 cities. 1 in ID, 1 in WA, 1 in WY, 1 in TX, and 1 in CA. Dallas, TX is the only city that operated the sewer system aligned with your experience. Crazy socialists. I want the freedom to choose contractors, where some brilliant guy can invent something to fix my connection at 20% the cost of the next guy. Or I can borrow my buddy's excavator and trench shields to do the work myself.\n\nThat tree certainly predates this guy's ownership. No city is going to allow that tree's removal. Not even at the homeowner's expense. In fact, I bet they ding him if the dumb thing dies because of his neglect. Maybe a city would permit it if the thing was perfectly centered over a sewer line and causing issues, where CA versus WY also would play a role in the city's reasonableness. Some kind of public notice for 30 days or something is common so that your neighbors can intervene on behalf of the tree. Either hypothetical city would probably require you to plant a replacement or two. I would suggest a male Ginkgo tree.\n\nThe typical tree stuff by cities is quite reasonable, in my opinion. Tree lined streets looks nice, and I don't want my neighborhood's aesthetic wrecked by some jerk neighbor who gets a bug up his ssa about \"his\" trees. Those trees belong to the neighborhood. Pruning the roots sounds like a nice cheap work around for the city to bless, assuming it actually works.",

You’ll just get fees and visits to check safety and it’ll cost you a fortune.”\nI said\n“But I don’t wanna run in 6 months n then the turn notices and I get charges and huge bills,”\nShe said\n“We may notice but won’t do anything; my boss and everyone in town just want a salary. They don’t want to actually DO anything, if you don’t register they just think it’s good because they get less work. But most likely they won’t notice: no one here is competent or cares about doing their job”. \nTook her advice, when Covid came and other businesses were shut down I just kept mine open (jiujitsu academy) and no one came to shut me down. My rival businesses all did so I got their students n made a fortune.",

There's asphalt work, trenching, and maybe a giant tree over the existing line, where they have to do a new tap and undo the old tap. Getting the compaction right as you fill the trench is difficult, where there's a non-trivial probability that the asphalt concrete's patch needs to be redone after a year or something.",

Typically, the party building has to pay for Right of way permits, pay fees to the public for the closing of any public infrastructure like streets, sidewalks ect. Anytime asphalt or concrete is involved its expensive, in my experience. You need all the equipment, plumbers, an excavation crew, a paving crew, flagging crew, and if there's a sidewalk, you will need concrete finishers. It gets really expensive and fast. My larger question is why didnt gram look into using a sewer packer to make the repair? Where i worked, we would try and use packers when wver possible as if it can be used will save a ton of money and resources. Maybe LA doesnt allow those kinds of repairs which could save millions of dollars.",

My grievance would be with their choice of tree. It takes very little research to find a subset of appropriate trees without shallow roots like those. Trees like Silver Maple were popular for spots like that once because of their fast growth I assume, but their roots are terrible for those sites. I would use the male Gingko tree nowadays. It's leaves all fall within a 1 to 7 day time period. You never realize what a nuisance other trees are until you have a male Gingko tree.",

I fixed it myself for 100 bucks, but it took me three hours to fix.\nThe inspector looked at the main house and filed a complaint that I had an illegal septic.  (I didnt) Took me three months to get it straightened out.  Apparently, the burden of proof was on me.\nAfter the final inspection, received a letter telling me that my property taxes were going up 9K a year because of the added value to my property, and that I owed them 27K in back property taxes because the value of the house had gone up SINCE THE TIME OF PURCHASE TEN YEARS PRIOR.\n\nA 42K project ended up costing me an additional 44K in administrative costs.
