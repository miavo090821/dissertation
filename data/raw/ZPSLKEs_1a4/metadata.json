  "description": "Music: www.purple-planet.com\nIn this video I discuss the latest surrounding the Disney+ original Star Wars series The Mandalorian. I of course go over the Anita Sarkeesian tweets related to it, but rather than harp on her as a critic or a person I move on to the underlying critique which happens to be the Bechdel test & how it's actually based on a comic book that was mocking the lack of female representation in film & why it isn't suited for analyzing the medium at all.\nTeeSpring Store: https://teespring.com/stores/actualjusticewarrior\nUse Promo Code DUMBPROMO for 10% off\nhttps://www.minds.com/actualjusticewarrior\nSupport me on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/SeanFitzgerald\nPaypal: https://www.paypal.me/Iamsean90\nVenmo: www.venmo.com/iamsean90\nSupport me on Subscribe Star: https://www.subscribestar.com/seanfitzgerald\nGab: https://gab.com/Iamsean90\nTwitter https://twitter.com/iamsean90 \nBackup Twitter https://twitter.com/AJWSean\nSecond Channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/DudeMonkeyHQ\n\nSources:\nAnita Tweet 1: https://twitter.com/anitasarkeesian/status/1197388822910132224?lang=en\n\nAnita Tweet 2: https://twitter.com/anitasarkeesian/status/1197578501064314881\n\nArticle about The Bechdel Test: https://www.huffpost.com/entry/why-the-bechdel-test-fails-feminism_b_7139510\n\n#Mandalorian #AnitaSarkeesian #IamSean90 \n\nFAIR USE NOTICE\nThis video may contain copyrighted material; the use of which has not been specifically authorized by the copyright owner.
