Also, IMO while she's certainly something like a den mother, she's more properly  a priestess, possibly THE priestess, of the combat-oriented religion all Mandalorians follow. As far as I can tell she's the spiritual and political leader of what remains of the Mandalorians.

Ultimately these big companies want profits.  When their stupid products fail, they are often clueless as to why.  The people making the decisions are in an echo chamber.  There need to be loud advocates on the outside that might eventually reach the ears of those ruining entertainment.  We have confirmation that it works.  Madalorian is better than all previous Disney Star Wars and it is no coincidence that JJ Abrams mentioned the Fandom Menace by name in an interview.  The people in charge of the companies are finally putting pressure on \"creatives\" to not sacrifice storytelling in favor of worthless virtue-signaling.",

The anime is about this tournament that contestants can join in the hopes of winning and becoming Queen. The cast is approximately 95% women. Every episode passes the Bechdel test, so this should be a super feminist anime right? Problem is that the fighters wear very revealing clothing, every fight has some kind of wardrobe malfunction, and there's more naked breasts than a lesbian nude beach party. \n\nAnother great anime example is Bikini Warriors. The show is a collection of roughly 5 minute episodes that spoof classic jrpg tropes. It easily passes the Bechdel test, but as you can tell from the title the main cast are all wearing bikinis and get into some really nsfw shenanigans.",
