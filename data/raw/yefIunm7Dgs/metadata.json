Let's just say it's been a lot in the realm of foreign policy, as president Trump has bombed a Syrian airstrip, and dropped the mother of all bombs on an ISIS stronghold in Afghanistan. In this video I discuss both the literal, and political fallout of these two events, while of course pointing out the silly reaction of some in the media.\n\nSources:\nTrump on Syria: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XQZsyQKcGI&t=23s\n\nRaw video of bombs (Syria): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03oRIVny_40\n\nLawrence O'Donnell Conspiracy theory: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxNIYVmad-k\n\nAlex Jones: https://www.youtube.com/user/TheAlexJonesChannel\n\nCBS Afghan report: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkH9rfv6mQ0\n\n\nFAIR USE NOTICE\nThis video may contain copyrighted material; the use of which has not been specifically authorized by the copyright owner.
