so i voted for biden this year and obviously i wasn't super excited about it i'm a socialist and biden is a neoliberal warhawk or you might say chicken hawk um which is a word for politicians who are more secretive about the wars that they do which is definitely a good description for biden when compared to trump um but like i said i voted for him the lesser of two evils and uh the main reason i voted for him though was because he promised to be the most pro-union president um it's in like 50 years since fdr maybe the country's ever seen i don't know he made some hyperbolic statement um so i want to reflect on what biden's done this or thus far politically um and what he if he's followed through um on his unionization efforts which are kind of the saving grace for me with what i'm looking at and i'm like ah please tell me that voting for this guy wasn't a huge waste of time and i just didn't just get bullied into the position by loudmouth liberals but but i don't think i did but let's watch one of my tick tocks i've made about buy and then i'll come back and talk some more let's run down the biden administration so far real quick we found out his student loan forgiveness plan hardly does anything he changed the name of the cages that we're putting immigrants in he threatened nicaragua appointed a cabinet of war mongers and held a nice ceremony for the people who died of covet young adults are still waiting on our checks but it's nice that you had the ceremony joe thank you and while this is happening cnn is still doing coverage about how trump failed us in the pandemic and hyperbolic coverage of trump's impeachment trials it's almost like cnn doesn't actually care about real issues facing americans it's almost like they're trying to convince you that trump is your real enemy so that you won't realize your true enemy is the entirety of the capitalist class who own both the media and the government alright so let's go in depth a little bit on some of the things i talked about first let's talk about nicaragua because not a lot of people know about this because it doesn't make headline news but anthony blanken who's got some position in the administration in relation to foreign policy i can't remember the exact position but he tweeted at nicaragua at daniel ortega you better change course right away um otherwise we will take action or whatever and what nicaragua did to elicit overt um open public threats from members of the u.s state department very close to the president um was they kicked u.s backed ngos out of the country saying they were backing regime change and that they weren't actual ngos they were biased towards the u.s state department which we know this is what ngos are we know nicaragua's claims are legitimate i mean they have a right to kick these um nefarious ngos out of their country and label them as terrorist organizations but the u.s wants these ngos in nicaragua to do regime change um so they told nicaragua they better change course or the u.s is gonna act soon so he threatened them he's promised to continue or to form a multilateral effort against china he thinks trump has isolated the us in their war against china and biden would like to ally with other imperial powers to to put their boot down on china and stop china from growing and stop china from forming this counter hegemony to western power economically um he's he invited a venezuela coup leader to be his inaugural guest at the white house someone who literally tried to overthrow the venezuelan government joe biden said come to washington dc we would love to have you as an esteemed guest at the white house for what you did in trying to overthrow the democrat democratically elected government of one of our enemies he appointed um someone very close to susan rice who was one of the architects to libya and someone who had defended susan rice and been close with susan rice he renamed the border cages to migrant detention facilities or whatever um we if if you don't know we had a petition midwestern marx did that got something like a hundred thousand or ninety thousand signatures demanding that joe biden release every child from a cage on day one and you know this doesn't seem like that that strong of a demand he promised to be better than trump right trump was this horrendous dictator putting children in cages well biden's done nothing but renamed the cages and liberals and cnn and the liberal media have done nothing but make excuses for him i've talked about this and they said no biden just can't do it right now there's not enough places to put these kids it's like how about put them in a hotel right the military budget 700 billion dollars and you're telling me all we can afford is a detention facility with um horrible living conditions for children who are fleeing war-torn countries put them up in a hotel joe come on lester of two evils baby um we found out his student debt plan was very toothless um i'm not going to talk about that in depth because i don't know about it in depth my buddy james has a great video about it on tick tock i think james ray or james gets political that's his username check it out if you want or just look it up it's actually been reported on in mainstream media how weak biden student debt relief plan is and the amount of cova deaths has hit 500 000 and of course that isn't exactly biden's fault he inherited it from trump and it's mostly capitalism's fault how unable our system has been or how yeah how much our system has failed and how many people have died in this pandemic people are being forced to go to work so they can pay their rent the government has provided no bailout private entities are not just letting their workers stay home because it's safer because they need to make a profit and biden promised to fix all this and and you knew that was bullcrap um because like i said the root of the problem is capitalism you know but he acted like i won't deny covet i won't say it's a ruse i won't say it was invented by china the same way trump was and it's like congrats you know you're not a complete like trump but you've still done nothing to help people you haven't nationalized wages you haven't strengthened osha which multiple lawsuits were filed against osha during the trump administration for people working in meat packing facilities where they would be put side by side on the meat packing line with no ppe no protection to make sure they didn't get covered and then they would contact osha who's supposed to be an agency from the government who protect workers and osha would call the employers this is well documented this was happening all over the country they would call the employers before doing an inspection which they're not supposed to do the inspections are supposed to be unannounced in random so you can tell if these employers are actually screwing over their workers so osha would call them say hey we're doing an inspection the companies would have their workers stand six feet apart put on their pbe osha would come in do the inspection say everything's good leave and then it would be back to normal the next day i'm not kidding you i can link the stories in the description this was happening all over the country did joe biden strengthen osha that's something he could actually do with the executive office he could make a huge push to strengthen osha but he's not going to because his loyalty isn't to the working class it's the corporations um and possibly his worst defense of all of course has been appointing nira tandon and pete buddha judge two of the most condescending wealthy liberals i have ever seen in my life two people whose personalities just really get on my nerves um the way they they loudly condem anybody who advocates for single-payer healthcare and says you you dirty progressives won't you just fall in line with the democratic party quit asking for health care is basically that was basically the campaign of pete but a judge and that's basically near a tandem's personality on twitter it's telling progressives why they're selfish dirty poor people who don't deserve anything and those are exactly the kind of people that biden wants to put in his administration pete said he was going to want build a lot more rail i would love that i'd love to see more high-speed rail he hasn't done it at all so what are the good things you know why am i looking back now and and not you know openly saying i i regret voting for biden because he appointed marty schwartz um marty schwartz marty schwartz is the guitar guy on youtube he does guitar tutorials marty wahl she appointed marty walsh to be his labor secretary and this is one of the very first labor secretaries we've had from the union or from from the unions in like 50 some years or he is the first one in like 50 60 years or something like that and that's good and and i've heard um from some workers on the ground that there's been a little bit more communication um than there has been uh between the trump administration and the unions but ultimately you know our unions have been devastated and they need to be built up from the ground level up and you know most people are leaving union jobs to go be owner operators and work for themselves because because it works better for them and that's how the ruling class knows they can stop the most important sectors of our economy from organizing themselves and really demanding the government do some serious things um at the threat of withholding their labor labor which makes the whole economy run um so having marty schwartz is labor segreg i said marty schwartz again marty walsh's labor secretary is a great thing if he actually does anything right if if we if organized labor is able to gain a foothold over the next four years and then the other good thing is that we are able to shift people's lens from seeing democratic party and liberals versus republicans and conservative party and say no they are the same it is political theater liberal democracy is nothing but a shell for capitalism what you need to see things as is owners and workers it's not democrats it's not left and right liberals and conservatives democrats and republicans it's those who own and those who work that's the only lens you really need that's not true i mean there's still like racial differences and stuff like that but ultimately um as far as enacting political change and and societal change uh the main thing you need to realize is workers those are your friends these are the people we need to organize and then there's owners these are the people screwing you over these are the people who determine how production is carried out meaning uh if they don't want to give you protection during a pandemic they don't have to um and they also own the government so the government's not gonna do it and in fact the government's gonna do things like bust unions um and and throw people in jail to make sure that companies are still profiting off the prison industrial complex and and yeah so we need to be showing people that look biden's the same thing he promised you with all his heart all the liberals said no he's the lesser of two evils he's going to be so much different it's not true he's a a corporatist his loyalty is to the owners and our loyalty needs to be to the workers and the workers need to gain a foothold in this time as much as they can all right so that's my uh socialist marxist opinion on joe biden's presidency thus far i hope you enjoyed it leave comments questions concerns in the comments tell me what you think of joe biden thus far as a marxist which hopefully you are if not you can still tell me how joe biden's doing if you're a liberal uh be quiet all right peace [Music] you
