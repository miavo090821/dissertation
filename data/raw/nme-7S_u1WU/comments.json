But it’s pretty easy to see if we didn’t redistribute wealth then in an unregulated capitalist economy slaves would be the norm and there would be no small businesses except the outskirts of rural areas probably. Money shouldn’t be the motivation for us as humans to do things, our neighborhood and community should be the reason we work hard. If you think that money is the best motivation then I really think you should look at yourself and ask why you are so greedy. Wouldn’t the world be cooler if we focused on building strong communities.\n\nAlso side note businesses of all kinds have more freedom today in many many ways than compared to a decade ago, especially compared to the greatest generations time. So the more we unregulated and less all businesses/rich are taxed the more problems our economy has....",

Another thing, the boom bust cycle that comes from market competition rewards survivors with greater market share, especially as it becomes more expensive to enter the market due to things like regulations or start up costs. There's a reason we went from 1900 car manufacturers to 3, with very few added since then. Starting a new car company is very expensive and risky. Libertarians argue we need to decrease regulation for the sake competition, but that's the wrong direction to take. Regulatory burdens should be subsidized thru taxes, and major monopolies should have their private shares reduced to a minority with the majority shares split between the workers of that industry and a publicly run holding company representing consumers.",

They used their capital power to get state backing. That’s literally capitalism breeding monopoly through political capture. You’re describing regulatory capture and thinking you scored a point 💀.\n\nInternet providers? They bought out local councils, bribed politicians, and used their size to block competition. They didn’t need the government to “force” it bro, they manipulated it. Same with bridges, same with energy, same with railroads. Monopolies form organically in capitalism because consolidation is the natural endpoint of competition. Every major capitalist empire ends with one or two giants eating the market or an oligopoly.\n\nAnd don’t even try to rewrite Vanderbilt. The guy was the government-backed insider of his era. He didn’t fight “the state,” he was the state in a top hat. He used insider trading, political favors, and bought judges. All of this shows that muffrey market ends up devolving into cronism every single time without regulation.\n\nYou’re basically admitting every industry becomes monopolized, but instead of realizing that’s a feature of capitalism, not a bug. you blame the state that rich men own.\nAbsolute denial on copium.\nSee why free marketers live in a utopian or just gaslighting ideology",

That actually pretty damn funny come from a socialist who doesn't understand how capitalism, or the world, works. \n\nI work a good job. I work hard at it. With that job, I make money. I spend money on video games with said money. I like to stream the games because I play so many of them and I feel it's a good way to spend some of my free time. \n\nHow does it feel to be so incredibly useless that you can't help but insult somebody who happens to have worked hard enough to be in a position that they can do the things they want with their life? \n\nBut hey, go ahead and blame everybody else for your own ineptitude. I don't care if you think my content is shit. Your opinion is as worthless as you are so why should I care what some child has to say about me?",

    "text": "I can tell Aleks was begging for a semantic argument against \"voluntaryism\" or whatever, so while I think Eddie's points are better and more important, I will offer a possible argument on the level that Aleks was looking for.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I was super annoyed that he just kept repeating \"work or die dichotomy\" over and over again; that's not really a dichotomy, it's more of a dilemma. A dichotomy is a relation between contrasting concepts, like \"work and leisure\" or \"life and death\" are dichotomies, not two alternative choices in a dilemma like \"work or die.\" Using big words didn't really work out for you here. Also, to really emphasize the dilemma aspect, it would be more accurate to say \"die or be exploited,\" as under capitalism, even your utopian capitalism(1), labor will always be exploited.\r\n\r\nSecond, I would disagree with your definition that an action must be forced /by another person/ in order for it to be involuntary. Isn't it just the case that it is the pain of hunger that /forces/ me to eat, or the pain of cold that /forces/ me to find shelter, or the fear of death that /forces/ me to keep myself alive. If I was invulnerable I wouldn't bother with any of these things, so they are /involuntary./ Isn't it obvious that death is always involuntary? (ignoring certain cases of suicide.) No one would ever die if the alternative was possible or better, hence if anyone dies, they didn't really have any other option, so it was involuntary, and so your definition is too arbitrary and restrictive to cover the real applications of the concept. Furthermore, I would never willingly allow my labor to be exploited, so the \"work\" option, under capitalism, is also involuntary. Hence the nature of a dilemma: the choice between two involuntary options.\r\n\r\nWhich leads me to reformulate a point that Eddie made, isn't it the case that being in the position of the dilemma is itself involuntary? Eddie points out the third option: fight for a better condition for the working class. E.g., rather than a condition of \"die or be exploited\" any worker would prefer a condition of \"perform a small amount of necessary labor relative to the amount under capitalism, and use the new remaining free time for leisure or voluntary labor.\" However, the body /always/ preventing that from happening is the state. So, both options under capitalism are involuntary, and the enforcer is the state. There is no capitalism without a state, as Eddie pointed out, because workers would revolt and create socialism. Is that not a perfectly valid defeater of your argument?\r\n\r\n(1) Market anarchy, just like regular anarchy, is inherently unstable (c.f. Hobbes for some of the early arguments about this), and so even if ancap was miraculously achieved as you say, it would soon give way to state-like entities, i.e. monopolies and capitalist oligarchies, whose interest is to extract as much profit from their workers as possible, i.e. as Marx clearly lays out, exploit and oppress them. So not only is your voluntaryist ethical framework rather arbitrary and immature, your libertarian utopia is less ethical than socialism because it inevitably gives way to a what you call crony capitalism, whereas socialism seeks a condition that is both stable and ethical.",

People don't work in order to \"keep a system running\", they work in order to survive. Just because \"a system is running\" doesn't mean my financial situation is secure. If you think you have enough money saved up so that you don't have to work for like a year or whatever, you can choose not to. I'm not really sure how you can say people work regardless of its impact on their financial situation (ability for consumption). Your entire first paragraph seems to allude that people in market economies are essentially forced to work regardless if they benefit from it, and i really don't see how that's the case.\n\nAlso, this bomb detonation analogy is really bizzare. If the person whose commands you have to follow isn't responsible for the bomb's existance, how is it his fault if the bomb happens to detonate in the first place. Seems to me that it's just an unfortunate situation, nothing to \"justify\" or not \"justify\" here. \n\nThis bomb (a metaphor for the fact that by and large, we need to work to survive) is a product of scarcity, and thus wil be with us forever. Not sure how its an inherent flaw in a free market rather than just a fact of nature. Yea, if you refuse to work and just decide to sit on your ass while not having enough money saved up to live till the end of your life, you can't survive, that's how it's always been because we live in a world of scarcity. The only way to not starve in this case is to live off the produce of others. If a person or group of people voluntarily decide to support you while you do nothing, that's fine. But I'm opposed to strealing people's money without their consent in order to achieve this end.",

Whether that is through the old system of hunters and gatherers, or through the newer system of jobs and careers. It is, 100%, your choice to decide what you want to do with your life.\n\nWhat exactly do you want? To be given free money and items that other people have created so you can live peacefully like a parasite, sucking up all of the resources without deserving it? Make it make sense. \n\nIt is your choice to work or to not work. There is no force requiring you to do so. If you can't get off of your lazy ass and actually do something productive, that is on you. Stop pretending like there isn't a choice in the matter. \n\nYou can choose to not work. Nobody is forcing you into it. You won't get anywhere in life but pretending like it's forced upon you is just a justification people who use to be lazy.",

        "text": "@HardenedH3ro it's not a question of work itself, but what system of work you live in. Saying \"humans have always needed to work to survive, so ANY situation in which you work to survive must be a good system\" is not a good take. \n\nAlso, to say that anyone who questions the efficiency of that system must be a lazy sucker who wants to mooch off everyone else, is also dumb imo. In fact, that's the origin of most leftist ideology. The main criticism of capitalism is the fact that most of the resources get directed to a select few who found themselves with the ability to buy capital.  Simply buy having resources, you can purchase the mechanisms humanity needs to survive, and fill your pockets. There's also landlords etc. You wanna talk about leeches of the system, you're in the right system. People always try to paint leftism as \"I just don't wanna work\" but it's more about questioning the efficiency of capitalism. \n\nBut let's look at something simple like a house. Compare the cost of a home today to a cost of a home hundreds of years ago. In the old days, you essentially could just go off and build a home. All you needed was enough manpower, work ethic, and a forest. It was hard work for sure, but it was doable. Most houses nowadays cost at least 300k. Depending on your wage, thats gonna be about 15,000 hours of work. I'm fairly sure that if you told Abe Lincoln that in order to get a home you'd have to sacrifice 5 years of manual labor, plus some for food water clothes etc, he'd tell you that's ridiculous. And it is. Most people essentially become indentured servants to the bank because of it. Also look what's happening now. Giant conglomerates are buying up homes before average Americans can purchase them. Not only is it driving up costs, but more and more the only option to live in a home is to rent it from one of these companies. But that's capitalism. The haves own what you need, and your only option is to do what they say, or don't get the thing they have. But that's entirely \"fair\" and anyone who questions it is just \"lazy\" for not wanting to do what they say right? \n\nWhat about food? Everyone's gotta work for food right? Well with factory farming that's becoming less of the case. They're making food with maybe 2 or three workers in the facility. What do you think is going to happen if humanity makes the technology to give us every resource we need without labor? They're still gonna charge as much as they possibly can. \n\nIt's kinda dumb having this conversation on your tube lmao. Probably not gonna keep going with this. But that \"if I question I'm just lazy\" attitude is terrible. You should always question a system, and make sure to look for the ones who are REALLY leaching off the system. They want you mad at your fellow american my friend. Idk just keep an open mind. Have a good one",

Like many rightwingers, it's about appealing to authority above all other considerations (including intellect, practicality, reality, or reason), because they know that the dominant hegemony/status quo is in their favor. Mind you, they do this while cowardly saying \"bUt wE'rE nOt fOr tHe cUrrENT sYstEm\" whenever that's a convenient copout for them in the debate. This let's them oscillate between implicit defense of the system and distancing from the system as needed.",

    "text": "For any libertarians or libertarian-adjacent people browsing around:\n\nThere is such a thing that you could call \"communal crimes,\" where every action taken by individuals might be fine in isolation, but collectively the actions create harm. Perhaps the easiest-to-understand example of this is overfishing. Each individual fisher isn't overfishing and might even be fishing a reasonable amount when looked at in isolation, but when combined with every other fisher, overfishing can occur. And harm to communities occurs because of the overfishing. Other examples are things like pollution or discrimination.\n\nAnyway, the point is that the libertarian in this video who's arguing that since no individual \"actor\" is forcing anyone to work, then coercion isn't occurring...is basically speaking nonsense. Systemic coercion can (and does) occur the same way that overfishing can occur. And capitalists take advantage of that systemic coercion to get workers to accept lower wages than the workers would otherwise be able to get (this is proven by the fact that unions are able to counteract underpaying to a certain degree--unions jobs pay more than non-union jobs in the same sector, on average).\n\nLife is more complicated than just individuals acting in isolation. And if libertarianism is unable to take those complications into account, then it's going to allow a lot of preventable harm to occur. Which makes it a failure of an ideology, in my opinion.",

    "text": "Cool debate, but I think you missed the mark when debating whether wage labor is voluntary. I would use the infamous coconut island example to prove that point. \n\nCoercion occurs by changing the consequences of somebody’s actions; for example, if I coerce you at gunpoint to give me your wallet, you are still technically choosing to give me your wallet, it’s just that I have imposed certain consequences on that. \n\nWhile it is true that labor is generally necessary under any system, there are new consequences imposed on me as a result for not laboring, namely, getting evicted from my home. This is a consequence imposed by the system and is not from a state of nature. Likewise, the system makes it so I can’t just go farming or apple picking or hunting because there isn’t land for that.\n\nWhen asked for “who” is doing the coercion, the answer is the police and the owners of the property. \n\nYou could also push back more on the expropriation of the commons, which is another form of coercion and theft. The land in America wasn’t gotten by homesteading, and even if someone homesteads, why should they still own it if they stop using it? The first acquisition of property is arbitrary and problematic for libertarians. \n\nI think the argument about China and co. Faking their COVID numbers seems weird but it’s a point worth engaging with when you get the time. I’d love to see a video segment on it!",

From my libertarian socialist pov, the key aspects of the socialist economy and society that I want to create is transferring the means of productions into the hands of the working class, which can democratically decide about how to use them, the abolition of the wage system, and thereby the abolition of the unvoluntary theft of surplus value. If you look at China today, none of those aspects are given at all. Sure, China has a mixed economy with a huge sector of state owned enterprises, but to me, state owned does not equal worker owned. Above that, the current Chinese system accepts private property, and if you just look at the state of workers in China and how they are treated, I do not think that this is anything an actual socialist would have as the idea of an ideal society. So in a way, when you are criticizing that most socialists argue that what we see in China today, or what we saw in the USSR back in the days, is not real socialism, what you are indirectly saying is that what we are now seeing in China is socialism how you would want it, right? And I just do not see how anyone could say that. What we see in China today basically has nothing in common with what Marx, or even any other socialist theorist, advocated for. Why do you cling so desperately to the idea that you have to defend China? Because eventhough I totally think that you won this debate because Aleks and Bens ideas are just absolutely mental and illogical, you have to admit that they kinda got you at that part. If you read this I would be more than happy if you could answer me, because I really want to understand what your pov is, but I just can not understand it by myself.",

To ignore structural violence under capitalism, is to ignore humanity, and just shows what ill intent all these conservatives / ancaps / (neo-)liberals / and actual capitalists have...\n\nOr maybe they do understand, and they just strategically choose to ommit this extremely crucial piece of information, in order to \"canonize\" and \"adorn\" the brutality of capitalism so that people will accept it as a \"natural\" occurence and conflate it with human nature; ultimately resulting in capitalist brainwashing of the masses, that aims at creating more people that are \"compatible\" and \"subservient\" to the status quo of the Bourgeois dictatorship, whilst denouncing and rejecting every alternative at the same time.",

In our studies we all undergo training on software with databases containing all aspects of materials, including things like carbon footprint, price etc. these software tools allow for materials optimisation subject to constraints. It is in fact part of our job to decide which are the best materials for everything we make. There is a whole field called materials science which mechanical engineers can specialise in. To say that you need \"organisers\" for this is really dumb, since it has never been the job of any \"organiser\" to select materials. The engineers do that, and have to operate within budgets. They can literally do everything themselves AND better if they didn't work in monopolistic corporations that push to cut corners and program obsolescence etc. overall I have a subjective feeling that in my lifetime products have been getting less durable and there is no excuse for this given that technological progress should be what the name suggests.",
