this idea of possibly being some shifting and some movement and and some collectivity on the ground is not completely dead just because of what's going on with Luigi but isn't it the responsibility in a way though of organizers to take that event and shape it into more levels of consensus but sometimes if you even hint at a racial issue oh I don't know if we want to say that I don't know if we want to do that and I'm like how much do I have to give to make white people feel comfortable we are going to create more of these instances if we don't have a narrative that is class forward and really

money hello beautiful black people and happy New Year hey happy New Year hey happy New Year this is my first show of the Year too so thanks for me mine too I I haven't posted anything on my channel in like three weeks which to me is like I've been gone for forever so um we have a lot of different things we could talk about but because we were just talking about it I think we should lead with that racist scene from a movie we all witnessed with kamla Harris where that was so crazy Rebecca sent it to me and I did I was like I actually I'm I'm not shocked that it happened I'm shocked he let us see it happen like it's supposed to be one of those things a story she writes in her like her book and then people say it didn't happen and they try to guess who it was we weren't supposed to see him do it on camera no well see the problem is he didn't make up his mind whether he wanted to stand on racism or he wanted to be low-key racism because the people defending it are like no no no no no because he got a cane and the Bible and this that and the other thing but no he chose stand on racism because he put the hand in the pocket when he put the hand in the pocket he conveyed to you I'm standing on my racism don't try and defend this I want you know exactly what it is I'm standing on full racism and they need to own that right and she acknowledges she does the friendly you know when we're being black and polite like like she was like oh I don't like like when you do the thing to confirm whether or not they being racist like let me go and be extra Pleasant and see oh word word okay all right like and and that was the how how black women have to adjust themselves listen she has the I kept saying this because people we forget you know she has one of the highest literal positions and leadership in the world in the world that's you know forget that she's the first black person to do this um but she has that and they still treat her like girl you low class like you not even he wouldn't even so the fact that she had to do six jobs six jobs y'all six jobs this is her position this is her job what she's doing y'all gotta come to me so I can swear y'all in and here she is doing six jobs to make them comfortable and in her last days too and they're sitting there there the woman comes up all of it like you were saying Reese just walking up there didn't want to give her eye contact then decided to finally look her in her eye and when he looked in her eye he was standing on that racist business he looked her in the eye she like well I don't I don't I don't buy it you know you know how black folks do it and I hate that for us um and her being a black woman at that you know they don't even like women so he you know staring at her and then you know having her for her to have to make that a comfortable thing for them while making herself uncomfortable but making them comfortable and then he didn't give a damn he didn't respond he didn't say anything to her and took the Bible and that that lets me know and was nothing wrong with that other hand was nothing wrong with it he was gripping that cane and nothing was wrong with that other hand took the Bible and then when the Bible was no longer in his hand you know he put that same hand that people are saying there was something wrong with him he put that same hand in his in his pocket to let her know and she had to stand there and then be embarrassed in front of the nation in front of the world on a world stage well see Rea see she took she took the Bible from him because she done already told him don't embarrass me in here cuz I know I know you've been talking to your little friends about what you want to do when you go see K you're not gonna embarrass me in front of here I'm taking the Bible and I'm giving you a free hand and he's and he still wouldn't do it he gonna be in trouble that's all I know oh he's definitely gonna be in trouble because Deb fiser who is who is the senator from Nebraska like what a lot of people don't know is she like barely won and she was challenged by an independent um former labor Union Leader so she's like I don't I don't got room to mess up and as sure as hell I don't want my husband to mess up that room for me and so I think it's just like it's one of those things where it's like I feel like it's like I saw it was you know I feel like one KLA was like well here it is here it is again tried and true but two it was just like that man just like he he wanted to say something he was going to it's like he knows he's not a senator his wife isn't like I feel like he's mad as well that his wife a woman that I he clearly looks down upon is Senator and not him too I think there's like something about him that was just like I shouldn't be second fiddle to any of these women especially not a black woman yeah you know what interesting to your point because they dug up because the internet is forever they dug up the clips of her being sworn in by Pence and by Biden and he was happy I mean he he looked like like he looked like when they bring out the fresh the fresh pastries at 7-Eleven like when you when you there at night and they just brought out like the good Donuts you know I mean that's how happy he was to talk to Pence and Biden in them all of a sudden KLA Harris it's a little you know the energies so you can't say it's you can't say it's a partisan thing because he was kikiing with Biden so right and you saw how he was like the thing about it is it's just purely how he was looking at her like it didn't I didn't need anything else any context like it was so unmistakably he was every time she talked to him you know when you just like you try on a tip of your tongue and say [ __ ] don't talk to me like he wanted so badly he was he was up he was upset inherently like she shouldn't be in a position like she shouldn't be in the position to even do that and child you know I wasn't the funny thing is I'm at the point where I wasn't even upset I actually was like validated and like you know sometimes you when especially when you're in the internet people tell you in such large numbers they try to tell you the world like the sky ain't blue and the grass ain't green like the way people keep trying to tell you racism has nothing to do with the [ __ ] that happen I was like not like a good old racist like like just like red the pain is right there okay I was like great yep that's what I thought you know good so this is what I saw in that though right is that if you look at KLA Harris's reaction okay so one of the things I said like after the election right I was like okay it's one thing that KLA Harris lost she lost to Donald Trump who has the res like literally looked like he was trying to lose and still won right so that's one thing but if you take the like the sum total of all of the attacks that they lobed at her during the course of the campaign for her to come out of that and not f a ways right and not and not be out here calling people out and trying to cut promos when she knows she's about to leave office I said you know going through that and and coming out with some level of Grace is is admirable but as a as a black person having gone through this election season I'm tired of coming out from all of these suffering all of these attacks and feeling like it's incumbent upon me to handle it with Grace and glass and be the bigger person which is why I think so many of us have pulled back that's why you have those Club 92 memes all over social media with I you I'm sure youall seen those with a black women sitting drinking coffee while the world is burning like that's why that exists because so many of us are tired of having to deal with who is this who is this dude who is Bruce Fisher like what have you done right you wonna come up here and and and create a clip that the entire internet is going to see embarrassing me as the second most powerful person in the country right and I have to be cool right I have to I have to be cool I think you know one thing about that that I think is like that's a pattern you see over and over again and I think it's important to kind of just make a distinction that we can point out the fact that the way these folks are dealing with these black folks in office is racist anybody who wants to deny that or try to Nuance it without necessarily validating or caping for the black elected who don't really need us to do that for them because I'm I'm personally not here you know I I consider myself sort of like oppositional to KLA Harris just to keep it that's my that's my particular politics but that doesn't mean that that moment was not racist and the stuff that happened to Barack and Michelle I mean just flagrant people that you see it all the time now folks acting totally out of pocket like how to like and then you know and then somehow things just kind of move forward and so it's it's part of a long pattern to that I think it just like for me it's really about disrespect I think I think very few like very rarely do I feel like if I if I took on every time a black woman was disrespected in the world if I took it if I took it on personally like you wouldn't make it right so it isn't like I you know make a habit of that but there I think there is something very specific about like that's not substantive about pela it's what she is I think like as an educated black woman or as a lawyer like things that I like relate to and then you see someone at the highest you know what I mean and it show it just conf confs for you that there's no height you can reach as a black person especially as a black woman and not not just be disrespected or be disrespected on a world stage but be expected to endure that disrespect like to what Reese was saying like that is so frust I feel the same way as like I hate that black people are always graded on how graceful like we endure something like that's always like you know something you're applauded for but at the same time I can't say that she should have done anything differently because had she in any way had any kind of reaction she would have been including black people black people would oh that's not the way you know what I mean blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah like she would have been Relentless criticism like I remember during the election I walked by um I was at barstone Mountain and I walked by these two old white men on the bench and they were both talking about how comma can't speak and I was like wow you really like it don't matter what's happening in real life you know what I mean like it doesn't matter what the facts are what reality is what the debate was she could be as educated as this a whole and they just say [ __ ] and people who say that [ __ ] in Mass I'm like I don't even I can't imagine what it's like to take disrespect on a on a level that big and that's not because that has nothing to do with on a personal level on comma it has nothing to do that's just purely off the strength of like wow it's just it's just uh it's disheartening I think is what it is it's very disheartening but um Everybody hit some great points but this is the conversation that we have to have even when we try to rest right we that whole picture with the people on the balcony with the world burning you know all of that we we want to be there but we had to like it was like I said yesterday on threads it's like a bat signal for black women who had to come out and say that was racist I no no because we know what you're gonna do that was racist that was racist so Us coming out to do that but it it sucked but we had to come out and say we've all experienced this as women in some way shape or form I remember I remember working um when I first got into politics about 10 years ago but I remember when I first started working in these these white folks they were my my bosses and well the woman that he was married to she called herself Olive but she was white presenting but you know I remember having to deal with them and being the only black girl in the black woman in that space at the time and they sat me down they didn't they didn't Ben Benjamin Dixon um was my co-anchor and we were all sitting together and the way that they treated him was different from how they treated me even though they were so racist they literally told me that on M I say the story all the time cuz crazy they would treat me often very very different they paid me less all the things and every time I would have to go into the room I would have to present a certain type of way and I remember being disrespected by the white man that owned it and then he his wife chimed in and they all said that the white men who watched me they said that I presented as if I was on BET but they watched me on mute not knowing that I actually for that Network gave them all the numbers okay at the time and but they didn't respect me in that way they were like well uh they watched you on you they were just watching how you speak with your hands the way that you uh wear your nails how you have your hair and they say that you present as bet and I just needed to know what that meant right and I'm in the room and I'm like no one is sticking up for me so Ben had to come out and speak up for me because when I was even speaking myself they were they were talking over me they were talking over me they were acting like I did not exist in that room and that it's a very defeating feeling after all the work you may try to put in or whatever and they look at you still like you could never ever you can't you you you you don't meet the standards for me to even speak to you even though you're growing my business um and we need your gift we need your we need your talent we need your expertise we just I will never look at you as an equal or as somebody who is above black people are always treated like when we're good at something they always find a new word for charismatic like they're like Entertainer I swear to you like that's like if you're fit something as a black person when they explain why it's always like The Vibes you know what I mean like they I'm tell there a real thing like I remember like and even in law school let alone in actual practice like when I would beat like and like way outperform like some white guys in a mo Trial Competition the way the the like the instructor or whatever lawyer or Professor would go out of their way to try to like convince the white boys like they are special like don't just it she's just really entertaining or Dynam some kind of you know what I mean charismatic like I'm whooping this on the law like you know what I mean the words they come with always about making it not about work not about skill that you built and and internalized not about you know what I'm saying like they just like oh like it's like you just woke up and can play your instrument like that like come on you know what I mean like you just like you're just you know what I mean like a like an entity like oh like they just for whatever reason you know they just have it like it's a it Factor as opposed to you actually have any like discernable skill sets of any kind tell you what I listen to you everybody got something to say well no I I would just listen and and she was just so explosive you know what I mean like she just has that that natural Genna sequa I don't know what it is naturally she she got them fast twitch muscles you know what I mean them fast twitch she just come with it no you you on to something that's exactly right they do that with sports and they've always done that with sports it's not how smart you are or anything like that right the black quarterbacks they're athletic right they're they're not good passers or what they could be great P they do that with Lamar Jackson all the time he's an excellent passer right right he he's an alltime quarterback but they still athletic I know he's athletic don't get me wrong but then they'll do stuff like even back in the day I remember they did this with uh cam Cam Newton and they said the same thing he's athletic and I'm like dang him and Tom Brady run similar 40s he actually is not that fast but just because he black he is it doesn't it doesn't even matter and this exists in you know regular people's life no matter how articulate you might be or whatever the case may be it's so frustrating when you're talking to someone white folks and they act like you're speaking another language when you're really speaking theirs and I'm just sitting here confused what part of the English language that you not understand I I don't know I'm so I'm so very confused to what you're talking about you know you could get all the accolades that you you have all the degrees that you want people are always going to assume that you didn't get it on your own Merit there's no way that you could have done it there's no oh you you in grad school you doing what what well then I never knew any blackies did that there's no way you could have somebody gave that to you that made me think a couple of years ago I ran into like a a former colleague and they said something to me like uh some no this is exactly what they said I know just what the they said they said oh I wish I could like get on TV like my personality like that's what I be doing I just my personality like I'm like that's so crazy but that's what they water it down to right like if it were other people like oh you're a great political comment your takes your content creation all this to the next thing but if you're you're black the oh your personality they just like you you're a Persona like that's what you that's what you are that's so true I there I could go on forever about this whole entire topic sometimes I deal with situations at work where two different individuals are like so what are you doing with your hair now if I said what you doing with your face I'd be wrong I'd be wrong I'd be in the office I'll be at HR because I'm just like what kind of question what do you mean I got a afro right now and I might have uh a Twist tomorrow I might have braids I might well have whatever the hairstyle I want to have what kind of qu what do you mean what am I doing like it's undone it's unkempt right and you can just make these inflammatory statements and if I say anything I'm the problem but it's also because like we're I mean this reminds me of a lot of conversations I've had at different communities as well but like one is that like we're not allowed to we're we're we're supposed to be a monolith right any any any identity and we've seen this with the recent Vic rant about my God I mean I can't wait to like talk about that because he literally said I'm sorry I have to divert for a second but he said that the whole country work watched Corey Matthews and I'm sorry but I I feel like everybody watched tapena on boy beats world like nobody knew nobody wanted to be Corey Matthews anyway but like it reminded I was like like definitely yeah Eric in the early seasons was fine in the early Seasons but nobody I was not like oh I mean Corey was the like like the the C in a sense like you know what I mean like anyway but it it just reminds me that we we are not allowed to be all of these things because I get the opposite as somebody who I was a high school dropout I have you know a GED but also have been able to work on campaigns and have these accolades or whatever and people be like oh my like people be like oh where'd you go to college I'm like I didn't you know High School job and they'll be like oh but you're so eloquent as it right it's like it's like the so it's and it's like the opposite of like oh you didn't work for this so how did this come about I don't understand you right and it and it's all because of the the like the monolith with they we're in like Laos are supposed to be a certain way right like all these different like all of these folks are supposed to be just the the way that they picture and how the media portrays you in you know um portrays us and that's all that like that's the Simplicity of what people want they don't want the they want to be like oh yeah all black people are this or all black women are this and all black men you know like can't take care of kids right like that's the stuff that they want to simplify us down to and we see that in a day-to-day basis and it does not matter if you're the vice president of the United States you can't be two identities which is wild as somebody who's also two identities like you know she can't be black and Indian which she is right you can't be have a law back CR you can't do this and you can't be vice president um and that's it you know it's just like at every level this is it doesn't M like you could go you could be working at McDonald's you could be working at the White House we're all GNA be seen as the same you black woman you black you just a black woman and black woman sometimes it's like like Olay you mentioned that we it's the grace part of it so even when I was writing about it yesterday on threads I'm like I have to put that she I have because she did I have to put that she did it with Grace she took it with I got to because that's what she did and every time I write that I get so upset because let me tell you something I don't like being viewed as um you know the moment it could be 363 I'll give about that I'm always coming into work I'm presenting well I'm giving you guys what you need I'm I'm doing all the things and then I turn around because I'm sick of it and then I turn around I'm like you know what I'm not going to do that I actually don't feel comfortable covering that particular story because I feel like now we're we're we're focused fing tooo much on X Y and Z and I would rather focus on this and they're like oh my God you don't have to be so angry about it Rebecca did you have to yell about it and I'm like you see this what I'm talking about I don't like it I don't like that we have to keep coming in with Grace the moment that we highlight something and say this is racist or have to you know say you know this is uncomfortable for me or whatever that's going to make us the angry black woman and I know that that olay's experience with that I'm pretty sure you have nelini and I'm I I get that often times when I first got into politics they wanted to they put me they condensed me down to just not even a journalist but they literally said um black Barbie she doesn't have any points she's just a she's just a Barbie she that's it she's just a Barbie they don't want me to speak have her speak here and don't let her speak anywhere else and I'm like no that's not cute to me that's not I I'm literally skilled for this so I'm not going to let you guys condense me to that so I had to fight my way all my life I had to fight I had to fight my way to somewhere to make sure that they don't just leave me at black Barbie because I'm that's not what it is um because of what I look like or whatever because I'm a woman in in this this space where I was just surrounded by men at the time but I don't like that we have to what don't kill us you know make us stronger you know we we took that we didn't we didn't go there and and act a fool because considering like if we say that we're uncomfortable with something or if we say I'm not going to take that we do a little neck roll you know we give a little Stern eye now we're out we're at no we're we're angry we're black we're coming in and and we're um you know we're out of order when we maybe you shouldn't have and sometimes a older black person may say maybe you don't have to you you you don't got to do all that you don't got to be like them and it's like I don't want to I don't want to be like that I want to be able to go in like Karen over there who literally is burning down buildings in Mexico cuz they wouldn't let her into a club that what happened happened it was in Puerto Rico where I'm like where Puerto RTO Ric Puerto Ric was like they get to they get to do whatever they want I miss that let me tell you what happened so this older white Karen woman was at you know Club they told her to leave they were like you you being too rowdy you've been drinking too much as a club can do um cops came uh escorted her out and said look like you know you your your place is right there like she was like this is where I'm staying your place is right there and this woman came back again with well no before the canister she came back again without the cops there to be like I don't know why y'all did this blah blah blah but then they closed and then this woman came with the canister and burnt the [ __ ] down burnt the place down burn and now she's on the business businesses because in Puerto Rico a lot of our business are really CL when they don't get their way CU they're not to it you live in a world that prepares them for it oh then she flew home then she got on a plane oh yeah and flew home to Missouri and that was maybe that was what a week ago two I don't know but it was recent but far enough that she got to get on the plane yep and go home and she wasn't arrested but the feds did go to her house I believe it was yesterday they went to her home um to for questioning and investig um I don't know from when I seen it yesterday to today if there was an arrest made but the feds Puerto Ric she never make it out the Bahamas they had to put her and forget about that same thing with bise but but the thing about Puerto Rico is Puerto Rico actually she went missing Puerto Rico did try to find her the way that she got to the airport was like this sneaky sneaky way like she changed her flight she had somebody else with her now also Puerto Rico's infrastructure is like there's like no airport security like there's not like you go to the airport you're like where am I for like a major travel place so like they don't have the in I do not know if they have the infrastructure for all of that but Puerto Rico put out and the and Puerto Ricans contacted missourians to be like if she comes home y'all better arrest her because this is some up [ __ ] um but yeah this Karen just set the whole place on fire and multiple businesses and there is a GoFundMe uh that I like I've been tweeting about out there so please please if you can try to raise the GoFundMe because they're they're raising it collectively together for all of the businesses you know oh the go okay so the GoFundMe was for the businesses you say GoFundMe automatically automatically I'm like she got a defense already she might have one but I'm saying that there is a a Puerto Rican GoFundMe it is it is valid it is real and they're they're collectively fundraising for all the businesses on the Block that got and they'll say for her she just had a bad day they didn't why didn't they let her in it was New Year or something oh no cuz cuz Rebecca she had taken an ambient she had taking an Ambi in between the second and third time she went back and that it you know yeah I was just going to say right speaking of what white people do when they're indignant about something let's talk about [Laughter] Luigi oh man y'all see my little care be care we do got to be careful Italians though they're about to make them not you know they're about to make the people of color again Len words carefully before we have a a substantive discussion because I I I'm going to put out a video like where I wrote my comprehensive educated you know well thoughts and I know people love him and they deeply invested in all of this right but like I will say just as my pure jokes in my soul like when I you know you know the little rumors about like oh that he had back pain or whatever and stuff I was like I'm like as a [ __ ] with scoliosis and breast bigot in my head and C chronic back B who the way if I and they have denied M specifically like to go get a breath production if I had shot a had I shot nobody listen I listen I I will say like listen I'm all down for we gonna have the substantive discussion but I will say generally just generally the ease with which white men can be radical Iz to to kill and in general I find unsettling I for any reason white boys get upset and say why I UT you know what I mean that's a good point I never I didn't think about that that's a good point that like this dude went from because if you look I like quite as I went to um Junior High down the street from where he went to Junior High at Gilman in Roland Park which by the way Tupac was in school at the same time as me I just realized probably but long story short that school is you know like it's like if you go there you're on a path to become a conservative white dude you know and you're like out of nowhere this dude goes from like I'm Ian say out of nowhere but you go from like on the path everything's happened to like I get offended like to connect the dots between that white entitlement you know what I mean you know that's crazy and that's that's like deep on my it's like listen I understand to the the short the short version is I fully understand why people are not sympathetic to the CEO got that that makes all the sense like everybody everybody most people in this country do have a terrible relationship with the the health insurance industry so obviously people are going to get that they understand why um you know they're ins sensed about that I get it I fully get it and I also get that like you know um people people feeling like you know certain kind of radical actions inspireing people and that's you know you're free to feel that too so when we move back past that I'm like this General level of like people are talking like he is experiencing an un unprecedented treatment in the legal system and that's nuts they're like I'm like that's not true like especially in New York City like I know for a fact how New York City's criminal system operates and I'm like listen I he how do how do how do I even put this it's like oh my gosh I for me for me personally from my own from where I sit my vantage point when I think of just like how I feel about anything in life in general I just wouldn't care about this case right the reason the only reason I even have any care is that somebody in New York City that Advocates against things that will be taken and weaponized to increase police funding so I don't love the idea of a white guy getting upset traveling to New York City where he doesn't live to shoot somebody to shoot a well-to-do white man in Midtown because now you have handed the powers that be something that they're going to exploit to the detriment of black and brown and poor New Yorkers like not the Luigi's of the worlds right so like that's how I feel about it in application but I do substantively understand I don't think that shooting a CEO is going to lead to systemic change to the to to to healthcare I I don't I don't think shoting a single CEO now that being said I I I do understand a level of like inspiration and inspiring a generation and different people and you know people now wanting to like fight against like what what's happening with Healthcare and explaining those and giving that pushing that to the Forefront and all of that but just the general kind of like lionization like that's happening and this like celebration him I'm like I'm you know I'm not personally feeling it but I don't want to like yuck anybody's yum I don't care you know what I mean I don't think it's harmful if people are very excited about Luigi I just think i i i those are my thoughts and I also and I just disagree with this General notion that people are using it to say as like proof of Cl class solidarity because I'm just like no you know that's a point are we actually are we actually having class solidarity or is this just something that's happening because that's something I've been seeing on social media for sure is a lot of people talking about it okay so you guys want to pass universal healthcare I don't know that they do that's that's that's exactly what I'm getting at like what are we going to do to be able to coales and you know uh create some sort of unity some sort of uh Coalition and stuff like that to get these things done what can we do as well to potentially shape a particular narrative and create some sort of collective that can get something potentially done I'm not convinced like I hear people say this they're full of contradiction to the point where I don't know I don't know hey I so I would say that like if it was on its own I would agree with you but we all we have been living in a a period of time since 2020 where there was the great resignation there have been the mass mass strikes there is a level of class Consciousness and class solidarity that we are seeing more that we haven't seen since the likes of Occupy Wall Street you know like and and that is that is a fact like we have it we I think during the fres Trump Administration we left class and and the left did left class behind and went into over identity issues and I don't have this like I'm not a I'm not I'm not a class reductionist and I'm not a like oh let's put identity to side I'm just like there is a world where we can do both but I do think that the larger moment right like this is bur this is coming from Bernie talking about Healthcare this is coming from people dying this is coming from you know folks with disability saying you're not going to take the away the Ada and doing direct action during when they tried to take it away and they didn't cut Healthcare right so there are I think that there is there this is from a broader thing however to me what this is actually is saying is that when we don't have a class move class forward movement which we do not right now we do not have a full uniting class forward Movement we have a bunch of people talking about class but a lot of people blaming immigrants and a lot of people blaming you know like black people and blaming guns and then a lot of people blaming CEOs and then a lot of people being like well if we just had a Utopia you know like there's just like all of these different projects you're you're exactly right United narrative and I think and that's the problem that's what happens we we we create Luigi's we are going to create more of these instances if we don't have a narrative like like an actual movement that is like that is class conscious that is class forward and it's just like it is on organizations it's on organizers like me but it's also on like our people to get it together and really have a Frank conversation about class I 100% agree with that because the same people let's say I agree hypothetically uh FBI agent whoever is listening that I agree with uh what Luigi did and stuff like that there are other people who agree on that same thing and they might turn around and kill some migrants the same exactly you see what I'm saying we not on the same page the point said about like creating more Luigi's right if you take Luigi like what the reason for out of it like what we're saying is the reason white boys get incensed in America and shoot up the place or kill decide to kill somebody often we see manifestos and blah blah blah just for different reasons the difference here is that people agree with the reason that's put forth but we see this often right like and so to me that speaks to a different issue what I was saying to my original I generally still find that unnerving and for me I I agree that there is a greater class Consciousness and I talk about this I think there are a lot of people who would support Luigi and be behind it even if he wasn't if he wasn't um you know what they are perceiving as a very handsome white guy right like if if that wasn't the case because there was a lot of support for him even before people knew the identity of the killer although they did know he they did know he appeared to be white um for me I think oftentimes there are these moments in American not American history because my American life right like my life here like it happens when people appear to be in lock and step but they are not truly and then in a couple of years when they don't get more to what Jan was saying do you support Universal healthare do you support these things people act like something happened like there was a fractor disconnect between the moment we all agreed and this thing not happening but we don't all agree and that's what I I for me it's like the same thing with like in 2020 people perceive like oh everybody's on board with like the police and defund the police and systemic change they're not they're not they're against this horrific video they're seeing of what happened to George Floyd they're against this particular thing but they're not in agreement overall with the system it doesn't represent the solidarity you think it it it does and that's to me what Luigi because if Luigi had the identity of somebody if Luigi were one of us if Luigi was you would not even have reported to us what his alleged his alleged motivations were they wouldn't even have given him the opportunity to be in the minds and hearts of the people but it will also be a massive faction of people that are saying yeah yeah yeah they're all behind him for the reasons now that would not with him just off the strength and they would be actively against him so that's what I'm saying I I guess I want to caution people to not think what appears to be true consensus you know what I mean and true solidarity like I think we we have to be mindful with that because we always set ourselves up for disappointment and the minute people get disappointed the minute the first opportunity to do something like major and when it comes to healthare doesn't pan out people will go oh I have Ally fatigue I'm defeated it didn't go what happened what right wrong and they'll now devote their all their energies to discourse about why their upset things aren't happening rather than like toward something I guess isn't it the and I agree I I just want to be crystal clear I agree with what you're saying and as usual this is the smartest conversation I've heard on this topic it's just like I'm you all kinds of things I didn't even think about like the angle you mentioned specifically about now what is the how is the criminal punishment bureaucracy going to emerge in result of this who's going to Bear witness who's going to Bear the brunt of that all those things but isn't it the responsibility in a way though of organizers and people who have a more radical analysis to take that event and shape it into actual more level of consensus in other words like we can indict the public for not already being there but historically when Consciousness is Shifting often it's because something happened to someone some that somebody can identify with right you know in the case of for example in the cases of black people with police it's often sadly it's it was at first the respectable black people that got when they something happened to them you know what I'm saying people who were like unarmed Etc people could rally around that not other folks and then you have to then move to the point where then people can rally so I think absolutely I feel like that I feel like we to overestimate what this means is absolutely we should caution against that and yet I do think you know um and again I you know I I want to proceed carefully here for those who are watching I mean I'm excited not necessarily that people are get anyone anyone is killed but I like when contradictions are exposed in a way that like every people can recognize the contradiction you know what I mean people can recognize that maybe um you know this particular class of people are not the people we should really be empathizing with so those things are good but that's I'm in full agreement with what we're pointing out here which is how do we get there you know I mean so I completely agree jendra like I absolutely think people should take it and build from there the problem or to me what I worry about is when people do it from the wrong premise because what happens is if you build if you start from the premise that everybody agrees we got solidarity and everybody's on the same page then you're you're working from the wrong for you're working from the wrong place makes me nervous is I want people to expose contradictions right but I want people to expose the right contradictions like I'll see people like they make these comparisons like oh he's being charged with terrorism but the this person somewhere else whatever isn't being charged in New York City they charge people with terrorists foring up a score during a protest like you need to make you know what I mean these kind of comparisons like you have to recognize how the system already treats people less privileged than him you can't go and then present it like this is the system doing like if you really want to get people to like be you want to expose them the the contradictions to them you want them to understand the system you need to explain to them that this what you're seeing right now this is the kind of [ __ ] that's happening for people who doing way way way less than this this is the experience that black people and brown people are dealing with in New York like even hearing people talk about like oh he should you know get a Mis child because of the purple walk and all of this I'm like you need to understand how the criminal justice system works in New York and in these places they regularly weaponize the media and publicity and the Maring them taking cases and stuff and doing this to harm people that's all the time so my problem is I need you to take this and say look how [ __ ] up the criminal system is that even with this privileged white boy and yada yada y look at what they doing imagine what they're doing but what people are instead going is this [ __ ] ain't never happened before or this is so shocking yes I'm so shocked that they charged him with murder and terrorism when he shocked that man in the street like no no you can't you can't but the thing is the Fe the glorification right and I feel like we we we walk a fine little line with that because it's immediately when it happened it was like bet you know they out here I'm like no guys this is problematic because we got copycats we live in this world where everybody's on social media who wants to like let's be what are are you really like you guys have pointed out what is are you really upset um or are you really like uh excited that this is going to bring out a highlight of of of what's happening in the Health Care system did you do you really want that and I feel like people are just on it for the fad of it I don't like when I get online and and again for me in my house right person personally uh he ain't even that fine um and we are so focused here we are so focused on somebody who's very mid and making that such so he's prison Bay and that's the focus like I think people are taking the fact that he's like literally he's so fine make him you know Luigi for president he's people's um avies now they're focusing on this um you know Sensational the sensationalism of him and I don't like it I'm like there is an ual issue at hand we got to talk about something here even people with large platforms I'm like not you sis you posting up how fine he is and how you want to see him in prison Clos when we know we need to talk about the criminals justice system and what they going to do to this white man and what that would look like if it was a black man we have like why why are we there's so many different things that we can talk about in this and y'all just own here with your two million followers just going with The Fad to get the numbers because he's allegedly fine let's be for real like there was there was a crime that was committed um you know about his about his personal situation but so many people are like Luigi who can't get on no bus or can't get or can't do this and can't go confront no such and such you know we seen John what it John Q the movie and and we saw what what can happen when black people are outraged but we also see that it won't lead to that person being some kind of prison Bay or this it's going to be bury him under the jail somebody died that was somebody's father that was this that was that M and like yeah there's two things well what somebody already just used the words denied disp Emily in Boston and she got arrested she just used it as a as a text message so that's one thing like you're also Now setting a standard that people are going to follow who she didn't realize that her words but were going to be used but this is what happens with criminalization second yes I agree that it's our moment to to like to to educate but also shinari like I think the thing that is struggling with me as an organizer is like all this time the make America healthy again Maha has been and and RFK have been pushing all of this health [ __ ] and we're not talking about that [ __ ] that's actually GNA be policy and all we're talking about is Luigi and so we don't even have the opport the opportunity so we're actually not talking about like this Maha movement that's like wellness like literally like look I this is Lexapro I love love it I need it every day they want me to go to a farm and not take this no more and work the land Absolut and that's what they're that and so we're ignoring all of them and they are also like kind of they're like talking about Luigi but not so much and that's where it's like we're also being kind of like out chest moved where we're focusing on this Sensational moment but if we really want the moment to be about Healthcare all these [ __ ] are out organizing us right now excuse my Lang well that's just real quick first of all I agree I'm you know I look I I receive everything y'all saying I I just want to point out though that the issue about wellness and how people like I have you know people in my community who I love and don't want to cast as you know but like you know there's other reasons why people buy into so it's a whole another front of struggle yes but um but yeah I mean yeah so I mean but anyway go ahead yeah I agree I hear y'all you know I mean well what what I was what occurs to me about all this is when it all went down there was this idea of maybe there could be some substantive change maybe there could be a movement that grows a little bit more class Consciousness and in my opinion uh class solidarity is really up to middle class and lower class whites it is really the ball is in their Court in order to play their position they have not played their position for quite some time in fact I won't say quite some time since the mid-60s when there was the the the the party shift because the Democrats pushed the civil rights movement and voting rights right they have not played their position since then this was a moment which broke across political lines and people were reacting based on their real life experiences not based on the boogeyman who they told you to point out the window and look at so my thought coming out of this was this actually could have some positive it could Capital C could have some positive ramifications am I hopeful hell no because why would I be hopeful like there's been so many moments where things could have had pos positive ramifications and they didn't so I'm not hopeful the other reason I wasn't hopeful is because we have extremely short attention spans yes and and one of the things we know about our current political political climate is they throw stuff against the wall right we're going to take Greenland we're going to take Canada we're going to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico all real life things that have happened this week right so they're going to you know the news cycle is so massively quick that I don't know that people actually have the wherewithal to stay with this for an extended period of time that being said over the holiday we saw this Civil War go down in Maga between these h-1bs where they sitting there thinking that the new Administration was going to stand on business when it came to immigration we was up here holding up Mass deportation signs we know what both of those words mean we holding up Mass deportation signs we think that's it and that's all now it's all of a sudden all these carve outs and and caveats that you have for Elon Musk and Viv gr Swami and all these other dudes right now you have other people hopping on top of that train talking about wait a minute it's a whole lot of a whole lot of billionaires in this cabinet y'all notice y'all notice how many of the B now now why they didn't realize this in October right why they didn't see this in August if is a conversation for another time and I yell about that in the shower still to this day like that just just put that to the side that it took six weeks after the election for them to realize exactly what they did that being said this going to be that's a reinforcement this whole immigration issue which is not going away that's a reinforcement of the kind of ideas that creates the kind of class Consciousness that we were talking about with this Healthcare thing with Luigi so this this idea of there possibly being some shifting and some movement and and some collectivity on the ground is not completely dead just because of what's going on with Luigi it has it has legs going into because if we if we if we being honest if we're being honest he's gonna keep moving for his people and so it's gonna be up to the it's gonna be up to the the right Wingers that put him there to decide whether or not they are going to actually stand on business or whether or not they will just evolve and shift their politics based on what exactly they see is happening from the White House well the split's already happening right like I mean the whole hp1 Visa fight um where viic and Elon seemed to be very like you you had it was a wild day on the internets where an couter and lur lumer were making sense in some sort of way I was very much like did I take acid like what what is like what is today I was off from work so I was like maybe I took an edible I don't know but like and and and and I think that it and it and it it is I mean the co like this is the thing coalitions aren't don't always last right and their Coalition was always Frau especially when you take in billionaires that you need to win an election because it's billions of dollars now or a presidential election and you marry them with some white working-class people some white middle class people and then a lot of black and brown men that were targeted with misinformation for a decade um and I think that I think that that this is where like I mean this I think that the immigration fight along with some of the class solidarity but I think the immigration fight is like the big like the place where we have to start to unpack where this is about class and it's not immigrants fault and I think those are the opportunities that we have to talk about class solidarity cuz like I mean even in New York like I was I was spending a lot of time there but like you know I'm a couple I was a couple stops away from from Coney Island on the F train from after you know um they you know burned a woman on it and it's and it was tragic and sad and all of these things and like and also like you've got working class New Yorkers who are black and brown who actually like are children of immigrants sometimes too be like oh it's immigrants fault and I'm like yes yes I mean you my C the anti-immigrant like it is a myth like I'm saying this as someone who lives in this country as an immigrant with immigrant status at this point in time it is a myth for you to think the progressives and everybody on the left like they're on the side of immigrants because they don't be I'm telling you I see it I see it like just finding all these nuanced ways and blah blah blah to be anti-immigrant I'm telling you this right [ __ ] now there are very few on the sides of the immigrants and and it's crazy because I feel like that's taught to them you know um you know wherever they are and there it's a class issue too you know first it goes from you know how brown black you are uh we know that we see that within the system with our people want to say you know Joe Biden was the the best pick I was one person who sat there and talked about how he handled the whole situation with um title 41 title 42 whatever with how he did it made sure he did away with it when it came for Haitian immigrants who were underneath that bridge but then when it came to ukrainians he made sure that they walked the red carpet and and utilize that for them to come and have places to stay so we understand we've seen this systemically we know that this ain't a this ain't a thing for the left or the right this is right up in the system like all of them they they use it all of them they know and they're aware of it and I think that online I see when it comes to content creators people who uh are commentators when it comes to politics or anything you will see see people sit as if they're on the right side of it but then on their tweets or their comments or whatever uh I remember pointing this out where it's somebody who has a lot again a lot of followers I got a problem with this because they be like they'll have on their page that they're in solidarity with everyone right the diaspora all this but then have an issue with um shabzi questioning shabzi being up there with Beyonce and saying that it feels like cultural appropriation when shuzi is actually an American at from Virginia you know and have a problem with this person liking the music that they like so because they're Nigerian not because of nothing else it feels like cultural appropriation because America told you to feel that way about this black person who is Black American who who because a see here we go black isn't a monolith it ain't everybody got different stories we raised different weights all kind I'm Haitian I'm haian I speak Creo I love being Haitian people got a problem with that but they think that well are you not American I was born here I was born here many comments will say for me to go back to my country or whatever the case may be but I see these conversations getting more and more heat like the it's the heat is rising and I feel like because uh the way that Don Donald Trump has opened these doors and I just want to add this and I'll just sit it right there because I'm all over the place with it but even with the um the whole threat of taking away um you know factchecking and things like that which they ain't been doing a good job at anyway but taking it away we know the first people that are going to be attacked are the you know the marginalized groups and immigrants are high up in there they've they've already been attacked on in these spaces already and they're going to be high up in there we seen when they allowed um uh uh JD Vance who we haven't seen by the way we seen when they allowed him a whole state senator to lie on Haitians to lie on Haitian migrants and what that looked like online and to continue to spew out lies and misinformation and of course they were the ones that were attacked first Haitians that and so I know in this space we're not going to see if it was like white people getting attacked we know that they would make sure they delete videos attack people close your account all kinds of stuff but the way that the at the diaspora Wars how I seen people give it up recently for the black migrants and or immigrants and all that and the conversation that and people that swear up and down that they are for us baby it's it's really given the same rhetoric that Donald Trump gives and it's being by white supremacist like to be like they have some um statistics on it like there's some studies like they are they white people and these like active like white supremacists these same kind of think tank peoples are buying up these Bots and they're putting out all these Bots to stoke that they are pretending to be black online to stoke that so what happens is they are flooding and people bite on this raid click button you know what I mean and after years and years now of flooding that and these apping to be black accounts you see those kind of views take hold and they become more popular but there is a significant amount of white people behind those accounts like actively turn us against one another see how many times they get caught politic Ians uh famous people online accidentally going into their burner black account and they get caught and then they pretend like oh no it was something else like come on bro but one of the reasons why that stuff catches on and this is this is kind of speaks to an issue I see is that unfortunately the currency online and I'm I'm I I'll own that I'm complicit in it as an online person I'm not talking about anybody else is the currency online is about calling people out where they are now in Ting people pointing out HP you know hypocrisy this is what folks do online and Bill clout and that becomes the way you start to think but I want to see I would like to see more people thinking like organizers right because the reality is that some people in every across ethnicity across whatever people's immigration status is there are some people who are more and less conscious about different things right and as when organizers are like how do we understand why you know if I'm in Queens and I'm talking to a brown person who's ready to kick away the ladder for everybody else why the the key question is not to indict them put them in a position call them out Bill clout but say why what are we not addressing how can we be in community with you because that's what our opponents are doing they're pulling people in they're pulling more and more different kinds of folks in and so I wish I could what I wish I can see what I unfortunately it's not that I don't think accountability is important but as an organizer for me I always want to go to the Curiosity of like the curiosity like you should become curious you know I'm saying about why someone is in that position what do we need to learn you know I'm saying I mean I hope that doesn't sound corny I just feel like you know mean to your point I feel like that what you highlighted is one of the differences you talk about the currency online versus what you would want to see that's also the difference between the things that people do to get attention right the things that people do to get noticed and the things that people need to do in order to earn attention which doesn't necessarily follow right so those are also the two differences between the things you do to get elected and the things that make you actually a good representative I think one of the reasons why we just came out of the most unproductive Congress we've ever had and also it's starting shaky right now right is because we have a congress filled with people who can make a lot of noise to get elected right organize is not the thing right that's not the thing it's calling people out it's making moments like we were just talking about KLA Harris and how she handled it with Grace a lot of people would have handled that a whole lot different and would have had a tweet out immediately and a post and been on cable news you know what I mean and gotten a gang of attention off of that you know what I'm saying we have Congress filled with those kinds of people those kinds of people don't necessarily have the skill set to you know lead make legislation vote on things organize yeah yeah and as like me uh personally you know I'm like a union organizer um one of the hardest things is like what y'all are talking about dealing with people who are not on the same level as you whether it's Consciousness or whatever the case may be you know especially me being a you know a black person and I'm surrounded by people in the organizing that I do that are not black and and they don't understand the black issues or anything like that and if I remotely say anything that affects black people or anything like that it might be a problem right just bringing up like we could talk about class solidarity we can have class solidarity class analysis all these different things I'm all for it but sometimes if you even hint at a racial issue or some other issue oh I don't know if we want to say that I don't know if we want to do that and I'm like I hear what you're saying but at the same time why is it the other question is how much do I have to give to make white people feel un to feel comfortable yeah how much do I have to get I'm giving a lot I am giving a lot and it's some relax you put put some relaxer in there they they probably feel relax that c and that's what I mean it's just like okay you they have in their head a lot of them it's just like they already think they do sacrificing or it makes them feel comfortable to hear these certain things or whatever and I'm like I'm holding a lot in to be able to be in solidarity with you and I want to get this thing done so how are we going to do this how much do we have to give to be able to get [ __ ] done also the [ __ ] on the internet whether it's about Beyonce or whatever what the fck are we talking about [ __ ] all of this what are we doing to get [ __ ] done I I'm tired I'm I get so exhausted with this [ __ ] some of us jokes some of it's whatever what the f are we doing to get [ __ ] done what are we talking about that's that that that's the thing for what Reese was saying earlier about you honestly waiting on these white middle class and and and Working Class People or whatever to decide because the thing and this is the thing why I like class solidarity conversations always get me like because I think there's a the rest of us live in a world where we have to deal with discomfort it's never a perfect environment it's never a perfect anything we we recognize it's the reason why we're not waiting on the rest of is because we recognize already that we have to like you know you know get in where we fit in and figure out what we could do in order to get our had we already recognized that but white people need a perfectly a perfect environment tailored to their needs where they are upfront where they Define how it is that they're centered XYZ and so it's hard for me to ever really agree when things happen that people decide oh there's CL there really is class solidarity here because we all up here to agree and I like yeah well the rest of us already had certain sense and beliefs and white people are on board because it's white now it's okay like it hasn't it hasn't upset them it hasn't added in any other of the groups or identities or issues that they refuse that they they don't like you know what I mean that they don't want to get on boards I'm always like okay you know what I mean let's see let's see how that goes it's like all right we seem we all seem like we we're all you know United on this issue of how Healthcare is and the industry and y y y but I'm like listen black women are the the most mistreated people in the me in in health care in this country like dying the maternal Health Care rates like dying death uh maternal death rates three times that of everybody else or whatever right I have yet to see anybody else other than black women like the country even rally around that and I can't imagine if that was an issue we push like let's start really carving it out let's find things that we we care about and what we want to do if we have this you know we have this momentum around this what happens when you actually start discussing what is [ __ ] up about the healthcare industry and whatever like oh how the hospitals they put in black neighborhoods give it up like oh the difference on this the difference on that like are they gonna get on board once those things are meant to help other people like when you mentioned like medical racism and stuff like that all of a sudden certain people start to back uportable healthare act you see what I'm saying like how can that be racist right and then they're just like oh my God now I don't want to work with you and I'm like you're you're that fra fragile yeah you're that fragile to where you're willing to break our solidarity and stuff like that because something might not affect you as much and it makes you lose your mind to now you not on board that that's the thing we got to deal with and that is hard it's hard but you see it online every day or you see it with the people you work with that it it' be folks I'm like okay as soon as you present this it's like oh can't touch that can't touch it because it's gonna it's gonna mess up some things I don't really think that's an issue we see how they did Dei I had a problem with Dei since day one every day I talked about it I said this is I don't like what before they made it the equivalent to ER right before they made it to the equivalent to calling you a hard E I just didn't like the idea of it they got they they made this whole little black little specific position for that one two three black people in the corner to hold down something that them F like all all the white people got so much help for their regular positions now your little Dei corner you ain't got no no no kind of help white people don't want to put their hands on it no nothing as soon as Elon Musk got to Twitter that little Dei Corner because we know that little Dei before it was Dei black Twitter black people made Twitter what it is black people on on Tik Tok every video that you see from white person is probably a copycat from a black person who got five views on it I've seen a a white person literally cleaning up their house with their baby on their hip to a song a Florida song about killing folks okay and this a song that I absolutely love and grew up with didn't understand it but this is what like I don't like that white people we seen in 2020 George Floyd di George Floyd died in the middle of covid lots of things were happen at the height of covid so many things were happening all of these people all these businesses all these white folks we saw Nancy Pelosi Jesus and her friends um in in kente where it was just wrong we saw what you know all of these companies were doing they were had the black candles and the uh the Target near my predominantly white Target had the uh uh the the t-shirts and stuff that stayed on the rack because white folks weren't buying it but they they were selling the items they were partnering with black people they were Netflix was now had a section for for black right ERS uh and producers to come and work and create and all and all of those things quietly have gone have left they disappeared because they capitalized on that they don't give a damn when we start yes and when we when we start talking about that this was an issue we would have thought that they were did they get it right they actually care no they were capitalizing on that they don't want to be a part of the people that didn't like what wasn't caring to black folks after or during the the the protests and and while the all these marginalized things were H they didn't want to be on that end of it so but as soon as they got the opportunity they were just like everybody else whether they uh support Biden or whether they to support Trump them Big Rich businesses and white folks and all them that were in solidarity with us we would never see and we better not ever catch her again but we would never see Nancy Pelosi standing so close to the the black caucus the way she was and with the K CL we would never see these businesses selling selling the candles no more they've taken like they've taken it all away Netflix lit depleted that department and this is why I say like it's for us to really focus and and join together and organize we can have our fun cuz black people like to have fun stop inviting everybody to the damn barbecue I don't want to eat I don't even want to eat the food no more we need to organize with each other and really really get down to the core of our issues because nobody's talking about the black you know uh uh the black maternity uh rate for for for black women that like they're not talking about that they're not talking about how for for men's um um mental health issues they're not don't give a damn about that but we do so if we organize together we can do it but it's really hard for us in the space right now because of what's popular if I talk about that online will my audience deplete or will I not get any uh um uh sponsors or this and that we got to be real careful or do people really care then we start to see when we start wanting to organize and be serious about it because we are uh because we're either dealing with it in reality or we know somebody that's dealing with it um we start to see when we start wanting to bring it to the table people start backing away from us and it's like you know it's it's it's it's it's hard it's a tough first of all first of all Rebecca I think you need to apologize because when Nancy Pelosi knelled in the kente cloth my black Jesus wept on the wall on the wall okay that's number one but but number two to the point that you're talking about um trying to organize and how your audience will receive it it you reminded me of uh where the conversation was about 5 10 minutes ago when you were talking about the censorship right and the community notes and all that kind of stuff that they're doing on social media and all of that stuff really triggers me because as somebody that is a creator online I'm trying to assess the viability of my platform right and what I can do and what I can say so here you have Elon Musk who is the champion of free speech right here you have Elon Musk going in and putting in all these uh troll accounts back on Twitter and get getting Community notes instead of of of pulling people's content down and that is now spread to meta and all this there's this free speech movement right now as a content creator a free speech movement should be purely to my detriment to sorry to my advantage right this should be nothing this should do nothing but free me up a free spe movement yet at the same time I'm watching ABC settle this suit with Trump because they don't want beef with him I'm watching Elon Musk threaten to purchase uh MSNBC and have Joe and Ma go and apologize at the same time you have all of this Legacy Media and all of these other billionaires who are who are own content companies and whatnot KY to to Trump in the rightwing so I'm like how the hell at the same time as we are doing a free speech movement I am deeply concerned about the viability of being able to express anything freely that that is not uplifting the administration like we are so the contradiction is just so blatant and out front like they not even hiding it it always has been and people don't care Elon I wrote an article about this in I knew what the play was the day Elon mus decided he wanted Twitter like this was the plan the plan was to suppress these kind of movements and momentum around news and issues and that's exactly what he did he just came out with it you know what I mean once like it was close to election time he made it like extra extra transparent but everybody was saying it everybody saw it they made their intentions very very clear they buying up they want all the it's not it's not a it's not a by accident or coincidence that every every major platform seems to be owned by some billionaire with very very specific political intentions and leaning like every like someone said it today like like you really have to laugh at it every every like seven business days is basically everyone like Flock like fleeing to a new platform that's owned by a different ridiculous billionaire it's like you ran from Elon Musk on Twitter the thread forgetting that Zuckerberg is the original boy thank you we were we were reminded real quick yesterday because I'm like you know to see him at the party you know you know with with Donald Trump meanwhile where he he's over here making threads and we come to threads and we're like ah social media Heaven okay no DMS um you know there's no ads here you know not accidentally I put this up not accidentally clicking on somebody's live with three people we all it's everything is good um it's okay if if one person sees this post it's okay if a million people see this post uh we'll move on tomorrow like it's just it's nice it's great and my I can curate my timeline next thing you know he on there talking about some you know I got with what a gold chain and a black T-shirt and a a pro that is questionable and telling us that he's going to give us he's helping us out by get taking away factchecking as identical identical to Elon Musk Elon what he did with Twitter and we done ran over here to threads and he's trying to put under the guys of he trying to put it under the guys of you know I want to make sure I minimize the hate you know we we make sure that we we we misinformation doesn't happen anymore El Elon was straight up with it he's like everybody can get it misinformation for everybody I don't give a damn and you over here with the same blueprint and telling us that this is because you want to counteract that that's not true and but then you also were the same person that gave a million dollars he gave a million dollars the same way that millions of dollars was given to uh Donald Trump by Elon Musk Zu our our little black white boy Facebook everybody want to glorify him forar in a gold chain literally mid things things that are mid um he's given a million dollars to Donald Trump for his inauguration and and so these people are the same people Donald Trump sat up there yesterday when he was questioned and said well they literally asked him do you think it was your pressure for him to to remove the fact checking um that made him change it do you think that's what it was Donald Trump said yeah I'm pretty sure it was pretty yeah it was it was me I just saw that video too I'm just sitting here like this is this is some rid this is some evil [ __ ] we I witnessing some evil [ __ ] I knew it would come but this is just more blatant than I thought it would be I want you to know sense my friend called me yesterday and said Donald Trump trying to change the go of Mexico to the Gulf of America of America yeah I saw that yeah I saw that let me tell you something if there's one thing Donald Trump does well is distract the media and the public with stupid [ __ ] so it could be doing all kind of I mean all day every day all kind of Insidious [ __ ] up [ __ ] just happening on the open but he got us like focused on some foolishness and really ah but you know yeah you know the great start one thing I just want to say is this also connects like you know anytime these folks talk about free speech and this is going back a long time let's just say what it is when they say free speech that's actually white supremacist capitalist Zionist canc I want to say whatever nasty I should whatever Fed Up thing to you without check I also you'll be demonetized you won't have a p I just want to say just just keep in mind like today I just learned they banned a whole bunch of students at NYU they suspended them for a year for a protest in the library where they were essentially like reading poems um and this same protest I was filming it as a journalist in December and I got declared Persona nonr banned from buildings on a campus wow so I was like all right NYU where's the Free Speech people I'm a professor in a he's a student in a library reading poems nope you know I mean and you know some people did some people some people stepped up but it was like not not really and so this that's none of the Free Speech people stepped up that's the thing the thing is I hate America's like annoying like how the Americans use Free Speech free speech is a right as applied against the government like I hate the way Americans just run around like free speech is my right to say whatever the f whever the [ __ ] I want to whomever the [ __ ] and anything you know what I mean if it wasn't treated like that these people like to believe in that and then they come out and be like no no I have a very strict originalism understanding of Street speech like that's the problem is like Donald Trump and them like Donald Trump and Elon Musk and all these people come out telling you they believe in this super broad version of free speech is way broader than the Constitution like yeah yeah yeah everybody say whatever and then you say something to them baby like no [ __ ] way I didn't mean you but it's like but yeah and I it's like it's interesting because I saw this movie that I think a lot of people should see called homegrown by Michael Primo who's a buddy and you know he followed the like the left and right wing for years and he actually followed a person who who has ended up with the longest January 6th um sentence um and it was wild because he W in in in like in this documentary he was like talking about free speech and he was like look well other people get to do it like why can't I like it was I think that we are we are at such a time that both we don't have any consistencies for anything all across the board we don't have any consistencies of standard because the reality is that it's always been whatever works for people in power right so when it works or or corporations and like and capital right so when it works for Capital to be diverse they decide to be diverse when it when Capital wants to say they're green like Walmart greenwashing [ __ ] right and then like they're like green for a second and then it's out right it's everything is so it it is it is movable because of capital and capital is adaptable and because of you know and because we don't have the same standards across the board and I think that like I mean the like the free speech on the online stuff I mean I feel like all of this is going to be a backlash honestly for the corporations themselves I think that they are not they're not they're not going to survive in the same way um if they aren't like because people are just gonna dox folks on Facebook people are G like there's just going to be too much chaos in some of these spaces with like such a like polarization happening that I that that I do think that it's like it's it's it's untenable to last and also this Coalition is not going to last I think that's another thing that like when we're talking about the ruling Coalition there are only two the Republicans have the smallest majority they've that they've ever had and they're not all on the same page right you have the mgts of the world or whatever or MTG you have the the you know the you have the romneys of the room right you have like a a untenable Coalition and I think that we're going to start and and also not only anable and then you have these weird places where things are like there are some things that Bernie agrees with that that RFK has said right like there so I think that we're there are some things that Bernie has said that I don't agree with my nerves recently period I mean there's a lot of things right like I think that there I mean one person I will say that like I know a lot of people think that she's but I think she's as somebody who's worked at who's who works in politics and knows that it's a it's a game too and you got to play chess not Checkers like I do have to say that like I have been more impressed with AOC than I ever have been before because I do actually think she is understanding that she needs to play ball with the people who are in power or she's got not going to make any impact which I think a lot of leftists and on online folks don't understand stand they want everything to be pure a nice little package um for Utopia and I think she's also still true to the community um but yeah I just I think that I think it's going to be really really interesting as we see like because that because everybody was making choices of their own self-interest that they're not going to have as much as a united front as I think I don't even think they're gonna have as much as I def find as the last Administration and I and I I yeah I agree with you and I that's actually a question I want to ask you because and it relates to the question on Dei as well one of the reasons why Dei could be sort of like signed on to and taken away so easily is because and actually I'm actually getting it wrong wasn't signed on too easily folks did struggle for some of those Dei efforts and we need to honor that but the reason they could be removed is because to me that was never real power yes right those and that's kind of the point you were making Rebecca like we saw what that was that was actually an effort to preserve most of these institutions how they mostly function without changing the structure so for me a more robust form of power is what jhaa is talking about like to me like you know when I look at the struggles of my folks over in Staten Island and queens at Amazon for example right to me like that's the it's not the the power isn't there yet we see how they but and but that sadly though that does require Coalition so that's kind of what I'm asking what you think about that because I hear what people are saying about being tired of having a you know sort of like moderate but to me it's like when do we want real power even with these plat ATS like that ain't we could go to Blue Sky here I just I just made a fan P you know look I don't it's like look but what when do we want do we want real power and what are we willing to tolerate to actually have something where you don't have to rely on like asking folks begging for folks it's like you can you can actually wield that you know I wonder if the left actually wants that I think that should be the final question we posed to everybody we end the show with cherai like like that I think that's it I think that's really the thing that everybody has to think about because I don't know and I don't think don't know yeah I I I don't know but being in a union being part of UAW being a local of UAW I I'm G to actually be in a um leadership conference in region 6 here in La uh this weekend and if it doesn't get canceled because all the fires but that is a real question that is hard that is hard it is a struggle it is difficult but my kind of my point is are on board problem problem me a lot of other black people and stuff like that I it's it's really the worry that there's other groups of people that are not necessarily on board and how how do we communicate with them how how do we how do we deal with that and I don't know the answer it is difficult we can struggle as much as we want to to get that done but that [ __ ] is hard man I I sit there and struggle with that all the time because I'll get some crazy ass statements and I'm like that was racist as [ __ ] what the f kind of but it's like a labor is to them a labor issue with the immigration and stuff so you those type of conversations happen and I'm like that's what I kind of meant earlier when we were talking about like uh Luigi right and people being interested in him and what he did or whatever the case may be and about CEOs but there are people who want to you know like oh they hear that you know what and then they go this way and they say oh it's the migrant so I need to off some migrants or rat them and call ice and do all this crazy [ __ ] so what do we do that is a great question and that's why we have conferences and that's why we have conversations because we needed to figure that the out [Music]
