Like the most you could give him is class betrayal, but that can’t be true of a rich guy that’s pro-establishment, pro-feds, pro-cop, and just acting on behalf of his singular grievance (if we’re to believe the story about his back).  \n\nClass can’t be addressed without race, because the two reify each other. The makeup of class is informed by the constructs of race, and if you want to be “in solidarity” that means caring about the most vulnerable of people that you share class status with, and that will always be Black people, regardless of the other nuances of our experiences.",

    "text": "RE: \"Luigi solidarity\" There will never be a shift in anything until the people truly realize we have the power, there's too many people deeply fearful of the powers that be. Scared witless about losing their jobs if they stayed home in protest, fear of jail or more if we stopped paying whatever in protest (taxes or fines or rents) it kills me too, the realization that they cannot punish us all just hasn't gotten thru. If 250 million people stopped participating in this mess, it'd flip but it won't happen because of the centuries of fear from \"Them\".  We need an under the radar org to \"turn out the lights\" one day on the economy to send the message (stay home/don't buy etc) \nRE: Free speech: yeah...Americans are completely ignorant about what ANY of the Amendments mean. We're 38th in literacy so comprehension is low on what meanings and definitions even are. It has limits and it has consequences. \nRE: Real power: I think humans are kind of \"two thought classes\" - those who want power for the sake of it and those who want change but \"power\" is tricky to them because if we see power as its shown forever, this \"evil\" thing, decent people cringe from it because we don't want what that generally means. Power means control and no one with compassion seeks control they just want things to be equitable for all, ending greed as it is, that kind of thing, so it's tricky for good folks to seek power really, catch 22 - have to have control to make change but control is generally not viewed as a positive thing in regard to government.",

They're people that have a common cause for solidarity around hopefully a few things, but sometimes only one cause\n\nthat is a fraught and potentially precarious situation but it doesn't mean that it has to be that way or stay that way. \n\nbuilding solidarity takes work, and it's not work for everyone. But I dont know that people saying this is a marker for increased class consciousness haven't considered that's there's a lot that still actively divided us and works against us when we attempt solidarity",

It's like Harambe, a few people cared about the kid/gorilla/implications of putting down animals over humans, but mostly the conversations were all memes.\n\nluigi is just a meme, they reduced an important conversation down to, \"He sure is a nice guy, look how cool he is.\" which is plain weird.",

My friends and I have been trying to organize people into doing more than friendships: show up and do chores for people.  Do tasks and take the daily load of living off of people so their hearts can grow and the amount of inertia we meet all the time us sooooo huge.  Im finding over and\n over people just dont even KNOW at ALL.  Theyre angry, and theyll go out and do protests if they happen or maybe they do stuff like getting food into peoples mouths and thats important.  But i keep meeting people with zero foundation for just\n daily collectively living.  They go right back into individualism if i mention going to help out a local housing justice org to fix some apartment doors or something. These are people under threat, they have gone through bad stuff, and they have this reflexive reaction still where the basic assumptions dont change.  I mean its happening slowly, i realized just... People dont take care of eschother so we have to regrow it so we are trying to do it.  Its just so effing sloooowwwww.  These are more left inclined people not \"liberals.\" Not even wasting my time less than that and its teaching babies basically.  \n\nLuigi is basically that movie Falling Down.",

There were tons of people that were slave abolitionist for very different reasons. For example a lot of abolitionist wanted slaves sent back to Africa and didn’t necessarily want black people living next to them. What matters at the end of the day is that Chattel slavery was ended with that coalition. \n\nIf you can get your average racist Gen X Karen and Dave to agree with you on the solution I don’t think the rest matters all too much. \n\nWhether or not they agree on universal healthcare as the solution is the only question for me. If their solution is anti-immigration, racism, and giving billionaires more power then it’s a useless coalition.",

She is saying that Lui shooting in New York is going to give them a reason to increase the police state that is there and I feel that is false. New York already has a ridiculous police state and they were going to increase the police state regardless. I mean you are talking about a place where police popped random people due to a single person not paying for their ticket to the metro (idk what it is called). If they try to blame Lui then the effect came before the cause - meaning they had a plan to do something but they found a reason to blame it on afterwards.\n\nAlso, saying that Lui can cause people to shoot at immigrants because of some promotion of yt men violence is also false, imo. Again, those people were bound to do that anyways regardless of what Lui did. What Lui did was show other yt men, who are frustrated with the system, who they should be pointing the pew-pew at if they want to point it. There have been several yt men copycats so far who have aimed the pew-pew at yt CEOs. \n\nAlso, the whole point of 'if it was a blk person they wouldn't give him the time to explain himself'. As a black woman, I agree that's true. Every community needs allies. We need yt men to continue to use their yt male privilege to protect everyone else while we work towards more equity. \n\nThis has been said to be the season where blk people are resting, rightfully so. We can support others who are fighting for causes that will benefit our blk community while we rest. Blk people are treated the worst by the healthcare system so we have the most to gain by it changing.",
