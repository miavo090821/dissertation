I don't want any more allies where are the accomplices you should sharpen The Guillotines but that's just me I think it is the issue with teaching people not to oppose a system but to oppose their place in a system what they do to allow for a homophobia to run rampant is they make it white not that that's all sat men most susception taught to dissect themselves from their emotional selves well let's call it what it really is you unfoundedly hate me or dislike me so you are transmitic you're homo Mystic so my question is who gonna throw the first brick laughs I am so glad to have you all for my first queer Olay friends convening I had said I was gonna I'm gonna do it on a regular basis people have been like oh you should make a quail laying friends for for pride month I was like or I can just do that regularly not regularly relegated surprise like yes and honestly turns out I have the longest list I have a longer list of uh black wear commentators and public figures that I then I have anything else like this is the easiest thing to do I was like I have so many people I'm just gonna convene a group with a great chemistry that I like so because I wanted to hear from y'all honestly you're gonna have the best most app takes and I think everybody especially in Myspace is gonna rush to have a bunch of um sister the street people talk about you know lament about the woe is me uh I'd rather not I was like let me hear from the people themselves and bring it and moderate this and bring that there so I'm so glad to have you all it's good to be here we love you and yeah I'm glad to be here we're like the gay Avengers [Laughter] yes no but yeah y'all have y'all have thought y'all had the takes like and honestly I really I really wanted to hear from y'all because here's the thing this is a kangaroo court I there's really no need for any of us to even act surprised we should be outraged every time but surprise not at all this has been this is and they're gonna keep doing this every time they get an opportunity we're going to see a roll back and a roll back and I was talking to my friend today like you know America's honestly getting to the point where they're about a couple of law a couple of rights away from you got to get a you gotta have to get a flag and leave it's gonna it's getting that bad legitimately I think it is going to be a mass Exodus because basically all they're trying to do is use the court to legitimize homophobia transphobia queer phobia every kind of phobia they could get into they're getting into and so I basically wanted the thoughts from the people that's going to impact the most first you know because they come in for everybody and I think that's something people forget they think they think when you ask them to be in that's why I kind of want to get rid of Ally um they think it's like doing a favor for other people as opposed to the fact that if they come for you in the morning they come in they're coming for you at night you see what I'm saying I'm like they're coming for lgbtq persons first first they're in the open with it first but it doesn't end here so yeah I kind of wanted to put that to the floor you know you know I have a lot of thoughts always um and I think that for me when I first read about the Court's ruling honestly I'm not gonna hold you I laughed because it was just like girl of course like like what else are y'all gonna do like y'all bored y'all y'all be in the house doing nothing else like what else are you gonna do of course this is what you're gonna do and I also laugh because I think that black Trans and black queer folks for the longest have been talking about like how same-sex marriage in particular has always been a very CIS white gay fight and they felt like oh you know we've locked in this this right to get married so things are Done Right meanwhile disproportionately black Trans folks black Trans women in particular are being murdered right meanwhile folks can't even use particular bathrooms meanwhile black gays are being mugged on the streets right like meanwhile majority of our black homeless youth are LGBT right like and none of that matter to these people because they got the chance to get married to to assimilate into this very CIS white supremacist patriarchal institution right and so I I laughed I was like okay I mean a court and its rulings we're never going to be able to give or take away any particular rights to [ __ ] in the first place because [ __ ] don't have rights like what exactly like what exactly are we are we even trying to fame some sort of like sadness or or or surprise for right we know for a fact that these people have never engaged us as full human beings who ever had access to any of the particular rights that they or repealed in the first place um and I think that like where I'm always where I always land is at the fact that if nine people or six of nine people can determine whether or not you have a right to exist in the first place you don't actually have a right to exist like so so now we have to actually talk about where exactly you land in the sort of cast or that or the hierarchy of rights to exist and babes you don't have that right so now what I am on the side of Jane Fonda if you know you know sister girl said the next step is murder and I'm on her side I stand with her like because these courts they were they're never going to ruin my favorite this is always why I was like y'all are like going up for homegirl who just got um put in office I don't remember her name katanji yeah like you know they were very very they were going for her I'm like are we aware of what the Supreme Court does are we clear about exactly what they have to be committed to in order to to sit in the office and of course she was one of the the three who voted against um Laurie Smith is the woman's name um that ruling but it's still the Supreme Court like and you want the Constitution to recognize you as something that the constitution says you are not so now what so that's where I landed that's I was like all right what's next um I was I just want to say something but I'm not trying to get put on more FBI watch lists okay soften The Guillotines um however uh nah I think white supremacy is so Insidious in its connectivity and how often white people like I love that DeSean pointed out like how specifically white queer CIS people are so willing to like just throw the rest of us under the bus uh to secure these honestly like meaningless rights um like marriage like not that it's meaningless overall but meaningless in the grand scheme of like what impacts queer people on a daily basis um I was not shocked by this at all I honestly think that it is about to get much worse um and the next step for me for what I see is like them trying to in birth right right citizenship so they can dictate who is and who isn't a citizen because yeah um because so much of um like the way slavery Works in this country still works in this country uh contends on like your rights as a citizen and if they can strip that right from all of us they can really do whatever it whatever they want um and I think like we've seen this like iteration like many times like in the prison industrial complex and I think they're just shifting the goal post which is what they do all the time but that is the insidiousness of white supremacy um and yeah I do I do really land on every time we should sharpen The Guillotines but that's just me usually I was saying that Revolution was around the corner because it was clearly a cascading effect like they it was so orchestrated the way that it was back to back to back with affirmative action and then this and then a year ago Roe v Wade and every time I mean what DeSean has been saying for years black queer folk have been saying this is going to happen for years right specifically black Trans women have been saying this is going to happen four years and people thought [ __ ] was sweet when they they all she would speak when Obama got into office right same-sex marriage all of that all of it right yeah the [ __ ] walks or I forgot what it was called when a white woman had you know what I'm saying like yeah but they thought [ __ ] was sweet and then Trump gets elected and that's a shocker and literally the moment is like we're saying this is all going to happen to people and Believers and it's like it's like white women white CIS women and white queer folk are the most shocked and surprising flabbergasted but it's like we're regressing in a way that of course is what happened I don't understand why you think that it wouldn't and it's it's it's given very much like they're attacking people that like by the end of it it's going to come back to people who have already kind of been hurt regardless like the the rights that were passed weren't really helping us anyways so imagine how much worse it's gonna get when they really start actually attacking us and um I too am agreeing with bring the gay teens back um say something crazy but the the funniest part about this to me and I think that the part that nobody is talking about is the fact that queer people have been saying these things for years the only time that folks have found them interesting enough to listen to is when a CIS had Ally activist-esque person hops onto their platform and says oh like as an ally as a you know whatever but like I agree with Olay I don't want any more allies where are the accomplices because at this point I need you to come and do the damage with me or get the [ __ ] out of my way and keep all of your performance for whatever Awards you're trying to get for whatever acknowledgment from whatever TV company you're trying to draw up or whatever and that's not to say that these people don't genuinely care about queer people but I also understand that in the world of becoming the next social media activist star person whatever that there are perks that come with being able to speak on certain Topics in the affirmative but the thing about it is for you it's a topic for me it is life or death and the sad part about it is that even queer people have fallen victim to this idea of upholding or uplifting these folks that are not in the margins with you that barely understand the surface level arguments but we're propelling those things over the people that are working on Grassroots you know efforts over the queen genes over the Raquel Witnesses over the folks that are like really out here organizing and creating the space and so I think that the reason why it's not just a shock just for the white CIS heads and the white you go queer folks but it's shocked for a lot of the like the black people who have been doing the work is because your idea of doing the work is propelling the messages and the voices of people who don't know what the work is or where to start they've just been regurgitating the arguments from the people that are actually doing it and hoping that something lands and I I don't know I just feel like another thing is we need to point to their playbook I mean they're going after lgbtq rights and it's also attached to the rights against uh contraception the rights against abortion because you know in 2018 the white population was at 60 percent compared to 90 in 1950. so there's a lot of fear and it's rooted in like Fascism and it's expected that it will fall under 50 in 25 years so they're attacking us from all different different parts just so they can keep their majority just so they can keep us under just so they can keep us below because we know what they want to do they want this to be a white State they want this to be a white country but we're I don't know what we're going to do I don't know how we're going to get there but I would like that if we just defined exactly and be real about what the [ __ ] is going on in this country right now and you know go ahead I'll let it go ahead no no no I was just gonna read it I was just gonna say that I think that this is this is for me the very frustrating part of like witnessing conversations that just don't drive us anywhere because people really don't understand the pervasiveness of anti-blackness right and the pervasiveness of anti-blackness the thing that makes anti-blackness so particularly violent is that you can't write anti-blackness into or out of practice it is a practice that exists and therefore allows for things like this to be written into and out of law right lawmaking does not end or or begin anti-black practices right and I think that like this is my frustration with liberalism with neoliberalism because people have invested so much of their time into electoral politics right that under this this premise or this idea that if we can vote someone in or out of a sea that somehow our lives are changed or or we're saved that we have access to better things access to resources that we didn't have access to before as if we did not sit under eight years of Barack Obama as if Atlanta does not exist right now and has not existed with fit with a black mayor for over 50 years that has been rapidly gentrifying and pushing out its black residents right I've lived in Atlanta for a decade I know very intimately what black misleaderships relationship to its black residents look like right Atlanta has I really packed black APD right our police officers are many of them are black right they're the ones who are arresting Us in the streets they're the ones who are harassing Us in the streets they're the ones who are making sure that we don't get to make it to the streets are out of the streets right the black police officers the black mayor the black D.A right and so you know for me it's like I think more people should be really focused on Atlanta politics because I think that it disrupts everything about what we have been taught to believe about about representing exactly precisely right 96 the 96 Olympics even before them really but the 96 Olympics in Atlanta cemented driving out homeless folks and black folks in the city of Atlanta and has set a precedent for how black folks will be engaged in Atlanta if you're not an affluent person if you're not a black celebrity right who oftentimes to be clear live on the outskirts they call they say they from Atlanta they live in Atlanta but I'm right of the great she made some points some of these [ __ ] some of these [ __ ] is um because they don't they don't live in the city anymore and and then you get T.I and Killer Mike who stand beside police officers who stand beside Keisha Lance bottoms who stand beside Andre Dickens and are like this is a wakanda and we gotta treat it like a wakanda and that means locking up [ __ ] that means pushing out [ __ ] right and so to me it's like when you when you live in that environment every single day when you organize and you engage in movement every single day for a decade under black misleadership the kind of things that happen on the federal level just feel like exactly that makes sense to me it makes sense to me that you would would write in write these laws into practice or repeal these laws that have allegedly been protecting some people and their rights you know the people who are recognized as people and their rights it makes sense that you would do that because we don't understand the pervasiveness pervasiveness of anti-blackness and we think that as long as those laws exist or don't exist that we're protected and I just gotta say I've been watching [ __ ] be murdered every every single day almost it feels like yeah 15 years by black police officers under a black regime if you want to call it that in a dying Empire yeah no that's it that's it that's it I'm gonna say that some studies say um in the end of end of police saying in that book there's a study that says to like they're basically showing that police brutality is worse sometimes against people of coloring black people when there are black police officers then people seem to forget that whiteness yes it's your rate like race you know phenotype all level whiteness and white supremacy is literally an ideology it's like a cult it's something you can subscribe to and you do not have to be white to subscribe to the ideologies of whiteness of white supremacy and one of the ways I literally was just arguing in in my comments with black folk literally today and yesterday about how pervasive homophobia and queer phobia is in our community and that is such a pillar of white supremacy that they don't even understand they're echoing the same the same tools this is in the Playbook meanwhile black people we have never been included in in the definitions of masculinity the definitions of femininity of Womanhood of manhood of sexuality heteronormativity we have literally always been outside of those definitions so to be so tied to the definitions that it literally exclude us we have black women who are being excluded from sports right now because God forbid they have different testosterone levels they're not they're not considered a woman yeah and you want to be transphobic you want to you you're literally doing the same exact things and that is exactly how they're getting us and if you think as black community as Black Folk that we could all be free but black queer folk can't be free and black Trans hope can't be free then you're literally delusional it's just I I if you look at the backbone of so many of our like civil rights movements who have been who have been there if not people people Los Angeles at you while they be in homophobic what they be talking about they'd be killing me when they say that I'm like I can't more often than not both historically and present day when I think of black activists or black Scholars or or black leaders they're queer three out of five times they are past and present I told you at the beginning it is it was easier for me to go through a list of queer people quick like black queer people that could talk then then CIS straight people is much harder for me to convene that panel and I think you know I think there's something to I think this kind of exposes several problems one I think it is the issue with teaching people not to oppose a system but to oppose their place in a system I think that's the problem with how we go about capitalism how we go about so many of these institutions in our society like you'll find so many black people they are not mad at capitalism they are mad at where they're placed in capitalism in the same way you see them they're not mad at these oppressive structures they're not mad at hegemony they're not mad at patriarchy they're not a massaging they're mad at the way it's weaponizing against them and so it really allows them a different opportunities with queer people to subjugate a group underneath themselves and to me it's a lot like people going to go exercise control they don't have otherwise in society and I also think the second thing is again back to the the favor thing is you know I think people are so it's funny people are selfish they really are and I think and and I think targeting and addressing that would help us a lot more but everybody is both selfish and dishonest like they want to believe especially I find this but like I find this in the white non-profit industrial complex every day is white people wanting to Advocate to white people as though white people aren't white like like oh well let's talk about caring and blah blah blah so I'm like they don't give a [ __ ] about that why don't you tell them how much it costs them and how they come in for them after I'm like they're a lot and I think in the same way like we said black people non non-white people are just as capable and every day all day become you know harbingers of white supremacy and misogyny and all these different things and I think that's what you see uh with them when you try to tell them hey caring about my queer brothers and sisters or my queer non-binary folk they don't give a [ __ ] but I think when you when you more so point out hey you see how your your transphobia look what's happening here because you know that's gonna get you is this black woman it's never been included in femininity or Womanhood or any of that but they don't get it yeah and we see that in a lot of different places sorry I was gonna say we did see that in a lot of different places especially with the separation of the LGBT from the T when black Americans are extremely extremely homophobic when you go all the way back to when black men were getting the right to vote with the 15th Amendment and they were trying to leave women out including Susan B Anthony and her Compadres but also black women and we had to wait years and years until the 19th amendment to even got any kind of recognition and the right to vote in this country so we see that separation many many times and what was what was it that you said Olay about their place in the system but not rejecting the system Keys yeah their problem is not this system their problem is where they fall exactly yeah I want to just oh sorry go ahead baby I feel like I would lose my license if I don't bring it to the room in the conversation trauma and how trauma is passed down and like how black people are in a very abusive relationship with uh this uh very much so anti-black capitalist State and it starts off to like one let's not get started on how and Christina you do a lovely job of talking about this a lot but like how like uh how white white people have such a deeply embedded like traumatized way of enact uh interacting with the world around them and they just like enact violence on everyone else around them and that is a result of that [ __ ] they had what was kind of Curves on here yes of course that [ __ ] that they had going on over there in Europe and they brought that to the rest of us even though we did not need that um and they just like deeply internalized that and I think that has a lot to do with the way that they they structure their systems um and why I think that a lot of the black people who do try to uh buy into these like larger likes like like a vote ain't never did [ __ ] to change my material reality I'm so sorry thank you to Sean but um like I think a lot of people buy into it because it is like an abusive relationship and I do think that they inherit a lot of things like uh homophobia transphobia and things like that through this information but also the internal is a result of being traumatized there are four trauma responses and I think the black people who really like I gotta call them Bootleggers I'm so sorry like the black people who who lick boots and who really try to like sit at the lap of white supremacy and like really feed into these like very like transphobic homophobic uh [ __ ] CIS uh CIS the federal normative standards of living who are constantly like bickering and attacking other black people online policing other black people and how other black people maneuver through a very anti-black World those people inherited trauma I believe that they are doing uh if you ask me I I know a fawn response when I see one um when you try so much uh to basically like take parts of and earn respect from uh your your oppressor your person who is abusing you and I think that a lot of black people are just wrapped up in that if you want me to be honest and uh I think these systems right there's this interesting thing like where it's like such an emphasis like and I think DeSean you covered it like such an emphasis on voting right if six people fight and don't if Jenna got three apples like that's how I feel hearing this conversation because if six people have the power to literally make it legal you know without repercussions from an already homophobic and transphobic state to discriminate against like people who who come from our community what the [ __ ] does that tell you about the state of this of this of this society and you know what's crazy I think like white I think the way I hear people talk about especially black people if you think about me and Laverne I had this conversation recently when it came to like if you look at like the Dave Chappelle I was like what they do what they do to allow for a homophobia to run rampant is they make it white they erase black queer people all together and they make it this conversation about like whiteness and that's why they always I feel like they always Center White queer people and what come off as like white trivial things and that allows people to believe the queer Community is far better off than it has ever been because they're looking again still at Maine stream whiteness rather than anything else hope but I I so because y'all are saying a bunch of different things I'm trying to like catch them all so first and foremost I want to like in introduce misia into the conversation rather than phobia and I want to introduce that because a lot of the times folks will sit back and say like phobia means that I'm afraid it does not simply mean that you're afraid but let's let's let's create a new space for some new words right like so transmissia and Homo misia meaning the hatred or unfounded disdain for right like there's a lot of that going on and whenever people are like oh I'm not afraid of you you know what you you might not be afraid of me so let's call it what it really is you unfoundedly hate me or dislike me so you are transmitted you're homo Mystic you're all of those things but beyond that what I also want to call out when it comes down to that is that black folk are not Black Folk are not unaware of the fact that black queer people are still in the same space what I think that they like to do is woefully disregard the facts right that we are still black because what I'll notice is that in a conversation where a person might not recognize or or see my transness whatever the [ __ ] that means right away all of the things that I'm discussing about being a black woman are received well they're amend I'm getting the same Auntie sister cousin energy the second that you find out that I'm trans now all of a sudden you have to disagree with me right and it's because to make anything else that you've said that you believe palpable and true in this moment now you have to renege on my blackness right and Center my queerness so that now you don't look like an ass when you say that the thing that I just said the thing that you just said that you agree with me on is now our problem and it's the same thing that happened when I when I recognized that on the Dr Umar panel as I'm up there and we're talking about black issues everybody was okay yeah I spoke with Dr Umar on a piano like a couple of months back on Fox soul and what was so funny about that was that Dr Umar did not clock my transness and in the midst of this interview Dr Umar called me a black queen a beautiful black queen on a couple of different occasions silly new and so after the interview because I got him together right because it wouldn't have mattered if I was just a nobody on the panel who didn't have much to say but because I was able to like come up with thought processes and all of the things now it's the problem and we want to know who this [ __ ] is because who is she and how does who who is she to try to get our King together and so once the research starts getting done and they realize that I'm trans now we're not talking about the fact that you made points now we're not talking about the fact that we just disagree with what you were saying now we want to dismantle it and we want to say fox soul and you know the people on the panel tricked Dr Umar but what does that have to do with the fact that he still said what he said not so said what I said why are we now making this about him saying that I was beautiful and all of these other things when the conversation was censored around whether or not we felt like black men were under attacking Community but the problem is no no I think that the problem is with a lot of people in community is that they love the uh they love the ability to be able to like you said separate the idea of your Blackness because then it gives them the right to treat you the way that they would treat white people if they could right queer black people are the closest that some black people are going to get to being able to be disrespectful in the way that they would to white people if they could and so they take all of that aggression the same aggression that you wanted to give Sarah that you work with your your your uppity ass manager the same aggression that you wanted to give your grandpa who's been racist since the day that you were born I hate your black little face the same aggression that you wanted to give your seventh grade teacher all of that comes to Black queer people because you know if you say that to Sarah she's gonna have your ass locked up you know if you smack so-and-so you gonna be in trouble but if you smack me everybody's gonna give you a hand clap of Praise because [ __ ] that [ __ ] and that's the [ __ ] that I don't like yeah yeah I think it's I think it's easier to alienate you know something I realize about people is especially because I went I was surrounded by white people for a lot of time by being in America white school is West Virginia Ohio all of this so what I realized about what about not just just people when when they want to when they want to discriminate against particular kinds of people because it's easy let's be honest it's easier to be a shitty person than it is to be a good person it's easier to say [ __ ] entire quadrants of people I don't want to be bothered I don't want to think about it I don't want to know it and it becomes easier when you put up the plausible by the deniability of sitting on your foolishness and never no one knows people and so I think that is a lot of the impetus between alienating people like I don't want them in the room because on some level it is it is it is a fear of having these beliefs checked right and I think you see there when it comes to like their masculinity their sexuality all the different things about um uh that they're holding on to what they're really sick about is the idea is like I need to keep I need to keep black Trans women out the room or I need to be told this so I can move in a particular negative you know treat men from the beginning because otherwise God forbid it be revealed I think this black Trans woman was beautiful God forbid what does that say about me and my sexuality that I was treating like and I think that is the foolishness that they come into into you know and it's like all right it's easier it's easier if I just keep them out and then I can create a narrative if you never have trans people at the table then it's easier to get the narrative you want to believe about them and what you want to say trans people are pushing and to get off the agenda nonsense but if you just be in a room with trans people casually there and that's not presented to you and then you are forced to realize you are interacting with And discussing and engaging with trans people the same way with anybody [ __ ] else in the black community because they are like everybody else in the black community that dismantles your whole [ __ ] oh so my question is who gonna throw the first brick and where are we throwing them no break baby but I'll put them underneath all 40s tires I got outside and because I'm here for Brick throwing I'm here for but the thing about it is that and I think DeSean I don't know if you remember like way way way way way back when when we had that conversation um with Lord Jesus I don't forgot the man but we had a conver yeah underneath at all as black people and as a black community I hate to do the old black men on the problem thing where CIS type black men are usually the problem thing but a lot of the time it's hard to decide where you're gonna throw the break when at the end of the day the people that we want to protect most are six black men but the people that are [ __ ] us up the most are six black men so it's like if I throw this brick and I hit Dante in the head I have to then turn around and not only pick him up from the brick that I threw but picked him up from the ass whooping that he caught from the police unjustifiably right and so it's just like at what point like it when Marcia threw that break and when Sylvia and and stormy and all the rest of the folks was like okay we with you there was one common enemy there was one common goal there was one understanding as black queer people if we decide that we're going to attack our attackers that looks a little different because now the police have justification to say well the people that we're attacking are the same people that y'all are attacking or so shouldn't it not be justified why do y'all want to stop whipping their ass when they whooping y'all ass and that is where the problem comes in for me this is this is to me why it is so imperative that we actually have a really grounded understanding of policing of violence of anti-blackness and I I keep bringing us back here but that's my bag because I think that like people really people really do believe what you just said help like oh well what's wrong with the police murdering black people or or black men if black men are the ones who are murdering y'all are black men are the ones who are violating y'all right and it's like Babe's the issue with that is that black men are none of this is innate to them right this is something that's being taught through various systems that some sociologists to call it social institutions where they learn to to police people to dominate people because policing exists right and policing can only exist because of the slave right all of it always leads back to slavery and we don't want to we don't want to sit with that truth but that's the reality and so it's like yeah when I pick up the brick I'm I'm going to start with the police officer and I hope Dante is watching to be clear like babes the police officer is the one that's getting hit up in the head right now but if if there's not a shift that you make you're next right because because I recognize if I have a lot more more grace for for black folks writ large not just black men to be clear the black folks are at large because I recognize the fact that a lot of how we are showing up in in these in these spaces is because we've been taught through various white structures how we're supposed to engage each other and I'm saying we as black folks collectively um and so for me it's like part of the brick that I'm about to throw right now and and what I always feel the the need to like that I always feel the need to talk about in all these conversations is the spread of protestant Christianity right folks you know our communities are are very reluctant to hear that their relationship to Christianity um is not something that has to be interrogated right but the very basis on which this Supreme Court ruling stands is that this woman has a right to not accept people's Lifestyles because of her religious beliefs right conservative religious practices are playing a significant role in what laws are being passed and what laws are being repealed but that is the very Foundation of America itself right the spread apart I think Christianity is what led to and what allowed for shadow slavery to exist in the first place so for me it's like I I'm uh that's my break I'm gonna I'm throwing the brick at the [ __ ] churches yeah because because they because our folks you know like and he at one point in time sure during the 60s the churches was really getting things together and they was really provided for the people they was like really you know giving folks some food giving people some shelter blah blah blah blah blah unless you're in a small rural area now churches are not committed to those same practices and they haven't been for a very long time and they especially are not committed and even if they are right to be clear even if you are committed to those practices you still gotta go I want to be clear that I am very much committed to destroying Christianity and all churches and and honestly religion it's a i anyway so I see all that to say I see all that to say that for me it's like I think that if we if we have an actual grounded critique in the pervasiveness of anti-blackness it will always lead us to the spread of protestant Christianity it will always lead us to this as you know a lot of the folks online love to hate on her and I do have my critiques but she ain't down with this this CIS hetero patriarchy imperialist imperialist patriarchy that live under where the Bell hooks right as long as we are living under that structure we will always have something something that a brick has to be thrown at and and I think that we have to get clear about that and that's the importance of having a real grounded critique in anti-blackness yeah no that is oh the church the role you know what I think is so incredibly frustrating about um the fact that the church the church in Christianity is so foundational to all this [ __ ] is again it is really truly the one thing [ __ ] are not trying to hear you I'm hey you got the most educated scholarly [ __ ] they know in every way shape or form you could not tell them nothing else there's nothing else there's nothing else that I think is the people we could so consciously know is fed To Us by our enslavers by our colonizers we historically know it was for the reason of keeping us okay with the slavery and still [ __ ] will yeah but you to the death to them I got a question yes uh I guess my question is exactly where do we start in uh like addressing this larger culture DeSean I really love that you uh brought Bell hooks into the room because one thing that I was thinking about when you were talking hope when you were talking about uh throwing the brick and hitting Dante in the head uh whatever name you use but like is how Bell hooks talked about the way that even like if you raise for example like a boy to be like anti-patriarchal uh they will go out into the world and be taught those very same lessons of patriarchy so like it's a larger culture that teaches like boys to like separate themselves from their emotions and not to practice uh empathy for the other people in their Community not that that's the set because I know if uh straight success man see this I know how they how they get not that that's all susette men but like yeah some CIS had men most susette men uh uh are taught to dissect themselves from their emotional selves I know I know I was literally just kidding yeah I'll be tired of getting dragged all day I get and that's why I said it Shaheen didn't say it I did I'm tired but no like they're taught to like really cut themselves off from their emotional um their emotional selves and that really impacts the way that we can even uh operate in unity as a as a culture as a people and I think like the weakest link conversation always brings people up in arms but if we really be keeping it a bean if we really keep it at a beam where do we start to address that but we already are and that's the reason why this conversation and conversations like this are even happening right the the movement uh or the first of all what was so funny about it was that you saw so many CIS had black men talking about but where's the black boy Joy y'all got black girl magic y'all got black girl this y'all got black women empowerment where's the black group where's the black boy stuff the road assist head straight throw the CIS at black women um in it in it too I must I must say it as one as the one it's true because hey we right there it's locking lock step on the [ __ ] okay harbingers of misogyny homophones I'm gonna say what what this this gets people tight and it might get some of y'all tight the reality is none of us are exempt from any of that because all of us all of us in many ways want to be gendered right and the gendering that that we're desperately trying to hold on to plays a significant role in in why we are invested in these very gendered structures that are only allowed to exist because of white supremacy because of anti-blackness and that gets the girls upset they're like what do you mean I I meant what I said that's what I said we can really we can we can all the genders all the other things all of us are in in different ways committed to these very same practices because none of we're all being taught in the very same Society we all watch the same TVs listen to the same videos listen watch the same media grew up in the same religious households grew up in the in the very same um education institutions right like we're all being taught in different ways to think about these things in these particular ways and that's that is why I think that despite whatever critiques are offered that's why what the hooks names as in this very like succinct way right CIS heterosexual imperialist patriarchy it's very very important because what she is telling us what she's getting us to understand is that all of us are invested in this in in this very same practice she's the one that named that patriarchy is not exclusive to men that patriarchy is is is not a gendered experience right that those are her words despite the fact that the sis have men love to be like she was on like her babes she she said how'd they get that out can we just talk about how to get that off in the first place because I know that that's like the Bell hooks regularly I don't know nobody else who try to humanize men more than Belle I'm not sure well I'm like I ain't read [ __ ] else trying to humanize they align their identity they align their identity with patriarchy they feel like they are patriarch they literally a lot what I think that's a lot of people they refuse to see that it is we're literally living under this umbrella this construct and that's why we're operating the ways that we are they feel like that is who they are that Sergeant innovative line to get so deeply that if you try to rip you try to strip them away from it or you dare at least challenge them not even challenge them ask them ask somebody why they believe what it is they believe and they even go crazy yeah it's the same people in Christianity they feel so tied to that in their in their Essence and their identity that they can't even say and look at the facts look at the knowledge that we literally have proof of and be like oh maybe I actually don't fully believe this I was told to maybe I'm part I'm just so happen to be indoctrinated by these things they they've done such experience has done such a good job of making people feel like no this is who you are in the system this system isn't just created is this is just how things are and when you believe that you can't deconstruct a system you believe that you can't construct a new one yeah like while you're trying I think in my process of deconstructing like what you were saying to Sean is like there's still aspects where it's like oh I'm I'm tied to being gendered or I'm tied to sexuality I'm tied to the the definitions of certain things because we're still living within the system but trying to deconstruct within the concept that is still happening can be so difficult but some people aren't even ready to even acknowledge that it is [ __ ] [ __ ] is made up I say this all the time I'm like this is really made up like yeah we did not have to have six people make a decision for a whole entire country but we've decided we've just decided that it's not a problem I think that that's the thing though like once the majority says that this is the thing that we've all agreed upon is the least problematic it is hard to step away from the flock because now you don't want to be the person at the high school Dan that's in the middle of the floor while everybody else is like waiting to see when the win the right song or when the right teacher is going to come and embarrass themselves and make it okay and the problem with it is that like nobody who they deem as important enough has made queerness or black queerness and the the culmination of those thoughts okay and so until then I'm gonna hold on to my flocks mentality of thinking that y'all are weirdos y'all are the days and the damns and the we are people and I am normal and until you know until I guess back in the day Lil Wayne says that it's okay to wear you know skinny jeans that eat [ __ ] or until you know the right rapper of the new age says I'm gonna date this trans woman or be this gay queer man and it's not Frank Ocean who we were already questionable about in the first place people are going to continue to feel like it's not okay to do the things that they already feel perfectly fine about a lot of people don't give a [ __ ] about who you having sex with or how you show up they just feel like if they have an affirmative opinion it puts them in the same category as it puts us and rather than be othered they would rather fall in love with things that they don't even know is I have conversations sometimes with like I have a close I have a close friend who who literally called me once because a woman who's in a really who is sleeping with a woman privately but God forbid to them they acknowledge any level of not straight and the real issue the real issue was never about the relationship the sexual attractions the anything but not wanting to be a part of the group you know what I mean not wanting to be a part of the group not wanting to care wanting to be you know separated and not really wanted to explore that night and I think I I think that uh is a big promise I also think the another issue is the fact that like what you said hope is the fact that somebody else always has to speak up I think that is rooted in in anti-in anti-blackness in the same way because rape race just like this especially when it comes to the blackware community in Pacific if they're the only things in American society treated as though expertise actual experience like anything else having more experience or expertise with something makes you the most qualified to hear from it but when you are a queer person you are a black person that is the first thing that makes it delegitimized like they would not listen to Hope give 19 points on all the things but if I go and I say want to quote the hopes points Loosely Loosely quoted viral they love it now you know what I mean the CIS black woman said it so we gonna hear it and I and that is I that is the that is the most dangerous thing I think because it gets us back to the problem you said it like the little way into this like Malcolm X and them always talked about that the dangerousness of the celebrity if you need people other people to speak up for people who are not the experts who are not the people who experience who not this of course you're going to get [ __ ] misinformation or half-assed conversations and discourse and not really get the info and I think what's really dangerous about that is I think people like to think especially I'm a lawyer people love to think that you know you become a lawyer because that's how you think you're going to change it and I'm like why do y'all think that where in the book where you feel that way like a lawyer is a harm reductionist at best on the best day like at best but I'm like a lawyer is fighting within the confines of a system they are working within that system they can't change anything and I always I'm like to me education like in terms of what we tell people what we teach people has obviously the biggest impact because I was always going to be a lawyer but I wasn't always going to be this kind of lawyer like if I didn't read from Angela Davis and my college professors or whoever in college imagine me put in this same kind of intense energy towards coonan or prosecution or whatever it is which easily could go that direction and I think it so I think it has a lot to do what we say like for example like how I first learned at Deshawn is I have belly the beast when DeSean told me about my fat phobic ass without me knowing it I was like I read it and I'm like oh [ __ ] you did not know that I was like let me find out like learn so many things and you can see my annotations and my notes and I think it's like a general unwillingness our society has to one like we take trying to share information as an indictment like I think that and I think that's how people see the LGBT community in general they act like the LGBT community is trying to inconvenience them to stress them out to give them problems they never look at it as like oh I'm I'm trying I'm trying to give you the information to better yourself myself all of us it would help us instead it's like they're trying to stress me out they're trying to cancel me they're trying to give me problems they're trying this and that is a dangerous thing uh I just want to add one more layer to it too yeah beautifully said um too uh I think one thing that's really important for us to keep in mind is like the self-protective nature of a lot of these institutions through violence like when people do speak up like it is oftentimes met with like harsh and I mean very harsh violence um or death like and I think that conditions a lot of people to shy away from being the person I think hope said it in the at the school dance in the middle of the room by yourself like that violence is really like inherent like whiteness is violence let's start with that but like uh that that violence is really like I'm trying to measure my words but it's beaten to like us as a people and I think like it's no coincidence that a lot of the times like uh when queer people speak up it is often met with like that that much apprehension because that violence is something that is in innate in how Society operates here um specifically in this context and I think uh like keeping that in mind the self-protective nature of patriarchy um is is so so essential to being able to maneuver through it and to make changes within it because yeah we can all like all of us it matter of fact all of the people I know here at some point has like been on the receiving end of violence simply from like using using our voices so I don't know I think that's really important to keep in mind too people are scared yeah again I have to be the therapist in the room but people are people are terrified which is why I think a lot of black people specifically just a layer because it's like a lot more and they're not drawn to be terrified honestly because like the LGBT community is specifically the black LGBT lgbtq community are the violence against them are the most legitimized but like it's like you when you think about it right because when it comes to the white queer Community they have whiteness they have the protection of whiteness or whatever and a large and what their experience is within whiteness is entirely different but if the black Wear Community is less [ __ ] hanging because the whiteware community is not coming to to Center to Center to care about to take those issues to win anyway acknowledge that and the black community is saying [ __ ] you you know what I mean you're not blacks aware where do you turn and I think that's not a coincidence why the the violence against black Trans women is so high it's not a coincidence why you see uh legislation in these things disproportionately impact blackwear Community because it's easy to do it which is why I think in general why you see so many attacks against the trans Community Nationwide but specifically who gets the brunt of that are black Trans people because there's so much less people because it's been right now it's like oh yeah there are other there's other other they're unicorn I don't know nobody nobody has to do it or it's treated like whatever that's why that's the reason why statistically trans issues people are not voting on it for our games one way to Nest like whether Republican they're not voting Anything Could Happen the Democrats the Liberals the level and the right leg you know what I mean but nothing uh one way or the next they treated us like this isn't even an electoral issue for us you know what I mean it's an intellectual exercise something for them to field around engage in all this harmful rhetoric without any real level of of knowing who this really impacts good because it's a litmus test it's not about actually seeing you know how these people's lives are going to be affected it's about seeing how the social order is going to react to it right because if I can see whether or not y'all are gonna go you know ham or come out the bag on us about this then we're going to take our time with it we're not going to roll out all of this at one time but if y'all are gonna say [ __ ] them with us now we're going to speed up the process a little bit and I think that that's what people fail to realize is that this the reason why you're seeing trans stuff so much is because it is a test of the of the broadcast system they're just trying to see if y'all are paying attention and what y'all are paying attention to okay so when we bring this up and it affects white queer people um y'all might pick it up for a day it might trend for an hour but y'all ain't really biting on it but if we tell y'all that some the some black Trans girl said something about Aretha Franklin y'all were talking about it for two weeks got you yeah right if we kill if we kill black woman in her car in broad daylight it might trend for an hour or two unless the right celebrity picks it up but if we kill a black [ __ ] it don't matter where the [ __ ] we kill them y'all going ten toes down but we're gonna start killing more black women right and that's what we've seen but the problem is that the litmus test works it shows them where there are chinks in the armor and every single time we show them what we don't care about all they do is nitpick boom and then before you know it we ain't got nothing but a vest and a hell man we wondering what the [ __ ] the rest of the army went and it's because you were paying attention to your feed and you were paying attention to that little vest at whole time because they was working on the legs and knees and you missed it except when the [ __ ] is is trans right when it when when the [ __ ] when it's a trans man or it's it's a non-binary person who they can't really name nobody wants a rally around that nobody wants to hop in the streets around around those folks right no no no I know all kind of I know all kind of black Trans people that have been killed or died in the last so many years I've been a lot of protests I've not been one one themed around that I've never seen that be what's the trending issue I've never seen that be with all the op-eds about like except when it's being done by other trans people right like yeah yeah like or when it's being done to tell you that we're co-opting the movement right so if the movement is about Blackness and if the movement is about us getting free from the police it doesn't Tony mcday got shot in Broad [ __ ] daylight there were several videos of not just trans people the first couple of rollouts of these videos were people in community that we can assume were not a part of the community that said Tony was not in his business he was going through something but he wasn't bothering nobody and these are community members that were saying this but they found out he was trans all of a sudden we don't give a [ __ ] and then in the midst of all of this we were trying to have dual spaces where we could talk about George Floyd and Tony and um the other Olay like all of those people but the second they found out that the other Olay was queer and that Tony was a trans man and not a black CIS man now it's oh y'all are trying to call out the movement that's not what we're here for it's not about but they were both black yeah we're gonna bring the the flags because we want to represent them and what they stood for but they were also black people so you got black queer people that are showing up to these marches and feeling like I can't bring my whole self but I'm trying to support people that would have likely killed me like it sucks that as a black queer person as a black Trans woman I'm gonna go on March for George but I don't know if George would have actually been a person that would have stood up for me but here I am talking about Justice for this man and this man might have been one of the people that was up in my comments talking about I'm a man and I need to die building Christina I was just gonna say I've been thinking about Auntie Harriet Tubman this entire time and that's why she had to go for a reason because if we're talking about throwing bricks and if Johnson has to get hit in the head well I get well move out the way you know what side to be on at the end of the [ __ ] day and it's some [ __ ] made [ __ ] it's just some [ __ ] made [ __ ] it really is like when we're talking about people being afraid because we they can see the vines that you know we'll deal with or people who are more visible more outspoken who don't have the privilege of being able to hide behind some [ __ ] even if they do agree with these with with these right um agree with like transfers and queer rights even if they do want to learn even if they are interested like it's a privilege to be able to hide behind that Veil but there's so many people who cannot hide behind that Veil so you're gonna sit and watch them do with the violence just because that you you know at the end of the day you don't have to that's what makes me sick and it's some white supremacist out of [ __ ] and it's [ __ ] that white people do that but the black community constantly tells white people you hide behind white privilege you hide behind this privilege [Laughter] and I know I know we know that and I know people don't want to hear that but it is and it's like you can be afraid yes but it's literally not gonna stop the violence from happening right to these people and it's not it's not the violence happening to you because what people don't understand is it trickles down you think black Trans people can be exact and you your reality is a black assistant man ain't gonna beat that honey like you you think of that [ __ ] don't align right well I'll say this and speaking on the afraid and I guess the trauma I guess I don't know hope was just preaching over there because I I think about this whole conversation I've been a little quiet because it's just even hard for me to even have these kind of discussions and these conversations because I think that I'm I'm getting these all kinds of flashbacks and I'm getting these feelings of of fear and Trauma that Shaheen has been speaking on which I feel like are all very very valid and I'm thinking like damn am I [ __ ] made because I for a minute I think I've been a little Frozen in Time and like you know how do I say this I know it's kind of hard because I've been living like on like like honestly like I've tried to do my best so I'm just waiting for my time to come and I want to get out of that and I want to throw a break and I wanna start a get in the movement do the movement and I'm like what do we do what are our steps what is what's going to work what's going to work and like how do we not censor the Constitution like that they've been trying to decide all right so on how do we not Center this you know state of white supremacy and you know the American industrial complex and and the Machine that it is so I'm I'm very yeah you know this is a very very uh can I ask you a question yeah do you think living visibly as a queer person in and of itself is like I was literally scary I was about to say that evolutionary love I was living here yeah thank you it really is yeah like Jason I was literally about to say that when you said that I was like first of all I think something people need to forget like remember especially when it comes to like blackness in general but like the added layer of being black and queer is you don't get a choice you know what I mean like your entire existence is political right like you have no [ __ ] say in it right you go out in the world and you are involved in in this right so you were there's already that like maybe you know everybody else might get to choose whether or not they do this or become an ally and they're supported and you know it becomes that but you don't get a choice that's one two I think that being said in not getting that choice and already having to live that existence and being part of this very politicized existence I think Joy is important you know what I'm saying like I don't think I think it's very important what you do is that it is a part of that when I thought when you said it just I was like you know I think you the the bigotry the bigger tree that we exist in in this world that has been pervasive in our entire world the anti-blackness the homophobia all of this is not there because it's the strongest it's not like it doesn't survive it's not pervasive because it makes the most sense or because it's it because it's the the hardest to knock down it's the flimsiest it's there because it's what people see the most it's what's been common it's what's been centered what's been pushing everybody else has been pushed to the outskirts and it's what's been other there's a reason why they want to ban books is the reason why they want to stop visibility of queer people they want to take it out of your face because it makes it easier to do that there's a reason why prisons are put far away where you can't just visit and you can't just go so the fact that you're not just visible you're not just walking around being queer but you're walking around videoing it for the rest of the [ __ ] us you're showing us all kind of queer people you are making that normal to people who otherwise get away with doing this by othering it and making it in a unicorn and all that so you are doing something rebel I just watching outside in front of like a government building the other day you are doing literally amazing things so Awards and I I think we all we all forget because we do know the magnitude of what we're up against but you know last night I was watching something and my friend my boo he was next to me and he was like oh I had a a like I was watching something I was actually I was watching uh why I left tyt video on their transphobia and my boob was like I heard someone say that the other day and I knew it was like some [ __ ] like some transphobic [ __ ] and he was like I knew that was some [ __ ] but I didn't know how to say like I didn't know how to defend it I didn't know articulate it so he's like give me this link I can send that and I'm like that's the things we don't get to see right like I'm like Christina you famous for real they talking about what you saying in real life you really agitating people getting discourse going though and that's real life like I see hope all over the goddamn place look it's being there it's being visible it's saying these things it's like the way I told this on I had never met the show I never talked to the show but I already read all of belly of the Beast you know so you are all doing revolutionary things but even because the average person is not speaking at all you know what I mean they are scared they are this and just you know how many people you probably don't know that you've impacted to like live in their truth which is in and of itself is a part of revolutionary conduct so I want to be clear queer Joy is important and and putting joy out there is important I want to just add uh one more layer yes no about the queer Joy I think that it's like uh just to even like bring it bring it back down to the science right uh bilateral stimulation is like a huge part of like uh processing and metabolizing Trauma and like a two-step for example that's bilateral simulation a lot of the like the things that like we do for our Leisure are like really important uh like just culturally I think we naturally gravitate towards things that help us to metabolize and work through and process drama enjoy how we dance like how we like uh express love for one another that is a huge part of that so like that cannot be like downplayed at all it is a huge part of what I do and why it is important for you to show up and like bring bring that portion to it it's not all doom and gloom just putting that out there um and you know it's important for us not to get uh caught up in that trap too as we are working through metabolizing trauma not only on an interpersonal level but on like a systemic level yes it is the our happiness uh contributes to us having enough energy in life to address a lot of these issues and yeah so just want to give you that love too because like don't don't ever don't play that that is a huge part I don't downplay it but I do this this conversation specifically it does bring back like flashbacks and feelings and fear you know just with all the [ __ ] that we've just lived through and experience and I guess I have tried to create that escape but it definitely there's a part of me that I used to be that I'm not so much anymore and I'm just like y'all are just like you know y'all in the ringer y'all uh you know a pickup thing but I definitely want to acknowledge that like everything I was saying like really really powerful and it's this is a tool of the white supremacy and it's also a tool of the culture right to make us feel like what we're doing is not enough right and I think that that's the thing too it's the the the the oppressor programming our people to making us feel like the way that we show up is an inconvenience right and if we are not showing up in a very particular way then our own Community turns against us and says like well I'm I'm at the Forefront I organized three marches last year and I got Pepsi to sponsor my ball and I got so and so to sponsor a give back and I got it it's this need for hypervisibility and Hyper sponsorship to say I am this because these people know about it and it's not those folks that are creating change like no see no shade I'm very honest about the fact that hope used to be an attractions girl I hope you still be the [ __ ] slapping the police at the front of the line I hope you should meet a girl getting arrested every other weekend I'm not that [ __ ] no more because I don't have to be right there are times in our lives where the shift has to happen you do the work so that the people coming behind you can learn from your example not so that you can stay in the trees for the rest of your life my goal in doing that work was for me to dig right so that I can be at some point in a position where I'm a where I'm a Laverne or Angelica or one of those people because [ __ ] I want to live my self-life and sit in my penthouse in the middle of Manhattan too but the thing about that is I'm not gonna feel and I'm not gonna let you make me feel bad about it once that shift starts to happen because I put in the man hours and I'm making space to pass the mic at this point JC you feel like you're you're in your Pastor Mike era and there's nothing wrong with that the work is still being done and it's getting done but it's not requiring the labor that you used to put in and I think for anybody listening to this don't think that because the work feels like it's getting easier don't think because your wardrobe to show up to the moment are are changing that you're no longer valuable to the movement [ __ ] you put like my things at the end of the day of Martha and Sylvia and all of them were still alive first of all no not even if Miss Majors is still alive is Miss major still walking around here with picket fence and like picking signs no she's living her soft life from the work that she did before and we are the people that are carrying that out So for anybody that feels like your evolution is a downgrade to the move man [ __ ] stop like stop that [ __ ] and stop allowing one of these these new babies and these [ __ ] white supremacists to make you feel like unless you're out here on your hands and knees begging and scraping and scrumping that you are not doing the work because the work has already been done and all I'm doing is sustaining it and make sure that babies know how to get what they got to go safely if that's it let's breathe let's breathe it in I can't that was alive I'm [Laughter] crying I'm crying but no I just want to add a caveat to that to say that you know I really love this I love this conversation because as someone who and hope knows this I mean I think you also know this too but as someone who for a decade has been outside running from police guns pointed in their face right like building on the ground being threatened by secret service right like who has been who has been outside right my commitment to how I show up looks different right I know I don't feel committed in the same ways to run it from police in the streets unless unless it's a particular strategy right yeah um but my commitment to the movement has not changed I think that is to me that feels like the most important piece because a lot of people will get to a place where and I don't have to name names because we know the names right we know that we know the names of the people who have who have built entire lives right off the back of the movement actually I wore that names I don't give a [ __ ] you know we have the Patrice colors and we have the Sean Kings right we have the Tamika Mallory's we have the delays right people who have built entire hello I I don't I don't I don't give no no [ __ ] I'm not gonna say that to nobody I don't give no fun for the names no shade no Pig lemonade I'm I'm a I'ma name the things as they are right we know that people have used the movement as a catalyst to to to live big lives to steal from folks so that they have that they sit on top of millions of dollars right they have money and access and resources that folks do not have right and I think that that's because one folks are not in community with people or they're in community with people who have the same commitments as them right um but also not reassessing their commitments to the struggle and for me right it looked like sure I might not be outside every every day which y'all running from police but I do have a mean media and calm strategy right I do know how to write up a Manifesto I do know how to make sure that I'm bringing the the words the voices from folks on the ground into the writing that I'm producing that helps to create a narrative that matters for folks who are on the ground right my commitment has not changed how I show up has changed and I think that's very important um because people they think that when they people do this sort of this sort of thing that to me feels very like cognitive dissonance where they're like you know I'm I'm moving into a different iteration of the struggle but their commitments don't look the same right they're not committed to folks in the ground they're not they're not listening to people who are on the ground they're not engaged with people on the ground and then they wonder why folks are like calling them out for being celebrity or celebrity adjacent or are calling them out for not having any real commitments to folks who are producing the very real like work that's happening to be able to make make space for any type of Revolution that's going to happen in the first place um so I wanted to name that because I think that's a very important caveat and also name I don't think of myself or as my work as revolutionary right um I show up in in whatever capacity I have as somebody who gives a [ __ ] and ask somebody who is wanting to move us closer to Revolution right and and I'm and I mean Revolution not as something for us to look back on but Revolution as something that does not have a promise of being on the other side right Revolution that that says that all I know is that this world is [ __ ] up and if it means that we gotta end this [ __ ] I don't know what happens after that but I know that this [ __ ] gotta end right that's what I'm trying to move us closer towards and I don't think that any of the work that I'm doing and that many of the people are doing right now is revolutionary because we're not getting no closer to that but what I do know is that we are in a dying Empire right we are we are experiencing what it means to be living on the tail end of an Empire that has existed for far too long and so whatever we can do to show up in in our abilities right whatever it may look like is what I think we should be doing um until we get to a point where we can actually be revolutionary so I wanted to say that because you know I won't get into it there's nothing no shade but some some of the folks be having me [ __ ] up sometimes and I have to be clear that I do not think about myself or my work as revolutionary I do think of it as clarifying I do think of it as something that's in relationship to being on the ground I do think of it as something that's driven by that is POS made possible because of my relationship to being outside right and and I think that it's important because it only happens because I'm in community with people who also have those same commitments I've had people have a problem when I say that like oh I am not a revolutionar and I've never identified as something that is very wild I always say I am a harm reductionist at the very best like and especially my lawyer capacity um because you know listen my my Blackberry icon my girl Audrey Lord has always put it to me is there are no new pains you know what I mean there are no this is a discourse that has existed everything I am saying somebody has said before there are just new ways to make your ideas felt and that's all I'm trying to do I took it all the time I'm always aware of how much like people don't read in White America ain't familiar with nothing because it ain't nothing I need nothing I've ever said or a spouse was not educated and told me by a black person that's come before me and you will go say it and people will act like you put something novel into the world and I'm like no no the way I see it personally for me is I'm just a mitch who talks all day I would if you didn't if I was I've been running my mouth since 93 and I will run my mouth till I die and so I realize I'm like listen in a different world I would love to go be a city girl go be cute go mind my business go nibbon I'm like y'all think I want to talk about bigotry but y'all it's just that it is the reality of this world that we live in and so for me I was like you know what if I'm gonna run my mouth anyway when I realize that old people like to listen to me they would listen they will read they'll whatever if I go up into me I'm like well I was gonna talk anyhow so I might as well talk about something that Services The Liberation people and that's how I see it I'm like if I have a platform it's not that I think anything that I can or will ever do is revolutionaries what I believe is that I allow me cannot push the needle by myself I can't push nobody's needle by myself but if there are a bunch of other people like me same mind same ideas other black people all these queer people that we can put there if all of us can talk that makes a big big difference I'm like you know what if y'all gonna listen to me I have a platform let me platform the views I want and see how I can help us in the slightest bit move towards what is our larger shared Vision but not because I have it [ __ ] up and I think because I'm always like hey yo the real revolutionaries are dead or political prisoners let's try out that's how I see it so yeah thank you you wonderful people for coming to join me today I'm sorry I have to say this I have to say this episode I couldn't get my mic off mute fast enough I love that you said that because folks say it say it folks be walking around here you know a lot of the people on Twitter thinking that they have valid criticisms of of people who have put in real work when they haven't done [ __ ] and I want to be clear I want to be clear there is something very important and significant about digital organizing digital organizing does not start and stop on Twitter and if you have not put in work with Community I don't actually give a [ __ ] about what you have to say because the reality is that none of us are doing revolutionary work right this when we we go to sleep tonight and wake up tomorrow we will still be in the same [ __ ] America that has not shifted the Empire will not have fallen right and and to me there is the Revolutionary work starts when we start to crumble all this [ __ ] that's when I know that we're doing revolutionary [ __ ] in this moment we're building capacity for for a revolution to get to whatever that experience is right and I think that there's nothing wrong with acknowledging that there's nothing wrong with with being clear about that and this this idea that everything that we that we do has to be or in some way already is revolutionary to me all that it really shows to me is that we romanticize revolutionary Aesthetics in a very particular way that that remove us from any real context of Revolution and all of that has to do with how we've been indoctrinated into wanting to even those of us who who have a a grounded um or a deep understanding of these systems right we have these this com this commitment this desire to still being able to experience a life wherein we are gendered or we're in we have access to certain amounts of money or we're in right where we have access to the very things that we're critiquing right and that desire is what keeps us from any possibility of Revolt right so what I'm committed to is is the undoing of these desires so that we can get to a revolution but until then let's be clear none of this [ __ ] is revolutionary it's preparation for the Revolution and that's what matters [Music] maybe the main ones foreign
