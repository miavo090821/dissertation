Not to mention their tendency to police the language of activists doing the real work. \n\nIt was so nice to hear Olay speaking so much sense about the situation on Leftist mafia last week. It’s so disappointing that one of the very biggest organizations in Progressive/Leftist media is so reactionary and self-interested. Olay is spot on that they see themselves as some kind of Lefty Royalty.\n\nI am done with them. I don’t need to hear bad, reactionary takes. You know? Especially from supposed Progressives. We have to always think critically about the media we consume, but we also gotta curate what we consume. Be sure it’s worth our time and mental energy. \n\nTYT is dangerous because they’re  still mostly Progressive. That makes the terrible, bigoted takes so much more harmful. It’s more insidious. And more likely to open their remaining audience up to further arguments from the Right.\n\nThey’ve finally become the funnel themselves instead of just promoting people who do it like Jimmy Dore.",

Why would you think about the importance abortion rights to women when you can pretend there’s some sort of threat from trans people? \n\nIt’s always been this way, when they couldn’t literally point at a racial/religious group and blame them, we had ‘welfare queens’, ‘family values’, Satanic panics and ‘chaos at the border’.

I just saw the clip of your segment. \n\nI’ve been keeping my eyes out for your video content in particular ever since. I don’t agree with every single take, oc, but some of your points are just so insightful!\n\nIt’s really gotten me thinking when you pointed out a while back that we don’t need to wait for the baddies to admit what they are. You are absolutely correct that there’s a weird emphasis placed on confession. When we have to make big, society/country-level decisions about the people we allow to have power based on the facts available, not whether the specific bad guys in question have confessed their sins.\n\nI am so glad you’ve got your own channel now too! Keep it up! I know you also have a day job doing really important work too, but don’t discount the importance of your rhetorical work online.\n\nShow us more Raheem, please! Once he’s speaking to you again. I have been there too. Lol.",

Obsession indeed. \n\nThank you so much for the video ♥ (also side note I really love your Gengar and Badtz-maru stuffed animals [really the plushie setup in general])",

While I agree that this should exist to keep just anyone from getting hormones bc they want it,\n\nit is also paper thin bc just anyone can fake dysphoria too to get hormones. This is why it's such a hairy topic to discuss. \n\nThat said, I also think that dysphoria being a mental disorder is very demeaning and even offensive to transpeople as well. Very difficult topic to talk about since there is too much grey area there. \n\nI like your content! Only thing is the music in the background is really loud and bothers my hearing a lot (i have a hearing disorder) and it's hard to hear your voice over it.",
