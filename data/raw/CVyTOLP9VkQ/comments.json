I say this as someone who's parents are both black attorneys, but the kind of \"don't give an inch\" arguments you have to make in court aren't how you learn anything or have a productive exchange. And like they point out in the video, that mentality can really damage community and relationships. It doesn't leave any room for empathy or the possibility mid-arguement to acknowledge you might be wrong.\n\nLol, guess it's no surprise that I say that last part as someone with divorced parents.",

She has gone viral in the past for other incidents where she incited public attention and exaggerated some details. I also checked her tiktok and she said she called the police department 27 times trying to get charges on Olan or whatever dude name is that assaulted her. The police failed to press charges and instead was tipped off by Daphne about her making erroneous gofundme in the past. I find it quite strange that the police failed to press charges even with video evidence of him hitting with an object. And the fact that she reported two police officers for making fun of her online about this case makes it seem like retaliatory behavior from the cops bc although they claimed mutual combat one has medical reports of what happened and the other doesn’t. If she had to be hospitalized how is that not assault with a weapon?",

It's why black women who tell the truth about their assault don't get nearly the empathy and support they desperately need and deserve compared to the outrage and vitriol women like Rho receive and will continue to receive for years to come. \n\nIt is wrong that Rho lied about the details. But, more importantly, why is it that instead of using that energy to go and support the black women who tell the truth, these black men take to Twitter to celebrate their \"got ya\" moment and spew their disdain over cases like this? I think Foreign made a really good point at the end (Olay has mentioned this multiple times, too) that it's the institutions that are the problem. It's the pd. It's misogynoir. This is, at best, myopic and a symptom of the problem. Trying to fix this by trying to send her to jail or prison is just going to make things worse.",

There are plenty of cases of where the nature and details of the abuse is clear yet the female victim is met with suspicion, hostility or blamed for their suffering. There is an irrational and unfair expectation for victims to be perfect. Male victims included. Life is messy, violent and/or abusive situations are extremely messy. It's ridiculous to expect any involved to be angels or innocent damsels in distress. It's just not reality and doesn't help build the consciousness necessary to help people recover and prevent these incidents. I think some people are more interested performance of morality ( condemning lying)  rather than being empathetic and pragmatic with situations. Victims can and probably will lie because they think it will protect them or increase their chances of getting help. That says more about the public than it does the victim. We pick and choose who's deserving of salvation and fail to analyze the full context of why some may lie in these scenarios. We pick apart the humanity of alleged victims and even the alleged abusers before proper investigation and reflection.  We fail to acknowledge how our biases feed into these scenarios and also perpetuate the cycle of the abuse. The onus is not just on the victim to be honest but the entire public. We do live in society that likes to protect and justify abuse. We live in a victim shaming culture. If we can't be honest and address that how can we expect victims to take the risk with honesty?",

    "text": "I get with the two brothers on the left are talking about, but the lady did definitely perpetuated a narrative especially in how she framed it. \n\nThat said, she didn't really do anything that harmful. The people who gave their money a mutual aid got their money back. She didn't fraud anybody because the money was being used for medical bills for what we see on her face. The most she lied about was what she got hit with, and that really doesn't matter because we see the damage that was done to her face, so it's not like she lied about that. It really doesn't matter if she put her hands on dude first, cuz the fact that you went for a fucking bottle to harm her with his practically attempted murder.\n\nShe definitely shouldn't get any jail time, especially 30 days. Like at best I'll give you like a week, but in the end this was still a mainly victimless crime and if you want to point to a victim in it, look at the woman with bruises all over her face. She's the only one who had any real harm done to her, both physically and getting dragged online for something that doesn't have to do with the assault & is more being looked at because of how it made a lot of black men feel.\n\nLike two things can be true at once, but certain things matter more than the other.",

That is foul, and she is an agent of yt supremacy. \n\nFalse accusations are also a part of the AA male experience, usually resultant of yt women tears. To have one of our own resort to the same tactics of yt supremacy is the rub.

My believing her adversely affects me in what manner? Both are rhetorical questions. Maybe you have some scale you use to grade belief. Let me explain this belief of mine: face value. No different from if you told me you were a lawyer, I wouldn't disbelieve you. I would take you at face value and keep it pushing. I don't know about you, but I would rather err to the side of humanity and dignity for a victim.\n\nThis view is not so mypopic that another value cannot exist simultaneously. That value is of due process for the accused. 1. the victim should be able to come forward without fear and be provided support 2. the accused should not be guilty until they have received due process.\n\nI will continue giving grace and the benefit of doubt until I am provided with facts contradictory to the person's story.

Not because I don’t care about anyone  but I’ma  prioritize myself 😂💕 (love me some me) so that’s number one.

People can say that “people are complex and multiple things can be true” but that feels like a new concept and the internets aren’t a safe place to critique. I never feel satisfied with real conversations done on Instagram or tiktok. 🤷🏾‍♀️ ESPECIALLY when it has to talk about Black business  AND black women🖤\n\nUpdate: and also… IN MY OPINION, when situations trigger trauma, I don’t mean personal trauma though that is real, I mean COLLECTIVE HISTORICAL TRAUMA as a result of colonization, white supremacy, and police states and the internalization and indoctrination of such, CANNOT HELP BUT COME UP. On all sides. It feels like that BW don’t get the grace/compassion/space to speak UNLESS we create it ourselves. (And BM, please make space amongst yourselves to have the convo). There is HARM between all identities within our community. There is distrust that’s seeded. And the need  to repair and have restitution when problems arise HAS NEVER been a part of the policing system. And yet we want this for ourselves. But that means there’s even more work (😭😂) to do in even imagining what would actually repair a problem. And no one situation is the same.

    "text": "I just want to fist start by saying that this has been a very insightful conversation I had witnessed. It gave me a perspective on how to view most of the dynamics of black women and non-masculine presenting black people in society. Initially, I was outraged when I first heard of the story, and my thoughts were that it's very disheartening to see black women, ESPECIALLY dark skinned black women, not being protected by black men in society. Now, before people come for me - it's not all men obviously, but it seemed to be the general conversation amongst men in this panel, and I found it important to mention that because they had a substantial platform and subsequent interest. I watched a video similar to this, and it had both black women and black men discussing the topic of black women and social protection. Most of the men in that video mentioned that they TOO were afraid of the guy who stroke back at the time (of course considering the fact that they didn't have the full story), and stressed that they would be putting their lives on the line because they want to play the hero.\n\nAt the time, I was studying Colorism and it's historical trauma - especially pertaining black women. From watching F.D Signifier, Lil' Bill and Foreign Man In A Foreign Land videos about Black Masculinity. They inspired me to search further and study the history of the oppression of black women by both the black and white community. It hurt me to find that even STATS confirm that black women receive generally less social protection in society than any other women in society (the homicide rates and birth mortality rates being the first reference of point.). Now, getting to my point... As I sit here and watch this video as a non-masculine presenting individual, I am hurt by what the two of the three men on your panel are saying by ignoring the fact that whether this lady lied or not; a woman reporting a case like this is normally questioned EVEN if it was true. They are refusing to acknowledge the fact that even if the woman was fighting ANOTHER woman, the responder STILL had an advantage over the attacker. One man even casually spoke about how she may have deserved something like this by attacking people first, as if that justifies the fact that being stricken with a blunt object that could potentially be a WEAPON as a response is okay. Even if the man was smaller or had less strength than her, he STILL had an advantage over her simply because he had a WEAPON as a response to violence when he could have resorted to SO many other non-violent solutions. One of the men also emphasized that although this happened and we'll say... This was true (hypothetically speaking), there was still a group of men who would question on whether or not she was attacked. SAME thing with Megan before the police proved her right. It shows that black women are not believed most of the time, and that until they have proof then something will be done. Now here's the sweet part; one of the two men was so adamant that something should be done about people who lie in these instances, like there wasn't a sea of black men bashing her and calling her names (I'm just being sarcastic of course). I agree, if they press charges and are found to being lying then they should be countersued by the state for perjury and malicious intent. That can be something that is discussed,  and also whether or not the person they lied about wants to press charges or not. But STILL; this was not the point of this conversation- or I'm assuming. \n\nThese 2 men proved to me that psychologically, black men have little to no understanding of the empathy that black women and non-masc black people are seeking from masc-presenting black men, and that they seek not to understand most of the time but DEFEND black men without critically assessing the key element of the situation. There was one woman on the panel as well who gave empathy to this level of thinking from black men. And listen; I am NOT saying that there aren't beautiful, masculine-presenting, healthy, good black men out there... I am saying that there aren't enough of those out there reprimanding the men to actually understanding what black women mean. Men like Jason Wilson, a BLACK man, who I cry every time I watch his videos. He brings a very vulnerable yet strong, open-minded and symbiotic way of viewing the world without losing your identity as a black boy/man. I just wish he had more of a platform like these RED PILL BLACK MEN you normally see on the internet because he would buffer most of these toxic ideologies that they spread. Now, I want my black man to eat - but masculinity is providing, which means you provide insight and awareness on matters that affect the future generation. It could also help prevent the unwanted experiences of most of black boys' childhoods. \n\nNow, there's nothing wrong with this woman seeking a GoFundMe to get financial assistance with her medical fees. Also, she DIDN'T press any charges pertaining the incident. But I will say, that mutual combat is always reliant on the intrinsic scenario in which the case is labeled under. I'm sure we can all agree that being the only one in combat with a weapon is advantageously unfair. Yes, she LIED about what happened. At the same, we still don't know the context of the conversation that was had before she struck the guy, as she had claimed that he wanted her number. I am STILL not justifying her actions and her LIES, but I will not DISREGARD the fact that THIS happens to women who don't give out their numbers if not worse. As for the woman going into the community and apologizing, I don't see why she should because she didn't get social protection; EVEN after the truth came out. And lastly, I think the new topic we should be talking about is how do we reprimand and rehabilitate people that makes mistakes instead of treating them like uncivilized individuals. I think it's important to acknowledge that the main reason for crime is poverty, and until we talk about how that's trauma for a lot of people - we're not ready to have all this conversation. With all that being said; I don't see why they need to persecute them.",

So we can stand on the moral high ground and look down on her. The natural consequence is that no one is going to take her seriously; she lied so we should vet her claims.  That's it.  We don't need her head on a stick.  We get to keep minding our own business while she picks up the pieces of her life and gets it together.  The idea that she should be punished is just wild.",

She was assaulted outside the car and called for help to stop him before he drove away. She didn’t lie about asking for help and not getting help with stopping him from fleeing. She didn’t start the gofundme and never received any money from it. I really don’t understand the fraud charges and I truly believe Houston PD would not have cared about this case had Black men had not hyped it so much in the first place because they don’t believe victims especially when they are Black women. I’ve never heard so many Black men parrot the words of a DA: mutual combat mutual combat because they have a moment of reprieve to say see look we aren’t inherently violent like you make us out to be. And that was never the claim in the first place but they would have to listen to Black women to understand our actual experience of them.",

I agree with him that yes black men can be victimized and are often portrayed unfairly as abusers, yet it seems like hes making an implicit defense of Rho's attackers by constantly trying to bring up her accountability in the situation. I just wish he could talk about those issues while trying not to throw Rho under the bus or without inadequately addressing the legitimate danger and disempowerment black women are often exposed to, being some of the most vulnerable people in American society.\n\nAnd then the comment about Rho calling him up cuz of her body 🤢🤢🤢",

Abusers will push a button so much in you and then make sure when you snap it's in a public so they can say you're crazy. It's so upsetting to see ppl still falling for this manipulation technique. \n\nThere shouldn't be consequences for anything she did. She asked for help in a broken healthcare system, embellishing details. Victims dont owe you a detailed truth of their abuse, it could include embarrassing or private information. Or the victim simply knows they won't get help without embellishment, people are NOT sympathetic to victims unless you meet a whole imagined checklist of innocence parameters.\n\n\nI would be willing to bet most people who gave to her gofundme are other people who understand abuse and would still want to help her, even with the new news. How is she gonna pay her medical bills now? Is she ok? Is anyone protecting her now that there is a hate mob of backlash against her? Who hurt her? Has he hurt other people? There are so many more important questions than the \"gritty details\"🤢. This is really hard to listen to😢",

I just wanted to mention that I have been noticing a strong divide in the black community and I don't know if it's planned by the powers that be or an unintended side effect but it feels like divide and conquer. In the past few years I've been trying to make sure not to lump ppl of color into one group, like \"the black voter\" but it seems like something is trying to break up black unity. Again I'm an outsider looking in and just trying to understand this country we live in. I will say I grew up in the south around a lot of prejudice and I've always known that when white ppl realize they are losing power/dominance they were going to freak out. I hope that I'm wrong because it would be a major set back for everyone.",
