Afghanistan requested aid from the Soviets, being a caring neighbour and friend of their people they decided to help. His argument of saying that the Soviet's stance to protect a friend was wrong and stupid, is a very selfish way to look at it and reminds me of the American narratives around the \"divide and conquer\" strategy, which could be what he has fallen victim to.",
