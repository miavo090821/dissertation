It's culture 100%, it's who you are letting in. You are letting the rednecks of Islam in. I have huge respect for anyone else who speaks up and is willing to take the brunt of what they can throw to silence you. Those who stand and look will bring no change as idle hands achieve nothing. My armour is my lord jesus christ and if I get struck down by my enemies he will show me the way to win against all odds no matter how much damage i sustain both physical and emotional.

        "text": "I do not know the ages here.  Back in the day, UK was a great country - safe t leave doors open etc.  I am afraid you need to blame successive governments All wanting Cheap Labour.  Back in the day there seemed to be less hostility towards ‘others’.  Whilst you eat your madras or chow mein, reflect how much better we all are.  No one complained when we had EU immigration.  No one complained when Ukraines were offered a safe haven in uK.   During Covid, The gov have been operating under the radar.  The EUs policy for free movement has affected many countries negatively, Germany, Sweden. ….  When Sovereign countries like UK, US insist on destroying other countries to ensure democracy, they create problems.  And the countries they help destroy (collaborating with forces like Al Quaeda) become destabilised and war torn, with inhabitants being desperate.  Women and children left whilst the men leave to seek fortunes in another land.  So whilst I totally agree that the UK has been trashed, my opinion is that the UK and other countries have collaborated to prioritise regime change over sovereignty. Because the resources of Africa, Russia, Iran, Syria etc are too attractive to resist. Great Britain was so brilliant at ruling and stealing from other countries.  The history of Africa, India etc are intrinsically linked.  Is it possible that Karma is a true  …tch and now we are paying?  Or is it just that the Breaking Down of Nation States   Is actually part of the plan.  Having us all savaging each other is a perfect plan for a tyrannical entity.",

You know a time where full auto weapons were sold and you could buy a gun through a catalog and have it shipped to your home and take it to school the day after it arrived. You need to account for long term stats and spikes genius. Britain's rate is currently more then DOUBLE its 1950's rate. And again this is with lower reporting standards (note lower reporting standards is BAD it means there is higher chances for crimes to go unreported at all levels).",

This can reverse the intended effects of a weight management plan. Some short-term side effects include headaches, dizziness, light-headedness, fatigue, low blood pressure and abnormal heart rhythms. It is argued that fasting may impair the body’s ability to absorb certain medications and interfere with everyday vital bodily functions. Abstaining from eating could also be risky for individuals who are already malnourished, for example, cancer patients. Eventually, the effects of abstaining from food varies largely based on the individual who is fasting.",

That's why you see them dominating the local population and other ethnic groups.\nMy calculation says that presently there are 2-3 brits for every muslim in most of the urban areas and they are catching up very fast.\nIt's high time brits get organised, stand behind true heroes like Tommy and choose the right people. \nIt's now or never. \n\n🍹🌹🍹",

That's why you see them dominating the local population and other ethnic groups.\nMy calculation says that presently there are 2-3 brits for every muslim in most of the urban areas and they are catching up very fast.\nIt's high time brits get organised, stand behind true heroes like Tommy and choose the right people. \nIt's now or never. \n\n🍹🌹🍹",

        "text": "It’s interesting because look, Christians and Muslims have most of the same rules about society though there are differences in punity. Some say Allah is God, the one and only same as ours with a different name. Jesus directs us to tell EVERYONE about him and that you don’t have to be a Jew to receive salvation lest you believe he’s the son of God, who died for our sins, was resurrected and is coming back for those who follow his commandments, that mostly Christians, Jews and Muslims have in common. So, it’s to me, kind of equivalent to another denomination of Christianity to ask me to convert, why? If we are already following the basic principles of faith and worship? It’s a bigger difference in culture and practice and various nuances of worship rather than a question of who’s right and wrong. This again is assuming that YHWH and Allah are one & the same. And the only other explanation is that YhWH had a different purpose for each of us just as the angels all have different jobs. They all must worship The Almighty but he has different purposes for each of them and asks them to do different things.",

This way, it's impossible to go even an hour or two without knowing about the full weight of the movement, and it's impossible to do anything else, or to move away from it, as there are no long periods of not being aware of it, or deeply soaked within it. The same is true for many yearly holidays for Muslims, all requiring many careful rituals and so on, moving all of culture in the same direction, stopping all national work if required. It creates an order and stability on a daily basis that is difficult to shake or penetrate. (The prayer, also, must face Mecca from anywhere in the world. Hence, signs in the lakes of England with signs, pointing the direction.)",

The Bible is 2/3rds prophecy. Play time is over. \nRussia, China and Muslims will join against the rest of the world at the valley of Megiddo.

        "text": "\"The homogeneity of European nations is fundamentally against the interests of the Jewish people. We are a critcal turning point in history. The West is becoming more racially diverse, and soon the White Race will be forced into submission.\n\"The future of the west is that of an ethnically diverse melting pot, where the evil divisions of race and white supremacy no longer reign. This is all thanks to the tremendous power of our social movements and institutions. This great change will be catalysed by the Moslem settlement. From the land of Israel, Jews will forever be a light unto the new monoracial world as guarantied by God.\"\nRabbi Abarron Haviv - World Jewish Congress Summit 2011",
