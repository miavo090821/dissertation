hello everyone eddie smith here coming at you with a long overdue video i'm reviewing this book talking about evil morales this book is called evo morales the extraordinary rise of the first indigenous president of bolivia it is by martin sivak um and it's martine had unprecedented access to evo um for many years he was able to follow along with evo so he wrote this book talking about evo's rise to power um evo's politics the socialist revolution of sorts in bolivia um but also just covering evo's personal life right this is a pretty fun read it's not a super dense historical book um but there's still a lot you can learn from it and there's a lot that i think we can learn from bolivia um the way they had their sort of non-violent revolution there and a movement towards socialism through the trade unions and then through seizing um political power electorally so we're going to talk about that a little more in depth so like i said it's a pretty easy easy and fun book to read there um evo was elected in 2006 he was the very first indigenous president elected to bolivia bolivia's got a long history of racist exploitation where the indigenous people have been forced to work for the colonizers um so evo becoming um the first indigenous president was a huge thing obviously there are tons of racist attitudes and classist attitudes left over um from from the colonial period there and bolivia's been a country with a long history of dictators who are backed by the west so evil was rising to power through the coca growers union one of bolivia's main crops is coca which is used to make many things one of the things being cocaine but evo always stresses you know and he's pro coca there's been a us drug war led against bolivia by the dea saying look at all this cocaine that's coming into america we need to nip it in the bud we need to get rid of this bolivian coca and evo says no we grow the coca and we use it to make shampoo and soap and other stuff but then we sell it and and the cocaine is actually created in i believe it's japan before it ever gets to the us so evo says you have the dea and these us officers in bolivia when bolivians aren't even doing cocaine right we just grow the coca leaves and then we sell them and our economy is partially based off that mostly because western companies for a long time have extracted things like coca from bolivia so there's a lot of turbulence in bolivia uh evo's rising rising through the unions in the late 90s and the early 2000s in the early 2000s and 2000 you have the water crisis and in 2003 you have the gas crisis in bolivia um situations where essentially the water was privatized right they said we're going to give the water over to multinationals rather than making water a publicly owned commodity that everyone has access to um this created mass protests basically riots in the street it was semi-violent protests and they actually won um both the bolivian dictator actually said this is too much we're going to lose power here by trying to privatize this water and give it away to western multinationals while the u.s was saying no just do it just privatize it's the way to go but the people said no forget this and that was in the early 2000s same thing happened with gas in 2003. so evo then wins election in 2006 promising to nationalize more industry not only keep coca uh the coca leaf industry around not only to contin keep keep water nationalized but to nationalize the hydrocarbon industry nationalize the entire gas industry nationalize the tin and lithium industries um and and because of this the us portrayed him as a drug trafficker because of his support of the coca leaf the u.s portrayed him as this international narcotics terrorist who needs to be overthrown and if you look at anything about evo in the u.s media you're going to find things about him being a narcotics a narcotics dealer but what it's really about is evo wanted to nationalize all of bolivia's natural natural resources so this includes yes coca which is sold out of bolivia and then can be refined into cocaine but also the hydrocarbons also the gas although also the lithium these are the natural resources that the us is really interested in so the u.s media portrays evo as this drug trafficker and the bolivian bourgeoisie uh their media sort of portrays evo as not only a drug trafficker but this sort of dumb hick who just doesn't understand politics and doesn't understand economics because he's an indigenous person this is a stereotype that you saw with the rise of hugo chavez that you've seen with lula in latin america where they have these stereotypes of indigenous people as sort of these dumb hicks which is funny almost considering how well evo ran the government and how much he learned about economics and about industry in his time as government and and one of his main skills as we'll talk about later was surrounding himself with people who understood the things that he himself didn't understand um so after coming to power evo invested in food vouchers for kids um invested in social security for people 60 and up foreign companies who were taking 82 percent of the profit out of bolivia and paying 18 to the government evo reversed that so now they were paying 82 percent of the profits they made off bolivian resources to the bolivian government and the company could only keep 18 so we're seeing here the us losing power and losing a foothold over bolivia while the bolivian people are seeing the wealth that's created by their labor and by their natural resources reinvested in their country via things like social security and food vouchers and of course during this time you're going to see massive reductions in poverty massive reductions in infant mortality massive reductions and hunger and actually an increase in gdp which is which is interesting and luis arsey who's now the president of bolivia post u.s coup um who has won in an election um and evo has been returned to the country we'll talk about that more later evo always had luis arse and other people like our say around him who were economists who were trained in industry who were trained in understanding the global markets the the um who were trained and dealing with these giant private multinationals to try and to try and build socialism in bolivia right to do things like reverse what that multinational was paying to the bolivian government from 18 and taking 82 percent profit reversing that that's just one example of a policy that was implemented that was implemented because they understood the multinationals who were in their country they understood the conditions of bolivia and if evo didn't understand the conditions he had people around him who understood the condition so they knew exactly what they pitch and that's why even though they had nationalization and even though every libertarian will promise you that nationalization could never work one they were able to reinvest in their people but two they were able to grow their gdp they were producing more stuff and exporting more resources than they were when when the multinationals had control of bolivia um so so really you know you're seeing um bolivia building socialism in the 21st century right building socialism in the face of u.s imperialism and in the face of neoliberalism building a new path for themselves nationalizing these industries by understanding the economy sorry my alarm went off and my video stopped recording by understanding their own economy and by understanding the conditions of their own countries how they were able to do that so there's a lot of really cool personal stuff about evo morales in this book too um including talking about how he likes to dress in traditional like indigenous bolivian garb rather than wearing stuffy suits or whatever else which i thought was kind of cool you know i don't think there's anything wrong with wearing suits or presenting yourself well but i just like that he preferred to be casual and wear stuff that was made in bolivia he loves soccer he plays soccer anytime he visits these countries they set up soccer games between evo and his bodyguards versus the other countries pretty funny he has a short temper um so he's harsh with the people around him but he keeps a lot of smart people around him he's all about working with a team and i mean you could talk about bias like obviously this book is pretty biased but we're talking about the first indigenous president in bolivian history who's looking to build socialism in the face of um ridiculous blatant imperialism from the u.s so it's hard not to root for this guy right this book builds a little bit of a cult of personality around him but it's whatever like you can still be critical of evo and and like his personality um and you can learn a lot about what he did right because he he built socialism by rising up through the trade unions rising up through the major industries in bolivia and earning the respect and the support of the actual bolivian working class and that was what was able to help help him eventually achieve political power i did a review of bernie's book a while back where he talked about how he achieved political power in vermont um very similar thing working directly with the unions not telling these people this is what we're going to do for you but listening to them what do you want done and then laying out a plan of okay we're going to do nationalization reinvest in the people blah blah blah you can figure out the technical economic stuff but it all stems from listening to the working class you know we want dictatorship of the proletariat the working class should be in control of the state and evo is from the working class from the coca growers union so there's things like when he goes and visits i believe it was cochabamba i can't remember where he was visiting where there's a huge group of coca growers when he goes up to give a speech all the people cheer you know he's a coco grower just like us he grows coca just like us this is a country who's long used to seeing white dictators backed by the western imperialist powers run their country and now they see an indigenous person just like them who grows coca just like them running the country and reinvesting in them bringing them food vouchers so they can they can eat for the first time and the book also talks about how evil grew up in poverty in bolivia and you see the kind of struggle he went through i mean how much that must have motivated him to cease power so yeah i want to avoid cult of personality want to always be critical but it's hard not to root for this guy and like i said there's been huge major uh major us influence in bolivia throughout their entire history um the us will either support centrist liberals like carlos mesa who ran against evil multiple times or they'll support dictators like hugo bonzer who was a brutal dictator ruling over bolivia with the u.s backing whoever the u.s can get that's not a socialist right i mean evo got a lot of help from hugo chavez and fidel castro in learning how to inspect the burned palace as it's called which is basically bolivia's capital um for for cameras and stuff like that and how to thwart assassination attempts from the cia from the west so of course the book doesn't cover this but in 2020 there was a coup the u.s realized they couldn't beat evil in elections so of course the revolution in bolivia wasn't a violent revolution it was a non-violent revolution where the trade unions were organized um and then evo rose through the trade unions in one election um so the u.s starts backing janine anyas in this far right wing national unity front i believe is the name of the party and this is a far right extremely racist party you could definitely define them as a fash party fascist party they um christian fundamentalists anti-indigenous and this is because uh carlos mesa the centrist the u.s realized uh he wasn't gonna beat um evo in an election no matter how much support the u.s and western multinationals threw behind mesa and the other centrist candidates they couldn't beat evil evil was too popular he had raised their gdp and reinvested in the country he still had the support of the masses so what do they do they back anyas they back the national unity front they back the far right wing racist because she's going to give the u.s what they want economically and for the u.s you know they would rather have a racist dictator than they would have a an indigenous socialist because the racist dictator is going to give them what they want economically sure the us will take the liberal too sure the u.s will take the centrist who doesn't say racist things but still gives us corporations all they want but if they can't get that the cia will support whoever it takes to end these these policies of nationalization and reinvesting in the bolivian bolivian people um and that's exactly what happened in the 2020 coup and you see then um after after evo has ousted and seeks asylum in mexico the mas wins election again uh defeating anya's and mace anya's party and mesa the centrist in an election is luis arse of the movement for socialism the mas party um the person who's been with evo the whole time serving as his economist is the one who then wins election and this is pretty interesting from a theoretical standpoint because we talked about how this revolution was non-violent right but the people on the ground the trade unions through evo's entire reign of power we're calling to arm the revolution saying evo i know this was a non-violent revolution we took power via the ballot box and via the unions um but we need to arm ourselves because the u.s is going to try and infiltrate us and the the ruling class is going to try and overthrow everything we've done here and all the gains we've made for workers and that proved to be prescient so what happened after the coup in 2019 the unions went on strike mass strike trying to shut down the entire country's economy demanding that this undemocratic coup be reversed that evo be allowed back and there was violence um from the unity for national unity front party in anyas and the us and the cia against trade unionists against the bolivian working class trade unionist orlando gutierrez who was leading the struggle against this coup was murdered uh after luis arse eventually won election he was killed with or he wasn't killed sorry he was attacked with dynamite um this is a violent party and we're seeing here the the violent class struggle right even in a non-violent revolution you still have to realize that if you take economic power they're going to try and kill you the us and the bourgeoisie is going to try and use violence to overthrow the revolution so that they can take economic power back so this is why this is why you know people say arm the revolution or arm the the working class even in bolivia a country with a non-violent revolution they still had to arm themselves for self-defense and this is really interesting from a theoretical standpoint right and i i pulled out this quote on page 210 that kind of explains what the bolivian revolution was um from a theoretical standpoint uh it says with traces of indianism of the national and the popular of cynicalism and marxism evil morales has turned the mas into a power structure that now controls the state and dares from this point forward to undertake the construction of a post neoliberal model perhaps the only serious one in latin america so you're that seeing there with the mix of of that kind of nationalist indian identity of i'm an indigenous person we've long been oppressed um he uses that he uses marxism to analyze the economy and analyze seizing state power actually marxism leninism people in his um inner circle were reading a lot of lenin about taking state power and how to use state power but they didn't have a violent revolution like i said right it was is there's a hint of syndicalism of we're going to organize unions in the major sectors of the economy and use those unions to then control the state and i think there's a lot to learn here from or for us in the u.s right people often talk about we're not just going to overthrow the government one day right the government's got sky guns they have drones and it's just kind of unrealistic and we need to start with that economic organization on the ground our unions have been decimated we do not have anywhere close to the union representation that bolivia has or anything close or the unions in the u.s have not advanced class struggle anywhere close to where the unions in bolivia did to where they were in a position to seize political power right in the u.s here we're talk seemingly talking in circles about political issues and taking political power and how to fix our political sphere while the economic organization gets totally left to the side right we'll do mutual aid and stuff but there's very few people looking to organize their workplaces looking to truly organize the masses against the capitalist class and advance class struggle which is what marx was talking about so yeah a lot to learn from bolivia i hope you all enjoyed this definitely check out this book if you want a nice easy read about evo morales the first indigenous president of bolivia um and then the socialist success story that is bolivian the socialist success story in the 21st century um and you'll learn a lot about you know the 21st century movement across all of latin america against neoliberalism and against imperialism um one last funny story from this uh you know you'll hear a lot of americans say in latin america che guevara is thought of as hitler he's this evil murderous dictator and young stupid college americans like to wear che guevara on their shirts because they just don't know what he stood for obviously that's untrue che is a symbol against neoliberalism and against imperialism and when the u.s ambassador came to visit evo morales in bolivia's um capital evil morales had him unknowingly sit under a giant portrait of che that was sitting in his office and was just like take a seat and then talk to the guy the u.s ambassador who stands for the country who has long backed murderous dictators in bolivia sitting under a picture of che guevara the person who kicked the us and the in the batista dictatorship out of cuba and who stands as a symbol against the us for all of latin america pretty funny stuff there pretty good story i'm definitely glad i read this book definitely worth your time alright hope you all like this video we'll see you next time
