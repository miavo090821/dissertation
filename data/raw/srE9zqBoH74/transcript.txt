I know retrospect F I'm going be appreciated as the mayor that lived up to what I said I was going to do I'm not going to do that now you know people always crap on us when we in the ringar but when my when my gloves are hung up list said that was an authentic baldheaded earring wearing brother that did his thing as the mayor of the city of New York embarr black people the most important city on the globe is being run by a person who was dyslexic arrested re Ed now I'm elected be the mayor of the cityal in the last urina production on Eric Adams I declared to y'all that I was an Eric Adams hater but I'm a hater with lots and lots of reasons and I walked you through how City ended up with Eric Adams as our mayor straight through many of his disastrous decisions like bringing back stop and frisk worse than ever before Reviving NYPD units that were disbanded for their disproportionate use of police violence against black and brown people concealing Riker's death from the public and the Department of Justice being outed for making up stories about dead policemen slashing budgets and education homelessness Services prek funding the library Rikers re-entry programs and Parks all while giving NYPD historic New Deals and millions and millions more dollars than ever before fair mongering about black and brown immigrants and using a migrant crisis to stoke xenophobia and blame migrants for budgets he's been cutting since the moment he came into office and resources he's never provided and just generally being a cop loving fair mongering piece of [ __ ] and as I'm sure many of you already know that since making that first video I've actually had the opportunity to confront Eric Adams to his face about many of these decisions on The Breakfast Club and you know how that went when I went to do an analysis with all of my gang members and I asked them the question you know how many you have't learned disabilities how many of you are dyslexic all of your gang members there's a lot that's what you decided characterize them with people who are KCK fol want no I I meet regularly with people but more on that later not only has Eric Adam's tenure as mayor been marred by Scandal after Scandal all of which have illuminated not just the many failures and Corruptions in his administration but his own morally bankrupt nature Eric Adams has been involved in scandals and accusations of corruption dating all the way back to 1993 yet despite scandal after Scandal shining a flashlight on Eric Adams misdeeds most have been a blip on the media's radar who paid them very little attention until the FBI started closing in on him They seized them phones they got warrants they sered subpoenas they raid the whole whole team resignation started dropping and the block is officially hotter than ever before so our first time around I told y'all why everybody hates this [ __ ] but today I'm going to tell you why the FBI and the US government does too cuz this motherucker just got indicted Eric Adams told me he was going to make history and I'm actually proud to report that he was right he is now the first New York city mayor to be federally indicted while in office and his resignation is imminent and we love to mother see it so how do we get here everybody let's go on a journey shall [Music] we the thing about Eric Adams is he is a fair mongering buffoon of a cop maybe you've seen when he created a video I swear to God is not an SNL sketch teaching parents how to search their children's rooms for crack cocaine and guns you write the Constitution there are no First Amendment rights inside your household so by periodically sending a message to your home that there are no rooms off limits you don't believe in locked doors your house is open to inspection but you always have to inspect what you expect you can look in a jewelry box a jewelry box of this nature maybe a simple jewelry box but if you look through it closely you don't know what your child may be hiding for instance a gun could be hitting a small caliber weapon could be hidden inside a jewelry box when your child bring in his popular napsack with many different locations look through it to see what exactly is your child carrying in addition to a book something simple as a crack pipe a used crack pipe could he have found it on the street that's quite possible behind a picture frame you could find bullets what is that mean to find bullet does it mean your child is is carrying a gun no where there's smoke there's possible fire the baby doll could be just a baby doll but also it could be a place where you can secrete or hide drugs run your hands over the pillows this one could be hidden inside a pillow a gun just look and see what's inside your bookcases perfect place to hide uh cocaine there are no First Amendment rights in your home or maybe you've seen any of the millions of times he's calling whoever the he's pandering to at any given moment insert City hair of America New York City is the Athens of America it's the Instanbul of America is the keys of America the soul of America we are the tel of America New York City is the Islamabad of America the zabreb of America we are the Lemma of America New York City is ME Mexico City of America or maybe you've seen him just generally be the stupidest person to ever exist when you look at the totality of the year if you had to describe it and it's tough to do in one word what would that word be and tell me why uh New York this is a place where every day you wake up uh you could experience every everything from a plane crashing into our Trade Center to a a person who's celebrating a new business that's open the problem though is that fishness may make him the butt of the joke but it doesn't disempower him or encourage people to take him or the real danger he poses seriously people don't investigate and then they don't realize that who Eric Adams really is is much more [Music] Insidious ironically enough in a rare Act of good governance it was actually Eric Adams similarly disliked counterpart in bad governance Governor Cathy hokel who signed the legislation that extended the statute of limitations on the New York adult survivors act effectively leading to one of the nails in Eric Adams coffin many people are aware of the New York adult survivors Act and the fact that survivors were given an additional year to file their lawsuits because the world was stunned when Cassie Ventura sued ped for a Litany of sexual physical and emotional crimes since then more survivors have coming forward and one of those survivors is a black woman named Lorna Beach maora who filed suit against the New York city mayor Eric Adams himself who' coincidentally given Diddy a key to the city so what happened so let's take it all the way back to 1993 when Eric Adams was a Transit cop for the NYPD and the president of a fraternal organization within the NYPD that was specifically dedicated to helping black employees in the NYPD called the Guardians Lorna was an administrative Aid in the NPD at the time and a colleague of Eric Adams Lura had been expecting a promotion that she believed she had gotten passed up for because she was black and Lorna said that that was power of the course being a black person at the time but because Eric Adams specifically held himself out as this champion of civil rights for African-Americans she thought she could trust him to protect her and go to bat for her so she reached out to him she was actually thrilled when he agreed to help her and he offered to give her a ride home after work so that she could tell him about her problem but instead of taking her home Lura said she noticed that when they left the police department instead of driving to her house in Coney Island he was driving in the opposite direction toward the Hudson River so she asked him where was he going he told her that quote he wanted to have more time with her and he pulled into a remote vacant lot away from the street Lorna said she was afraid but she kept telling herself no no no I'm safe Eric Adams was a police officer and the president of the Guardian he was someone who was there to help her but she said her anxiety remains so she kept asking him questions she asked him well well why are you parking and he told her he wanted to concentrate on her story without being distracted by driving but instead of actually letting her tell that story Lorna said he told her that he thought he could help her but he also needed some help and this man started rubbing his [ __ ] di through his clothes and told her she needed to give him a [ __ ] Lorna said that she was stunned and she refused but he did not care he continued quote repeatedly cajoling demanding and begging her for oral sex and eventually he just straight up unzipped his pants and whipped his [ __ ] dick out grabbed War's hand and put it on his dick and demanded a hand job when she continued to refuse this man just jacked off in front of her came on this woman and then on top of all that instead of even dropping her home like he promised he would after driving in the opposite direction from her home and sexually assaulting her he dropped her at the nest station from where he assaulted her and he drove off Lura never formally reported it because she was actually convinced that Eric Adams would retal she did eventually informally tell a supervisor and Lorna says she was then transferred and demoted and she believes that that was Eric Adams doing because she refused to give him the [ __ ] he demanded speaking for Lorna her lawyer said quote she knew that filing this lawsuit would cause her significant personal challenges but she did so nevertheless because she believes sexual abusers must be held to account no matter who they are her Fairless and Quest For Justice are inspiring as they are important Eric Adam's response was that this didn't happen and that he can't recall ever meeting this woman that he worked with hi Mr may can you pleas resp respond to this uh this uh lawsuit uh it absolutely did not happen I I don't recall ever meeting this person uh and I will never harm anyone in that magnitude uh it did not happen pretty much anytime he's asked about the allegation he begins avoiding eye contact and stuttering through a similar response to this I would never do anything to harm uh anyone just really uh just something absolutely that that has never happened and I I don't even recall ever u u meeting the person who made uh the uh this allegation Lorna was devastated and traumatized by The Experience because she had only put her trust in Eric Adams specifically because of how he held himself out as someone who was a protector of African-Americans as someone who was battling racism and abuse from the inside but instead she'd experienced what she called quote an astonishing abuse of power that there was quote no way to safely report at the time but she was moved to finally speak up because she was tired of seeing his hypocrisy during both his campaign as mayor and his administration while he pretended to battle for black people inside and outside of the NYPD New York City has a similar relationship with Eric Adams the man who held himself out in his mayoral campaign ads is someone who became a police officer to battle racism in the NYPD from the inside but became our mayor and he immediately reinstated stop and frisk ran cover for officers who killed New Yorkers and revived NYPD units that were specifically disbanded for disproportionate use of police violence against us although Eric Adams claims not to know Lorna or what she's talking about she is neither the first nor the only black woman to work with Eric Adams in the NYPD to accuse him of sexism and an abuse of power in 1991 lazette LeBron was a 24-year-old Transit cop in Eric Adams's Department literally just starting out her career she found out that some of the members of Eric Adams fraternal organization the guardian had cheated on their Sergeant exams and when she made the decision to report their cheating to Internal Affairs Eric Adams set out to destroy this woman for daring to follow the rules these police claim to protect Eric Adams went to the press and told them that this 24-year-old black woman was making up the allegations because she wanted one of the men and he rejected her sexual advances and he then gave the Press bikini pictures of her to exploore lazette said that it brought her to such a dark place and it literally destroyed her career meanwhile the three men lazette had accused of cheating had [ __ ] cheated and they were criminally charged and convicted while Eric Adams masquerades like someone who was fighting racism from the inside and protecting black people he was actually abusing his power and retaliating on the real whistleblowers that's who Eric Adams is and it's who he's always been so how did we get here last time I presented y'all my theory on how New York City got stuck with Eric Adams which I attributed to a combination of factors from his significant Union support his deceitful ads targeted at the black community where he presented himself as some sort of black activist who became an officer to fight police brutality from the inside rank Choice voting and just the general liberal urge to elect a black cop because he would allow them to put a black face in the police state status quo in order to use diversity to hide behind the illusion of progression and Shi the administration from accusations of racism and anti-blackness but there's another theory as to how New Yorkers got stuck with the mixi miror we've seen in a long time and this one's less a theory and more like a fact that came with six criminal indictments and every single person involved has since pled guilty in July of 2023 Manhattan da Alvin brag indicted six people for conspiring and diverting tens of thousands of dollars in public money into Eric Adams's campaign for mayor in exchange for construction contracts on the back end Kickbacks New York City contractors tonight are charged with illegally funneling money to Mayor Adams's campaign prosecutors say the contractors managed to go around the campaign donation limits by using straw donor to make extra contributions those contributions were then matched by the city mayor's campaign insists they knew nothing about the illegal donations here's on news reporter Lauren glassberg these four defendants are char Ed in a scheme to raise money through straw donations for Eric Adams's mayoral campaign in 2021 the idea according to the 27 count indictment was to give out money orders to people who would then donate that money to the campaign and the money would be match by public funds so a $250 donation would Garner a $2,000 match the defendants would then allegedly pressure the mayor's office for construction jobs assuming Adams was elected Eric Adams of of course denies any involvement in this scheme that directly benefits him despite knowing and working with the individuals involved in the scheme and despite the fact that in the emails between the individuals charged and convicted for the involvement in the scheme one of the men shamid in Reza tells retired Police Inspector and colleague and friend of Eric Adams Dwayne Montgomery to show Eric Adams with construction job he wants once he's elected as well as they did a wir tap on all six people and got hour and hours of extensive conversation about the scheme I got you know SpongeBob in one email between two defendants Shaman RZA writes to Dwayne Montgomery a retired Police Inspector about a potential construction project in Brooklyn saying FYI this is the one I want safety drywall and security one project but we can all eat please show it to him before event it will start when he's in office da Alvin brag has never accused or indicted Adams or anyone in his administration likely because it would create a fight between he and the mayor he's already busy with his case against Donald Trump and the FBI has got Eric Adams covered but if we just use our common sense and think about it for a second all of these people were not just indicted and convicted for stealing public money and putting it into Eric Adams campaign in exchange for lucrative contracts they've plad guilty to it and admitted to it so how do we think such a plan could have worked without Eric Adams's involvement and knowledge despite the fact that we literally [ __ ] know all the donations to his campaign weren't on the up and up because we have six guilty hemmed up for it and he was denying any knowledge of this happening he suddenly wants us to believe quote we return back tens of thousands of donations that did not follow that muster we did the internal scrutiny we're supposed to do Eric Adams buddy Dwayne Montgomery pleed guilty and was given all of a $500 fine and 200 hours of community service and you know what the same Eric Adams who could care less about poor black and brown New Yorkers dying on Rikers because they can't pay Bale thinks about that he said that after the guilty plea Mr Montgomery should be allowed to go on with his life saying quote the worst day of your life does not define your life he said he had not communicated with his former friend since the indictment but if he were to see him he would wish him the best and Dwayne montgomry is far far from the only good good friend that Eric Adams has suddenly wanted to distance himself from once they came under criminal scrutiny because don't be mistaken despite the fact that da Alvin brag hasn't gone after Adams directly that has not stopped him or the FBI from rounding up everyone around him because that's how this works before you face the final boss you got to knock off all the pawns think about Donald Trump who's also in Alvin Bragg's crosshairs before Trump ever saw a single criminal charge many of his people were charged Andor convicted y'all remember that Pastor that went viral back in 2022 because he was live streaming in a church service when he got robbed at gunpoint in the middle of the service and he told us the [ __ ] made off with millions of dollars worth of jewelry and everyone was just like why do a Brooklyn Pastor have millions of dollars worth of jewelry and Gucci down from head to toe right that [ __ ] Lam more Whitehead AKA pass the bling bling like that [ __ ] really called himself The Bling Bishop it was given scammer cuz that niggaer was a scammer and I'm not just referring to his June 2024 conviction for fraud for stealing $90,000 from people in this congregation no no no this was already a convicted scammer frauder and identity theft before then and that's the [ __ ] Eric Adams was claiming as his [ __ ] Protege in menty and running all around Brooklyn doing business with it's Undisputed that Eric Adams claimed him and Whitehead was known for leveraging his relationship with Eric Adams to make money and do deals in Brooklyn funny enough like the six people who were charged and convicted for the straw donation scheme The Bling Bling Bishop has been on record saying that Eric Adams offered him a $50 million Construction contract in 2023 the New Yorker published an expose called how Eric Adams started mentoring a con man in it they tell the story of a man named Brandon Belmont who contacted the US attorney's office in Manhattan to report that the mayor of New York City is trying to extort me through someone else he told them that someone else was Lam more Whitehead AKA Bishop bla the FBI show show up at Belmont's door the day after he contacted the US attorney's office they wasn't playing with him I told y'all they're on Eric Adams ass and Belmont then told the FBI that shortly after Eric Adams became mayor Lam more Whitehead went to his car shop in the Bronx because his Benz had been in a crash the cost of fixing the bz was $25,000 but Bishop Ling wanted Brandon Belmont to do it for $113,000 in exchange for a kickback from Eric Adams in addition to owning the car shop Brandon Belmont owned real estate and he had a property in the Bronx so Bishop bla proposed to him that if he did the job for $113,000 Eric Adams would make the property a homeless shelter so he could get City benefits Belmont told the FBI that Bishop Ling even offered to set up a meeting between Belmont and Eric Adams so that's how Bishop bling ended up on the FBI's radar shortly after Bishop bling would end up being indicted by the FBI for fraud and extortion and after prosecutor successfully argued that he not only finessed one of his congregants out of $90,000 but he also attempted to extort Brandon Belmont from money in exchange for kickbacks from Eric Adams he was sentenced to 9 years in prison and Bishop Ling offered his two senses to why the FBI decided to go after him take a listen I want to be really clear why was Bishop Whitehead on trial okay why was Bishop Whitehead on trial this was not about Bishop Whitehead y'all this was politically driven this was about mayor Eric Adams and hey look two things can be true is Bishop bla probably guilty of all the scamming they say he is yes why yes is it true that the FBI probably only went after him because they're trying to get Eric Adams probably also true and speaking of two things being true it can be so hard to determine what's true or not especially when everyone is targeting you with clickbait and misinformation which is why I am so excited to partner with ground news today's sponsor their app and website are excellent for the kind of research I had to do for this video to be all up in Eric Adams business because ground news allows you to compare coverage from media across the political Spectrum On Any Given topic and verify the source of that information it's really an important tool to navigate this chaotic media landscape so for example this week Eric Adams pled not guilty to federal charges maybe you've come across an article published on it on ground news I can see that more than 150 articles were published worldwide and instantly access each one comparing coverage is interesting because sources like the right leaning New York Post and the left leaning the city emphasizes not guilty plea in the details of his charge but some sources like left leaning depending on who you ask CNN claim he's set to be arraigned see how depending on where you get your news from you could have a totally different perspective on the issue on top of that ground news provided a factuality rating indicating how subjective or objective their printed reporting is and they even go out of their way to highlight stories that the media isn't covering with their blind spot feed it really just cannot be beat because it makes it so much easier for me to make sure that I am not spewing unsubstantiated mess at y'all which is why it was a no-brainer for me to go with them as today's sponsor check them out at ground. news/ Olay and use my link to save 40% on the same Vantage plan that I use for unlimited access to all their features by subscribing you're not only getting a product we all need today you're directly supporting my work so that I can continue to give you content like this thank you round news back to the video I told you the government is on Eric Adam's ass and they rounding up his boys it's like that moment in the narcos and mafia movies when the government starts taking out everyone closest to the boss until the boss is held up in his office scared knowing he's next yeah and Bishop Ling isn't the only menty of Eric Adams to be into criminal [ __ ] and end up in prison his old mentees were two brothers named Robert and xan pastran and those two men own a Manhattan restaurant named laaya that Mixie asked Eric Adams be regularly at to this day and it's not even Hayden to call Eric Adams Mixie because this Eagle Maniac brags about it he literally told reporters quote I'm the nighlife man this is a 24/7 City I'm obligated to go patronize my restaurants patronize my theater hell no Alvin bra also recently hemmed up Eric Adams senior advisor returned buildings commissioner Eric Ock who was a former Republican city council member think about that Eric Adams brought on a republican to be his senior advisor before becoming his buildings commissioner da brag indicted Eric ol for accepting $150,000 quote in exchange for performing official favors from his various positions in city government including his time at top the Buildings Department which has the power to make or break a development project and quote this indictment said this [ __ ] was accepting Apartments Mets tickets suits surus are and More in exchange for Kickbacks and Eric R resigned shortly after being indicted and this is not the first time we've got an legal indication that maybe Eric Adams campaign for mayor wasn't all in the up and up remember how I talked about the IRS getting him for lying on his forums and disclosures in the last video but now he's in deep deep [ __ ] and it is getting deeper every day this niggaer might actually have to resign so let's get into the FBI's investigation into Eric Adams shall we why is the FBI after Eric Adams remember how Alvin brag successfully hemmed up those six Associates of Eric Adams for creating straw donor schemes to funnel money into Eric Adams campaign illegally so you probably won't be surpris that there are more straw Doner schemes and remember how I told you Eric Adams menty Bishop bling bling was trying to bribe folk in exchange for construction deals and kickbacks from Adams right so again you won't be surprised there's more of that but there's a lot more than that so the first thing I need everyone to understand is that Eric Adams is not in a little bit of trouble this is in a lot of trouble government officials are not allowed to accept donations from foreign governments and the FBI both believes and has proof that Eric Adams conspired with the Turkish government to funnel illegal campaign contributions into his campaign that he muscled City officials into opening a Midtown skyscraper built by the Turkish government before it had passed mustard with safety officials in 2021 the moment he won the Democratic primary this n didn't even wait to officially take office to start getting his [ __ ] deals lined up and they also believe he conspired with China so let's establish a timeline leading us up to the bomb that just exploded in Eric Adams face because I am a firm believer that when the feds want you the feds going to get you now we can do this the easy way or we can do it the hard way the choice is yours the streets first got word that the feds were building a case against Eric Adams in November 2023 when the FBI raided Eric Adams 25-year-old campaign fundraiser Brianna su's home and left her house with all her electronics and manila folders literally mocked Eric Adams and then just a couple of weeks later the FBI rolled up on Eric Adams himself to straight up seize this cell phones and his iPad and The Dominoes have been dropping since what's crazy about Eric Adams is when this first happened he and his team Dad tried to throw the campaign fundraiser Banna under the bus to save face they were actually trying to tell the media that they are just so committed to following the law that they conducted their own investigation and discovered wrongdoing on someone's part wink wink and that they voluntarily told the Feds and had them seize the phone and the feds aren't actually looking into them and then a couple of weeks later they got rid of Banna what a bunch of and it's wild because Briana sus was a 23-year-old with absolutely no experience besides working for Eric Adams staff and a much lesser role while she was in college and when critics questioned why he'd be entrusting her with such a serious position as campaign fundraising he insisted she was the woman for the job and she's excellent only to throw her under the [ __ ] bus and even if we didn't all know that this was a lie this whole idea that the FBI wasn't looking into Eric Adams himself because Eric Adams was literally on his way to DC to harass Joe Biden and continue to stoke xenophobia for his migrant crisis and was supposed to be in all day meetings and had to suddenly spin round when he learned the feds how to warrant for his ass just look at how this reacted when I asked him about it law enforcement does something every day it's bad but when they do something against Eric Adams oh it's good you come on I said what happened I didn't say that it was good I don't think it's good our mayor is being investigated for legal campaign I don't think I came back because of not that they had to take my phones that is that is not true and you should I said it happened that day no it did not happen that day I said it was reported before you were going that it was May Adam wrong where your phone did the FBI sees your phone did they search your top AIDS did they search the home of SE several people okay yes that's what I said does that seem like someone who voluntarily asked the feds to come get his stuff but Eric Adams insisted on trying to convince the public that he was not the target of the FBI's investigation into his campaign make it make sense sir in July 2024 the FED served a whole new round of subpoenas on Eric Adams his election committee and City Hall looking into Eric Adams and his Aid traveling fundraising and that was just the beginning because in the month of September the feds got on Eric Adams ass and as of September 25th 20124 they have indicted him but before we get to the indictment I got to walk you all through how serious got for Eric Adams and his administration this month leading up to this point where reports are speculating that his key fundraiser Brianna sugs will also be charged so Winnie Greco is director of Asian Affairs as well as at least three of NYPD officers so this month of September the FBI executed search warrants seized phones raided homes of more than half a dozen of his senior officials in his administration including on September 4th the FED straight ran up on the police commissioner Edward kabon Eric Adams mayoral ADV advisor Timothy Parson the first Deputy Mayor to Eric Adams Sheena Wright his school's chancellor David Banks and that nig's brother Phillip the deputy mayor for Public Safety by September 12th the NYPD commissioner Edward kaban had resigned but before we even get into kab's resignation I would be remiss if I did not highlight that he is not the only NYPD officer being caught up in this proe because after my Breakfast Club interview with Eric Adams the NYPD was very upset at their boy's performance so they made it their business to harass me openly and publicly for all to see from their official Twitter accounts which was ironic considering in my interview with Eric Adams I explicitly mentioned how NYPD uses their social media to harass journalists and anyone they disagree with and Eric Adams dismiss me random acts of violence are being highlighted if you have if you have 24 hours in a day and something that happens to you in an hour in the day you start to Define yourself as that entire day those random acts of violence are plastered on social media they're plastered on on newspap they plastered on everything people begin to believe that oh I'm living in a city that's out of control we are not she made a good point though if New York if NYPD is is reposting that kind of stuff what are we supposed to think I said at the beginning everybody got a phone brother no no nypd's page is doing this has recently been there so much so that they're arguing with journalists on there it's NY ypd on their own Twitter pages that are posting and sensationalizing crime the main officer who was harassing me on Twitter was chief of Patrol John Chell who importantly murdered a black man in 2008 and his family was awarded a $2.5 million verdict and despite thousands of people seeing that man harass me and rightfully alarming me and many others because again this is an officer who murdered a black man when Eric Adams was informed by reporters of this harassment and questioned as so whether he'd intervene he said this so color me unsurprised that the same John chalis caught up in the FBI's investigation of Eric Adams corruption so he immediately raced to put in for retirement and when the New York Post tried to get a comment from their boy John Cell about the investigation I say that boy cuz don't forget the New York Post was working with NYPD to slander my [ __ ] name following my interview with Eric Adams to John CH responded by calling the reporter a [ __ ] scumbag I love that sounds like he's mad let's see how retirement goes for you shall we officer chel all my enemies is catch it and it does not end there baby when I tell you the feds are on these asses the feds also raided the home of Rana abasova one of Eric Adams AIDS in his International Affairs office they raided chank okal a former Turkish Airlines exact who worked on Eric Adams transition team remember I told you that also on the FED list is the deputy mayor of Public Safety Phil Banks who was an unindicted participant in a corruption case a decade ago and Tim parison a retired NYPD inspector and Eric Adams senior advisor the FED suspected they were involved in steering City contracts to companies purportedly represented by his consultant brother Terrence Banks who the feds believe Adams was giving millions of dollars worth of contracts and when I say millions of dollars I don't mean a few million the feds are looking into the $154 million contract that was given to Philip bank's former company to provide services to Nicha housing the feds raided and seized the electronics of both Phil Banks Tim parison Terrence Banks and Eric Adams first Deputy Mayor Sheena Wright and all of these characters and their relationships to Eric Adams are so interesting in their own rights the breakdown of those being investigated by the FBI reads like a who's who of the mayor's Inner Circle last week the FBI raided the Uptown home of first Deputy Mayor Sheena Wright Wright shares the home with David Banks New York City Schools Chancellor David Banks is the brother of Philip Banks III deputy mayor for Public Safety the New York Times is reporting that Deputy Mayor Banks was part of an FBI bribery investigation agents took the electronic devices from those two homes and that of a third bank's brother Terrence who runs a consulting firm their father Philip Banks Jr was an NYPD Lieutenant when Adams was a Captain Tim Parson isn't just one of Eric Adams top AIDS and subjects of this federal investigation oh no he is his senior advisor longtime friend subject of an existing investigation into a brawl at a migrant shelter and a [ __ ] facing multiple lawsuits for sexually harassing women that Eric Adams is using taxpayer dollars to defend him against which I guess isn't surprising considering that Eric Adams is using taxpayer dollars to defend himself against the sexual harassment allegations I told you earlier birds of a feather in addition to Illegal connections to Turkey the FBI is also investing Eric Adams travels and ties to China via his relationship with his director of Asian Affairs Winnie Greco who the the feds also believe played a part in illegal campaign donations and thus they raided her [ __ ] offices of the New World Mall and queens that hosted Adam's campaign operations in 2021 and multiple pelm Bay homes that are owned by Winnie Greco also suspiciously following the raids of Winnie Greco's offices she was given a raise by Adams Winnie Greco is one of the people expected to be indicted with Eric Adams and speaking of Eric Adams illegal ties to China we know that's real because in March Chinese media m and former nightclub owner Quinn H plad guilty to illegally funneling more than $111,000 worth of donations to politicians in New York and Road Island including Eric Adams the FBI also searched the home of New York City sheriff Anthony Miranda who Eric Adams personally appointed another official under scrutiny is Sheriff Anthony Miranda the Department of investigation is reportedly looking into allegations that his office stole cash during raids on illegal weed shop plus whether or not not he solicited any donations as a chair of the national Latino Officers Association in exchange for looking the other way on targets being investigated by his office so it should come as no surprise that after all those raids the resignations have been coming left right and Center so on September 12th the NYPD commissioner Edward kaban had resigned which is great rewatch The rer section of the first Eric Adams urina production to get a refresher on what a demon that man is who was also personally appointed by Eric Adams but also read up on his cover up of nypd's killing of 32-year-old kowaski trck kaban resignation marks the shortest tenure of NYPD Commissioners in 30 years and let me tell you something you know the feds and kaban ass because not only did they search him and they investigating his brother but when he resigned they also searched in his temporary replacement Thomas donlin to be the first Hispanic Police Commissioner is an honor of the highest measure yet 14 months later k and stepped down after the FBI seized his phone last week in his resignation later caban says he did not want to be a distraction during the federal probe that Fox 5 has learned may be connected to his twin brother James and a third Brother Richard James command was fired by the NYPD in 2001 for allegedly trying to frame a New York City Taxi Driver he runs a firm that does security for New York City nightclubs sources tell Fox 5 that he is part of a corruption investigation their connection to Mayor Adams is through their father Juan caban Juan caban and Adams both ran organizations in the 9s that supported minority police officers on September 15th the mayor's Chief legal counsel Lisa zornberg straight jump ship resigned and on September 16th two former fire department chiefs were arrested and accused of accepting tens of thousands of dollars in bribes to speed up the fire safety approval for building projects across the city we going to get back to that when we go through the indictment on September 20th the FBI subpoenaed the head of Eric Adams office for Asylum Seeker operations Molly Schaefer on September 24th the school Chancellor David Banks resigned and the FEDS made it known that they're not just investigating Eric Adams ties to Turkey but to four additional countries school's chancellor David Banks is the latest person to announced he is leaving the Adams Administration in a resignation letter he says he is retiring by the end of December conversations Banks says he had with the mayor early this year this comes as Banks his fiance deputy mayor Sheena Wright and the Chancellor's two brothers had their homes raided by the feds also this week City Health commissioner Ashwin ban says he will be resigning by the end of the year the FBI also serves the Pena and even the monia of a Brooklyn church that does business with Adams former Chief of Staff power broker Frank coron and funny enough on the night of September 25th when Eric Adams was indied Frank rone was seen leaving Gracie's Mansion so it's possible that this is multiple sorts of branches of the same investigation that in the course of doing one investigation prosecutors stumbled upon other crimes and began branching out the investigation that wouldn't be at all unusual much of the early interest some of the early indication that we had involved these investigations about turkey perhaps it was some sort of bribery or pay tolay we don't know but prosecutors have likely been to the grand jury obtained an indictment that will be unsealed and we'll learn more about the details of what they're alleging once they unseal that indictment so what this very very tangled web should have revealed to everyone is that Eric Adams has been involved in a very large lucrative web of Kickbacks bribes and illegal money and relationships with foreign governments but that still did not stop Eric Adams from getting up in front of the cameras the moment the news of the indictment hit the press to tell us the these [ __ ] just praying on this downfall my fellow New Yorkers it is now my belief that the federal government intends to charge me with crimes if so these charges will be entirely false based on lies but listen don't mind him because this morning the 57 page Federal indictment against Eric Adams was unsealed and it's wild what this is on the Federal indictment opens by making it clear that they have evidence of Eric Adams ongoing corruption and illegal donations stemming not just from his tenure as mayor oh no but dating back a decade to when he first became Brooklyn burrow president they've got a decade worth of Investigation on this in 2014 Eric Adams the defendant became Brooklyn burough president thereafter for nearly a decade Adam sought and accepted improper valuable benefits such as luxury international travel including from wealthy foreign business people and at least one Turkish government official seeking to gain influence over him by 2018 Adams who had by then made known his plans to run for mayor of New York City not only accepted but sought illegal campaign contributions to 20121 mayoral campaign as well as other things of value from foreign Nationals as Adam's prominence and grew his foreign National benefactors sought to cash in on their corrupt relationships with him particularly when in 2021 it became clear that Adams would become New York City's mayor Adams agreed providing favorable treatment in exchange for the illicit benefits he received after his inauguration as mayor of New York City Adam soon began preparing for his next election including by planning to solicit more legal contributions and granting requests from those who supported his 2021 mayoral campaign with such donation Eric Adams the defendant sought and accepted illegal campaign contributions in the form of nominee or straw contributions meaning that the true contributors conveyed their money through nominal donors who falsely certified that they were contributing their own money by smuggling their contributions to Adams through us-based straw donors Adams overseas contributors defeated federal laws that serve to prevent foreign influence on us elections wealthy individuals evaded laws designed to limit their power over elected officials by restricting the amount any one person can donate to a candidate and businesses circumvented New York City's ban on corporate contributions by funneling their donations through multiple employees frustrating a law that seeks to reduce corporate power and politics Adams increased his fundings by accepting these concealed illegal donations at the cost of giving his secret patrons the undue influence over him that the law tries to prevent Eric Adams the defendant compounded his G from the Star contributions by using them to defraud New York City and steal public Funds New York City has a matching funds program that matches small dollar contributions from Individual City residents with up to eight times their amount in public funds to give New Yorkers a greater voice in elections but Adams campaign applied for matching funds based on known straw donations fraud obtaining as much as $2,000 in public funds for each illegal contribution Adams and those working at his Direction falsely certified compliance with applicable campaign Finance regulations despite Adams repeated acceptance of straw donations relying on the concealed nature of these illegal contributions to falsely portray his campaign as law abiding as a result of those false certifications Adam's 2021 mayoral campaign received more than 10 million doll in public funds Eric Adams the defendant also sought and received the improper benefits from some of the same co-conspirators who funnel straw donations to his campaigns in particular a senior a senior official in the Turkish diplomatic establishment the Turkish official who facilitated many straw donations to Adams also arranged for Adams and his companions to receive free or discounted travel on turkey's National Airline which is owned in significant part by the Turkish government to designations including France China Sri Lanka India Hungary and turkey itself the Turkish official and other Turkish Nationals further arranged for Adams and his companies to receive among other things free rooms at ulent hotels free meals at highend restaurants and free luxurious entertainment while in Turkey Eric Adams the defendant and others working at his Direction repeatedly took steps to Shield his solicitation and acceptance of these benefits from public scrutiny Adams did not disclose the travel benefits he had obtained in annual Financial disclosures he was required to file as a New York City employee sometimes Adams agreed to pay a nominal fee to create the appearance of having paid for travel that was in fact heavily discounted other times Adams created an instructed others to create fake Paper Trails falsely suggesting that he had paid or planned to pay for travel benefits that were actually free and Adams deleted messages with others involved in his misconduct including in one instance assuring a co-conspirator in writing that he always deleted her messages in September 2021 the Turkish official told Eric Adams the defendant that it was his turn to repay the Turkish official by pressuring the New York City Fire Department FDNY to facilitate the opening of a new Turkish Consular building a 36-story skyscraper without a fire inspection in time for a high-profile visit by turkey's president at the time the building would have failed an FDNY inspection in exchange for free travel and other travel related bribes in 2021 and 2022 arranged by the Turkish official Adams did as instructed because of Adams pressure on the FDNY the FDNY official responsible for the fdny's assessment of the skycraper fire safety was told that he would lose his job if he failed to acques and after Adams intervened the skyscraper opened as requested by the Turkish official they outlined how Eric Adams not only accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of illegal donations from Turkish Nationals in exchange for Kickbacks contracts their political influence over him luxury trips and Gifts he never reported but he also illegally received more than $10 million in New York public funds directed his staffers to engage in these illegal deals straw donor schemes and false certifications to the government in fact the indictment highlights how Eric Adams threatened employees with termination if they wouldn't carry out his illegal request on behalf of the Turkish government as well as he directed his staffers to delete the evidence my favorite highlight from the indictment is that when one of Eric Adams staffers was approached with the offer to accept illegal campaign donations the staffer was like um no that's illegal Eric Adams is not going to do that and Eric Adams was like [ __ ] what absolutely do it the indictment reads on June 22nd 2018 the same day as the fundraising event just described the Adam staffer and the promoter discussed by text message a possible trip by Adams to Turkey the promoter stated in part fundraising in Turkey is not legal but I think I can raise money for your campaign off the Record the Adams staffer inquired how will Adams declare that money here the promoter responded he won't declare it or we'll make the donation through an American citizen in the US a Turk I'll give it I'll give cash to him in turkey or I'll send it to an American he will make a donation to you the Adam staffer replied I think he wouldn't get involved in such games they might cause a big stink later on but I'll ask anyway the Adam staffer then asked how much do you think would come from you $7 the promoter responded Max $100,000 the Adam staffer wrote $100,000 do you have a chance to transfer that here we can't do it while Eric is in Turkey to which the promoter replied let's think after this conversation the Adam staffer asked Adams whether the Adam staffer should pursue the unlawful foreign contributions offered by the promoter and contrary to the Adam Stafford's expectations Adams directed The Adam staffer to pursue the promoter's illegal scheme but while that surprised the staffer the reality is that illegal donations has been Eric Adams bread and butter for at least a decade so it should be no surprise that the indictment includes text messages of Eric Adams telling his staffers to always delete their messages it reads Eric Adams the defendant continued to conceal the benefits he received from foreign Nationals seeking to gain influence over him Adams did not report any of the 2019 gifts he got from the airline manager or the Promoter on his annual disclosure form in addition in March 2019 while exchanging text messages to plan another possible trip to Turkey in which the airline manager would arrange travel for Adams the Adams staff texted Adams to be in the safe side please delete all messages you send me Adams responded always do this indictment really is a treasure Trove because like I said earlier when the feds want you the feds are going to get you and the FEDS don't indict you until they already have you the case is already built they conducted an extensive investigations wir Taps email searches they've got it all another highlight in the indictment is that Eric Adams changed his cell phone passcode from a four-digit passcode to a six-digit passcode and he told the Feds that he changed his password to prevent his staffers from deleting any messages or information inside yes the same staffers the indictment provided text messages showing that Eric Adams instructed them to delete their messages yes yes but that's what Eric Adams is claiming okay he is claiming that he changed the passcode to stop them from deleting it and now he doesn't remember the passcode the indictment reads on November 6 2023 FBI agents executed a search warrant for the electronic devices used by Eric Adams the defendant although Adams was carrying several electronic devices including two cell phones he was not carrying his personal cell phone which is the device he used to communicate about the conduct described in this indictment when Adams produced the personal cell phone the next day in response to a subpoena it was losted such that the device required a pass code to open Adams claimed that after he learned about the investigation into his conduct he changed the password on November 5th 2024 and increased the complexity of his password from four digits to six Adams had done this he claimed to prevent members of his staff from inadvertently or intentionally deleting the contents of his phone because according to Adams he wished to preserve the contents of his phone due to the investigation but Adams further claimed he had forgotten the password he had just set and thus was unable to provide the FBI with a password that would unlock the phone what's interesting about this particular nugget is it seems on its face buffoonish right that he would think changing his passcode would keep the feds out and the idea seems buffoonish L consistent with the kind of buffoon who the feds have in 4k telling his staffers to delete their text but what's interesting is the FBI actually does find it impossible to break through iPhone passcodes especially when it's a six-digit code and apple refuses to break in for the FBI and the court to refuse to compel Apple to break in for the FBI to be able to get into the particular phone however the FBI has not struggled to build a massive case against Adams without that one phone because they successfully seized and accessed all the other electronics and that of half of his administration as well as the seven people who we already discussed earlier have already pled guilty to destroy donor games but don't give Eric Adams too too much credit because he and his band of fools really are just as buffoonish as you think actually they're worse because if this [ __ ] wasn't in the indictment I wouldn't believe it myself tell me why when the feds were inter ating Brianna shows Eric Adams campaign fundraiser he threw under the Bus Shorty tried to go to the bathroom to delete the incriminating evidence the indictment reads the Adam staffer also agreed to speak with FBI agents and falsely denied the criminal conduct of herself and Adams among others at one point during her voluntary interview the Adam staffer excused herself to a bathroom and while there deleted the encrypted messaging application she had used to communicate with Adams the promoter the Turkish official the airline manager and others they are literally just as [ __ ] buffoonish as you think you guys are from Turkey Brooklyn loves turkey Brooklyn is the istano of America that was New York city mayor Eric Adams playing himself in a 2017 Turkish film in which Turkish men attempt to bribe New York city mayor Eric Adams [Music] and you know what none of this stopped Eric Adams from still trying to [ __ ] New Yorkers with a press conference where he tried to surround himself with black people and paint himself as a black mayor unfairly targeted by the FBI I would be remiss if I didn't point out that this is Eric Adam's usual Playbook whenever he's criticized or investigated for his wrongdoings he cries black and he also loves getting whatever black activist is for sale to cover for him following my interview with him in The Breakfast Club in order to try to preempt New Yorker seeing the interview the next day and me exposing him for his cover up of death at Rikers his willful blind eyes and the nypd's murdering of innocent New Yorkers like wi Rosario cutting funding for re-entry programs at Rikers and overall being at the helm of one of the most anti-black administrations responsible for again I I can't get tired of reminding y'all Reviving stop and frisk as well as reflooding our streets with NYPD units that were disbanded for disproportionately brutalizing us he went and got Al [ __ ] Sharpton to baptize him at Rikers so I say that to say I was unsurprised and unmoved that this integralist got up in front of New Yorkers and tried to Gaslight us while cloaking himself in pay to-play and lucky for me black New Yorkers were just as unmoved at him trying to pretend that being held to account for decades of corruption had anything to do with him being black yoring this is not a this is not a black day is a you this is a you this is not your polies are anti to all black people in this city things that you done uncons about maybe the out press conference was a bad mistake our children are hared by police is ridiculous this is ridiculous you can just be all you want with the people are with us and this is not a black day this is a Justice day and you know what more importantly let me tell y'all something if you are a black person saying something silly like oh they let the white Mayors be criminals it's unfair that they're going after him if there were ever a who deserves to feel the weight of the criminal system disproportionate desire to punish nigas it's the nigas that champion that system and weaponize it against poor four black and brown New Yorkers every [ __ ] day [ __ ] that [ __ ] this is a man who does not bat an eye when Corrections Officers allow people to die in Rikers actually he does bat and ey he does more than that he runs to Rikers to support the [ __ ] Corrections Officers [ __ ] families [ __ ] the dead people Eric Adams a man who stole $10 million from New York's public funds spent the last three years slashing our budgets and social services and telling us to blame the migrants he was working with foreign governments to accept illegal funds accepting Kickbacks and traveling all over the world while taking your taxpayer dollars and telling you to blame migrants the [ __ ] irony this is a man who is stealing millions and demanding due process and the presumption of innocence but just the other day he told us all it was justified for NYPD to shoot four [ __ ] people in the station over $2.90 and unpaid Subway fair I cannot express this enough [ __ ] that [ __ ] don't defend him because Eric Adams not only wouldn't defend you he would direct his Department of Corrections to cover up your death the only thing you need to do for Eric Adams is ask him to resign because New Yorkers need and deserve a mayor and a strong Administration not a corrupt fool and his equally corrupt Administration who will be far too busy defending themselves against federal crimes they're absolutely going down for to run this city correctly
