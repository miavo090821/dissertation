Mostly pretty tame except for a few bad actors that have been suspected and very possibly were hired or otherwise motivated provocateurs. In an area where things got A LITTLE rough, a woman was seen putting her head through a window of a locked door that she CLEARLY couldnt fit through got popped in the head by cap police who was in no danger whatsoever! Police were ordered to handle these 'offenders' with extreme pre jud ice and did.... the MS painted it out to be \"the worst attack on America since Nine 1 1\" and told a FAIRYTALE of a \"terr if Ying v10lent insurrection where red hats were trying to overthrow our democracy and the poor valiant police and dim officials (who werwnt even there) were in a fight for survival...\"? They hunted about everyone involved down, locked them up and made them wait, imprisoned for a looooong time to stand trial while the MS took that time to impose guilt of serious, heinous crimes on them....\n\nTHAT is how \"our system\" responds to a natural, organic uprising of citizens who are tired of corruption! They squash it out as soon, sometimes before it even starts! They use their MS outlets.... news, media, social platforms and educational institutions (their prop agan da machine) to plant seeds that \"this is ok, but this is NOT\" to condition the masses. Consider all the times that r10ts, burning, v10lence, l00t1ng and mobs spewing and enforcing  h 8 full, dangerous, many times ill informed, deluded messages was allowed and even patted on the back by kind reinforcing words of endearment from the MS media and corrupt officials.... and then the times that people had a legit gripe and/or were actually being mistreated took a stand, they were labeled \"a threat\".... a threat to \"innocent people who have been mistreated in the past\", a threat to \"progress\", a threat to \"freedom, diversity, peace\" and of course \"a threat to our democracy\"!! No matter that those of us not allowed to actually stand in protest consists of all \"types\" of people, they will still label the group as ray cysts, bigots, etc and make claims that its about \"trying to maintain wyt control\" or somehow trying to \"resist civil rights and return to pre civil war US\".... its absurd! Of course no one wants to be called that or looked at that way and are NOT that way and that is never what its about! The real protests that real, genuine and decent people get behind are always about resisting going along with something(s) that are not right!.... and they are NOT ALLOWED!  All the other B S, horribly threatening and v10lent \"protests\" (r10ts) that are fueled by all the lib, w0ke, selfish, identity politics and prop agan da are FULLY EMBRACED by the establishment! \n\nI don't understand how its so hard for so many people to see. If the evil, corrupt establishment full of self centered, greedy, liars and psy co paths gets behind, encourages and allows a mass \"up rising\" and uses their \"mainstream mouth piece\" to feed you \"your message/cause\" and enable your actions.... it SHOULD BE obvious you are on the wrong side of things!? These people just believe that all of a sudden, our evil overlords, power/control structure, establishments and institutions care about and approve of us \"little people\"? These ARE the SAME rulers/system that have persuaded people to be evil and go along with all the \"unflattering\" things throughout our history by MAKING it the social norm, \"the way of the world, the way it is\"! Now all of a sudden THAT system is good or are they naive enough to believe the system is backing them now because they \"ascared the times are changing\", \"better get on board, the people arent having it\"😂😂 No, they could just as easy put a stop to the bad \"protests\" but they like those for some reason🤭",

        "text": "@mr.turnersneighborhood1741 - Forgive me if I pass on the whole \"Thank you for your service\" greeting. I often find that those who say that are just being nice, and in some cases, hypocritical. You see, I know that the U.S. military is the MOST NOBLE MILITARY in the history of mankind. I often ask people, \"Name another military that fought, and died for, people who didn't look like them, dress like them, talk like them, didn't worship the same God as they did, and then after all of the warfare was over, gave the very land, that they had fought and died for, BACK to the people that they had liberated?\" I enjoy watching their  little wheels turn, as they try and name another military, that did the same thing. It's kinda of a loaded question. Because I know, before I even ask the question, that they CAN\"T name another military that did the same thing. (I tried joining the Marines myself, but I had some, um, very \"unique\" adventures myself, before I turned 18. When even the Marines (the F'IN MARINES!) can't accept you, that really says a lot about my \"unique\" adventures before I turned 18. I also never speed. I'm more of a driving \"very enthusiastically\" kind of guy.) Dude, you're even WELL PAST the Steve Rodgers Captain America level OF HERO, because you're REAL, and really  took some VERY HERIOC actions, and you can PROVE it!  So, don't make any decisions that you can't undo later, and F the bi... the woman in Cincinnati!  (Yeah, I live in the PRC {People's Republic of Cincinnati } so when I say \"F her\", I really mean it!)",

But, just look around and notice some other things that are also happening, and that are good. \nTrump won by an even wider margin than his first time. \nEvery day black people, Latinos, young men and working class people, are leaving the Democratic party. \nYoutubers, like Actual Justice Warrior, Colion Noir, Black Conservative Perspective,  Vince Doa, Decoy voice, Crowder Bits, Joe Rogan, and many others, are gaining in popularity, while the MSM is continuing to lose in the ratings.\nLook at the Trump hating late night talk show hosts and where they're going, while Gutfeld is increasing in the ratings. \nWe've got Scott Jennings, and a gay dude whose opposed to transgender surgeries on kids and giving transgender medications to kids, and CNN hates both of them.\nThe S.C.O.T.U.S. is giving decisions favorable to Trump. \nNATO is finally paying its fair amount, not just 2%, but 5%.\nMore money, than ever before, is flowing into the U.S. Treasury. \nThe Southern border is closed.\nIllegal crossings are down to zero.\nIn the U.K. people are rebelling against their very Liberal governments.\nIn Britain, over 2,000  marched with British flags, and they were yelling about how much they loved Trump. Why did they do that? Because Trump said that you should be proud of your country, and your traditions. \nI use to have the same mindset that you have. 3 years ago I would've said that what I'm seeing in America, and around the world, would be impossible. But I was wrong. It's ALL changing, and in a good way.",

The S.C.O.T.U.S. is making more 2A friendly judgements, than they ever have in history. Suppressors are no longer considered weapons. Pro 2A Youtubers, like Armed Scholar and Colion Noir, are gaining in popularity. More Americans, like women, black Americans, Latino Americans and Asian Americans are buying guns, and getting their CCWs, in greater numbers than ever before in American history. Why are they doing that? Because they've realized that criminals don't care about the color of your skin, and certainly not if you're a woman. Criminals are looking for the weak and unarmed. And many of the criminals are FAFO that that woman, that black guy, that Latino guy, that Asian guy, that gay person, that older guy/gal aren't  as weak, as the criminals used to think that they were.  Those same people are getting their CCWs, getting trained and buying the guns, that fit their lifestyles. No this isn't the time to grab your guns and prepare. (Don't you remember what happened at Waco? How Janet Reno's ATF burned alive all of those people? Don't you remember what happened at Jonestown in Guyana? Both of those groups had the mindset of \"Arm yourself and prepare\". How did that work out for them?) Heroes, when things get bleak, always press forward, they don't run away and hide. I used to have the same ideas of get ready, strap up, get even more armed and get your food stores built up. (Haven't you ever seen videos on Preppers, and how real experts on being prepared, rate their preparations? Preppers don't do very well in those videos.) I'm one, of the very many, who isn't running away. More Americans aren't running away. On the contrary, more Americans are running towards the fight, and looking forward to that fight. It doesn't matter if the fight involves politics (the Men in girl's sports, locker rooms, bathrooms and showers issue, is being more fought against than ever before, and the Dems are losing on that fight)  Dems are watching, as every day, more black people, more Latinos, more young men,  more working class people, more single working mothers, are leaving the Democratic party. Money will no longer help the Dems. Harris had more billionaires backing her than Trump, but that didn't help that blue wall against that red tide, crumbling that blue wall on election night. I'm a big believer in the 2A. So yes, buy more guns. Get more training. But realize, that after decades of loosing, our side is fighting back, and winning! 😁",
