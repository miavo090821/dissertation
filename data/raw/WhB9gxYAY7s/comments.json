Meanwhile, the reality is Nelson was a terrorist there. He was part of the group that ultimately destroyed South Africa and practice genocide against white people. \n\nUN is useless. They don't stop any genocide. In fact they help set up the conditions for it and for wars. \n\nJust like NATO does. A huge drain that we should have cut completely lose.

Imagine if a White person said that to a Black or Brown person, though. People would freak out and cry racism! 🙄 \n\nUgh and why do the Democrats still deny that the kids are being given puberty blockers, hormones and even surgeries? Why has there been no national outrage about this medical malpractice and the evils of the trans meds and surgeries in general? Also- Lupron is the only puberty blocker I know of and it can have some nasty side effects. People who take it for actual medical reasons even stop taking it because the side effects are so bad! Why the hell do people want to give this to kids who don't have a legit reason to need this? It's so evil!! 😢\n\n I have a feeling that once this trans trend blows over, a looot of people will be suing for medical malpractice. It's also so messed up that Planned Parenthood actually had vans where they would hand out hormonees to kids! People in vans givinf drugs to kids and people were okay with this? It really makes me depressed that there is no national outrage about the trans medicine. It is the medical system's new cash cow. I'm very curjous what would be uncovered if we followed the money- especially who is profiting from giving these medications and surgeries to kids!!",
