Turn off any media that shows a heavy biased and is pushing extreme views. That pushes for war. That says it's ok to hide crimes and protect the wealthy but poor people are the problem. That includes online when \"independent media\" who unmask themselves as compromised. \n\nWe are here today in part because of media and people believing in the cults they identify with be they gender, political, worship of wealthy, virtue signaling that both left and right give in to...time for people to face the real enemy and actually take in that everything around them is fake.

Meanwhile, the reality is Nelson was a terrorist there. He was part of the group that ultimately destroyed South Africa and practice genocide against white people. \n\nUN is useless. They don't stop any genocide. In fact they help set up the conditions for it and for wars. \n\nJust like NATO does. A huge drain that we should have cut completely lose.

The term gained prominence in the 1980s with its adoption by the US Census Bureau.",
