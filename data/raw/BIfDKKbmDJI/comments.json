Nationalist turns are not proletarian\n\n11th July 1949\n\n“You speak of Sinified socialism. There is nothing of the sort in nature. There is no Russian, English, French, German, Italian socialism, as much as there is no Chinese socialism. There is only one Marxist-Leninist socialism. It is another thing, that in the building of socialism it is necessary to take into consideration the specific features of a particular country. Socialism is a science, necessarily having, like all science, certain general laws, and one just needs to ignore them and the building of socialism is destined to failure...\n\nIf you understand this everything with the building of socialism in China will be fine. If you won’t you will do great harm to the international communist movement. As far as I know in the CPC there is a thin layer of the proletariat and the nationalist sentiments are very strong and if you will not conduct genuinely Marxist-Leninist class policies and not conduct struggle against bourgeois nationalism, the nationalists will strangle you. Then not only will socialist construction be terminated, China may become a dangerous toy in the hands of American imperialists. In the building of socialism in China I strongly recommend you to fully utilise Lenin’s splendid work ‘The Immediate Tasks of Soviet Power’. This would assure success.”\n\n—  J.V. Stalin,",

I want to practice hope, I want to be hopeful for our collective future. How do you practice hope despite seemingly unsurmountable opposition to our ideals? America is so uniquely anti-communist because of its history of human domination and exploitation, wherein our ruling class of slaveowners and monopoly owners have pushed the public narrative as opposed to the groups actually doing the work that pushes this country forward. I do feel the time in era of time to build socialist movements and workers' unions, but if feels like, for me personally, being too vocal or visible about these ideas gets me shunned, fired from work (I have been too many times... possibly b/c my hammer&sickle tattoo on the tricep ticks off the boss, maybe personality of being a rebellious spirit with enough education to develop communist ideas does me in). What do you see for our future? As in Ideal future... I can already imagine the dystopian part, what do you see for how the social movement takes root.. I am probably more isolated than I want to be, I wish to be more involved.. Even so, many of my circle agree with communist/socialist rhetoric, but we can't actually elect a socialist, can we? What should I do? blow up oil pipelines? Chain up the entrances to JP morgan? Post on Social Media with enticing communist content/education? Or just pray more and hope we all make it to the greener grass future without billionaires and war. Much Love, your tiktoks radicalized me in 2020, I absolutely hope  you can influence more and be a part of a better American, and consequently, world future.",

    "text": "11th July 1949\n\n“You speak of Sinified socialism. There is nothing of the sort in nature. There is no Russian, English, French, German, Italian socialism, as much as there is no Chinese socialism. There is only one Marxist-Leninist socialism. It is another thing, that in the building of socialism it is necessary to take into consideration the specific features of a particular country. Socialism is a science, necessarily having, like all science, certain general laws, and one just needs to ignore them and the building of socialism is destined to failure.\n\nWhat are these general laws of building of socialism.\n\n1. Above all it is the dictatorship of the proletariat the workers’ and peasants’ State, a particular form of the union of these classes under the obligatory leadership of the most revolutionary class in history the class of workers. Only this class is capable of building socialism and suppressing the resistance of the exploiters and petty bourgeoisie.\n\n2. Socialised property of the main instruments and means of production. Expropriation of all the large factories and their management by the state.\n\n3. Nationalisation of all capitalist banks, the merging of all of them into a single state bank and strict regulation of its functioning by the state.\n\n4. The scientific and planned conduct of the national economy from a single centre. Obligatory use of the following principle in the building of socialism: from each according to his capacity, to each according to his work, distribution of the material good depending upon the quality and quantity of the work of each person.\n\n5. Obligatory domination of Marxist-Leninist ideology.\n\n6. Creation of armed forces that would allow the defence of the accomplishments of the revolution and always remember that any revolution is worth anything only if it is capable of defending itself.\n\n7. Ruthless armed suppression of counter revolutionaries and the foreign agents.\n\nThese, in short, are the main laws of socialism as a science, requiring that we relate to them as such. If you understand this everything with the building of socialism in China will be fine. If you won’t you will do great harm to the international communist movement. As far as I know in the CPC there is a thin layer of the proletariat and the nationalist sentiments are very strong and if you will not conduct genuinely Marxist-Leninist class policies and not conduct struggle against bourgeois nationalism, the nationalists will strangle you. Then not only will socialist construction be terminated, China may become a dangerous toy in the hands of American imperialists. In the building of socialism in China I strongly recommend you to fully utilise Lenin’s splendid work ‘The Immediate Tasks of Soviet Power’. This would assure success.”\n\n—  J.V. Stalin,",

The numerous victories that the colonizers experienced, followed by the victories of the capitalists , has resulted in an imperialist state.  A state so captured by capital through and through that there is no practical path of bringing lasting justice to the indigenous people, or any oppressed minority,  other than the path that will bring justice to all of the people. This doesn't deny the heinous crimes our ancestors committed, nor the disproportionate suffering that the indigenous people still suffer because of those crimes. On the contrary, it's caring enough to be pragmatic about a solution, which is a critical mass of class consciousness  and the revolution that'll follow. MLK, DuBois, Fred Hampton, and many others knew this.

This is a debate whose answer was found by the response of the second international to the outbreak of ww1. Patriotism brought some of the most fervent marxists like Kautsky, Plekhanov etc to support their own national identities \"against\" imperialism. \n\nIt is not different, and there is no magical difference about Americans that serves to alter their class consciousness to such a degree that they require marxism to be babied up to be more palatable for them through the veneer of patriotism.

        "text": "​@stevedbertram11th July 1949\n\n“You speak of Sinified socialism. There is nothing of the sort in nature. There is no Russian, English, French, German, Italian socialism, as much as there is no Chinese socialism. There is only one Marxist-Leninist socialism. It is another thing, that in the building of socialism it is necessary to take into consideration the specific features of a particular country. Socialism is a science, necessarily having, like all science, certain general laws, and one just needs to ignore them and the building of socialism is destined to failure.\n\nWhat are these general laws of building of socialism.\n\n1. Above all it is the dictatorship of the proletariat the workers’ and peasants’ State, a particular form of the union of these classes under the obligatory leadership of the most revolutionary class in history the class of workers. Only this class is capable of building socialism and suppressing the resistance of the exploiters and petty bourgeoisie.\n\n2. Socialised property of the main instruments and means of production. Expropriation of all the large factories and their management by the state.\n\n3. Nationalisation of all capitalist banks, the merging of all of them into a single state bank and strict regulation of its functioning by the state.\n\n4. The scientific and planned conduct of the national economy from a single centre. Obligatory use of the following principle in the building of socialism: from each according to his capacity, to each according to his work, distribution of the material good depending upon the quality and quantity of the work of each person.\n\n5. Obligatory domination of Marxist-Leninist ideology.\n\n6. Creation of armed forces that would allow the defence of the accomplishments of the revolution and always remember that any revolution is worth anything only if it is capable of defending itself.\n\n7. Ruthless armed suppression of counter revolutionaries and the foreign agents.\n\nThese, in short, are the main laws of socialism as a science, requiring that we relate to them as such. If you understand this everything with the building of socialism in China will be fine. If you won’t you will do great harm to the international communist movement. As far as I know in the CPC there is a thin layer of the proletariat and the nationalist sentiments are very strong and if you will not conduct genuinely Marxist-Leninist class policies and not conduct struggle against bourgeois nationalism, the nationalists will strangle you. Then not only will socialist construction be terminated, China may become a dangerous toy in the hands of American imperialists. In the building of socialism in China I strongly recommend you to fully utilise Lenin’s splendid work ‘The Immediate Tasks of Soviet Power’. This would assure success.”\n\n—  J.V. Stalin,",

Labor is literally the antagonistic pole to capital\nb) therefore the only condition in which the proletariat can be meaningfully liberated is its abolition. It cannot be free if it exists\n\nTherefore any political demand that reaffirms the existence of proletariat directly or indirectly via the reaffirmation of capital fundamentally is not revolutionary\n\nAnd by that standard landback is fundamentally reactionary given that it reaffirms property, property being one of the relations of production inherent in capitalism\n\nActual communists such as myself will back you up when leftists attack you for their class collaborationism and ethno-nationalism with revolutionary aesthetics",

That does not mean people should feel guilty, but it is very important context that remains relevant today due to things like historical dispossession and intergenerational trauma, as is the legacy of slavery. I think the main goals of this movement align very well with addressing this legacy, so I do not see it as an \"either or\" scenario as it is presented here. \n\nSecond, \"land back\" is not a call for a race war, that is kind of a ridiculous straw man. To most Indigenous groups of Canada and the USA, land was fundamentally something that was not owned for private property nor for profit, and was in stead to be used communally for the benefit of everyone... sound familiar? I think that there is a great opportunity to have Indigenous views on land stewardship and communal use augment the Marxist analysis, rather than detract from it.",
