now you think you got to be in the gym 24 hours building you know a bookshelf in the back and your body wasn't made to do that the way that the body represents almost like cod switching where it's like if I find this body type I have a a different level of authenticity within a specific sudo celebrity culture here in Atlanta and I think it's true in the marketplace under capitalism certain body modifications put you in different places in the market I tend to believe that people should be able to make those choices right there's a value judgment based on the on the Natural Body and almost like a demonization or a inferior an alloying of the BBL or the augmentation but if anybody says to me I will fight them about that more people were radicalized under Trump I think more people were liberalized because they want her I get it cuz I'm a black woman I don't like seeing a competent and educated black woman in this be attacked and disparaged and all these [ __ ] misogynous racist fronts and all of this right but what people are doing now is now you becoming Pro prosecutor [Music] H beautiful black [Music] people you know I always I never really wait for y'all to say hi back and I always want trying to say hi to me like and then I waited this time y you don't give us a chance and look I and I gave you a chance today look what you did nothing we didn't know we weren't ready throw the ball you watch what you do with it nothing I'm putting in the girl I remember this so vivly uh what's it called just brought uh Rebecca just brought it up what just happened um the I Like the Way You Move video from big boy had his baby mama's sister in it yes and why that's that's such a weird and she was a huge she was so so I'm looking at her now she's still very attractive regardless but like now she has a fitness body this is a fitness influencer body that she had in the early 2000s versus before versus now again she would be considered skinny um and it's just so wild to see how things have changed but I I will say this I think we've always had like beauty standards has always been a thing so people are always chasing whatever like the beauty standard has been set at right like we Beauty like who goes in and out of style like that's always been a thing the same way like clothes and Trends and what have you I also think like within our own Community I think we've always liked particular archetype we just changed the proportions over the decades like we've always liked the my mommy used to call it the coke bottle shape you know what I mean and it had to be smaller for the 2000s and the um and the 90s and stuff that was more based around what white people was on and they skinny this nonsense and it got bigger and bigger and bigger but then once like people had more access like surgery so the rise of the internet social media allows you to see way more of the world for something to get set you know what I mean in a standard and so then it became like um uh the more you know people getting bbls and stuff but the BBL is just a reflection of is it's just people trying to seek a body type that does exist right like an arch that coke bottle shape that lots of black women do have and so then it became people like all right I have the money now to access it and went from celebrities to now I think even more than just the people who are doing it you know because there are a lot of people who are doing it because they think it will provide them access to a new life essentially they think it will give them a a new dating pool of a certain kind of person that makes more money they think it'll allow them to be more appealable online to be influent and they're not wrong they're not wrong in a lot and and a lot of respects and then there are just a lot of people bbls have become incredibly popular like like regular people like I know tons of people with bbls like all like not just at L every damn where friend hairdresser like nor regular everyday people everyday gals and it's because like again we've always chased as a societ and like as women we chase a beauty standard and what you think you're being seen a lot you know what I mean and like eventually like you don't got that body type you know what I mean you feel like you are you know you and so people have the money they they they do it because child Lord knows I know a lot of people bbls yeah yeah and you know I I came through the the punk rock scene and body modification was a big part of it and so you know I was one of the one of the early afro punks right and it's just like so I I come I I I arrived at a place where I'm very open to body modification and I'm I see it from the standpoint of sort of like body bily autonomy like people have the right to Al he is being modest afro Punk was built on a documentary about Maurice and like the like that's where the festival comes from it's a do the pioneers of it and did not know that not know that I'm a big up my boss and friend oh so now look now I gotta go and make sure I put that to go watch that at that look what I find out meanwhile I I brought y'all here for y'all's working family parties like takes we are supposed to be having a conversation act like like it's not me that's derailing it now I want you to it is Rebecca FD signifier let's talk about buts I'm always to talk about we're try to have a serious conversation about BP Harris and it goes straight to BBL like did cut you off but finish your thought morrice yeah no I mean so I arrived at this place where I'm very comfortable with body modification and I see it as a way that people could express themselves and and I see it from the standpoint of bodily autonomy and so when I see sisters do bbls my position is like you have the right to modify your body however you want to modify your body and I think it's true true they aren't wrong that in the marketplace under capitalism certain body modifications put you in different places in the market and they're making thoughtful decisions in order to place themselves in in places in order to monetize and and so I tend to believe that people should be able to make those choices right um and also like there's artistic choices that you're making around modifying your body that's just about your expression and so that's the line that I take around any body modification just because of like you know I came I came through a a movement where people were like doing all types of things to their faces to their bodies nobody wanted nobody understood them they were Outcast because of it and I see some of that discourse around bbls that makes me feel uncomfortable and I'm like look this person for whatever reasons right for whatever reasons is choosing this for their own body and on a certain level we need to protect that right well I hate the discourse and I I completely agree with you and I hate the discourse around shaming women or I being like or for any surgery like I hate when people pull up Lil Kim's picture and they be like why did she do this she was so beautiful you didn't say that like you have to acknowledge the larger you know what I mean like let's talk about like what colorism is what featurism is all these different things that play into like why certain women particularly black women don't feel beautiful and then when they go and they do the work based on what you're saying people will shame them like I think of even like laa like they used to call La La bad body bad buil nonstop especially I remember when the second like think like a man came out or whatever like her body type versus the others then once she does work they talking [ __ ] you know what I mean like I I hate also like I like to addd I'd like to addd the fact that like sometimes yall don't do it for us and like when you see like girls like sometimes getting breast reductions in the way how react to that like GS would have like how dare you I'm sure Li you could be like you could hear about this type of [ __ ] like I know you got thoughts because like you see like how dare you take off them breast like what like that's why we loved you and like the whole thing is like maybe she wasn't a doing it for your male gu yeah may it was bothering her health maybe it was like it and I'm going to do whatever I feel like doing and anytime I change my hair like somebody's going to say something about ol's hair anytime I change my hair or do something with my hair or whatever the case may be oh Rebecca I liked it better when oh I don't give a damn I don't give two dams right I'm gonna rock my hair how I feel like it and even if a guy says you know Queen because you know when they Queen what Umar say you got to be nappy sister is too good don't with that with that crack with that crack that they put in there it's giving cancer it's giving when you had your curls that made you look more and it's it's like I'm gonna do what I want I'm gonna wear my curly hair if I feel like it I just cut my natural hair I was rocking flips for a week doing some like I'mma do what the hell I want to do and you can't it's not GNA make me less of being me but for you you're telling me that that's more desirable to you and I have to go by what you want their standards and it does drastically change how you perceive like I like as well this is this goes for everybody right like this is not unique to black women right I'm just speaking of the black woman's life experience but like depending on which how you choose to do your hair how you choose to dress how you choose to whatever how you choose to do your nails you can you can and will convey an entirely different thing that attracts and perceives like an entirely different thing like it is 100 100% like me having my locks or whatever appeals to an entirely different and cre a whole different aesthetic and archetype whatever than my than my weave or versus this pixie cut or whatever have you and like people feel starkly different and they have perceptions and understandings of you based on that like how you choose to to show up or whatever and your aesthetic has a lot to do with it and how your body type in particular like again I'm just speak you women other women you all have experiences too I'm just speaking for black women like but like having like a like you say like a voluptuous body type like I've had these boobs my boobs have been big in my head since I was 133 right like I've had this this body type since day one and the way that like impacts how I move through the world and how people perceive me and not just like men or whatever but like women other women or whatever people in what their came inside your comments and was telling you about how you should wear your breast you have no idea that was wild and it's nonstop like it's nonstop like that like when I was thinking like like more than I think about how like men receive my my my my breast it's how women perceive it's women constantly like and I feel like women do a thing like in the especially in the um what you mentioned earlier about um uh um the surgery about the like oh how men perceive like oh you getting a breast reduction but no it's actually what I receive more in my life is women the first thing out of women's mouth to me they the first thing they feel to see they to say to me is oh your back must hurt you must need a breast reduction or whatever and it's almost this way like to like offset how they feel you know what I mean like about you whatever they're doing it's this way so you know what I mean minimize how they feel about you this yeah you know what I mean they got a something with your breast they gotta whatever whatever like it's really really a thing like a real life thing like it it it's funny because it's it like lends to such a a massive hypersexualization like you have biged breast like hypers sexualizes the [ __ ] out of you and the way other women then perceive you and how they see you and and ju supposed to them is incredible and then like the flip side is you also can't be a public intellectual yeah that's one thing I like you were more on Twitter like Olay would every couple of weeks just pop out on the like all right by the way hey I'm fly as hell and like the comments and like every once while you see those comments it be like well this just feels like you should be focusing on other things it's like or she could post a thirst trap on Twitter cuz like you can do both um I wanted to respond to something uh uh not so much respond but I wanted to at least make it clear when I uh my my critique here of like the BBL and BBL culture isn't more isn't focused on like a woman's body should be X Y or Z it's more so kind of like trying to tease out the core forces that have in Atlanta it feels surreal and that's kind of probably why I'm so stuck on it the core force like I I do think it is capitalism I think I don't know who brought that up but like the way that the body represents almost like cold switching in a in a weird way like a reverse cold switching where it's like if I if I if I find this body type I now am uh I have a a different level of authenticity within a specific C pseudo celebrity culture here in Atlanta um like you can't hang with us if you don't have these this aesthetic as a black woman and you and you were made to feel that way I remember thinking I could only pull like I remember like being like thinking I could only pull like oh famous [ __ ] would only look my way or whatever if I had like a BBL that this kind of body type like oh I have to work out or change my body type in some way or whatever because curvy has drastically changed in our lifetime because black women have always been curvy generally right like that is always it was our archetype and we like we've the B BBL culture and surgery has allowed us to basically like box ourselves out of our own archetype like curvy and what has become the body type whatever is no longer us like in a normal world or in the in the old world whatever before you know you could do enhancements I would be unmistakably curvy to me but in the world versus the women that I see you know what I mean on on on social media or as you know what I mean or whatever have you yeah change drastically like that waste the thingy ratio is I I mean but we should add that that the way that technology intersects with that because some of these representations actually aren't the repres presentation of anything in real life because and that's what I was going to say like I realized in real life like oh that's not the case Okay the famous like me I get in the rooms everybody still think you cute daen yeah go ahead no the last thing I was gonna say like a lot of these representations are touched up a lot of the proportions are actually changed so when people are like oh this particular Baddie this particular model this particular influencer that's my archetype she doesn't even look like that yeah right and so it's like technology is actually enhancing whatever you're seeing and so it's to the point where the whatever the black women archetype is has been augmented by AI to the point where it's not even like grounded in anything yeah it's literally like it changes every there's a new body type or it could be an old body type history repeats itself when it comes we see that when it comes to what is trending and what isn't BBL is the first of its kind of its time so that that it'll be here and it'll be gone and it'll be gone right now what's coming back is that Slimmer look we know that a lot of people are on OIC I've never seen people who couldn't who were naturally just thicker in the face or thicker in the body um just and be working out and still be thicking those places um immediately just be so small right now they're going back to the small aesthetic that that early 2000s '90s book but that is about capitalism too because because though having that kind of work then used to be like a status marker you know what I mean like that used to be inaccessible to regular people and now that regular people regular women are have access are getting bbls and getting the same work done they don't like you know what I mean the the appearance they need something to be able to tell themselves aesthetically apart from from the common folks that everybody's going back to but everybody it's it's the same thing that how the wave of the BBL came everybody's doing the wave of whatever I think that it's more so it and I can't lie it affected the BBL time when it first came out it affected me because I just moved here and I was like damn I don't wear these type they won't fit me I'm gonna be baggy on the side I told you guys it ain't gonna work for me but I had to really the same way with you Olay I like I know that I'm beautiful nobody can't tell me that I'm not I know that but when you're just surrounded by all of this and this they're saying that this is what is in and you don't see yourself getting there anytime soon soon you can't afford none of that like all I do is go running so I'm probably going to be like slim for a while because I just like cardio that's my thing so my thing is I was like I don't know if I'm gonna fit in with that I had to look at myself and be like it's one of those things you got to tell yourself Rebecca you just you you got your body it is what it is and I used to think that um even being on air see in my life in regular world I was thinking this one way about myself when I got on air and I was doing Politics the comment section was saying all I am is just a pretty face um I don't know anything about politics I'm just a a talking head they called me the black Barbie and I didn't like that either CU I'm like see now you're you're telling me about how wide the Gambit is but it's all negative whatever we can whatever angle we can take as long as you know we don't [ __ ] with you exactly we can call you pretty but you can you can't be pretty and intelligent you can't be pretty and well spoken you can't be pretty and educated so we're just going to put you in this box over here so I didn't like that either but I realize if I allow myself to these people to Define who I am or I take an insecurity that I put upon myself because this is trending uh and I don't fit into this box uh then I'm not going to be happy with me so I remember going out one day and um with Ben and we went to some you know event social light event or whatever and they was asking about me and I said because I am that [ __ ] and I cannot allow myself to be putting putting myself in a box because this is a trendy thing Rebecca you are you you're going to be beautiful for somebody who gives a damn as long as you're beautiful to yourself but it is very difficult I will say um because people will tell you men will say oh you know this is not what I care to to be with and then it be this whole thing online you see that same guy that was saying that in the comment section for this person thirsting after this person their whole timeline is filled with nothing but ass ass ass um and then you know then there's me so so so it's like it's it's a lot um that that social the social logic they'll make you say that this is what you have to work towards the gym girlies if you might fall into that side of the internet now you think you got to be in the gym 24 hours building you know a bookshelf in the back and your body wasn't made to do that you just no matter how much you in the gym squatting you just gonna be flat back there sis you're gonna be nice healthy and flat it's okay so so you know I think it's just like about more of there was I remember there was this big thing about body positivity I'm seeing less about you know big women in their campaigns thicker ladies in the campaigns now I remember when that was the thing they had focused on oh you know body positivity we saw thicker women and more campaigns online for this and that and immediately like you guys said because it's a capitalistic thing I'm looking online now a lot of those same um brands are going for the smaller girls uh now different colors they might get the darkest girl right and then they might get the the whitest girl and put them in the same campaign skin different tyes but all thin all the thin family somebody said something about the way uh I think it o said something about how social media projects things and I I hate to bring us back to to swirl uh discourse but there's a like so when we talk about desirability specifically with black women my so I see more projection of dark skinned black women with white men than ever seen in my life and I know for a fact that colorism is still real among white white men just like it is among black men but that particular uh Dynamic gets spun up in the algorithm so much that now it's becoming a meme so I saw my first meme um uh identifying that phenomenon online where it was like a gorgeous dark skinned girl with you know natural hair in a pool and her like you know decent looking white boyfriend and then it was a picture of Kobe Bryant and it was like white white guys when it's time to bag the sexy dark skinn and I was like damn we've already hit the meta commentary level of this of this thing that's how hard this is hitting not just my feed but feeds in general and how does that feed into all these other narratives about black folks in general but specifically like uh black women in darkskinned black women in like the messages it sends about where their value um and how those messages are reflected I want to say reflected in real life because I don't I can't speak to that but how are how is that how how does that distort how those messages come across you know what I'm saying yeah and it feeds into this this narrative I've always like seen floated online is that like black men don't like dark skinned black women and that white men white men like us like like us more and treat us better and Y yada Y and I mean like here's the thing I think the world more DM some old girl did you I forgot that's what we talked about last time I was I I just it just hit me while I was on my mind but sorry go ahead the world the world don't like dark skinn dark skinned black women right like in some you know I was thinking about this like the kind of implicit things you're taught to believe about your beauty or yourself as a as a dark skinned black girl specifically I think growing up um would respect me like cutting off my hair because 10 years ago I like I want to say almost 10 years ago like when I first moved to New York I cut my hair into a pixie cut and panicked immediately like you know what I mean full throated Panic like I have to get a wig this's the most stress you know what I mean for the yes year and I realize like when I think about it and I look at the cut and I'm like oh this was cute like what's the problem and I know what the problem is the problem is like implicitly like as black women I actually right before we started recording I was listening to YouTube video I was oh I was listening to breakfast club and um they were talking about Soulja Boy B Simone said you know never in my life has anybody been like I like she was like Soulja Boy is a legend he's great da but never in my life has any been anybody been like turned that so boy on like I'm trying to hit that Crank that you know what I mean and so soldja boy starts going off and saying a bunch of it's funny like so much typical anti-black stuff that don't even apply to this lightskin y you know what I mean like he like just general antiblack [ __ ] in your direction like fixated on like oh her [ __ ] you ain't got no hair cuz she has a pixie cut by choice right like like this and and I thought about and I was something I was thinking about a lot this week the way like black women like baldheaded is such a go-to of thought process excuse like this like like insult or whatever like even when you have hair they say that you they think about the way like in Martin they would talk about Pam you talk about Pam kitchen Pam had a hair full of long straight and he still I was so confused by that for much of my childhood cuzz I didn't know what a bdb was I would look at him and be like you are a dark black woman like sudden like it's it is like to inherently be undesirable like if they think it's undesirable it applies to you no matter what it is that they could see right and you're made to feel like you have to overcompensate for the fact that the world doesn't think you're pretty you know they receive that even if you don't like it has nothing to do with your own self-esteem like I think about even how like when Shannon sharp like posted a picture of his daughter one time dark beautiful woman but he felt the need to be like and all that's her hair that's her real hair that long hair whatever blah blah blah like the way you feel like like black women see is like a badge of honor to show you have long hair but in particular whatever when you're when you're dark skinned God forbid you you not be skinny or whatever have you and I'm like you know what that's what it is like I realized like 10 years ago like that's what it is the the the pressure and the inherent Panic of feeling like I thought about I thought about it like even the need to feel the like to show like if you're going to show that you cut your hair I have a pixie cut the need to feel like show how much how long your hair was before that it got cut off like you feel like you have to validate think about how many grown black women want to tell you how long their hair was like they always tell you oh it was long I you that was so weird and it's like what's that really rooted in right and it it really speaks to this larger you know what I mean these larger beauty beauty standards and these um things that are anti-block and a lot of respects or whatever and it creates this desirability so I think like to Loop it all around it's like yes I think I think that people should be able to do whatever body modifications that they want to and they should um and I think that they shouldn't be shamed for those things however I do worry about what the desire a lot of the motivations to get those bonification come from and if you notice you see a lot of people start doing surgery and they start getting a bunch of surgery it isn't like you get it it's like I satisfied what I wanted to do you know what I mean it just can like a lot of it can be feed into this like body dysmorphia and a constant chasing standard and surgeries are dangerous and the thing about the bbls most one of most the stories when you go and you watch the Vlogs or you go listen to the women who have bbls it sounds like a nightmare like a Horror Story even the regular healing like when didn't like the amount of I'm just like Jesus Christ like Housewives all the time I wrot House women getting them and I'm like like just like watching the screen and it's wild M did a whole documentary and she had a whole show on time about her experience because she at first came out I remember when she came out she looked totally different um I went to fam and she was Miss FAMU at one point so her pictures on the wall totally different and not that she wasn't beautiful but she just looked totally different and then it and you know because I'm not even talking about veneers just yet because that's just like the BBL of teeth we're that but she ended up getting a thought right she ended up getting a BBL then starting doing another process I didn't I didn't even know was a thing you get one you get another process you get another process she did so many and she became like it got out of hand for her she wanted oh sorry she wanted to have she wanted to have a baby um with her partner and um they were saying hey like the fluids are going in places that they shouldn't you're like she it was a whole thing her whole body was shutting down on her so she had to start removing parts of it I remember I'll never forget it she was sitting at the Breakfast Club and Charlamagne was like so is that real like is that in the back is that real she said it's home grown and they were like it so that's homegrown she said it again it's homegrown so they K Michelle K Michelle said that on I hadn't heard you said I just knew based on my pop culture knowledge I but but she she she said that it was homegrown and that she it was it it's real and it's funny because you go get this work done but you're ashamed to say that you got this work done you want them to think that it is actually homegrown even though there's evidence that definitely supports that you went and got work done but you're not confident enough in the work that you got done or to let them know that this is not something that is your natural body but it started to take it almost took her life so she had to get it taken out out of her until this day she's still doing work because she still she wants to carry children which she's not going to be able to do she says because of all the work that she had done and what she had taken out and they had to reconstruct her body so she still doesn't have her normal body type they had to reconstruct it when they all the stuff out so it was so bad that they ended up giving her a show where she showed on lifetime so many other women who had work done and what it's done to them and how it's ruined their life um some people going to the black market because they want they can't afford to go and get it done correctly at a you know at a proper surgeon so they're going to the black market going to people's homes getting things shot up healing at the people's homes um you know all of this stuff and she was saying you know here's my story and here's what I don't want you guys to end up looking like and here's other people's stories let's be honest most people don't have the money for what it is because the reality is and what gets left out of the conversation is you don't ever get to have one surgery like people who get these bblc procedures they are having rounds and rounds of surgeries and around and procedures and and um with the actual proper followup and after care and treatments and they're supposed to do whatever all that stuff is a [ __ ] ton of money so the problem is too is like people saving up you know their last to get like one surgery or thing in kind of complications and stuff happen or whatever have you like that is the thing I I do feel and there's a lot of it son like even with like veneers like L the veneers [ __ ] really I wanna I that was a thing like a month ago right I I didn't there was why are young people my whole life growing up I remember my grammy didn't have no teeth my grammy used to have my had dentes and I remember my grammy was sham when them dentes would not be in her mouth like she would be shame like what what happened where young people with a mouth full of healthy teeth y started shaving their teeth down like chicklets to put fake teeth in their mouth voluntarily it's wild and knowing when you will have a lifetime you'll your Mount up now you gonna spend the rest of your days like you have money it ain't again this is not one surgery I think V have to be I don't know the specifics but I think it's like every 15 years or 10 years or so or so you're supposed to get this again and it's very expensive are y'all out of your mindes yeah my mother got veneers very ear like but she had terrible teeth like she actually had teeth and had to get them like and she was like she was like very confused she was like what what am I gonna look like this like she was like give me my natural teeth but they were rotten in the core and so she was just and she she got like up but it was also at at that point it was not as chlay looking as it is now like they actually looked more natural yeah and more fitted to your actual mouth but now not only that people are actually going to these not doctors and getting [ __ ] from yeah where where they getting because that's what I was seeing it was like like people learning to do nails in the crib is how they doing peoplec on top of the too some down some of them are not even shaving it down they are literally placing a whole brick on top of your tooth and and then they're like like an overlay and then what's happening is a lot of people are getting infections in their gums because this is not healthy here's the thing you'll see these I've never seen so many again in Atlanta I've never seen so many signs that are literally telling you that getting your teeth done make you fine it's like literally signs about Smile Dentistry or whatever the name of this thing and it has so many it says your teeth make your teeth sexy again or some kind of stuff that they're selling to make you think that your original teeth aren't good and they're literally like these quick Dentistry shops that are popping up everywhere and you're not going to your dentist anymore for your checkup you're not going to your dentist anymore for anything else you you you got gingervitis but you went to go get your you went to go get your teeth done have unpopular opinion I have an unpopular opinion based on my lived experience people overinvestment and getting they te done based on what the actual worth is in society like Beyond being a little kid the only people if you're a little child and your teeth are up or whatever and like cheering in the schoolyard say something or whatever but in life nobody be on your teeth run as a Gallow at braces for years and have pretty great team no one gives a it don't earn no nothing nothing about it then somebody who has I am president of the Big Titty Committee nobody cares and I they like to talk about it it's a lot of talk it's a lot of expectation there a lot of Arling but in real life application nobody give a it is a it is a un it is a depreciating value like a car like no one get a ass worth we we are entering demonetization space so it seems like we're moving around the body can we talk about I just want to bring this in right and this is something for the brothers but like I see two two representatives from the beard gang here on this on this feed all right so so let me you got something no like I'm not in the beer Gang This is the best I was excited when these joints started to connect right that was that was my experience we have to shut down I wish I could get my other camera back up um because I C I called a struggle beard comment um off a live the other day and it hurt my feelings I was like let me get back to myox my minox on this [ __ ] this is Maurice you back I was said yeah I got excited when these joints started to connect right but the best I could do is a patchy little something like I'll never be in beard gang right but this brother's going so let me so so forign you stay out of this one because a forign is is just it's it's twigs and berries but for me so I was a lot like Maurice um and I this is this is all work from Co I wish I could pull up an old picture of myself where I was just rocking the the mustache joint and during Co I was like I'm going to stop shaving and I'm going to research how mother grow beards and I'm gon figure that [ __ ] out and it's still like on camera and a low and in like 720p my [ __ ] is Gucci this is great but as soon as that HD joint come on that's turn sideways it's like oh oh you look like you good at fight you are good at fighting games FD I see it now but I said that to say when the beard came back into style for black men I was obsessed and if I had the money and the opportunity I definitely would have done something to get well not the not the freaking the like the fake joint I wouldn't have did The Weave but if they had like but you would get the hair transplant when that when I never forget it was the beard gang Facebook group do y'all remember that are y'all to young for that it was so of them well but there was one the one that at least blew it up in my Facebook Circle I I was in there like the women like damn look at these [ __ ] beards I ain't got nothing like that and and like literally this is a result of that insecurity so I know for a fact if there was a BBL but it was beard beard lift I'm sorry I'm a dad then I would have had that all day so I get it that I think honestly the best thing that ever happened to me and I say this all the time my big sister is so vain thank you God like that's the best thing like when we was growing up she was like and all my sisters I have three she had three younger sisters we all look just like her so she couldn't allow for you to have low self-esteem that was personally offensive to her you know what I mean like you couldn't be around her being like I don't like my whatever she's like who like I am gorgeous and my big sister like kind of like I feel like my big sister hat hit me to the fact that beauty was about in Trends you know what I mean in terms of how the world received you very early on like she'd be like listen y'all ain't in style yet like or whatever so the people ain't hip yet to the fact that y'all find but trust me that's what it is and I remember when when African when African queen dropped that put me and my sisters on the map like all suddenly you are my African queen that put me on the map okay telling you listen they was never was looking my way at all like they amazing how trans work with that can I can I point that I really want like a real quick point I really wanted to make especially like on the on the body front is how a lot of this in particular like when we talk about the way that surgeries work a lot of it like when we talk about like gender firing care we kind of encroach into like the trans territory right here and like how much CIS dudes and CIS folks in particular are very invested in gender affirming care only to differentiate themselves from like a lot of people that actually involve themselves in gendering care a lot of the time and more importantly the way that like we talk about surgery like bbls in particular and I like just being around like a lot of natural bodies and in quotes natural bodies like you would often hear and I try not to go and criticize black women and Fs inside my my um online but like I gota go on oil of fire for this one not collectively but in in anecdotal they come and say oh yeah yeah all of this natural they say all of this natural they say I so I got to go and show you all what's happening because all them other ones fake and like there's a value judgment pce like like placed on the on the Natural Body and almost like a A demonization or a inferior an alloying of the BBL or the augmentation and it's always like it very much Teeters if not drenches in the transphobia because a lot of these different things that we look at in particular with bbls and like breast augmentation surgery or just like all these feminization surgeries they always Associated from a point of differentiating themselves from like a trans body or what they deem to be a trans body in reality a lot of these surgeries a lot of these gender affirming cares and things like that things that we do things the CIS folks do in particular and that's how it actually got popular and then transform because because I think what It ultimately comes comes down to is a feeling of like fundamental Worth right and like I guess you know um uh desan son has a great book called uh Belly of the beast on on fat phobia and all of these different things and like a politics of prettiness and all these different things and I I think the reason why it's that it's the same idea of like oh you have a child with that person cuz you know uh that you got pretty sure oh whenever somebody have surgery and they be like oh with your children have your real nose or whatever it is this is this idea that like per people who are more attractive or who who who have these things naturally are inherently worth more like more valuable the idea puran [ __ ] ex exactly and so that's the reason to like like it's not the same the points you get I guess like if you look at it in like the game of like the points you get the points you get for that being your real body or whatever your real it being natural versus if you had to do something that's why this that's why people play pretend right it's the it's the whole the reason why like on a lesser level like every romcom has a woman putting her makeup on in the morning so she could pretend like next to them when the man wake up like she looked like that original or whatever right it's like this need to like is not good enough to have it or to possess it or to be pretty or what it is you're presented in the world it also need to be real like it that it was what it really was you were just ethereal like that you know yeah the inherent value of that if if I that has changed too like the reality is like back in the day like people who were Kings or queens or in court were like bigger and that showed that you actually had more food more things on your table right and so it just is has always been attached to right like healthy and beautiful meant voluptuous meant not this you know skinny meant you know peasant or whatever which still was more also about capitalism and also the structures that we had but I just think that like to me it's like strange because like in in like Puerto Rico um and and beli too it's very much about the game of being how like natural you are and how not like in in every way like oh you probably need to exercise to look more natural like everything is about that like oh you wear like I wear too much makeup for uh my family in Puerto Rico a lot of times and I don't even be wearing that much um but it's just like it's it's this also other game but I think we all do it as a way to both it's like a way to distinguish folks of like from themselves because that's what we're taught we have to always distinguish ourselves and then I think it's also just like you know fashion brings a big role into that and like the reality is that there are only a few people that are setting this like these particular like wide shifts and Trends around Fashion like the Kardashians are one of them like they are like people like they you know that's always when you could see a thing shift and um so yeah I just feel like there's like fashion has a big and not look I I love I'm a fashion girly but not in the way that you know I'm telling fasion to ask me what to you know what to look like I just want to have fun yeah like that what that those people should be able I think it just boils down to with all of these things being at hand especially in social media social media is such a beautiful place but it's also can be a very dangerous place right um back in the day I didn't know people used to when I was a kid right they used to be like you're flat as your back I a't got no I ain't got no titties right and I ain't got no like nothing so I knew that when I got to a certain age these things would come in it may not be as big it may not be as small whatever but they were GNA come in I was going to get in the age and this would come in I remember being young and watching this stupid ass commercial because they used to call me flat so much but they used I used to watch this commercial called there was this drug called lvi and they said if you want bigger boobs take this drug and I will just be like one one I didn't have a cell phone they weren't a thing but I'll be writing the number down in my notebook one day I will call this number when I can afford this drug so that I can have boob so it's a social thing but now it's just so much more thrown in our faces kids are subjected to this type of thing so early we're seeing uh I remember back when I was a child but times have changed I can say this back when I was a child I was wearing a t-shirt and jeans and these kids are now wearing uh two-pieces the same one that I'm wearing at my age we're we're twin we're twinning but it's a different time also I think things are very much over sexualized in my opinion so we all feel like we need to be sexy we need to be wearing this and all of the clothes are catering to that look and it's like you know if you dress this way you're you're too covered up if you dress this way you're you're you're too sexy nothing is just do you at the end of the day just do what works for you and um and on both sides of it for the for the people who are natural us saying oh girl it's all real it's all real it's all real it's all real gives a little bit of Shame and then for the people who are bbl's um laughing at the people who ain't got it you know whatever it's like it's the shaming that goes around who's better than the other person I wish that it can go back to the days where it was a little bit more and it's not but I wish that it can go back to the days where it was a little bit more girl I'mma rewear this outfit three times this week because I nobody saw me in it I'm I'mma rock this body this fits me I nobody told me that hey Rebecca those pants are a little too baggy because when I looked into the mirror I thought it looked great on me like you know that type of vibe we're not GNA get there anymore body dysmorphia is a very big thing for a lot of people both men and women um body dysmorphia is huge it's a problem um and I think that I don't know it's people mentally we all mentally are messed up when it comes to that FD you were talking about how when the beard Trend came out you just really wanted to get your beard going you were online and you would see like damn his beard is sexy Lord why what Lord I see what you've done for others and it's like you know we go to we got to focus on loving ourselves because can get real tricky out here man it can get real tricky out here so can I um because I I got to be up out of here like 230 245 is we got to get to Camala cuz I ain't talk to nobody are we still try talk did y already do it did I miss it episod Leng because no cause cause Olay I disagree with you about her losing I got a whole video dropping probably tomorrow and I wanted I wanted to pick your brain let's talk about it I saw that you I saw what you said and so I went to call like my expert like who who do the stuff to be like am I tripping based on what all of the black people online's level of like and especially like the white liberal you know everybody's so excited and acting like oh this is this is a slam dunk I was like am I tripping and they confirmed to me that I'm not um they're like no I really think I'm like you listen I'm not saying that she's that that she's going to lose definitely or anything like that but I do think un have gotten carried away with not recognizing that there is still very much so an uphill battle and I think people are mistaking that it's easy to be that yes she has better chances than Joe Biden that does not mean that she has that in the [ __ ] bag and I think people are like like I'm just like listen I want people to be be hopeful be optimistic there is nothing wrong with that I have a problem with people acting like people who want to consider they precedent precedent you know what I mean and and and how the precedent and and and be and be cautious and think you should [ __ ] prepare I'm like first and foremost people need to act like they know K ran for president before they need to act like they [ __ ] remember and she was got the [ __ ] up out of there off rip all right not a very desirable candidate and let's not act like organically or authentically people would be inspired and excited for a comma Harris that's one two a lot of who the left is is who and who are upset with a Biden Administration are unwinable because they they will impute Biden's Administration to comma right so there's that right there are uh uh and I don't think it's go a lot is gonna be I also think Donald Trump is who people count and people can count out too quickly because I remember I thought the santis would have had it in the bag for the nomination I thought like once upon a time ago I thought for sure and a lot of people did [ __ ] ain't nothing to goo or whatever like last I can't remember his name half the time I be like the before not saying she's raising she is I'm I'm I'm always I want her to win I think I want her to win I think she is raising a [ __ ] ton of money I think obviously you see black women and on and people kind of come out and do this this and the next thing for her and y y but I still want yall to remember that this is America and I think a lot of us like are in like our own particular bubbles we talk into a lot of our own type I also think there's a lot what I really don't like is when you talk about a lot of the prejudices and a lot of the obstacles that she's up a gangs and a lot of the narratives the left not the left I let me don't even say the left but the Democrats voter base and liberals and stuff are behaving as though that's just the right they're like why are you focus on with the racist and the Republicans gonna say why the do you think those people only exist on the right like why do you think that I'm so sorry I'm like I didn't just let I didn't just wake up in New York I lived in Florida I lived in West Virginia I lived in Ohio before I moved here I know what America like I went to high school in West Virginia I know plenty about this mother country okay I I know these narratives I've seen it before and I have caught myself slipping buying into your [ __ ] before like I I I thought Hillary had this [ __ ] in the bag too had me looking dumb crying in my car all I'm saying I'm not saying when I say when I bring up the reasons why I do not think organically a candidate like K can win and I said in my video I said that I said when I right after I said that I said you know I'm not so sure you know uh uh that it's actually even the case these might be her best circumstances being able to become it's with the back of the in the wall and I and I believe that they would never want KLA in a normal in a normal time we know this so that's not act crazy not play crazy I'm just saying prepar that that's what's so interesting to me is the turnaround by not just so like most most most folks are already like she the same person she was when she was vice president Camala Harris but it is what it is I take over by it but the the sudden eruption especially and the rec I like to hear what you what you're seeing in Atlanta what I've seen among my peers is Obama in 2012 energy it's really blowing my mind um because like I remember in 2016 everybody remembering that she was a cop you know what I'm saying I remember her being not so much like she's not she's not Joe Biden but she doesn't have like that immediate gravitas that would explain the energy that she suddenly have but it's just to me so interesting to see how quick the the the black Excellence brunch crowd has um acted like this was where we was going the whole time this what we've been waiting for go ahead it's because people are are not people are products of their conditions right like we tell a story about history that all about biography the conditions are are developing this version of Kamala and so that's actually what we're seeing it's not it's not like her DNA changed overnight the conditions are allowing us to be reintroduced to this version of Kamala and what I would say is like look like me and Ne we work in politics every single day I can't tell you if she's going to win or she's going to lose but what I will tell you is that the prospects of Victory have changed and momentum is actually a real thing and so the fact that we're hearing people who most time most days they're not interested in politics now they're talking about politics now they're interested those people are not they're underrepresented in polls they're underrepresented in the electorate and so if those people that momentum continues you will see outcomes that won't be reflected in polls and you will see outcomes that won't be reflected in whatever the voter models might say because these are what what people might call you know low propensity voters right folks are going to show show up folks in the culture are going to show up differently if they're able to bring that momentum into it the other thing I'll say is that if kamla runs an excellent race it means that the election will be close and we always thought the election will be close which means the things that folks who are actually doing Grassroots organizing in the ground that aren't Democrats like the Working Families party and other folks that aren't kamla with the capital K those conversations and will actually matter in places like Pennsylvania because the margin is going to be maybe 10,000 maybe 20,000 that's what I'm saying like do y' y'all see kamla winning Ohio Michigan like Florida places or whatever like Georgia like I think all I'm saying is y people are mistaking again Vibes are nice momentum is great all these different things but you're also hearing that and getting that from your own sphere you know what I mean your own world right like I think a lot of because I just had this conversation for the episode that's going to come out Sunday with Garrison and everybody and Garrison said similar to ufd right like I'm seeing that like Obama 2012 energy and like here's my thing one I guess I have a different when I think of Obama like Obama's Obama is basically the Michael Jackson a polit of of political like like impact how people felt no swear to God like that's how people felt about Obama and as somebody who was like in the Bahamas like like or just come to America right or whatever so I got to see like my first instinct was how the an entirely different country felt about Obama you were were buying Obama shirts off the street in nassa or whatever so like to me I'm like listen I know I might feel like that and and and and it is she is raising a [ __ ] ton of money she's mobilizing a [ __ ] ton of black people nobody's taking that I want that to happen but I don't think it's no Obama energy I so I want to be clear I'm making the distinction obama2 versus Obama 08 and that's two different that's two different version I still don't think it's 12 Obama energy it's it's it's good as someone who like 2008 was my first ction and I actually I what I would I would disagree with that and say that like I think it is better than 2012 energy I was in Florida organizing I'm one of the co-founders of the Dream Defenders so I was in Miami and that was you know I thought FL I thought I did not see the level of energy because here's the thing when we when when Maurice even was said about the conditions changing they memed Trump into the presidency they literally did they memed Trump into the presidency and I have not seen even since even Bernie this level of in different internet spaces Real Housewives fans and I do fandom organizing where Housewives fans are talking about her it's coming up in Star Wars chats with Star Wars fans are the worst and I got a Ewok tattoo like it is Happ in these people where people are organized I see this in a way that I have not seen it since Trump 2016 like period I no candidate and I think part of it is because like me the the minute that that photo came out ofum with the blood and whatever whatever we think about that I broke down crying I said it's over it's a wrap um I got to think about how we protect ourselves from Project 2025 and I think a lot of people had that sentiment like literally even people who I know I mean I was in Florida this month at Tampa people who I know who are not political we like it's a rap you know y'all are done like and people who don't have a thing so I think that that kind of shift is really important and then the and then the reality is just like I've not seen this much and I know the internet is a bubble but the as many bubbles and I have not seen this much through like across like athlete spaces people on women's basketball talking about it people who like you know the watch women sports crew the like there's like nerds talking about it now finally for the first time there's like the swifties are organizing and like these are real groups of people who have a who have who have a base but also can like shift stuff I mean swifties thought that they were going to take down Ticket Master and said that capitalism was going to end and that's a huge jump to go for so to me I mean I'm not saying it's a guaranteed of course it's never a guaranteed it's like progress is possible it's not guaranteed um and I do think that like we live in this country where like either way also even if KLA wins we gonna see some sort of January 6 thing or something else right so I'm not say right like I just think I just fundamentally believe that we've had the best shot that we've had in a really long time to finally put some of some of the some of the stuff to bed um that's happening on the other I want it to happen like I said we have to we have to fend off project 2025 I just want people to also I like I I think being so hype and I just I I'm like all right all right I think I think this hype maybe I'm a negative [ __ ] right I I want to be clear I'm not necessarily hyped over Camala specifically I'm just like what I'm saying oh I'm G let you let say this and then I'm G give yall the floor because I've been saying that all week I'm a right from the beginning that had a problem with her and and even in this past um Administration with uh Biden many things that she said what what how she um denounced things and didn't denounce this and how a lot of her commentary uh towards um black people and then the hate crime bill that came out then her saying that America was not was not racist all of these things telling a a group of Migrant people uh don't come like I remember don't I a forget I didn't forget I didn't forget how she kind of stood idle with um her Rec her her recent conversations um just recently with you know uh the mentioning um the Hamas and just recently I still hear those things right but right now we're just in such a tight space I have no time to keep nitpicking we didn't know that we were going to get another option fast Biden right so to say that it's going to be easy I love that we had that energy it was actually 08 energy for me when everybody was mobilizing in that day because back in 08 when we was doing that for um Obama it was a big deal black people were getting together black people were the first to get together black women were the first to get together on a damn Zoom call and set right the set the Precedence for everybody else to do the same thing they doing a white man call I think tomorrow or something every group is literally getting together on a zoom call to do all the stuff to raise money to try to make sure they get her in there I like what I'm seeing but I do agree with you ol not in that she can't do it but it's gonna be hard so we don't get the opportunity because she's because she is minority because she's a woman and we know how America already views her she's a woman America don't like women okay she come from immigrants we know how they feel about that so and then you know she represents as black or or or Indian they don't care a whole fact that she she represents that they're going to make it so difficult no matter what they're going to make it so hard so we got to do more work we can't sit in the party all day and and just be holding up pom poms like we got I need to say a whole bunch of negative things let me let me be a negative pessimistic ass [ __ ] itic because I got a check my job to I love you my love by let me say a bunch of negative things just so I just so we I could say I said it first of all I said months ago when everybody before the same mother that are online now like beat the comma drums I swear to God it was the sing people bitching me out when I was saying from General oh that we still needed you still needed to vote for the Democrats or whatever because this is the situation with Donald Trump and Yad Yad y right I said ages ago because it's not about I said ages ago that it's about weak but voting for the weakest adversary right now everybody now everybody talking point is exactly that that was about who you who was easier to organize it's crazy how nobody six months ago I said that [ __ ] now everybody's talking point or whatever it say but let me just say this I have a bunch I have I have I have a I have a bunch of problems with all this hype that's around Kamala one I think I I think one everybody's being like listen but I've actually heard people being like Trump is incredibly easy to beat anybody could Jo anybody but Trump anybody but Trump if y'all truly believed that if y'all believ that or if the nation believed that you wouldn't have pushed Biden the out the race in the first place if you believed anybody but Trump can beat him we just got rid of it because we know it isn't truly anybody but Trump so that's one right like you just watched Trump despite everything that Trump has on him impeachments insurrections criminal convictions all kind of [ __ ] being a idiot bigot fool clown and still the if you think a nation could decide all out and whatever crazy bigotry you talking about let's focus on on um Joe Biden being a all out of hir like you know what I mean that's gonna be the focus here we decide that that is worse than than than having this then please don't be misled to believe this nation will not like uh uh focus on some [ __ ] [ __ ] on KLA or some stupid [ __ ] that have a problem with that that's one I want to say this two kamla I want kamla to win I want whoever they wanted to win because like I said I believe that we should have the weakest adversary right that being said KLA what KLA offers is a more competent version of Joe Biden's Administration I don't understand why intelligent people are play I feel like I'm in a movie where they like in in Men In Black raid you eyes like suddenly you believe overnight he's the VP of this Administration if you don't like they're doing on Gaza if you don't like what they're doing on these things or whatever like stop deluding yourself to believe like this is about what you're going to see over the next few months is about you analyzing strategy you know what I mean about people making a play and how they present it to you like I had tweeted oh kamla not go into the the the Congress to the speech by Nan yahu and go to to uh talk to Zeta F beta was a was well played that's not me saying I believe the [ __ ] is is is pro Palestine now or anything like that I'm talking wellplayed strategy Optics what you going to get we're in a dangerous the problem I have with the excitement it's like listen have fun vote do what you need to do I want KLA to win but the problem I have is people are like truly putting their back into it like they think they're going to be off with something different than Joe Biden's Administration if we already have the attitude now that oh we can't ask anything we can't nitpick now we can't say nothing we can't whatever whatever whatever because we got to put her in when after you get and you get your Joe Biden Administration what people can say other than like well we knew and D it didn't I just think I'm the thing is Rebecca not you Rebecca you have sense you could whatever I'm not talking about you I'm just saying in general like that is how I know people are going to give it up yeah so so I I just want to jump in have so many things to say about this but yeah number one I think we can do both and like you know me and Nell we we are all about this block and build strategy that you have to do both and so we we're going to articulate what our strategy is over the next few days but we are 10 toes down on pal rights on a ceasefire and we also are with a full chest saying we have endorsed VP Harris and let us explain to you why let us explain to you why because she happens to be the person who is leading the pro-democracy front not not because we like her or we love her or because because she happens to be the person who is leading the pro-democracy front and so if you want to defeat Maga electorally we have to align around the strategy and there's so many things about the Biden Harris Administration around immigration around Gaza that we have serious critiques about and we could hold those critiques while we make sure that they get elected before and after the election right and and also it's just the reality that in in a trump Administration they are Consolidated around anti-black anti-palestinian anti-immigrant the Democrats they are not Consolidated around that there is a debate inside there so there's struggle that could be had there like Point Blank but then around the critiques look we we should not allow any slander Any Lies any misinformation disinformation but at the same time we should say absolutely critique her record absolutely challenge her on public policy absolutely engaged but based on facts I think we could hold those two things you know right and I love and I and I tweeted y'all's position because I thought it was excellent like I thought y'all conveyed like it like excellent like I completely agree I think what I'm having the issue I don't think my let me be clear what my quam is I don't think should be the priority right now I don't think be addressing my quam this is just a quam I have in my soul that I just want to have said so when we inevitably honesty yes when everybody in two years from now said it like I I don't think it should be the priority night right now and I said that in my video I don't think a priority we need her but the issue I'm I have in my soul is the fact I'm watching people because they want her and you want and I get it because I'm a black woman I don't like seeing a competent and educated black woman at this be attacked and disparaged and all these [ __ ] misogynist racist fronts and all of this right um but what people are doing now is now you becoming Pro prosecutor now you think like oh because you you call somebody a progressive prosecutor and it changes what a prosecutor fundamentally does like you see people like I'm getting comments from from people swoll in the chest you know what I mean like to even to try to even like rewrite and spin like the things that aren't good and and and the reality is people inspiration people who people cons consider inspirational figures or somebody being being considered the first woman president the first black woman or whatever that has a major impact and I don't personally believe I'm literally in a middle a knee deep in an alarna production about how I believe you know hash black excellence in the rise all these these these uh Pro black like tough on crime black black elected officials and some of the worst things that happen to us so I do think there is a long-term dangerous problem of the impact the inspiration that will be had by a figure like this ascending that's just but I don't think PRI that we have to remember her past and this is something that I think is like like a lot of my mentors who used to do direct action for rainforest Action Network and Ruckus she used to go to Ruckus society's fundraisers like we also have to remember like I think that that's important too I'm not saying because like I could there are so many people that I could not give a you know I don't stand any politician never have never would even if we've endorse them I do it for the strategy and never stand any politician like I don't stand a celebrity but like I do think we have to remember just say kind of the time space and condition of where she was who she was who she was because for me I think it's really important to just like actually have that history and also important to understand on Gaza this is the thing they edited Her speech in January she wanted to say a bunch of things she said ceasefire they told her not to even if it was six week ceasefire even if it was all this stuff so to me I'm not saying that like she she changed overnight I think that she just reads people and she read the room Biden know doesn't know how to read the room and he just like and that's like a A plus and benefit of him right like and you golf right like I she could just read a room I think she just knows how to read a room I don't think it's because she was compelled to all the time right I just think she's like look this is the heat on the street this is what's going on this is the te I'm gonna respond in this way and so that to me again I think that that's why we're when we're saying the better organizing terrain that's what I'm always about I just actually think that she's gonna read a room better and actually respond to stuff in a different way that I do not think like let me jump in real quick let me jum in real quick um so so one thing I will I will give credit to I think she had one of the like most Progressive voting records in the Senate before running for president she had that to her name that may have been I I remember hearing that beyond that though something especially to to you I don't I don't mention name uh nelen and Maurice folks that are in organizing the thing that I want to be about or at least want to put some energy behind is learning from Obama CA what what's most surreal to me as a person who like like many men and women my age openly wept in '08 when Obama became president and just knew that [ __ ] was about to change Yad y yada and that by 2012 was like oh okay this is way more complex than I thought it is maybe I should reread this this wretched of thee book that I scammed in undergrad to F to pass a quiz and that has become much more radical today and it's kind of like me on electoral politics I what I do think and and frustrated by especially after catching some of the same Flack that oay called about our video in November that feels like it's weirdly come full circle oh hold it hold it hold it hold it I will say some some of the same folks that hated that video still hated but like a lot more people are like yeah this is a great idea lot of people kicking my back in are re literally just re so weird let me let me finish this last point the one thing so there's something somebody I don't remember who told me told me this when it was looking more Bleak they was like look you need to uh set a goal for four years from now and you need to be working towards that goal and and whatever energy you was gonna spend online arguing about Vote or not vote uh um third party or no third party whatever because in reality so little of this [ __ ] we talk about and fight about online matters yeah I do think there's something to the uses of the world especially those of us with larger platforms instead of like making a ton of electoral um argument cont content maybe pulling in those people with a little bait and switch and then sending them towards like explicit organizing goals when Lenny was talking about how do we organize to protect us from Project 2025 Maurice I don't remember the organization you pointed you you just mentioned a second ago but y'all are talking about like real actual tangible [ __ ] that's way more important than if I get drug on Twitter for saying Vote or don't V so I have to say make sure y'all send me your [ __ ] because cause cause cause I I don't know when it's coming I it might do a right win like I I have a video in my head it's either gonna be now that Kamala is president what do we learn from Obama or now that Trump is President how do we say like one of those two things and it's gonna hopefully be getting away from electoral politics and listen can nobody say all me don't do H can you see them I brought them right here right from the Working Families party I showed you I talked to Jamal I show up at the events I speak for people nobody have my name in their mouth okay right right cause cause oh my God last thing last thing because I posted a relatively benign tweet yesterday it's my first tweet that's not about Drake in like months and all I said was I said watching Kamala the energy behind Camala is surreal it reminds me of Obama let the people have their moment there's gonna be teachable teachable moments in the aftermath and the way that these online leftists that ain't busted a grape in six years if they if they even more than 16 years old came from my head about how it's really important to be mean to them to to be mean to liberals on Twitter is such important practice right now bro you know what's crazy I'm getting you know what's crazy I'm getting the same ones who I swear were the I swear to God it's the same accounts that were giving me [ __ ] for even saying oh Vote or over Biden or whatever have you there's a difference between Biden and Trump and all of that they now cursing me I they I I actually feel like I'm being more proa than anybody should even expect from people who identify as a gangster you know what I mean in terms of ideology and like somehow they mad at the least little me just talk I'm not even I Am pro her I am merely speaking to the critiques that I think she's going to face and they're mad at me about that like that's not pro comma like I'm being negative or something let me jump in here because I feel like there's there's nuance and Olay I appreciate what you're saying because what we try to do is discipline our folks to not get caught up in IR rational exuberance and to be grounded strategist and there are no guarantees and so tell no tell no lies seese no easy victories we may lose we may win and you have to prepare for the worst but organized for the best always in every condition so I'm really happy that you're bringing these things up because if we assume that talking about the the challenges the gaps talking about our weaknesses is being a hater then we can't be critical thinkers and strategists and then we can't begin to shore up the places where we're weak so we actually have to have this discourse about and being honest about where there might be vulnerabilities and also always always plan for the worst the thing that I remember is in 20 in 201 17 18 I was flatfoot because I thought Hillary was gonna win and I was not prepared and we are I can tell you at the Working Families party we are prepared for a loss but we're organizing like hell for a win and the thing I want to say is that the reason why we're talking about block and build FD is exactly what you're talking about right so people who are excited about third parties we believe that this is a moment to talk to them about a grounded third party Solution that's not going to happen over week a week it's not going to happen over a month or a year or one election cycle but it could happen over a decade we have a particular strategy at Working Families party that is building from the ground up county by county state by State we're in 20 states that is a actual grounded serious third party solution not this like all right charismatic leader running every year Celebrity Status here's a reality show my presidential campaign here's all a podcast I'm gonna do nobody's gonna come and save you no no charismatic leader leader is gonna come and save you every four years you actually have to organize right and this is an opportunity while the masses are sort of enthralled by this idea of of a third sort of a third Force to actually educate folks on how they could do it but seriously and so I I definitely think this is an opportunity for that because when I think about sorry go it's important that like we understand the terrain and I think that that's really like when we say like you know what happened with Obama when we say what happened like like Bush was the formative experience of my life um and I I was in new like it was September 11th was my third day of high school at LaGuardia high school in Manhattan um and so like went through all of that had first respond have First Responders in my family um and yeah there was activity there was so much anti-war activity millions of people on the streets but we didn't really get much and then we got No Child Left Behind and all this stuff when like Obama becomes president we you have not one more Occupy Wall Street all of these things that had a much fertile ground that were much more radical that radicalized people like me because I was even in a different position and we had a much more you then then 2014 with Mike Brown and all this stuff like we had the space and not yes the National Guard came in sometimes but not at the level that they do when the rightwing is in control especially how how how we've come here and then Trump gets in and honestly everybody's like oh everybody was more aware I was fighting with folks because I'm sorry but if anybody says to me I will fight them about that more people were radicalized under Trump I think more people were liberalized because instead of we were doing Occupy Wall Street we were talking about class and stuff and then we have parades we were I was bused stuff down as as as I could say on the internet without cops coming after my butt but like you know what I mean even I was taking more radical action than doing the parades and I'm not like I'm not trying to knock anybody down who did that stuff because that might have been their first thing but let's not get it twisted that actually we became more liberal and the space for radicalization tricks that's the thing you're so right you're so right like I feel like someone actually said that to me today is this like like like accelerationist adjacent argument that like oh it's easier to organize under Trump or people were more outraged whatever he was like it was easier he this what they actually said to me I actually and I love this person this is one of my followers that uh but they said it because I sent it to to one of my friends in this thought process they were like the problem is that they responded to I actually to my post about job with the working familyes post they said the problem is that this ignores facts I know from my friends in streets in the in in the streets in places like DC White liberals protested with black people and radicals against Trump they went home when Biden won it's easier to organize when white Liberals are willing to align with us and I'm like you're not radicalizing anybody what is happening is if you I if you if you shoot a bunch of people in the street like you know what I mean if that's what it is like a lot more people will will will object to that then they will punching somebody you know what I mean like if you keep reaching out the bounds you're not actually moving anybody further left you're just raising all that's happened when we have Republicans is they're just doing more wild [ __ ] and people are are react to yes people are reacting to that and more outrage by that but they're just staying status quo that's the again and that was recognized in Trump in the first place and how we got Biden because the reason that people wanted Joe Biden was because it felt familiar they thought Biden was a relic from the Obama years they felt like the world had drastically changed America because of Donald Trump in 2016 and they wanted to get back to the basics they didn't want to get to a this future or anything they hadn't moved left they wanted yester year yeah and that's why I think it's to when I think again this this a lot of this is self-centered but like I think about how well much I've moved certain folks in my circle and just even folks that's not directly in my circle but just observing the progression that folks have had since Obama because we have the bad taste in our mouth of like feeling like we drunk the obam Kool-Aid and got like cod uh cod liver oil and so like my whole thing has been not trying to shut down the the the super you know left folks online and folks that's disgusted at you know celebrating and raising millions of dollars for Kamala the prosecutor and the same week where we do have um the woman that got shot in Chicago and like the cognitive distance of that like all of that has it doesn't like when people say two things to be true at once like that's not a choice like those things just are true at the same time in the moment and but but what isn't written in stone yet is that there's a generation of people that have seen this play before and have are and now get to uh give the play to like nobody could give us the play when I I think I'm older than everybody in here like nobody could give me the play in' 08 about what was about to happen probably a couple of people but like not a lot whereas now there's a lot of people that know this play and so like my my attitude is you know what I'mma chill and I'm I'mma see if I can come up with the because entropy is here regardless I'm not going to stop either one of these [ __ ] getting to office but I'mma chill I'mma develop the play and I'mma make sure that Playbook is handed to as many people as possible so that even if it doesn't like you said it's not a it's not a six-month thing you know shout out to all these folks talking about Jill Stein 2024 um but the real work is in between I'm sorry the roll hold on I gotta go I just wanted I want to drop thata shade I agree with you FD but the all of that every I think everything everybody's saying is true the work that's been done the work that we've been that we've done in the time of Obama when be after that when we were trying to mobilize for a all these better positions we've done it online if you're an activist everybody has done it so there is that kind of wear and tear and it's like my thing is we I don't don't believe in people not holding her ass accountable when she does get in office but we got such a short window of time if we're focusing on trying to win they win souls and bring them to the polls uh then we can't push them away so we're trying to really do this I'm being selfish right now for me I want to make sure that I have a future I got something to do for me my family all this other stuff so that's what I'm thinking about I'm thinking about having an opport being able to have an opportunity and I do agree with you that when she does go in this is a woman who is going to be a byproduct of the b um the Biden Administration so we're just going to get a remix of the Biden Administration so to expect more something drastically different from from that is going to be wrong but when she gets in there we got an opportunity we got a chance we got a chance to start building somebody else up in those four years for when her ass is out so that we can doing a better like just doing it differently than having this whole mess that we had to deal with now I'm let that I'mma let that be the last word anyway like oh two two things that we could do in order to do it differently in order to learn from Obama is num number one if she wins then stand on business day one you can't just because she's a black woman let up even a little bit an inch if we we talk about trust black women if you trust that black woman to actually be in a leadership position then hold her accountable keep keep her accountable to all of those pledges and organize against her or organize with her if if she's align with us but organize against her if we think that she's not aligned with us right number one and number two exactly what you said do the work over the next four six eight years to build the actual future that we want so we won't be flat footed yes what' you say uh prepare for the worst organize for the best okay those bars okay real rap bars with that [Music]
