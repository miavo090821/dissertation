She told her sister she was done having kids…so she had earned her mommy make-over. The surgeon was a friend of the family, so the trust was just there. She came home from surgery with “no issues”….went to bed. When her husband checked on her, she wasn’t breathing. The poor woman was brain dead from lack of oxygen. It was so tragic, I could hardly stand it.  They had her on life support for a few days, but her “care directive” dictated that she did not want to be kept alive once pronounced brain dead. I am not privy to how they dealt with the doctor, as he was so close to the family. All I know is that a healthy woman died after building such a beautiful life. I still think about that woman all the time. She is the reason I am still a 32B. \n\nI’m built for speed! 😂 Small booty, small chest….aerodynamic…and I can swin like a SHARK…lol. Just wanted to end on a positive note. 💖",

I hate how people project their perceptions as things people push out (vibes) versus things to people actively read onto others. I'm too autistic for this bullshit 😅. Just let me gender in peace and forget that others perceive me no need for reminders. \n\nOne key difference i see in getting work done is there's gender affirmation and then there's gender conformity. It's very difficult to seperate and often you can't. With cis folk conforming to trends it's clear they are conforming to some manufactured beauty ideal under the patriarchal white gaze, even if that's not there goal the gaze persists. Even so there are cis people who feel dissonance in their appearance and gender, more cis women get hair removal than trans woman ( in total not percentage obviously). On the other hand trans people even if we're doing the best to just affirm ourselves and chase euphoria we can't escape survival under a colonial binary. There's always a pressure to conform out of survival than actual desire. And a lot of those colonial standards be racist as hell, I think the Williams sisters are amazing athletes and beautiful and even their gender is precarious under white supremacy. Makes it a lot easier to throw up my hands and say fuck it I'll do my own thing.",

One gets real tangible rewards—money, jobs, relationships, visibility, passing, etc—based on their looks. AND one also gets treated with respect (although it can be superficial and short-lived). \n\nBeing “ugly” wouldn’t be so bad if one wasn’t dismissed, ignored, passed over, and treated like sh*t. We don’t have to talk badly about each other. Men don’t have to ignore the ugly girl while they address the cute one. Kids shouldn’t be ostracized because of their features or class (which are things they don’t have control over anyway). Being told that you’re not worthy of anything—people’s interest, time, kindness, let alone a job or other elevating responsibility—because you’re not “attractive” is heartbreaking. \n\nWho and what is attractive will always be subjective but basic human decency and respect should not be.",

(aside from the increased danger of black market surgeries, a BBL is also a surprisingly dangerous procedure in general. there are a lot of blood vessels in your butt and even experienced practitioners can puncture a vessel and cause clotting or accidentally insert small amounts of filler into the bloodstream.) I also hope that adding informed consent into the discussion will help make a more comfortable and less disparaging environment to discuss anti-Black beauty standards with the women subjected to them. it feels safer to talk about a problem when you're not going to be judged for how you're trying to protect yourself from it.

    "text": "In an anthropological sense- human beings have been disfiguring their faces and bodies in the name of beauty since as long as humans have been around. Humans have always reveled in beauty and sought after it. However- it's really interesting what beauty standards have become sans the creation of the internet. Even in the early 2000s your beauty standards were fairly localized. Magazines and movie stars still very much influenced what you wanted to emulate- but you still paid attention to the stars and the movies that those around you liked. Your access to those outside of what the majority of your region liked was limited. For better or for worse- those limitations have been completely blown open.\n\nNow the barrier to entry to beauty is much higher than it's ever been. Rather than competing with the beauty standards in your town or city, your interests or even your specific race (I'm Polynesian, we had differing beauty standards to, for example, Sweden.)- you're in constant competition with everyone in the world. \n\nI was also a hardcore/punk kid for most of my formative years- so the beauty standards that I felt compelled to adhere to were that of those in that community- further \"localizing\" my eye for beauty. But with social media the lines of what I find beautiful can be blurred as I'm constantly bombarded with what the new \"beautiful\" is, pulling from an amalgamation of specific beauty standards from around the world. \n\nThose beauty standards in the past were not by comparison \"more pure\" or \"better\" as most contemporary beauty standards are just plain racist, colorist, anti-Black etc. But it is undeniably Different than the beauty landscape we're traversing now. \n\nJust really interesting stuff is all! thanks to everyone for this dialog and their perspective!",

So much has been reflected on while listening and watching this brilliant panel. @Rebecca Azor you my Azor Ahai @Olay you like that GOT reference. Lol.  Queen Azor you always shine with 🔥 because YOU OWN your beauty and sexiness.  That is REAL and I'm here for you and It.  @Olay I'm 5'0 Mayne 5'1 wirh Double Ds.  I've NEVER had kids and I've binded them for awhile.  I can confidentially say how much I appreciate my natural very womanly yet no damage to my nipple large breast.  I am.VERY proud of them and appreciate those that look.  Is that bad?  They are real and I'm proud and in my late 40s.",

We shouldn’t just care about our government when it’s time to vote for a president. We should be caring about what’s happening locally and holding all of our politicians’ feet to the fire to make sure that what we need gets done. When/if Kamala gets into office that doesn’t mean we relax, it means that’s even more reason to stay on her ass and her administration’s ass about our needs. Strategy is key. We need to be strategic with how we vote, what we’re voting for, and how we’re going to hold our politicians accountable once they’re in office. Love this vid! I’m 23 Olay, so vids like this are so important for my generation to see. We need to know what the generations before us have done and what y’all are still doing so we know how to move in the future.

It was the shaving down of the teeth that was focused on saying that now they have chickadees/chickpea (not sure what exact words were use but it was some kind of name calling). It’s making fun and calling people dumb for doing it. Oral surgeons have done veneers for quite some time, it’s unsafe when you go to basement dentist not so much with actual doctors. You should be focusing on the basement dentist not the people who want to get veneers as there is nothing wrong with wanting veneers. It’s their teeth. Similar sentiment as “you’re destroying your body with tattoos” to me its based in  aesthetic reasoning first.\n\nEdit: they said chiclet , referring to boxy teeth never heard that word before, either way it’s still name calling. I don’t think some tattoos look great but hey have fun it’s your body.

I have a perspective about an aspect presented in the video and you started to talk about how tattoos are less risky than veneers which I know. I’m not sure what made you think I was saying tattoos were exactly like veneers the opinion I had was: Someone’s approach to a subject was similar to an approach on another similar (not exactly the same ) subject.",
