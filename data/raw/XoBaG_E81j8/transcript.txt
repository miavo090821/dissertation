speaking of channels that I've been enjoying lately Glenn greenwald's system update is a really fantastic show he's not a socialist or communist but he's a real principled journalist um he's definitely left leaning and Progressive and um a staunch Free Speech Advocate was one of the people who was critical of big Pharma during covid critical of lockdowns and things like that so um really principal journalist who's been at it for a long time he's super sharp um and here he's going to take take down Ben Shapiro's defense of the bombing in Yemen of course Ben Shapiro has just been absurd um on the issue of Israel Palestine just what I mean Israel could do anything and and Ben Shapiro would defend it and he would find a way to blame homas for it so and he has articles from uh decade or two ago basically legitimizing uh the genocide of the Palestinians explicitly that's something lowy Shar casualties are okay with me was the title of one article yeah [Music] craziness if you look at those let's say four key prongs of Biden's foreign policy Ukraine Israel Yemen and China The Establishment wing of the Republican Party the dominant wing of the Republican Party represented in the presidential race by Nikki Haley and in the Congress and the Senate by people like Lindsey Graham and Marco Rubio and Tom Cotton are fully on board with all of those policies the policy toward China has been to militarily encircle it to put bases in places like South Korea and Japan and the Philippines and off various Islands to essentially militarily en Circle the Chinese Biden was the first president in decades to explicitly State the US would go to war with China in order to defend Taiwan and almost all of these foreign policy HS the core one which is such an insane thing to say by the way we're GNA go to war with China in order to defend Taiwan which is part of China okay that def find the Biden approach to the world have received Applause from the vast majority of the Republican party which supported the war in Ukraine which obviously supports the US uh paying for and arming of Israel which supports the bombing of Yemen and which supports an antagonistic and aggressive posture toward China here is bencho yesterday just as one example who spent 15 minutes or so on his program justifying and cheerleading the decision of the V Administration to bomb Yemen not just the act of bombing Yen but the rationale for it now obviously bench buau is somewhat of a special case because he is somebody who has long wanted the American armed forces to be used to fight against Israel's enemies it's something that is a very consistent part of his worldview but it's not like he's operational in that regard there are a lot of people who believe that the United States should devote everything it can its resources its bombs its military to seeing the World Through The Eyes of Israel to see Israel's enemies as the United States's enemies and so obviously what the H is saying we're against the destruction of God and what's interesting is one of the critiques that I heard Tucker Carlson making of Ben is like you claim to be a conservative you claim to be an American conserv conservative or an American Patriot but clearly his Zionism comes before his his loyalty to America which is supposed to be you know number one for the conservatives is their loyalty to the US you know sort of um nationalism um but he instead is saying that the US should put themselves at the the service of Israel and they should act you know as a military arm of Israel and it's it's just um absurd and and it's caused him to be criticized by Tucker Carlson um Joe Rogan and even Candace Owens so even conservatives have looked at his Ultra Zionist talking points and arguments since the um since October 7th and they've kind of been discusted by it Gaza were taking retaliation against Israeli ships and American ships bench be's thrilled that there are now combat troops of the United States armed forces now actively fighting in the Middle East against one of Israel's enemies not just the houthis but in bench be's eyes on arm of Iran the Ultimate Enemy of Israel that neocons and warmongers have long wanted the United States to fight remember at the start of the war in Israel people like Lindsey Graham and ni were saying let's bomb Iran Lindsey Graham recently said let's bomb Iran off the map and so this obsession with going to war with Iran has long been a centerpiece of traditional Republican Bushi kind of Mitt Romney uh foreign policy that would fit perfectly comfortably into the GOP establishment prior to Trump which they're eager to bring back so here's Ben I think it's worth going through a few excerpts of what he said again in defense of the administration's decision to launch a new war against one of Israel's enemies so last night centcom as well as a bunch of other foreign countries part of American Alliance struck at Targets in Yemen they struck the hoodies the hoodies are a ragtag group of terrorists who have taken over a large swath of Yemen after a massive civil war between the hoodis and the Saudis over control of the country the Iranians been funding the hoodies for years and years and years we'll get into the history of what EXA can you pause that real quick Eddie you know it's interesting how the the label of terrorists gets thrown around because uh up until maybe a few days or or weeks ago the ansar Allah you know the houthis weren't considered terrorists they were readded to the terrorist list conveniently enough when they participate in in these uh great actions in order to um try to do what they can uh to prevent the Israeli genocide of the Palestinian people so it's uh it's another one of those uses of the word terrorist um to just attack whoever ends up being an enemy of us imperialism has nothing really concretely to do with Terror one of the stories that we'll talk about today is how uh the leading terrorist Force Isis is being propped up by uh the US in order to fight against uh the axis of resistance that's uh creating itself and uh in in in the Middle East and being led in many ways by Yemen for sure and the Oxford dictionary definition of terrorism is just the unlawful use of violence and intimidation especially against civilians in pursuit of political bles and what does that sound like more um besides Zionism um and and what Israel's been doing in the past few days but of course they invert reality and call the people who are fighting against Israel the terrorists to say the reason that all this is happening right now is because the hoodies decided that they were going to try to act as an Iranian proxy arm and generate support for Iran by attacking Israel and then by more largely attacking shipping in the Red Sea now shooting off a few Rockets or missiles that Israel to get down by American ships or by the Saudis that really didn't have much of an impact on World opinion or On The World At Large but attacking ships in the Red Sea absolutely does okay he's exactly right he's seeing the world through the Israeli perspective he's saying the motive of the yenis is to strike back at Israel as punishment for what they're doing in Gaza so the question yet again becomes how is that an American war the yeis haven't killed anybody they haven't sunk any American ships they have been trying to uh impede the flow of commercial travel through the Red Sea by some countries that they perceive as being responsible for and the thing too is the Red Sea borders Yemen right so they're stopping Commerce in order to to stop a genocide on their own border the US has sanctions on Iran sanctions on Venezuela um crippling embargos on the dprk in Cuba we go all around the world and stop Commerce stop All Imports with the explicit aim of destabilizing um those governments and those countries and making life harder for their people we go all around the world and do that and stop Global Commerce and we're just allowed to um and other countries have to go along with it because Western Finance Capital dominates the Global Financial system but then when the houthis block Israeli trade when Israel is doing a genocide on their own borders we freak out about it and and you know try and start a war with them and start bombing them it's it's the hypocrisy is is unreal yeah especially when you look at the international law that uh the US and basically every country in the world has signed on to the country that's perhaps acting the most in line with what you ought to be doing when there's a situation such as there is in Gaza are the yemenese um and it's that simple so uh they're uh bombing a country for doing the thing that international law requires of them to do which is do everything in your power to stop a genocide under the total hypocritical pretext of a blockade that affects only the ships that are are destined to help Israel while as you said the US is the the country that um sanctions and and blockades more Nations on on on the planet than anyone else and that literally steals ships you know we we saw a few years ago an Iranian ship filled with oil uh tanker ship that was heading to Venezuela just get stolen in an act of piracy by the US and uh recently a similar ship was stolen and then recaptured by the Iranians that's shows you how the tides have have kind of changed and the axes of resistance um has strengthened itself and the US can't really do what it did some years ago to anymore the isra war in Gaza but why does this mean that the United States now has to go to war because the houthis are angry about what the Israelis are doing this is something we talked about from the start that the cost of the United States was incurring in order to defend this foreign country yet again is not dis measured in the billions of dollars that we're going to spend to transfer to the Israelis nor in the already depleted stock piles we're going to use to transfer the weapons to them that they're using as everyone knows to destroy Yemen whenever there's a video of babies that are killed or children being operated on without anesthesia broadcast to the entire world everybody knows that it was American weapons that that did that and that bears a real cost but the biggest cost is the danger that we're going to now have the Ben peers of the world demanding and now getting and now celebrating the deployment of American troops in an actual fighting war in a shooting war against other Israeli enemies in the Middle East that's what we have and that explanation of his makes clear that that is actually the dynamic that he is happy about let's watch a couple other excerpts the prior year well all of this drove last night an Allied attack on certain resources in Yen controlled by the houthis it was a telegraphed punch meaning this entire exercise was designed to deter the hthis not designed to actually kill or destabilize the who in fact as we say are terrorist group that governs a large SWA part of Yen the reason Toph the attack is to allow Iranians to get their military forces out of the way so as not to provot and provoke some sort of escalation with Iran more directly because of course Iran has lots of forces on the ground helping out the hoodies in Yen now obviously needless to say anybody who dislikes Israel or who fights against Israel is a terrorist that's pretty much the it is an escalation against Iran it is he's acting like this isn't what he's trying to do is act like this isn't an action that could inflame a regional War um in the Middle East but it absolutely is that's what's so dangerous and so reckless about this um especially the fact that Biden bypassed Congress to go ahead with this bombing um is it inflames tensions and shortly after this happened we saw Iran firing missiles at US military positions in Iraq um so clearly Iran did take it as a threat as of of course they did it's the US getting more militarily involved um in their region to to fight against one of their allies for trying to stop genocide so yeah Shapiro's analysis is poop and uh you know just some days ago maybe a week or so ago Iran was bombed on the anniversary uh the fifth anniversary of the killing of Kasam suani you know the great General the Isis Slayer a unifier of the people of the region um and you know Isis claimed responsibility for it but as we'll see in one of the later segments of today's show um it's you know curious that all of isis's targets are uh the countries in the axis of resistance that are building up pressure to the US and Israel yeah and there are many people who believe that Isis is has always been you know an asset of mad in the US at least indirectly um if not directly you want to go with uh keep going for a while with this video Carlos or you want to move on yeah yeah I I mean I haven't seen it so I don't know if the if uh good stuff keeps uh if the good stuff keeps coming but yeah let's do one more clip I guess definition at this point any group that defies the orders of the United States or Israel is a terrorist organization and even though the H are now running and governing Yemen bench wants to call them a terrorist organization but as he just said it was a campaign that we had telegraphed for many weeks it was something that was very well planned everybody knew it was coming and that begs the question that we raised the segment of why bid Administration can not simply have gone to Congress to debate whether or not it was time to go start a new war a risk a new war in order to fight against one of Israel's enemies in the Middle East it should have been openly debated and voted on in Congress for exactly the reason Ben be just said there was no emergency there it didn't pop out out of nowhere the opposite was true it was very deliberate and we had weeks to plan it and threaten it which means we had ample time to have gone to Congress to debate it and to seek its authorization heow the of course say they're not going to be it reminds me of when Obama Justified putting sanctions on Venezuela by saying a threat to our national security which is just like laughable like the Venezuelan military is about to invade the United States as we're dumping millions and millions of dollars into the violent far-right Venezuelan opposition and starving them with sanctions they're threatening our national security it's the same with h the houthis you know the all the Republicans um and zionists are saying well if Israel doesn't fight the houthis and Hamas they'll come to the US no they won't um yeah but this is uh either way an extremely scary situation uh because there's so much potential for uh for escalating uh the houthi uh leaders have made it very explicit that they do not fear a direct confrontation with the US um they're ready to fight I mean they took on a Saudi uh genocidal war against them for for what seven eight years and and they came out with their heads up high uh ready to fight like hell for their pal inian brothers and sisters more than honestly anyone um in the Arab world uh so it's a very scary situation because we know that the houthis are are going to have to retaliate just on the basis of principle and the US can't just sit after it after a retaliation it can't just sit back with its hands in its pocket it's going to have to hit back again so it's it's it's a real uh complex and potentially very catastrophic situation that we have in our hands here simply because of the fact that the US wants to protect the interests of a country that literally the whole world is seeing commit genocide right before their very eyes and and and trying them in the international court of justice for doing so this works in the Middle East is that you have basically terrorist groups that provoke a respon from an overwhelming power they their asses absolutely kicked and then they claim that just because they survived they won that's what currently going on in Gaz stri Kamas provokes a gigantic Israeli military response largest isra military response to any attack since 1973 and they get their ass is absolutely handed to them and most of their Fighters killed and most of their leadership killed and then if they are breathing at the end of it they claim victory the hoodies are playing the same game it's it's really honestly cowardly sort of Stu he calls them cowards you know the Palestinians are cowards because they've been carpet bombed by Israel and they've lost so many people yet they've still managed to survive it's really cowardly stuff no you know what's really cowardly stuff is carpet bombing residential neighborhoods and then claiming Victory and then claiming that you had to do it to fight Hamas you know even more cowardly than that sitting like a chubby soft little [ __ ] in your news Studio at the daily wire and and talking about the people of Palestine like that and calling them cowards when you've never been in a fight in your life when you grab graduated from an Ivy League institution and you're paid good money to be a mouthpiece for Empire that's what's really cowardly stuff Ben Shapiro you soft little croissant turn to life a mouthpiece that has lip fillers by the way he does yeah you haven't seen the comparison videos of the younger Ben where it's just a straight you know lip and and then the lip fillers that he he's done no but that's hilarious yeah he has lip fillers [Laughter] wow pampered Ben howly stuff he's sitting in the studio making millions of dollars a year maybe millions of dollars a month oh Glenn's going to say the same thing as me I didn't make it to this point to cheer the deployment uh American troops in that region to defend the forign country that he acknowledges he has a great deal of loyalty to and love for the houthis are confronting the most powerful military in the world and are saying they're going to continue to do it because of the cause that they believe in which is trying to get impos after they've been bombed for nine years now by Saudi Arabia with us funded bombs and US funded Jets and still manag to survive and to the point where Saudi Arabia when the US was launching operation Prosperity Guardian they're like don't do it you can't beat the houthis we bound them since 2015 and they're still here yet Ben Shapiro with his butt lip um plastic surgery and lip filler getting paid millions of dollars in the daily wire Studio thinks they're cowards I mean it's unreal it's we live in a clown world po some cost on Israel in the United States for killing an enormous number of civilians in in in in Gaza and destroying civilian Palestinian life now whatever else you want to say about the hoies what they are doing is not Cowardly Cowardly is sitting in a studio sending other people to war for your pleasure or for your agenda that's cowardly spending your whole life demanding more and more Wars that you and your family never go fight that's Cowardly Cowardly is not what the H are doing whatever else you might want to think about them offici told the W Jal this is a brutal aggression I love this it's Brut who the official told the wall Jal this is a brutal aggression I love this it's a brutal aggression hon to God if America and its allies want to commot brutal aggression against the hoodies this guy would not be alive to talk about it so they will unded pay it price will not waver our stance to support the Palestinian people regardless of the cost after the Coalition strikes us had not seen any directory action directed toward us or other Coalition members in the Red Sea and again the strikes came with a lot of warning one week ago us Britain key allies issued an ultimatum saying stop it and then they didn't stop it and then on New Year's Day Biden convened his National Security team to discuss the options and then despite Coalition warning the H fired anti-is missile that fell into the water with sight of a commercial vessel now the houthis knew that the United States and his allies were going to strike all these targets and so they relocated some of their weapons and equipment and fortified others the question is whether this is going to deter further action from the hoodies the answer is probably not when you Telegraph punches like this it is very this is the kind of arrogance you get at the height of an Empire and collapse you know this idea that oh we could have gone in and destroyed the houthis if we wanted to well not really not really you've been trying since 2015 using Saudi Arabia and Israel as proxies and bombing the piss out of them guess what it's done it's infuriated the people of Yemen and allowed the houthis to recruit more because the houthis say guess what we want Economic Development we want the Western World out of here and we want Israel out of here you know we want us proxies to stop bombing us and when you're constantly getting bombed by Israel and Saudi Arabia on the United States that's an appealing message which is why the houthis have only grown in power since the US has trying tried to wipe him out but Shapiro is so ignorant he's so used to the us being the dominant unipolar force in the world and and backing Israel every step of the way that he thinks they could just wipe the hoot off the map at any point wipe Hezbollah off the map at any point but they can't and Israel can't wipe Hamas off the map at any point and these organizations have actually grown stronger in response to the extremely aggressive and murderous actions of um Israel the US and Saudi Arabia which have killed so many civilians which is we covered on the show last time um uh that journalist who in interviewed a Hezbollah fighter and she asked him why do you fight and he takes her to a mass grave and shows her all these children who are killed by you know a US air strike says this is why I fight wouldn't you fight if they were doing this to your home country you know so that's the kind of mindset um in how us aggression has is driven Recruitment and Ben Shapiro is just completely delusional about the situation he has no idea what what he's talking about or he's distorting it on purpose no they're just a steeped in Imperial huis and you know this isn't unique you go back to any Empire in Decay and you find something similar you know one of the most um relevant text in ancient uh Greek writings is pericles's funeral funeral oration um from fuses uh during the pelian war where he's talking about the greatness of his uh State and the superiority of its citizens over everyone else and how that superiority affords it the right to conquer and to do all these different things and to win and then they lose you know so it's I think it's a a clear case example of what we're seeing right now from the US I mean there hasn't been any actually successful um geopolitical maneuver that they've been able to to to finish they lost I think it's very clear to everyone that even blinkin was admitting it before the end of the the year that it's a loss uh in the proxy war against Russia um it's a loss against Afghanistan uh and I I think that if they're crazy enough to take up a fight against the access of of resistance in Western Asia it's very clear that they're going to lose absolutely let's see what B uh Greenwald says about this and we'll go to the next segment likely that is going to convince the hoodies to stop what they are doing no I agree with him there too this is very unlikely to be the end of this escalation this war is like going to go on which means we have a new Middle East War the question is for how long it will go on for how many more exchanges of violence will entail how many people will be killed how much retaliation will there be Ben be seems extremely unbothered by those questions on that should have been debated in Congress that we should still be debating now because what he wants is what he has that's why he's so happy namely the exploitation of the most powerful military in the world in defense of this foreign country and its deployment against his enemies but if you're somebody looking at from an American perspective those are to be of great concern to you he's saying this is almost certainly not the end of it just the beginning which means we now bought ourselves exactly the kind that Jo Biden running which is what um the same thing that Yahoo said on [ __ ] Christmas you know this is going to be a long War we're not anywhere near D this is going to take quite a while right um it's oh yeah and and he says he makes a same argument that I was saying Tucker Carlson made where he says you know this is not good for America if you're someone who cares about the United States you should be concerned about this but Shapiro is only only concerned about the US defending Israel and using their military forces to prop up Israel and attack their enemies and that that shows I think a crisis in super patriotism because these were the people that would have traditionally been the the ideological agents of super patriotism of that my country is always right sort of patriotism that parenti so eloquently critiques in favor of an actual you know proletarian uh socialist patriotism uh but these people are coming to see that there's literally no benefit for for the American people at large even for the a national American Bourgeois if there even is still one which I I think there is it's not very large but um it's just all these actions are always just done in the interest of Empire and the Global Financial big BW and it becomes evident to anyone that's even slightly bit concerned with America and and and the American people that none of these actions benefit us that we're sending billions abroad to kill literal [ __ ] children while our country is going to [ __ ] while we have in most major cities people just walking around in basically zombie towns while there's 60,000 people um that are dying from overdoses while there's 45,000 dying from lack of insurance while there's you know 600,000 uh wandering around uh as homeless and in a [ __ ] country has 33 times more empty homes than homeless people you the statistics can go on you can write a whole volume on how [ __ ] up the situation has gotten here in the US in terms of debt in terms of poverty in terms of an inability to to pay for the things they need to survive at the end of the month all the while this is happening um and we're sending billions and billions abroad so um you know the fact that Tucker cson is calling it out and and other people on the America first right it shows that there's there's perhaps a crisis in in super patriotism where the super Patriots are specifically the ideologues um are losing some of that my country is always right uh even when it affects my people uh ethos that it contained for a very long time b b could said it better myself
