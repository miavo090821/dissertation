Benjamin Netenyahu is the one who continually says there will be no Palestinian state. So when you agree to everything someone says and the country oppressing you has the backing of several of the worlds great powers for decades. What are you to do? Just sit back and accept it? The Israelis have made it clear that they do not want them there but won’t give them a country. Do think they were gonna just sit there forever and not be upset?",

Why do they continue shoot kids when they throw rocks? Or shoot people who were praying on the Gaza border during the protest when they moved the embassy to Jerusalem? Why did they just last month shoot a Palestinian worker from the American Red Cross who was out there giving aid to people who were injured? She was snipped from over 1000 yards. Now I don’t know about you but I was in the army so I know the amount of concentration that goes into picking a target like that, there’s no way he didn’t see her in the fucking Red Cross outfit helping people before he took the shot.

The way it’s interwoven and compared/contrasted with our countries politics is so interesting and very convincing as a way to show the true nature of America. I just can’t see why anyone would think Ben Shapiro’s overly simplistic and lacking in nuance take on this subject is a better or a more accurate representation of the subject than this video where Three Arrows goes through each part and breaks it down so that it’s easy to digest and when you put the pieces back together you can see the whole picture and understand the complexity of the subject, something that isn’t present in the way Ben Shapiro presents the issue to the audience. I’ve noticed this a lot in Ben Shapiro’s and other right wingers videos that I’ve watched as opposed to more left leaning videos like Three Arrows,Shaun or Renegade Cut etc.",

Another point some conservatives love to hammer down on. We can't shut down our economy to save them!

Infact it is actually dangerous for everyone. It's just not the same kind of risk. Yes 12 year old child will have a far lower risk of seeing severe issues or even dying compared to a 80 year old with breathing issues. However and this is something some people don't think about immunity would require about 70% of the population to be infected and recover. With a nation like the United States where looking at 250 Million people here. We also know that about 10-15% of all Corona cases will be severe ones. Regardless of age or conditions. So even young and healthy people can get pneumonia. Imagine  just 10% of 250 Million people ending up with pneumonia. And from a Virus that is not known. There is still a lot of variables when it comes to the afftereffects, see Long Covid, Fatigue Syndrome and many other issues. In some cases people couldn't breath normaly even months after they suffered from the infection. \n\nDo you really want to take this kind of healt risk for the whole nation ... because ... wearing a mask is tyranny? Because this is how some people talk.\n\n>>you'd discover that governors such as Cuomo were stuffing people<<\n\nWe can talk about individuals and their actions during the pandemic all you want. I do not support every measure nor do I think you should stop to be critical here.\n\nThe point however is, at the end of the day, it is a pandemic and it is far more  dangerous than just the typical \"flu\". Look at any person who's really experienced in this kind of medical field. Look at the science behind it. The people which actually do research on this virus. They all say that it shouldn't be taken lightly. Even Goerge J Bush had decades ago the opinion that nations have to protect themself better from pandemics. \n\nMy point is, this should be a non-partisan issue. But one side, clearly, made it into a partisan problem. Talk about idiots with democrats all you want. But when you look at it many Republicans couldn't stop to downplay this virus and gawking about how it's a lie by democrats to get Trump. And this killed people.",

Between 1937 to 1945 and 1964 to 1985 the country saw very open dictadorships and people could still get weapons and ammo to attempt to face off against the regime. Suffice It to say, although there were attempts, they never even came close to ending the Estado Novo or the Military Dictadorship, that's both because people are willing to live under said dictadorship reluctantly - if not willingly - and cannot realitically form an effective resistance (simple question, how would 300+ million people purchase sufficient ammo to fight the 1.3 million soldiers of the US and their military assets? It's a simple accounting issue, you need income to form a freaking army that's capable of winning a mordern military while also fullfilling basic needs such as housing and food; your conservative ideals have this problem economics all the time, and that without even counting the fact that Federal Premium Ammunition or Winchester wouldn't be all that willing to even sell ammuntion to a rebel group).",

Warfare made popular militia without central command isn't nearly as easy as yankees like to think, there are overwhelming examples of failed examples (as well as some successful, though It's hardly thanks to having guns unregulated and more about sheer organization and support from numerous groups).\n\nThe warfare in Poland doesn't seem different from Brazil's guerrilla, to be honest: different groups fighting for the same goal yet cannot cooperate in order to bring down the regime, no one could even dream of tearing down the military regime alone. At best they could destabilize for a moment (for example, when a US service member was murdered in Brazil while Costa e Silva just had a stroke, the regime had no real power for a moment and had to concede with a group's demands after an embassador [from Switzerland, if I remember correctly] was kidnapped, the tortured and unlawful detainment was broadcast on nightly news at the time and prisoners were freed, even then It didn't came close to ending the regime, less 3 years later the entire group responsible for said actions were successfully hunted down, and this was made by a country that's completely backwards in terms of technology and intelligence services both today and at the time).",

But a lot of people who are not very keen on communism are motivated by the German brutality. There is a variation to how harsh German occupation gets and how active partisan activities were.\n\nYou could be tasked to watch when trains pass by and relay that to a radio transmitter. Because a nation with a strategic bomber force takes that information. It's still a great risk to have a radio transmitter.",

        "text": "@SkadooHusky I suppose pointing out that the Nazis were intent on holding large portions of Europe as their own territory and intended the systematic slaughter of millions of citizens, and the USA didn't, hasn't crossed your mind?\nThe difference was intent and the willingness to achieve goals. The USA had no intention of committing genocide and claiming Iraq or Vietnam as its own. If that had been the case, you'd probably find the conduct of US forces to be much different than it was. In fact, we did see the US commit similar atrocities in Vietnam. The My Lai massacre comes to mind. And that's the crux of it; how far are you willing to go in achieving your objectives? The US could have been far more brutal than it was. European powers did horrendous things during their colonial years, and the US could have taken that route and held not only military supremacy, but total civil supremacy. \nBut it's not like the USA was easy on anyone. Take a look at the outcomes of major battles and offensives in Vietnam. After 1968, the Viet Cong was all but wiped out. They initiated the Tet Offensive and got slaughtered. It was a bloodbath that the VC never really recovered from. After 1968, Viet Cong never managed to launch another major offensive. The NVA did, but even then, they understood that they weren't going to be successful  unless they could match American military power, which rarely ever happened. The casualty figures tell the tale. The US military could damn near march with impunity anywhere in S. Vietnam. They could launch incursions at will into North Vietnam. By 1968, the US had air superiority, with the only real danger coming from AA guns and missiles on the ground. North Vietnamese jets didn't engage directly too much in the latter half of the war, because they lost on a regular basis.\n\nI guess the point is that while insurgents make the news, when you ask the commanders on the ground what their concerns are, it's the things that can actually impede them in their tasks. US commanders in Iraq and Afghanistan didn't resort to brutal tactics against civilians, because they needed the cooperation of the civilians. That wouldn't have helped achieve their goals. Insurgents are a problem, but they're a manageable problem. Guys with rifles can impede your progress, but they can't fuck up your whole day like an enemy company with tanks can. That's the difference between guerrilla fighters and organized armies.",

Getting ahold of an enemy tank is great, but not if you can't fuel the thing or get more ammo for it.\nBut the original point is that militias and civilian resistance don't really measure up well against trained, disciplined, well-supplied armies. From the early days of the American Revolution when militia fled again and again in the face of the English army, until the Continental Congress paid for a professional army. The Viet Cong essentially stopped functioning as an organized militia/guerrilla force after 1968, and the NVA grew as a result. The Mujahadeen in Afghanistan in the late 1970s-Early 1980s were getting slaughtered wholesale and couldn't stop the Soviets until, mysteriously, US weaponry started showing up on the battlefields. The Soviets had a lock on the border and could stop most weapons shipments coming in from Pakistan until Stinger missiles arrived. \nBut even then, the Soviets didn't lose militarily. They gave up because their economy was in a tailspin. Just a couple years after they left Afghanistan after a ten year occupation, the USSR collapsed and the Berlin wall came down.\nHistrionics paints a rosy picture of the common man in his valiant struggle against the government oppressor. History tells us that the valiant common man, usually gets killed in that struggle, in greater number than government oppressors.",

I don't think you grasp the scope of the Resistance movements throughout Europe. Take the Home Army for instance. They were an underground political and military organisation composed of ex-military and ex-politicians/intelligentsia (4 times as big as the French Resistance with 400 000 people in it; while the French only had close to 100 000. People that joined the FFI passed 1944 are opportunists that seized the moment to deal with personal grievances). The fighters were either ex-military or trained by ex-military; which in turn made them into a rather useful para-military group. However, they never actually took back any territory, it was not possible. Their major accomplishments are mostly hindering the German logistics, taking out key German operators and passing on intel. Let's not forget that once WWII was over, the Home Army was dissolved except for the Cursed Soldiers. Another resistance movement that did little to hinder the U.S.S.R (not through lack of trying). You guys are acting as if these resistance movements were decisive for the victory and kept Nazi Germany from occupying the land (which is the point being made by the pro-2A people) which is UTTERLY FALSE.\n\n\nThe French Resistance is an even worse example. Composed mostly of young men and women that had NO military training, had NO hierarchy and were parceled into little groups usually with different political ideologies that would rarely work together for a common goal. Again, not a single resistance movement actually did anything when it comes to the occupation; they gathered intel, killed German key operators and sabotaged their logistical lines. At no point did they take back any land, at no point were they an actual threat to the occupation of their country. So no, armed civilians would and can not take back land. \n\n\nYou're all some wannabe minutemen, not understanding the complexity of war and the logistics war entails. As a civilian (even as an ex-military civilian) you do not have the logistics to confront a stronger enemy head on. You cannot coordinate attacks, you cannot resupply your lines properly, you cannot actually hold a position. You could have all the guns in the world but if your army fails and is disbanded, you're left alone with your group of friends. What will you do then? Have 20 men attack a garrison to take back a city? Try it, odds are you'll end up dead of tortured for information. You're going to sabotage them? Sure, do so; however, if the occupying force doesn't have another enemy it's fighting, you're not doing anything really. You're just hindering your own by damaging infrastructure they are using. Now If there still is a war going on; the most useful thing a resistance movement can do is intel gathering. Not fighting, not sabotaging, but intel gathering. \n\n\nAll this to say you guys are using TERRIBLE examples to prove your point. \nThe original point made by these pundits is this: \"Armed civilians would deter an army from invading/deter a dictator from taking power.\"\nThe arguments you are making by commenting \"google the (insert country here) resistance is this: \"Resistance movements existed, never took back any land, and were more of a support unit for other nation's armies.\"\nThe Historical facts are that not a single resistance movement in the world has achieved independence alone. If they achieved it, it was with the help of a foreign government/army. \n\n\nNow that you've read (or not) this comment, you may now disregard it and keep believing that you're Rambo and that if ever your country were to be invaded you'll single-handedly retake all of the country with the help of your semi-automatic rifle,",

This notion of the small insurgent force winning, is the exception, not the rule. And the examples typically thrown out like the Minutemen from the American Revolution, the Mujahadeen of Afghanistan, the Viet Cong, generally lack context. They hardly ever achieved lasting victories without support. The Russians were effectively dominant in Afghanistan until the Mujahadeen started receiving real support and supplies from the USA. They had no ability to counter the Russian helicopters, until the CIA started slipping them Stinger missiles. The Viet Cong were known to use long bamboo poles to counter American helicopters. They'd pop out of the ground, lob the poles at the rotors in the hopes of causing enough damage to force the helicopter to land. This ignores the fact that American helicopters had machine gunners watching for that very thing, and as a result, bamboo poles didn't work all that well.\n\nIf you feel you should fight in your hypothetical scenario, then by all means do so. Just be aware that your actions are more of a nuisance and a delaying tactic. You're hoping for a political shift, not a rout.",

Im sure you would rather die fighting than allowing someone to send you to a death camp and work you and starve you to death.  I will admit that the examples you mentioned did indeed need outside help and are relatively poor examples to use, but there is only one instance I can think of when civilians were able to defeat a somewhat formidable opponent and that was the texas revolution. A group of militiamen were able to defeat an army twice their size in a matter of 12 minutes at the battle of San Jacinto largely due to General de Santa Anna being an inept leader. There is no way of knowing who would win in a situation where its the government vs its own people until it happens especially with todays technology.\n\nEdit:  I believe the czar of Russia was forced to step down from power by the people and his own military, but I dont know much about the Russian revolution so I will leave it at that",

Half of the US military and three-letter agencies would defect in the event of an armed revolution to the side of the revolutionaries, and even more than that fraction of veterans would side with the revolutions. The retired military in the US far outnumbers the standing military. The US government would have no chance in the event of an armed revolution. Tanks and bombs and drones don't mean shit when you can't identify combatants and noncombatants, the people that were originally on your side are rioting because they're concentrated in densely populated cities rather than rural areas, and the power grids of those large cities are ridiculously vulnerable, so now what few police officers that didn't join the side of the revolutionaries can't even begin to hope to keep order. The fact that there is no power grid is exacerbated by the fact that there is no food and the people living in large cities are starving because all of the country's food is produced in primarily rural and right-wing areas. The government can't even feed it's own troops let alone pay them or pay for fuel to run their tanks and aircraft anymore, because now they're only collecting taxes from half of the population. it is ridiculously naive to just think \"you're Ar-15 can't take down a predator drone so shut up\" and just never think any further on the subject.

Would you trade your life for a policemans in that situation? Will you start political assassinations if gun control measures are taken? Maybe that development would be a temporary political shift or the start of a slippery slope, there is no way of knowing. Guns are not effective countermeasure to tyrany because when you know that it is time to escalate to that level it is too late. The checks and balances for tyrany should be a diverse and independent media and a critical populace that hold both media and all politicians accountable. You are fighting for your guns, but why arn't you upset about the dismantling of the first defences against tyrany? Why do you tolerate the lies of the Trump administration? Why are you not protesting against gerrymandering and the closing of ballot locations? These are retorical questions, Im not really interested in arguing.",

The greatest enemy of the German Jews wasn't Hitler or the SS, it was the constantly escalating culture of discrimination, persecustion, and dehumanization of Jews that was constantly being pushed by the Nazi Party. Any attempt to rise up would have been met with retaliation tenfold, as demonstrated on the Night of Broken Glass, almost six years into Nazi rule.",

Let me make this clear: if the government itself has made it it´s goal to destroy you and your ethnicity, then no amount of guns and genades will stop them. unless you are part of a VERY large minority(like 15-30%), which have a large percentage of trained, capable soldiers in them, have support from other governments or your own private army, you will lose. civilians don´t beat governments. armies do. armies with trained soldiers, united under a single goal, led by competent strategic minds, and funded with large amounts of money so large they could only be provided by governments or millionares.\n\n\"it could allow some of those under threat of the Nazis to escape, give the Nazis a very harder time time to carry out what they wanted to, or at the very least give someone chance defend their basic liberties. \"\n\nIt could also increase the fear the german population have of the jews, leading to a more drastic and brutal approach to their opression and extermination. it´s easier to hate someone if you percieve them as a serious threat. \n\nboth those hypotheticals are eually likely,(i´m giving you the benefit of the doubt here) but ultimately have one thing in common: \nthey´re entirely removed from reality. \n\nto assume that gun ownership could have been used to protect their liberties assumes that they hold a considerable amount of power. this is decievingly false, because it seems true. sure, they can go shoot some germans, but that´s not going to help them if the general populus is against them. how much power does a gun give you if you aren´t allowed to work, vote, own land property or hold capital? are you gonna walk into the parlament and hold politicians at gunpoint demanding they respect your liberties? what are 50% of 1% of people going to do in a country that wants them dead?\n\nregardless, they would have never come to a point where every jew owned a gun because there is no benefit in doing so. those who bear arms are the first to be shot.",

Because any defense of political rights that requires guns is based on force or the threat of force. How would a Jew in Nazi Germany have used a gun to 'defend himself/herself from their basic liberties being infringed upon' without either being arrested and executed. If your answer is 'in a group' then that's exactly organised resistance. If it's anything else, then you must ask yourself how that course of action would result in anything other than arrest or being shot by the police/local Nazi militia. \n\n\nGermany isn't the US. It's very central and inhabited. There are no places to hole up and form a Wako style hideout. If they did, it would have the same result as the siege of Wako, except all the people in the hideout being slaughtered would be expected and, in the Nazi's eyes, just deserts for 'race traitors and Undermenschen'.",

However, these small, isolated acts could potentially escalate to bigger and organized acts of resistance, as they are emboldened and/or inspired by the actions other's have made. Not only that, but these small acts could catch the eyes of third party's, who would look to capitalize and invest into the resistance for their own gains. Ranges from the common man to nations. \nExample, France and Germany supporting American's during the American war of Independence. USSR supporting the CCP during the Chinese Civil War. Communist states supporting the Viet-Cong's during the Vietnam War. And a recent example, US supporting the Taliban in their fight against the USSR. There are likely more but you get the point.\n\nNote however that I never said these isolated acts would lead into or is a prerequisite for organized resistance, nor does these small incidents necessarily lead into bigger incidents. I only stated that smaller acts could potentially escalate to bigger and organized acts. After all, a third party with enough money and power could just whip up resistances if so desired. And like you said, by the time you'll realize the system is against you, it'll likely be too late to do anything. So yeah.",

To my knowledge, he’s one of those hardline extremists that supports Netanyahu and co. committing literal genocide against Palestinians. There’s an interesting history of Israeli lobbyists drumming up support for financial aid to Israel and a lot of Americans are blindly “pro-Israel.” Okay, so I can very much see this natural alliance between far right anti-semites and far right Israeli militant Netanyahu supporters in the US. I think Ben probably knows he’s being used as a human shield for anti-semites and American and doesn’t care because he’s made a calculation that the Republican Party is stewing in Islamophobia…which is what you need when you’re advocating for literal war crimes against Palestinians. Here’s a new rule for literally everyone: when someone is working against their own interest, the natural conclusion IS NOT “oh, this must mean Democrats really are crazy and calling everyone antisemitic.” No, dig just a tiny bit deeper and you’ll find a cesspit of cynicism and calculation for furthering their own ends, and their ends are magically justified, right? So whatever means you need to get there…makes me so sick thinking about it. Another example of this is Clarence Thomas. He is cruel, spiteful and just an overall piece of shit.",

I can still track a fair amount of a conversation in Yiddish. It doesn't require strict observance to ethical laws in a book, as long as one's learned those ancient lessons and applies them.\nIf my neighbor is low on food, I know that some decision likely was less than optimal and they're experiencing a shortfall - usually by selling their food stamps. I get the same amount as they do (yes, more than one neighbor has come up short), I do exercise good stewardship and literally maintain a pantry with two to three months of staples. Largely, because I'm lazy and only visit the supermarket twice a month at most and I quite enjoy a wide variety of foods - especially my greens.\nSo, I just tell them \"oh, go shopping and enjoy!\". Gonna have to pick up another bag of potatoes, gave the last few to a neighbor, but not a biggie, got other root veggies in stock and even instant mash and au gratin crap mix as a rare comfort food. And I also bake my own bread on occasion.\nThat provides a good example for those who hadn't learned those skills and as I've said to many a man, a man isn't worth much if he can't repair things around the house, keep the house clean and feed himself.\nSomething important, as I lost my wife of over 41 years several years back, but I believe in learning and paid attention to when mom was cooking and sewing (albeit, at a far lower skill level for sewing).\nBut, every day, my goal is to learn at least one new thing and am always willing to share that knowledge.\n\nIn my previous apartment, we had a Synagogue next door. One source of anger for me was that they felt the need to have armed security during services.\nNobody that wishes to worship peacefully should ever have to feel that need! That isn't what I served over 28 years of my life in military defense of! And that wasn't necessary in Qatar or even Iran. \nYes, most Americans don't realize that there is an ancient and sizable Jewish community happily living in Iran. Met a fair number over the years as they traveled, usually worked some history into the conversation, even Esther. Surprised a fair number, that an American knew history and certain holy books, but as I said, learn something new every day.\nOne of the easiest ways to turn a potential adversary into a friend and the easiest, not being judgemental, but accepting them based upon their own value systems.",

    "text": "As a Turkish citizen, I do not see the logic behind the idea of preventing a tyrannical government by having large number of guns. The weapons may be an advantage to fight against a tyrannical regime, but it certainly is not enough to win against the oppressor.\r\n\nHere in my country, people can get different kinds of weapons if they like. They can get handguns, hunting rifles or shotguns, they can even get an AK-47 if they live in rural areas. By U.S. and European standards, Erdogan is already an authoritarian man and the country has already turned into a tyrannical regime by having the largest number of journalists jailed, poor human rights records, poor checks and balances in the government. In other words, it is a tyrannical regime in Ben Shapiro’s or Ben Carson’s word. Yet, the Erdogan’s government still has a huge number of popularities in the nation where half the country will rather die than electing another government. If the opposition groups revolt against Erdogan, it will only make his job easier to finally get rid of whatever opposition left in the country under the excuse of combating against terrorism. So, revolting against the government and shooting Erdogan’s men is equal to giving him a golden gift basket for their supports to help his cause.\r\n\nAlso, Erdogan has the control of the entire military, police-force, and intelligence agencies. However, if the opposition groups start a civil-war, for example, then he may not even bother to mobilize the army but rather he can give weapons to his supporters and send them to fight against the oppositions. Then, he can simply justify his actions by saying to the world that there are uprising events happening because of the opposition groups and he will remove them to protect the democracy from collapsing. So, tyrannical governments do not acknowledge themselves as they are tyrannical and claim that they are functioning democracies, republics, or something else even though they are not.\r\n\nIn short, there is no ultimate solution to stop a tyrannical government from gaining power because the guns which are used to prevent a tyranny can easily be used as a back bone for tyrannical regimes to rise at the same time. Look at the Syria for example, for a time the opposition groups were winning when they were supplied from other countries but once the Russia, a professional military were involved in the conflict, they began to retreat to the point that they lost all the chances of winning.\r\n\nTo prevent a tyrannical government, one needs more than just guns. They need a strong public popularity, allies from outside that will support and supply the oppositions against the tyrannical government, advanced weapons to combat against the government's armored divisions, air and sea dominance, professional people who knows how to fight or how to survive against the odds such as sickness, starvation, dehydration, physiological traumas or PTSD, and low morale. If an opposition group lacks any of these to fight against tyranny and rely only to their guns, that means they lost the war before even it begins.",

        "text": "​@kimdirkim12 You misunderstood the situation on what is going on in here. The purpose of the comment was not to compare the Turkey with Nazi Germany but to show why an unpopular uprising in an authoritarian nation, such as Turkey, will unlikely be successful to topple the regime even though the oppositions have access to firearms. \n\nThe country is like Iran you ask? No. Not yet...  But the reason why it did not turn out like Iran yet is not because Erdogan cannot do that. Unfortunately, you do know too well that Erdogan can declare himself to be the supreme leader tomorrow and the only thing he will face with thunders of applauds in the nation. He does not do that though because the nation itself is heavily depended on the western world's market and he cannot stabilize the situation in the country if they isolated him by putting even more sanctions. On the other hand, Iran has no such concern because it has no desire to maintain a necessarily good relation with the west, especially with the US. However, that is not case for Turkey, unlike Iran, it does not have a major natural resource to rely on and trying to make closer ties with Russia, China (highly unlikely due to what is going on in their northwest territory), or Iran will not cover the losses which he would face if the west turns on him. So, to answer your question is this. The country is not like Iran because he needs to act like he rules the country with democratic principles but in reality it is not as you are admitting it.\n\nAlso, he does not even need paramilitary groups like Pasdaran or Ansar-e Hezbollah. His radical conservative and religious supporters make a marvelous job on accomplishing those tasks by being the unofficial \"morality cops\" in the streets. There is a reason after all why the pro-Erdogan mafia groups, such as Sedat Peker, and AKP party members' relatives who shoot people do not face with serious legal actions for openly threatening the people or homicide charges (Note: those guys are also encouraging people to arm themselves to protect Erdogan). But, I do not even need to tell you this because I am sure that these are stuff that you are already aware of. In fact, perhaps you would like to answer the question for our foreign friends here on the probability of armed opposition groups' success in Turkey for trying to overthrow this authoritarian regime.\n\n\"Yeah, In Turkey we have an authoritarian regime\"\n\"Stop that, Erdogan will go by democracy, and hell yeah it is possible\"\nYou are contradicting with yourself here. First you admit that Turkey is an authoritarian regime and then said the leader of that authoritarian regime will go by democracy? If the country is an authoritarian regime, then it does not have democratic institutions. If the democratic institutions are working, then it is not an authoritarian regime. So, you cannot have it both at the same time, pick one.  Also, since when was the last time you heard a case that an authoritarian regime's leader left the office by democracy just because he lost an election? Because they tend to not to listen the rule of law and creating their own rules according to their will in order to stay in power.\n\nBesides, you are referring the mayor elections where he lost both Ankara and Istanbul. Call me pessimistic if you like but it will be a miracle if he lets the Istanbul go to the opposition side. It has been almost two weeks since the election in that city and votes have already been recounted due to CHP party having 15,000 votes more than the AKP but he keeps pressing on recounting the votes again and again and again and again... possibly to have another election in Istanbul. Perhaps you would like to look at the objection requests of each parties from the last few elections on the results and see which parties' objection were mostly granted by the Supreme Electoral Council. He keeps saying on the television that he will respect the decision of the Supreme Electoral Council but I will let you guess who is the person that the president of the Council answers to. You already know the answer to that. He changed the governing system from the parliamentary to the presidential one just so he could legally stay in power as long as he wants and you think the results from the last election (which he still won the majority of votes regardless) will somehow stop him from ruling the nation since 2003? You are very optimistic if you think that.",

        "text": "@1111Tactical While I understand  your point, I must say I am not really sold into your hypothesis of snowball effect of toppling a government with militia. Here is why:\r\n\r\nIf I understand correctly, then your hypothesis works like this: \nFirst, have a well-armed people. Then, start training to become a commendable force against government troops.\r\nSecond, use that militia to take over military facilities to obtain advance weapons such as tanks. Then, the militia will turn itself to an army.\r\nThird, attack government head on and topple it.\r\n\r\nYour hypothesis lacks two most essential key elements for a revolution. One is the public popularity. In order for your hypothesis to become reality, pretty much all people in the nation needs to stand behind you on toppling a government and needs to support your cause. However, assuming from the start that majority of the country fights with you will be an unwise strategy for you to take because some of them will not. People may not see that fighting to topple the government is justified for damages that they will receive as a result of retaliation. Also, there is a probability that armed militia may decide to stand with the government instead of you due to seeing you as a terrorist. So, in a way, you need to clarify what guarantee you have that armed-militias will stand behind you to topple the regime and not going to stand with the government. Because if it turns out that they are well-armed but they are not supporting your cause, then you will have even a bigger problem to deal with for both fighting against the government and its supporters. So, it would be better for you to make sure that you have strong public popularity at first then forming an armed-militia. You should not assume that they will fight for you regardless just because it is tyrannical. The reason is, they may be okay living under such conditions. Russia is an authoritarian, yet a large amount of people are somewhat okay under living it. Syria is an authoritarian, yet its people are also okay under the leadership of Assad. Turkey is somewhat authoritarian, but half the country prefers to live in this condition then otherwise.\r\n\r\nSecond, your hypothesis assumes that government will not take major actions to prevent such uprising from the start. However, in reality that is not the case. You need to hit multiple military facilities and not just one in order to make a major impact. The problem is though such coordinated attacks require communications throughout the country. But a tyrannical government will have easy access to listen private communications between these people. They can suspect from the start if there are large people gatherings are happening throughout the country and for that they can cut off all communications between you and your friends. By the time you realize what is happening, a majority of your friends may end up arrested for charges of terrorism (it would be a legitimate charge because you indeed try to topple a government after all). Besides, assume for a minute you are winning and government is losing to hold its territories. In this case, governments do not just sit there and accept the defeat. Instead, they ask help from their allied nations to intervene in such conflict. Syria is a good example for this. When the opposition were supplied from their allies and Syria government were losing control in some territories, they asked help from Russia who turned the tide on their favors. So, governments do not just sit and let you guys make plans to overthrow their regime and can arrest you for the suspicion of your actions of treason and terrorism in the first stage which makes it difficult for your snowball effect to take its course.\r\n\r\nTry to apply your hypothesis into this video for example. Do you see that Jews were toppling the government and winning against the Nazis? If yes, then you made a mistake somewhere. Jews in Germany were approximately 500,000 people in a nation with 70 million and Germany prior to WWII was pretty anti-Semitic towards to Jews. So, if we apply your hypothesis into this scenario, then it is difficult that snowball effect would take its course because there were more Nazi supporters than the entire Jewish population in the nation. In this case, if Jews would attack the military facilities to capture the Panzers then they would likely be pushed back by the armed Nazi supporters who would label them as traitors. As the video explains that Nazis were okay with their own supporters for having access to firearms. Thus, if there was a Jew that was willing to shoot a SS personnel, then you should assume that there would be two more Nazi supporters who would be willing to shoot that Jew before the SS and SA showed up with its full force. Also, any kind of communication to capture the military facilities will be exposed from the start because Hitler made it okay for government to listen private communications among people. In this case, your hypothesis seems to fail to meet its criteria in the first and second stage which makes it very difficult for Jews to topple the regime.\r\n\r\nI also tried to apply your hypothesis into my own country. It still failed to meet the criteria because we have access to firearms (not as easily as in US but it is possible), but there is no strong public popularity to support to topple the regime and instead half the country would be willing to support the authoritarian government from collapsing by arming themselves against the opposition groups. Attacking to a military facility and killing military or police personnel will also be considered as the highest treason that will be condemned even by the opposition groups. Something like that would justify the government's respond to get rid of any strong opposition even further because they would have a legitimate reason to do so at that point. So, in my case, it failed at the first step to create your snowball effect because not many people would risk themselves to topple a government by destroying their own country in the process if some of them think they live better under an authoritarian regime. Thus, your hypothesis needs to be a little more specific and more applicable to the real world events and not just on paper as hypothetical scenarios.",

I am aware of your militia groups and preppers (I guess that is what you people call). I must say I am not really impressed with their performance of overthrowing a government if it comes to that. The reason you should be skeptical of those groups because the order they will install after they topple a tyrannical government (assuming they can at the first place and have strong allies from outside world that will supply them) may not be better than the previous tyrannical government. So, I would not recommend for you to put all your eggs (all your hopes of a successful revolution) into this one basket (trusting militias alone because you never know. Perhaps they acknowledged that the government is not as tyrannical as other people accusing of or government may form its own militia groups from its supporters as counter measures).\r\n\r\n\"The government having drones/tanks/gunships doesn't make any of this impossible as we see with the US and allies quagmires in the Middle East.\"\r\n\r\nThe low performance of US in this region is the result of the mismanagement of your leaders for failing to understand the reality of the situation. You are not just fighting against the enemy, you are trying to build a pro U.S. government in Iraq with no cultural similarities. In short, you are trying to build a state from the start but you should have realized that state-building missions take decades of work and a lot of resources. You guys entered the region for toppling the regime and wanted to withdraw as fast as possible but the thing you did not realize is that establishing a pro-U.S. government and withdrawing from the region as fast as possible are things that cannot happen at the same time. On that sense, one can assume that you guys would do a better job on defeating the insurgents if you just simply annex the entire country because only then it would be your main problem to deal with. But instead you did not want to deal with it as your main problem and just wanted to get out from the region the moment Saddam's government collapsed. You can say that drones, tanks, gunships are doing their job pretty good against insurgents. Your government at that time miscalculated badly which they thought they were going to get out of that region in just a couple of years instead of acknowledging that they were going to stay there for a pretty long time. You also need to understand that people love freedom but they do not want to live in a anarchist type of freedom where everyone is for himself. They need freedom but they also need food, jobs, and feeling to secure because otherwise freedom alone does not justify the costs of that freedom. People cheered when Saddam was gone but now some of them wants him back because the freedom they received did not justify the costs of living in constant instability.\r\n\r\n\"Predator drones can't maintain rule of law.\"\r\n\r\nNo they do not maintain rule of law but that is the idea. They do not have to. A tyrannical regime does not need to follow the rule of law and they can bend the rules according to their own views by either changing the rule or changing their interpretation of those laws. Those things are pretty common in authoritarian regimes where they tend to change the laws according to their own desires. \rThe problem is how are you going to identify it? Perhaps the government is making some genuine changes to improve the living conditions or perhaps they are indeed trying to change the laws in their favor to gain more power. This is the reason that it is difficult for people to rise against government because some may see those changes as reasonable while others may see it as the rise of tyranny, and for that, a major uprising against the government where most of the people united as one is very rare.\n\r\n\"Abrams tanks can't enforce curfews.\r\"\r\n\r\nNo they can't enforce curfews. That is why governments rely on their supporters in those territories to force their rules upon nation. It might be strange for you people but not many people are worried to live in an authoritarian government if they live better under its rule such as high paying jobs for their families and increase of their wealth. Desperation forces people to take desperate measures for not wanting to lose what little they had before that government. For that, you may end up in a situation to fight against both government troops and its supporters who are enforcing the government's rule over territories to protect their gains if you spend more time on arming the population then actually convincing them to support your cause to topple it at the first place.",

        "text": "@Donbd83 \"Who won Vietnam the US with all its planes, tanks, napalm, agent orange and burning of villages and still they couldn't take and hold the land against farmers armed with small arms\"\n\nYou mean the farmers who were supplied by the North Vietnam who was also well supported by the Soviet Union and China with advanced weapons and had decades of combat experience fighting against French and Japanese? Granted, I guess you could make an argument from that but it is only the tip of the iceberg and a lot of other factors occurred in that war for the U.S. poor track record against Vietnamese. To stop the Vietnam insurgents in the South Vietnam, the North Vietnam needed to be persuaded to stop sending their insurgents and weapons through the border. The problem is though, U.S. never tried to invade the North Vietnam due to U.S. administration feared that both Soviet Union and China would also join the fight against U.S. and instead U.S. military was instructed to launch bombing campaigns in North Vietnam such as Operation Rolling Thunder. However, the military was strictly forbidden to bomb important places such as Surface-to-air missile (SAM) fields due to fear of killing Soviet \"instructors.\"  Also, U.S. air force was forbidden to bomb North Vietnam airfields which caused for U.S. not to obtain air dominance over the region and picking targets with low importance in North Vietnam. So, in a nutshell, you are trying to force North Vietnam into submission to stop supporting South insurgents but at the same time you do not want to invade the North and rely only on bombing the territories with low importance. How do you expect that U.S. would achieve victory in this situation against Vietnamese? Short answer; You don't, because Vietnam war was a huge political mess between the military and administration over how to achieve victory in the region. That is why, saying that farmers with small arms won the Vietnam war is very misleading because we know at this point that those farmers had more than just small arms including, SA-2 guideline SAM missiles, Mig-21 jets with their air-to-air missiles, thousands of RPG-7, thousands of Soviet AA guns, etc.\n\n\"During Desert Storm the entire American military along with NATO couldn't hold Baghdad with its superior numbers and technology and still couldn't wrestle control of it from civilians armed with small arms and improvised weaponry\"\n\nI assume you confused the Desert Storm operation with Iraq war because that operation's main objective was to force Saddam to abandon his campaign against Kuwait. The main objective was never to capture the Baghdad but rather to free Kuwait from Iraqi troops. For this, both U.S. and NATO achieved both of its objective by removing all Iraqi troops from Kuwait and forcing Saddam to submit for a cease fire. It is actually interesting you mentioned the Operation Desert Storm because after that operation ended, there were uprising events occurred both North and South of Iraq against Saddam's tyrannical regime and both U.S. and NATO was almost certain that his government would collapse because at least half of the nation's cities were occupied by the rebels. However, it turned out that the opposite happened because in less than 2 months, Saddam's forces crushed the rebels first in the South which turned the tide to his favor. He basically gave the order to his party officials either to kill or be killed at the hands of rebels. Government forces used missiles, artillery, helicopters, tanks, and chemical weapons against the rebels to force them to surrender. After the South region was under the control of the government once again, he began to launch attacks against Kurdish militia in the North. Iraqi army helicopters and tanks bombarded the cities and gave order to Kurdish population of Kirkuk city to leave if they wanted to survive. At the end, almost all militia that were fighting against Saddam was either killed, taken prisoner, or fled to surrounding countries. Approximately more than 450,000 Kurds ended up in our borders as refugees who fled from Iraq for their cities being demolished and the fear of retaliation from government troops. It turned out that militias with small arms were not be able to stop Iraqi government troops with T-62 tanks, and Mil Mi-24 helicopters, and chemical weapons when they were not supported or supplied by other nations such as U.S. and other NATO nations. \n\n\"these same civilians beat the shit out of Russia as well\"\n\nWhen did that happen exactly?",

        "text": "@Donbd83 \"America defeating Britain the most powerful military in the world.\"\n\nThat is actually debatable. It is not up to debate that the Royal Navy was the most powerful naval force during that time due to Britain being an Island nation. However, some historians would disagree that Britain had the most powerful army or ground troops and would argue that either French or Prussians should had that title for having better training, discipline, logistics, sizes, and their records of warfare. You also did not mention that Americans had tons of international support such as from Spain, French, and Dutch where as the Britain had almost no support to fight against the Patriots in the colonies. It is difficult to claim they would won against the Britain without any support from their allies on providing them with money and supply of weapons because it is known that French Navy and their military officers contributed a lot for the fight against the British. It is also known that despite Britain having a considerable military power, they lost quite a bit of wars during that time and American Revolutionary war was just one of them. Moreover, Britain did not want to continue to fight against Americans who were both receiving thousands of foreign troops and supplies from their allied nations because colonies did not have a big importance for Britain compared to other regions such as India. Therefore, sending another army to colonies even after they were defeated was meaningless because the support for such a war was pretty much gone.  \n\n\"at the time with only 3% of the active public resisting\"\n\nSource please.\n\n\"So yes history shows that small arms are able to stave off larger and better equipped militaries.\"\n\nI mean you can make the argument if you like but again, your examples are only the tip of the iceberg in very complex situations and when we look at deeply for each of these examples, it is becoming difficult to say if your historical evidence are good representations of what actually happened in history in order to support your claim. Because if your evidence are not historically accurate to support your argument, then you need to start from all over again to strength your claim more. Otherwise, you need to abandon your argument completely if you are unable to increase its strength by finding accurate evidence.",

        "text": "@Derek-d5097 So you are stating that Vietnam wasn't able to hold its own until it received small arms and weapons like AK's, grenades and rpgs and those alone were enough to defeat two occupying forces, the two forces that conquered it in the late 1800's right after the opium wars?\n\n\nSo France was able to occupy an unarmed and basically not technological advanced civilization having no knowledge of modern weaponry(literally using bows and spears still) were able to receive small arms from Russia(paid for by the US by the lend lease program)  were able to then repel two of the worlds most powerful militaries of the time? So how are small arms not effective in repelling a larger invading force, worked pretty well for them.\n\n\nSame thing against the soviets, small arms supplied to them was enough to repel the Soviets. You can claim the stingers aided but air power is useless when actually trying to occupy territory you need ground forces to hold and secure areas, now simple IED's are enough to disable American armor which is damn near useless in an urban or rough terrain environment.\n\n\nSo history sides with me on this, that you can give a force small weapons and with those weapons they can defeat superior forces as they already possess the most powerful thing needed to fight and that is the will, they tried to do this in Vietnam break their will  but you cannot break someone who has nothing to lose they essentially don't give a fuck.\n\n\nBritain was defeated by logistics and the one thing these invading countries need to occupy and continue occupation and that is money and support of its people. I am willing to bet that had the Zulu's been given small arms in their defense against the British the British wouldn't be in Africa now, they still brag about winning battles armed with firearms versus men with swords and shields, give those same people firearms and the British would go crying back to England like the pussies they are.",

But, that is not the case. Also, you are agreeing that if you give advance weapons for people to fight, then you can increase your probabilities of victory? If you look at the first comment, then you will see that I agree with this notion at the first place. I already explained that small weapons can have an advantage but you need more and more and more... For example, you need strong public popularity, allies from outside that will support and supply you, and need to have an access to advance weapons. That is the reason Vietnamese won the war against the French and U.S. because it fits all these criteria that they had a strong public popularity to Ho Chi Minh's regime, they had allies such as Soviet Union and China which provided them with advanced weapons, and they know the terrain well enough to use to their advantage. If all these conditions were met, then there is a strong possibility that insurgents can win against the government with heavy weapons. Soviet-Afghan war also fits to this description as well. The Mujaheddin's fight against the Soviets was recognized by many other Muslim countries, they received heavy weapons from other developed nations as well as a great number of fighters from other Muslim countries, and they knew how to use the terrain as well. However, 1991 uprisings in Iraq did not fit to this criteria because Iraq militia did not have the support from outside world that would support and supply them against Saddam's forces. The will is something that motivates people to fight but you cannot win a war against a foe only with the will alone because they still possess the most essential thing in the world and that is their lives. Not many people would like to risk their lives and die for a lost cause. That was the reason why the militias in Iraq decided to escape rather than risking to lose the only thing they had left with against Saddam's heavy weapons. It is a good thing to assume that the will would be enough to gain victory but that is not what is happening in real life.\n\n\"Britain was defeated by logistics and the one thing these invading countries need to occupy and continue occupation and that is money and support of its people. I am willing to bet that had the Zulu's been given small arms in their defense against the British the British wouldn't be in Africa now, they still brag about winning battles armed with firearms versus men with swords and shields, give those same people firearms and the British would go crying back to England like the pussies they are.\"\n\nCorrect. So you are understanding that Logistics was one of the main factors that caused the Britain to lose in the colonies. Therefore, it is more accurate to say \"patriots with the help of their allies who provided with weapons, troops, and money managed to hold on against the Britain until a point they gave up on fighting\" instead of saying \"Americans won against Britain only with a small arms alone\" because that is not historically accurate on what actually happened. You say that, only 3% (still waiting for that source) of the people fought against the British. Now imagine, what would happen if the 70% of people wanted to stay loyal to Britain? Do you still see a victory against the British if patriots did not have enough public popularity or not enough support from their allies on troops, navy power, or weapons? Highly unlikely.\n\nFor Zulu, It would increase their chances a little bit but they would still need support from a powerful nation such as France or Dutch, then it would increase their chances of a victory against the British. There are times when small weapons are simply not enough to gain advantage. Assuming that Zulu had access to small weapons such as muskets or pistols, they would still be in a disadvantaged position because the Britain had already possessed heavy weapons such as cannons, rockets, Gatling  guns at that time. Therefore, I wouldn't have been so comfortable for a Zulu victory just because they possessed small arms because remember Britain fought against other powerful nations who had same type of weapons and won against formidable opponents such as Napoleon. Even we managed to defeat them in Gallipoli campaign, but overall they took over the rest of the Middle Eastern territories (except Anatolia) from us at the same time.",

Your knowledge about warfare, insurgency, politics and history is admirable to read. \nI am curious and would like to know what is your stance on Erdogan. You discuss a lot about how armed uprising against your country's authoritarian government is hopeless as there is approximately 50% of people in the country who support and would be willing to fight for his continued rule in the case of armed opposition. He also appears to have the military under his control (Unless some high ranking members of the military plan a coup?) so regime change appears to be, for the time being: impossible. \nDo you wish for your country to become democratic like it pretends to be in order to garner support from the Western world? Do you wish for dictators like Erdogan to disappear from Turkey? I live in Norway, one of the most democratic countries in the world. So i simply cannot fathom how life under tyranny must be. But like you say, it is not bad for everyone. Some people live comfortably in the system because of their privileged position, or they simply enjoy the stability that the dictatorship brings. Even if they wish to have more freedom to express themselves, when the choice is between retaining the stability of the country or to risk everything in ensuing chaos and death in the hope of regime change. It is obvious which path most people in the middle and high class would take. Only people who'se life are already miserable such as lower class peasants, poor or oppressed people would want to solve the problem by armed opposition. After all, once a country has settled in a authoritarian government without democratic laws or checks and balances. It is very difficult to change. You'd end up with a one-party rule like The People's Republic of China or one man dictatorship like Syria. Unless special circumstances come into play. Foreign invasion, military coup, power vacuum... Internal change is much more difficult. And even if it is successful, such as the French revolution. It might just turn the country into yet another dictatorship again. \nIt truly is a sad world. The only thing i want is for a state that protects the rights of individuals, unfortunately this kind of state appears to be a rarity in this world. I feel grateful, but at the same time sad and shameful that i was born in a country which protects the liberty of man so well. Yet cannot do the same for outsiders who live in flawed countries.",

        "text": "@norwegianboyee For your question. Do I want the country to pretend like it is a functioning democracy to the Western World? No, I do not because it only means the current status quo will continue as it did for almost a decade. At this point, the status quo is no longer enough to continue to this circus. Technically speaking, we are a constitutional republic but it does not mean anything if there is little to no checks and balances in the nation. So in a nutshell, I saw the Erdogan and his party's rise and I have a feeling that I will see its fall too, However, I have little confidence that things will be better once Erdogan is gone. The reason is if he is somehow removed from power or choose to live the office willingly, then the next person who comes to power will almost be same as Erdogan himself and rule the nation according to his style. So, because of this I do not have faith in Turkey to become a stable and a functioning republic in this century.\n\n\nDo I want people like Erdogan to disappear from country? In short, yes I do. The reason is that Erdogan is not Putin or Xi Jinping. He is someone who wants to act like Putin but has the intelligence of Trump. I believe you have a good reasoning at this point why things would be better a little bit if he is out of the picture. However, the problem is that if the country becomes a functioning republic, then it is almost certain that people like Erdogan will always come to power. Unfortunately, that is just how things are working in nations such as Turkey. You can choose to become a secular authoritarian nation which will prevent people like Erdogan from achieving power indefinitely but at the same time it will not be a stable government and will receive backlash from other nations including the west. On the other hand, if you choose to become a functioning republic with fair elections instead than it is almost certain that people like Erdogan will come to power and they will use their public popularity to achieve even more power and become another authoritarian conservative regime again. We are back to square one. In a way, both options seem to lead to an authoritarian government because overall public does not have interest on ruling themselves without interfering others personal life. Also, I am not sure too if something like that is possible in Turkey where the conservative religious and secular side can live in harmony because the life styles of these people are overwhelmingly different.",

        "text": "@ffryan Vietnam war was explained above to Donbd83 that Vietnamese had way more than small arms of AK-47s and rocket launchers. To stop the Vietcong, the North Vietnam needed to be taken care of but that was something Johnson administration did not want to do to begin with. They had advanced weapons given to them by their allies such as Soviet Union and China to counter the U.S. and South Vietnamese troops. Soviets deployed thousands of Surface-to-air (SAM) rockets against the U.S. air force which caused them not to obtain the air dominance over the region. Also, U.S. administration put lots of restrictions over the military such as not to attack North Vietnamese airfields. Here is the situation, one side (U.S. military) was strictly prohibited to launch a major offense where as the other side (North Vietnam and Soviets) was almost free to engage any enemy military force. Besides, U.S. military did not even try to invade the North Vietnam due to the fear of Soviet Union and China joining to the fight with full force. Your government created its own defeat by not willing to take the necessary measures to stop the enemy from the start. That is why, the chances for a U.S. victory was doomed from the very beginning. Even today in Afghanistan, U.S. military is heavily restricted to do their job properly. You ask why the Superpower nation had poor results against the insurgents with small arms in this past decade? Ask your current and past administrations. Nation-building missions take decades of work and billions of dollars if not trillion. You guys were mistaken to think that you were going to pull out from the region the moment you toppled the Taliban regime. The reality was that you were going to stay in that country for a couple of decades at least and I believe you guys are finally realizing this harsh truth.\n\n\nAs for the Afghanistan, Soviet troops occupied pretty much all important urban cities in the country until the western nations began to supply them with advance weapons. Soviet Air forces managed to occupy the entire Kabul city alone until the ground troops showed up with full force. Stingers, for example, are the most popular weapons in social media but they had more than that. Mujaheddin had access to advanced heavy weapons such as anti-air and anti-tank once the other nations were persuaded to support them against the Soviets. Also, many other nations such as Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, U.S., Turkey, and even China financially supported to Mujaheddin with money and troops against the Soviets. It turned out that small weapons of AK-47 was not strong enough to penetrate the T-62 armor or Mi 24 helicopters. Here is the funny thing though, the Communist government in Afghanistan was going to fail regardless because it was not popular and as soon as the Soviet troops withdrew from the region, the government would collapse almost instantly. The west could achieve victory in Afghanistan by pretty much not doing anything whereas the entire damage bill would go to the Soviet Union but that is not what happened in real life.",

Or, they throw rocks in a way to discourage the government from taking actions on particular matter. However, they do not throw rocks in a way to overthrow the government. What did you think that they were throwing rocks to the police at the first place? You thought they were throwing rocks because they did not have any guns to fight against the government? If so, then you got the information wrong because that is not true. They have weapons but they do not use it against government officials; there is a big chance that you may even see people with handguns on their belts while walking down the streets. Protesters do not use weapons because the last thing they need is to give the government a justification to disperse the crowd with excessive force by ordering the police to use real bullets and probably charge them for the accusations of terrorism. That is the reason you see people throwing rocks, not because of they have no other means to fight against the government but rather not to give the government a clear justification to get rid off the protesters. Are you proposing that those protesters should begin to shoot the police with their weapons? because that would be a terrible mistake to make in a country like this where you literally offering the government a free golden-gift basket for your collaboration to help its cause to expand their control over the public. Also, are you saying that in your country protesters never throw rocks at the police at all and they only use their guns to shoot the police? I found it really hard to believe for obvious reasons.\n\n\n\"But even if your post... you just said weapons ARE useful, just that you point out a pile of guns won't do all the work for you\" \nThis sentence does not make much sense to begin with (assuming you can call it a sentence to begin with). I said that guns CAN only be useful if the other certain requirements are met as well but not before. Imagine a list of 100 items that you should have for a revolution. You have guns and that is good, so you have one of the items in the list. Now, do you have the rest of 99 items as well such as a strong public popularity in the nation where people will not stand with the government and they will support your cause? Do you have strong allies outside of the country where they can support you with intelligence or supply you with advanced weapons? Do you have the support of high-ranking military officers or police force in your team and you sure that they are not supporting the government? etc. etc. If you are lacking these other items, then guns alone will not bring you the freedom from your oppressor because the odds are clearly against you. You need to have more and more and more... then you can anticipate.",

However, I must say that the process for getting a license to carry a firearm is very complex and requires an extreme amount of money but if you try hard enough, then you may even be able get a permit for open carrying your own handgun. Another thing, unless you would like to spend a great amount money, then you won't be able to purchase a gun because some of them are known to be expensive. For example, a handgun may cost you as much as like 7,500 Turkish lira ($1297.94) or a semi-automatic shotgun can cost approximately 2,070 Turkish Lira ($358.23).  \n\nThe important thing is though Erdogan does not really afraid from an armed population. In fact, his government officials are encouraging his supporters to purchase firearms so that they could protect Erdogan from any king of uprising. Did you know after the 2016 coup attempt, a lot of government officials more inclined to form armed-militia groups around the country as a way to counter the military? I still remember the comments from pro-Erdogan groups to encourage their supporters to purchase weapons back in 2016. Let me give some examples: in 2016, a pro-AKP (Erdogan's party) organization's president shared a post on Twitter. Let me translate for you:\n\n\"This announcement is for all of our brothers who are following our cause. \nFor Nation\nFor Flag\nFor Erdogan\nARM YOURSELVES\"\n\nI can give another example. This is from the previous AKP mayor of Ankara that shared his thoughts of legalizing armed militias in the country after the coup attempt. Here is the translation:\n\n\"There is no point hiding this enterprise. I am explaining this in every television channels to legalize the militias. There has been an enormous amount of armament nationwide. The one who purchases the shotgun takes it to his home. If you are trying to make a coup tomorrow while having infantry rifles and AK-47s, wouldn't you be afraid from the fact that he will come at you with his own shotgun? He will not show you mercy as well. The nation understands now that the entire world is plotting against us. The plotters will know that if they try to make a coup attempt, then they will likely to get themselves killed when the people shows up.\" \n\nNow, do you see why Erdogan's rise could not have been prevented regardless if the population armed themselves? Because him and his party officials knew their conservative and ultra-nationalist supporters would fight for them to make sure that they would stay in power from the start.",

Also. If you think mental illness has nothing to do with gun crime then I assume you also think poverty has nothing to do with theft.

You instead want to take away the guns from people who obviously don't get them legally nowadays. You clearly don't get how the world works. Making it illegal to buy guns doesn't stop criminals from getting guns via people who can actually buy them. But I guess you are not smart enough to think that far ahead.

So in that sense they were against the family as an autonomous unit in society.  A very very common thing in totalitarian society is to turn kids against their parents.  So if thats what is meant, then the traditional family is useful in avoiding tyranny.\n\nAlso, i wouldnt say nazi leadership had a good deal of family values personally in any meaningful sense.

        "text": "That is actually incorrect. Nazi Germany of course employed the aesthetic of the traditional family. But they did very much seek to dismantle it or at least that which really makes the traditional family, that being support and loyalty that cannot be controlled by the state. The traditional family can't really exist under fascism because under fascism the state also wants to raise the children. They can't leave that to the family because then they can't controll what the child is learning/if it's being indoctrinated correctly.\n\nThe nazis mainly did this with the Hitler Jugend and the Deutsche Mädel groups, which had a lot of their events strategically placed at times when traditionally families would be having their personal time, namely Sunday during and after church hours (because they also didn't like people going to church). They couldn't openly antagonise the traditional family model, though, because that would have lost them support among Christains and especially conservatives. \nHimmler (I think) actually at one point suggested young soldiers have children outside of their marriages in order to preserve and build the \"arian master race\" and there was actual some outrage from traditionalists, etc (for that and not for the mass murder and deportations that were already going on by this point...). But make no mistake, small power structures are always at odds with one big power-hungry institution, like fascism. And the traditional family is just well suited for that because when it works - and even if it doesn't- it at least temporarily creates unconditional loyalty between a small group of people and a facist dictatorship usually wants all your loyalty to go to them, not to your family.",

        "text": "Just as many Americans feel that Hitler gained the majority of a vote to become the dictator. Just as many Americans feel all Germans were Nazis and loved what transpired. My Grandmother taught many things about living under Nazis control and the fear many Germans lived with. Were there fanatics? Of course. But not all were fanatics. It’s only been the 10 years that I have seen documentaries which told of the story that wasn’t taught in school. She told if a neighbor got angry at you they could report you as being Jewish or a Jewish sympathizer causing you a lot of trouble. She said saying anything bad about Hitler could cost you dearly. She told how the Hitler youth were brainwashed. For that matter a lot of German people were brainwashed. Grandma always said that Americans consider D-Day as the beginning of the liberation of Europe. What they don’t understand was D-Day also was the beginning of Germany being liberated as well. What is also not taught was many European countries and even the U.S. were discriminatory towards the Jewish. Even back when Obama was president and before you would hear about anti-Jewish remarks. So it’s nothing new. The U.S. at one time was very anti-Catholic and many thought Kennedy didn’t have a chance because he was Catholic. Many Americans were in a uproar when Kennedy went to the Vatican and worried if Kennedy would bow before the Pope. And yes I agree the media spreads a lot of this fear mongering. I have heard many claims by media and even democratic leaders concerning gun control where the numbers just don’t add up and that’s just by going to the CDC and FBI numbers or research by the CDC. I have even read other research where thousands of interviews conducted of convicted felons despite a lot of what you hear. For example many felons told thy got their guns of the black market. Felons have said if they suspect a person is armed they prefer to chose another easier target because they don’t want to take a chance of being hurt, killed, or caught. Why they chose to break into one home and another. These are researched and studies conducted by federal agencies and Universities not the NRA which I have a problem with much about what the NRA does. I also believe in common sense gun laws. How ever I do support gun rights as well. Which is why I try to read from unbiased sources. Just like you never hear the Democrats mention that according to the FBI by the latest numbers they have, which doesn’t include 2017 or 2018  but it has shown that over a decade violent crimes have been on a steady decline. I read a source a few months back saying since 2018 there have been over 3000 school shootings. Now I don’t remember the media covering any of it. I dug a little deeper and found that includes shootings within so many thousand feet of a school zone and includes shootings that had nothing to do with school and didn’t involve students or faculty. Like shootings during the summer when the school is shut down, weekends when nothing is going on at the school also at hours of the night and early morning when the school is closed. So many times your not really given the true factors. Or the story is given to where you imagine the information not given. One number I did read from police numbers was that people who legally purchased a firearm committed less than 0.5% of crimes involving firearms. People are lead to believe that AR-15’s are the same as issued to our Troops. That is not a true fact. I recently heard from a politician explains that deer hunters don’t need to hunt deer with an ask-47 because one shot would blow the deer to  smithereens, as he is holding an AK-47 look a like. Once again one shoot would not blow a whole deer to tiny pieces. Plus I know several deer hunters one hunts with a clone AK-47 chambered in a popular deer hunting round. A true AK-47 is a fully automatic rifle. The ones used in the United States are not fully automatics and are not chambered in the Russian combat round. AR-15’s are not fully automatic and when used for deer hunting are chambered in popular deer hunting rounds and not the typical UN combat round. Now why do hunters hunt with AR-15 and AK-47 look a likes?  That’s simple. Why do some people buy a Corvette instead of a normal typical Ford. One because it looks cool. That’s the main reason. It looks cool. You can easily join any gun forum and just by reading you will find that a lot of gun enthusiasts like guns because they love the way it looks. Just some rich people buy cars because they look cool and it is touted of going 0 to 200 miles per hour in a few short seconds. So why should people be allowed to own cars like that. Most of them don’t race cars and except at race track where are you going to legally drive 200 miles per hour. Do you realize how many teens are killed or seriously injured in vehicle accidents per year because they were speeding, under the influence, or texting?  It’s very alarming and yet no one is protesting against such practices.  More kids are killed per year in the United States due to careless driving than by firearms. Yet no one cares now I know there were plenty of guns in the country but as far as I remember I don’t recall any mass school shootings since Columbine. That tells me the problem is far more serious than just“ a gun” problem. I also ask how many kids must die by suicide because they were bullied. I can tell you that in my years of working in an ambulance service I have been sent to more suicides or attempted suicides because they were bullied. As I recall the Florida school shooter had mental issues which by laws already in the books who should not have been able to purchase a gun nor should he have been given easy access to a firearm. But he was also bullied even the girl with the head shaved said she participated in bullying the kid. Which certainly didn’t help matters. Where are the protesters marching for stiffer laws against anyone even kids involved in bullying. I have talked with many psychiatric professionals who have told me bullying probably did play a part in that kids and the Columbine shooters decisions to go to school and shoot students.",

Obama's blame is he just didn't really do anything about it mainly because it is not actually a federal matter and like Trump has found out the President is not actually a dictator even if his party controls all the federal houses.  \n\nThe major problem comes from both sides blaming the other for every problem without coherent plans to fix any of them, federal level politicians on both sides simply trying to score points with their bases without considering the good of the country or even their bases and a belief that the Federal Government actually has the same amount of power at the local level that other countries Federal governments have.  For instance the Republicans have been using gun control to score points against the Democrats for years but don't seem to have realized that right now they could abolish all federal gun control any time they wanted to, and neither has their base.  This will not change local laws at all but would allow local laws to be changed in any state that wanted to.  But they are more interested in using their \"fight\" to protect gun rights to get donations then actually fight for anything.  They are in complete control if they could get their act together they could do anything they want short of constitutional amendments.  Instead talk about \"fighting\" for the things they think their base wants without actually bothering to do any of that work.  Don't get me wrong the Democrats have similar problems when they are in power but at least you sometimes get bread with your circuses from them.",

I talk for experience as an Italian, we had the first fascist government in history and my grandparents were in the communist resistance from 1943. Americans tend to think that dictatorships arise when the government becomes too much powerful, but historically it has always been the opposite. In italy the blackshirts had a free hand to kill trade unionists and socialists because the state wasn't able to provide a security for it's citizens, the fascist were using unregulated weapons (mostly obtained from WW1 veterans) to assert their own justice system. In Germany pretty much the same thing happened with the Freikorps.\nIn short, dictatorships are far more likely to arise thanks to paramilitary squads who can arm themselves freely",

I think they lost about 70K in the first days or weeks. British wasnt that far behind while the germans lost about 20K taking all of France. It was an ant defying a boulder. They knew they lost, and decided to save millions more from death and destruction. At best their navy could look cool somewhere because navel warfare wasn't that big (in european front) and once America got rolling in the war with Japan, navies were just used to move supplies or bombard places.

If Germany had to fight a france that acred like the USSR, there might not even be a france after the war. France didn't have the tactics, manpower, equipment, or anything after the first losses of the war to Germany. It doesn't matter if you have willpower or spirit. If you can't back that up, you will die. And France knew that. That's why a number of colonies and Frenchmen left france to continue the war. They lost the first months of the war, but they knew the tides can turn like it did in the first, and waited and prepared to march onto their homeland to free themselves of the nazis. They lost the battle, but was able to continue the war. That is being smart. If they wasted it all and fought like the SU, then France wouldn't have been able to even resist after the Germans crushed them, much less fight them elsewhere in the world.

France helped with spying on the Germans, hindering them in D-Day (which would have been even more likely to fail without the intel provided by the French resistance cells), if France resisted and Germany crushed every Frenchman they saw, then the war might have lasted even longer with an even higher death toll, or the British may have surrendered leading to a German victory early on and a SU (if invaded at the same time as ours) that would have lost because they wouldn't have been able to stop the now massively larger and even more experienced German military, and Germany would have had as bad supply issues given the fact that no one would stop them from getting oil and other war materials. France fighting on like the Russians or just delaying the surrender for as long as possible would have hurt the war effort so much that people in that timeline would have bashed France even harder for not surrendering sooner.

If the Jews having the right to the means to defend themselves wouldn't have mattered like Ben thinks it would've, then why did hitler bother taking away their guns beforehand? Its because the whole point of the 2nd Amendment is deterance. Yes, odds a civilian armed resistance loses to an invading army are very high, but no army in the world wants to march through and go door to door to arrest or kill people fighting for their homes and their lives. My country has the most advanced military in the World and we still lost so many men doing that during desert storm. Bens arguement holds and you're going to have to do a lot better than some German talking about their opinions when they haven't got a clue about our principles",

Also, the French could've never taken on the British by themselves and they openly admitted so, so in your attempt to try scale down the affect a revolution can have you actually provided an example where a small revolution managed to topple the world's strongest military power at that time and change the worlds power struggle forever. Lol and also the British may not have been defeated as quick, but without the French you still had the biggest deciding factor in that war which is that we did guerilla warfare and didn't really care if you \"captured our capital\" patriots were a bunch of men who knew how to survive in the wilderness and were not afraid to fight for the rest of their lives, while the brits were already tired of fighting by the second skirmish",

Obviously Jewish resistance didn't cause mass casualties the arguement is they could've if they had the means lmao. Im just listing benefits of armed resistances. 2. Getting them to look bad to the entire world, i don't get the point of bringing up all that shit about facism Considering at this point hitler's regime isn't facist yet or at the very least has not been shown to be. Any country who has to fight its own citizens in their own homes looks bad to the rest of the world.  Neighbors like France, Britain, Russia, maybe would've seen Germany's efforts as inheritally dangerous from the start and refrained from appeasement. Point being, the world only saw the atrocities of the holocaust after it was done. 3 and this is far from important but if we are gonna argue about even more distant history, I didn't think I needed to site any specific evidence to show exactly the extent of Britains military influence across the known world at that point. They had the best army, supplemented with the best troops the hessians, they had the biggest navy and the most colonies. Yeah I think tactically speaking France proved to be the victor, but without the perfect theater of war to take advantage of the few weaknesses the British did have, the French would've never been able to beat Britain in a full on head to head war. What they did was they took advantage of an opportunity, which I'm saying is another benefit that armed resistance could have",

That was their appeal in hard times democracy had appeared to fail Germans so they turned to the alternative. Other countries would not have changed their opinions fighting back in largee mumbers would have just validated their propoganda. Reporters still in pre war nazi germany did in fact report these crimes but there was not he public opinion for war especially with people high up harboring fascist tendencies like members of the royal family and elements of the daily mail in the UK. At no point has the UK had the strongest land army. That would have been at time between France and Prussia and possibly the Mughals or China if we are talking a bit later. And again the final part of what you said I think highlights my argument, armed resistance only works in proxy with (generally) the opposing force not fully commited like Britain in America and America in Vietnam. In which case, it is not a very good argument for not regulating guns is it considering that it implies a hypothetical need for armed resistance in the US more important than dealing with all the problems of unregulated guns.",

He was given supreme powers through parliament and he seized the government.\n\nBut, what you are describing is indeed what happened to Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany.

They do not become proven in the first place just because you wish they were true. There were no terrorists among the refugees, they didn't ignore the Constitution on account of following the Torah, and they didn't cause america to stop being a \"Christian Country.\" The last one is made particularly obvious given the ideological descendants of the people who said it are now calling America a Judaeo-Christian country,\" to try to hide the version of that argument from the 1930's. \n\n3. Speaking of which, Ben has plagiarized my examples in his own arguments. Ben performing the condemnation of fascism doesn't change the fact he defends fascist arguments at every opportunity. The latter proves the former a lie, rather than the former making the latter okay. \n\n4. Ben has specifically used the (antisemitic) term JINO. He even got asked about it by Andrew Neil. Further, Judaism is a separate religion from Christianity. Claiming he's acting \"no different than a Christian calling out other Christians for ignoring major parts of the Bible,\" is not a defense of Ben. Further, when Ben attacks Sanders, his most common reasoning is that Sanders does NOT ignore the principle of Tzedakah. \n\n5. I have no idea who either of those people are. Probably the worst lie Ben's told about the Holocaust is his description of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, which described as the proper manner to fight fascism. Note the Warsaw ghetto saw one of the worst survival rates among Ghettos on account of the things Ben praises. There's also his adamant insistence that fascists should not be fought until they're in power (see his comments on punching nazis) excused by pretending a militia (of those too old and/or infirm to travel) would have done anything useful against the Third Reich. You know, the state that proceed to wipe out the french and polish armies right after Ben says it becomes okay to fight them at all. \n\nsame",

It should be her right to have some type of effective defence against criminals, not just pain compliance tools like civilian stun guns, or pepper spray. It just happens that a good defensive tool is also a good offensive tool, if you ban it, only criminals have it, and they use it for offense, if you don't ban it, criminals can have it and use it for offense, but then innocents can also use it for defence.\n\nAnd if we imagine a scenario where the government is tyranical and we should have guns, then the government should REALLY be left out of that, the moment you give the government any control over firearms, whats stopping them from adding \"just this 1 more reasonable measure\" and banning any weapon that could potentially harm the government?\n\nSo i'd say: the left might give lip service to guns, just because so many people have them, but they don't actually support the reasons people have guns",

You can still believe both of those. Like when people really press you on it just be like: I want reasonable gun control, and then when you aren't being pressed on it just be like: What's reasonable gun control? No guns because guns aren't reasonable.\n\nAlso the reason for me saying it's more consistent to want no guns is because some of their premises like:\n- Guns are more dangerous for the defender in a self defense situation than not having one\n- The populous having guns will not prevent a government from becoming tyranical, or limit how tyranical it is\n- Guns are incredibly helpful for committing crimes\n\nIf you have all those premises, then why should anyone own a gun? For hunting? Bow hunters can still take down a bear (Although it is much more difficult).\n\nI don't have the first 2 premises, so I think they are good.",

A dipshit who talks very fast telling people what they should think, and using rhetoric to win people over. Even him saying he's using logic and reason is a rhetorical tactic itself.",

He doesnt give any meaningful exposition on what that is for him (that I've seen so far). Which means I cant come here and argue with ideological enemies. No sparring. I've only seen a few of his videos, but the ones I have seen appear to be catering to the lowest common denominator. The videos pick apart what other people say, but offer nothing else. He reinterprets stats.  \n\nDoes he have strongly held beliefs like me? What are they? If he does, I wish he would explain them. Then I would have something to work with.

It seems like people sometimes ignored these restrictions as well in the hinterlands.\n\nA quirk of nations with conscription systems where everyone did army service is that they're terribly well-armed as a whole. Iraq had a large conventional armed force. Iraq had a number of security forces to balance eachother, and a large armed force with mandatory service.\n\nWhat happens after the US invasion is that the heavy weaponry in the Iraqi army armouries starts to drift.

        "text": "@falcon4186 Countries like Iraq and Libya tend to function around population groups.  They tend to run along ethnic or tribal lines, where the country's leadership either bribes loyalty or tends to oppress them.  In Iraq and Libya Saddam and Qaddafi put opposition leaders in positions of power and relied on corruption to keep them quiet.  Those they couldn't bribe like the Kurds in Iraq were the targets military campaigns and systematically isolated without roads and infrastructure to make their life anywhere from miserable to actively starving them.\n\nIn those countries having guns is fairly normal because they had endemic tribal warfare for centuries, Saddam and Qaddafi didn't oppress people like they did in 1984, trying to control every part of their existence.  In Iraq and Libya, the closer and more loyal you were to the regime, the more benefits you got, but in exchange there was no freedom of the press, there was no free vote and you had few if any rights.  Saddam and Qaddafi controlled the country, the resources and the purse, most of the money went towards them and the elites that kept them in power.\n\nEverything was riddled with corruption, nothing could be done without having to pay off somebody.  The country was inefficient because inefficiency is the greatest tool for a dictator, the less organized everything is, the less of a threat it is to the leader.  That's why they had big armies that were useless.  On paper Iraq could have wiped the floor with Iran's army which was in a terrible state after the Shah had fallen.  They were so to speak sending kids and old men with nothing more than bad breath to fight the Iraqis and for a decade the Iraqi army failed to break Iran and it remained a stalemate.\n\nFor the average person life was not horrible, but not great either.  You could make some money, but opportunities were few and reserved for those loyal to the party.  If you were a bit too critical of the regime you might get beaten up a few times by the police, if you actively criticized the regime you might end up in a really bad place or vanish for ever.  If you belonged to a minority, things were much worse and you might live in a permanent state of insurrection.\n\nWeapons were not a direct threat to the regime.  Leaders were, organized resistance was a threat, foreign intervention was a threat, somebody who had a power base might be a threat etc.",

The nazis nationalized large portions of the economy ( party controlled businesses)  and forced companies to share wealth to other businesses within their industry. As far as economic policy the Nazis were socialists. Nazis were against free markets as hitler saw free market s as the tool of Jews to control industry. Makes sense that authoritarian governments don’t care for free market. Trump is very much pro-free market.We saw some prison reform under trump for non violent drug offenders. Sure Trump did tighten border security but I want you to find another country that isn’t selective with immigration because Canada and Scandinavian countries, often used as examples for pro socialism, are VERY selective for who they allow to immigrate. Trump is a douchebag for sure but calling him fascist is just stupid and shows how little people actually know about actual fascism. US government in general has been continuing to expand its power since we first started the country with more recent authoritarian actions including the 1994 crime bill, patriot act, NSA spying, and HR-127 being introduced. But it’s still far from what fascism would be considered.",

Pretty far to the left here, but having growing up in the country, I'm  hesitant to get on board the usual anti-gun platform. It's frustrating how little my peers on the left have actually thought deeply about the issue, especially in terms of whether or not the things they advocate for would even have the effect that they claim. The right doesn't usually stoop to Carson's foolish Nazi argument, but man, they sure need a better argument than \"What if the government starts oppressing people!\" The skin-deep arguments from most on both sides end up being self-defeating; they just make the other side roll their eyes and double down on the ideology.

        "text": "@TaraRoseGarden The bolshevik revolt is not the first revolt in Russia at the time. It's important to remember that a lot of factions in Russa wanted the tsar gone in different ways. The more liberal duma got its reform attempts shut down by the absolute power of the tsar. The officer corps didn't like how the war progressed, and the absolute power of the tsar meant he also had absolute responsibility. The duma was pro-entante and wanted to continue the war. An external force, the Great War, had already started breaking down the tsar's authority.\n\nThe bolsheviks are the ones with large parts of the army behind them. When you form soldier-councils and worker-councils who decide that they would rather not fight the Great War and they're down for shooting officers if necessary it's hard to stop things. You can't tell the revolting army to arrest itself. Eventually they win the civil war.\n\nA quirk of these mass conscript armies in Europe is that they're made up of an almost complete cross-section of the male population, like if you took entire generations of men. The entante powers and Germany had the same concerns, their armies were also starting to teeter. There was mutinies in local units, several units of the french army had started to refuse moving forward. They didn't turn and march on Paris or shoot officers but they refused to do anything but hold their positions.",

The Vietnam Viet Kong took considerable losses against a superior enemy (US and South Vietnam Forces) and yet won the war. BTW Armored  units are not all that good when fighting guerrillas and citizens  because they rely on more resources than just regular infantry. Ex: Parts for repair such as rubber, plate metal, bullet proof windows ect. Gasoline, means of being able to travel through a war zone safely. Continues maintenance so they don't break down. Not to mention they are really slow and limited maneuverability.  Where as a regular guerilla soldier just needs food, water, and a basic weapon. Don't get me wrong they (Armored units) make huge difference but they're not the ultimate deciding factor.",

They had very important state sponsor.\nThe Viet Kong Wikipedia article  mentions North Vietnam, China and the Soviet Union as state sponsors. The Vietnam War Wikipedia article also mentions North Korea and the Eastern Bloc countries as belligerents in this war.\nThe Weapons of the Vietnam War Wikipedia article writes that\n\"Communist forces were principally armed with Chinese and Soviet weaponry though some VC guerrilla units were equipped with Western infantry weapons either captured from French stocks during the first Indochina war, such as the MAT-49, or from ARVN units or requisitioned through illicit purchase.\n\nIn the summer and fall of 1967, all Viet Cong battalions were reequipped with arms of Soviet design such as the AK-47 assault rifle and the RPG-2 anti-tank weapon. Their weapons were principally of Chinese or Soviet manufacture.\"\n\nSince I'm from an Eastern Bloc country I heard and read many things from this war.\nFor example my grandma had to work on Saturdays to aid the Viet Kong. These plus workings days called \"Vietnámi műszak\" were not payed because all the profit went to aid of the Viet Kongs.\nIf you search this term they will refer the Viet Kongs as \"szabadsáért küzdő indokínai nép\" and you will mostly find newspaper articles from the late 1960s bragging about how many a given factory made for the Viet Kongs.\nFor example the Viet Kong (and the North Vietnam) snipers used a lot of Hungarian made Mosin Nagant rifles. These rifles were made in the late 1940s and early 1950s by the very militaristic government of Rákosi.\nRákosi loved to waste money and resources on the military. This money and resources could have made a better life for us but they were spent on these useless weapons.. In the 1960s they gifted this to the Viet Kong. You can see these rifles in the NRA museums.\nAlso we made a lot of grenades (copies of the ww2 grenades) in the 1940s and gave some of it to the Viet Kongs but I haven't found any sources for that on the internet.\n\nSoo to sum up:\nThe Viet Kongs had a lot of very important and powerful state sponsors who sometimes exploited their citizens to aid this war. The Viet Kongs did not fight with their own weapons. They fought with sophisticated weapons (see the Ak-47 or the RPG-2) provided by other states, mainly North Vietnam and China but had minor state sponsors like Hungary who gave them their surplus war material.",

        "text": "@Songbird645 Sorry I've been busy all week. I don't recall the Viet Kong having air support or tanks. And if they were given guns so what? Were Russian and Chinese soldiers actively fighting against the south and US? Did they send a Navy to block supply from sea, did they shoot down American planes from the sky. If no then they not be included in the conversation. Its like me(Viet Kong) going to the gun store(Russia) and buying a gun to protect myself. The Gun store is just a supplier not really supporting unlike what the Americans did for the south support.\n\n Whats the deadlier weapon an AK-47 (most common stereo typical weapon of the Viet Kong) or a AR-15 (most common stereotypical weapon of the U.S citizen)? Nothing their both deadly. And given that Americans have owned their weapons most if not all their life. I say they would be twice as deadly as the Viet Kong with their sophisticated weapons. Especially since they have the privilege of choosing their own personal choice of weapon and personally added on attachments like scopes, grips, and extra mags. \n\nTo sum it up. You are right If the Russians and Chinese didn't supply them with guns they would've lost reason being they had no guns. Now Americans have guns and ammunition so their is no need no necessity for foreign government intervention. Americans can fight on their own.\n\n\"Privately owned guns do much more harm to the US citizens than good. For example Japan has very strict gun laws, few guns in private ownership and  a very low gun death ratio and I don't see as much tyranny in Japan than in the US.\" The Japanese never really had a gun culture so the gun death ratio has always been low. Also I don't know if they are living under government Tyranny but I bet a ton of those gun deaths are coming from government officials. \n\nWhat about the UK they have tough gun laws and now locking people up for hate speech. And that is a strong indicator for government tyranny.\n\n I don't know about you but I don't trust strangers and I don't like my things being taken away form me. that attitude goes both ways towards regular citizen and government officials alike. Especially here in the U.S police violence is becoming more and more common I don't like it I don't feel safe. My small town sheriff was found guilty of child molestation. Its scary for me to imagine if he was the only one in the town with a gun.",

Take Warsaw for instance.\n\nIt was a noble stand against the Nazis. Undeniably! And some would argue they were very successful.\n\nBUT.\n\nYou have to remember who they were opposing initially. It wasn't 1st rate or even 2nd rate troops. They were military police and support elements. As soon as actual combat personnel came into the picture, Warsaw fell almost immediately.\n\nEngland and Ireland is a complex situation with a lot of nuance that can't easily be explored in the confines of a youtube comment. However, all things being equal, it wasn't so much the guns and bombs that decided everything but other factors. .  And keep in mind, the UK STILL holds Northern Ireland.",

Germany is a socialist people’s state. And it is not the case that we think England is the richest land on earth. There are lords and City men in England who are in fact the richest men on earth. The broad masses, however, see little of this wealth. We see in England an army of millions of impoverished, socially enslaved, and oppressed people. Child labor is still a matter of course there. They have only heard about social welfare programs. Parliament occasionally discusses social legislation. Nowhere else is there such terrible and horrifying inequality as in the English slums. Those with good breeding take no notice of it. Should anyone speak of it in public, the press, which serves plutocratic democracy, quickly brands him the worst kind of rascal. They do not hesitate to make major changes in the Constitution if they are necessary to preserve capitalist democracy.\" - Joseph Goebbels, England's Guilt.\n\n\"If white supremacists/neo-nazis are all left-wing, why do NONE of them consider themselves such?\"\n\nThere's so much wrong with this it isn't even farqing funny. And I say this as someone who spent years tracking them and other hate groups.\n\nFirstly\n\nA: Anybody who thinks Neo-Nazi is synonymous with White Supremacist doesn't know much. Both are utter scum, but there are plenty of White Supremacists that aren't Neo-Nazis (the old school Klan are an example. Ever try reading \"The Turner Diaries?\" It's hateful bilge by American Neo-Nazis fantasizing about the genocide of everybody they don't like.\n\nIncluding Sheetheads.)\n\nB: There HAVE been plenty of undeniable White Supremacist Leftists. Don't believe me?\n\nTake a farqing look at the Rand Rebellion.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rand_Rebellion\n\n\"The racist aspect was typified by the slogan; \"Workers of the world, unite and fight for a white South Africa!\" and by several pogroms against blacks.\"\n\nObviously not everybody involved in the rebellion was a racist (or even a Leftist given the Reformed Chruch's influence on miners). But a number of them were.\n\nand\n\nC: Most people are so utterly uninformed about White Supremacist, Neo-Nazi, and Paleo-Nazi or Fascist rhetoric that they have no farqing idea what they say. And you can see that from the proliferation of fake Hitler quotes and whatnot to try and pander to different policies.\n\nI know Mussolini defined his movement as a turn towards \"the right\" from where things were before, but it is mentioned a grand total of once in his ideological manifesto (\"The Doctrine of Fascism\") and I know it because I know where to look.\n\nAnd it gets easily drowned out by Musso's discussion about the socialist roots of Fascist doctrine.\n\nHow many others can say the same?\n\n\"Why did the white supremacist Richard Spencer decide to call the movement he's attempting to build the altright and not the altleft?\"\n\nBecause Spencer's a parasite who jumped onto the label after Murray Rothbart (who has his own big problems) coined it.\n\n\"The right believes in the preservation of hierarchical social relations based on class, race, and gender. Fascists embody that belief system and take it to its most extreme logical conclusion. \"\n\nTranslation:\n\nYou have not the slightest farqing idea what Fascism is except what's been repeated to you at rote.\n\nBut you are going to pretend you do anyway.\n\nNo, Fascists did NOT support the *PRESERVATION* of hierarchical social relations. They were revolutionaries who favored OVERTHROWING the existing hierarchical social relations and building different ones. Mostly a hybrid national goulash of a community governed by a party.\n\n\"The Fascist negation of socialism, democracy, liberalism, should not, however, be interpreted as implying a desire to drive the world backwards to positions occupied prior to 1789, a year commonly referred to as that which opened the demo-liberal century. History does not travel backwards. The Fascist doctrine has not taken De Maistre as its prophet. Monarchical absolutism is of the past, and so is ecclesiolatry. Dead and done for are feudal privileges and the division of society into closed, uncommunicating castes. Neither has the Fascist conception of authority anything in common with that of a police ridden State.\" -Benito Mussolini, the Doctrine of Fascism.\n\nhttp://www.worldfuturefund.org/wffmaster/Reading/Germany/mussolini.htm\n\nFascism defined itself as a merger of elements between the Right and the Left to create a hybrid movement that originated from Marxist Socialism, but which rejected Marxist internationalism as well as many other things.\n\nHence why it is also called a \"Third Way\" or \"Third Positionism.\"\n\nHence we have Hitler's own pithy...\n\n\"In our movement the two extremes come together: the Communists from the Left and the officers and students from the Right. These two have always been the most active elements. \"\n\n\"Castroy64, stop being a fucking worthless cud-chewing fool and learn something.

You tell me my definition of Puppet state and genocide well let look at North Korea, main contributor in keeping that place afloat, China, are their Chinese companies in North Korea, yes there are, an Air port that links, the two countries, a ski resort paid in chinese money, and ow Kim give his good citizens houses which is still owned by said government, but ignore the work camps, and poor farmer outside of Pyongyang, they are not important, because we are rich, just like China oh but ignore China those Tibetans, and Manchurians, they don't know anything.

        "text": "Nick\nLets look at what one if not the most credited historian regarding Hitler has to say regarding this\n''[Hitler] was wholly ignorant of any formal understanding of the principles of economics. For him, as he stated to the industrialists, economics was of secondary importance, entirely subordinated to politics. His crude social-Darwinism dictated his approach to the economy, as it did his entire political “world-view.” Since struggle among nations would be decisive for future survival, Germany’s economy had to be subordinated to the preparation, then carrying out, of this struggle. This meant that liberal ideas of economic competition had to be replaced by the subjection of the economy to the dictates of the national interest. Similarly, any “socialist” ideas in the Nazi programme had to follow the same dictates. Hitler was never a socialist. But although he upheld private property, individual entrepreneurship, and economic competition, and disapproved of trade unions and workers’ interference in the freedom of owners and managers to run their concerns, the state, not the market, would determine the shape of economic development. Capitalism was, therefore, left in place. But in operation it was turned into an adjunct of the state.''\nIan Kershaw",

It's dangerous and violent language.\n\nI notice you completely ignored my point: Barack Obama did not enter office claiming that conservative media was \"the enemy of the American people\", nor repeat the claim on a near-daily basis. He didn't make vague threats about his supporters being \"very tough people\", encourage his supporters to beat up protesters, etc. Yes, you can find examples of fed-up liberals fighting back with violent rhetoric. But nothing remotely like the language Trump is using has come from liberal Presidents (or the last few conservative Presidents!).\n\nIt's obvious that you can't answer that point. This President is wholly different in kind, and his language is very violent.\n\nThe right may not be getting more powerful; that remains to be seen. It is, however, becoming a lot more accommodating of ultra-right-wing, racist conspiracy theories like \"The Great Replacement\" and \"white genocide\", and the President is a contributing actor to that development.\n\nTrump using eliminationist language like \"invasion\" and \"infest\" is no accident. That you would lay the blame for it on the \"far left\" is really twisted.\n\nBut if you agree with Trump that I should not be considered among \"the American people\", I can't really say I'm surprised.

You have provided no examples, and you refuse to acknowledge that Trump's rhetoric has rendered liberals as outside of \"the American people\", or that Obama never approached saying something similar to that about conservatives.\n\nThe President of the United States, the leader of conservatism in the U.S., routinely speaks of refugees as \"invaders\". He has referred to people fleeing violence or extreme poverty using the word \"infest\". He routinely refers to liberals as if we are illegitimate citizens who hate \"real Americans\" and want they to be killed by the \"invaders\" \"infesting\" the country.\n\nIn one hand, you say hatred is no big deal, then on the other, you say the left is more hateful. Which is it? Hate is no big deal when it comes from the right, but when it comes from the left, it is? Then you say free speech matters more.\n\nI have said nothing about restricting speech. Neither does the video you are responding to. We are responding to hateful speech with arguments about why it is dangerous, in the hopes that people will wake up to the harm their hatred is spreading. Is it wrong for hateful speech to be criticised, and dehumanizing, othering language to be called out for what it is and the atmosphere it creates?\n\nThat doesn't sound like a society where freedom of speech is valued very highly to me.",

How exactly is compromise possible, given that he chose from the jump to label half of the country as not \"real Americans\"?

        "text": "Actually, _unarmed_ (white) Americans defended escaped slaves and freedmen on the streets of Boston.  Slave catchers came north, sometimes after a specific escapee, sometimes looking for whomever they could catch, and abolitionist gangs would beat them senseless if they tried to enter the city.  They could do this, not because they had guns, but because they were the majority, and they knew a Boston jury would never convict an abolitionist for assaulting a slave catcher.  That was what the Fugitive Slave Act was about, forcing Northern state governments to help and protect slave catchers.  As long as you have the law and the majority on your side, you don't need guns, and without them, guns aren't going to protect a minority.",

I think the strongest points in this video are that there were only 200,000 Jews in Germany after early migration. And that at what point would they have effectively taken up arms? Last point. Ben Shapiro is an anomaly among Jews. His arguments for religion, and with Christian iconography, is the antithesis of how Orthodox Jews view religion. We do not proselytize. Ben Shapiro and Dennis Prager do. They are more like the Jews for Jesus cult. No idea how they got raised so badly. And. It’s possible to detest both Ben Shapiro and the aggressive woke nonsense bleeding from universities (and weirdly Canada and England.). See the Sam Harris’ podcast “Making Sense”. Especially the episode with Bill Maher.",

They only had to survive long enough so the Vietnamnese and American people would realise that the war is pointless. The Nazi burned down Warsaw during the Uprising '44. And when 13.000 Jewish men rebelled in the Warsaw Ghetto, the Nazis just liquidated it. 13.000 Jewish resistance members dead, and how many Nazis? 100-150. And btw., the Vietcong were almost brought down in 1968. The NVA, AN OFFICIAL MILITARY WITH TANKS, AIR FORCE AND SOVIET FINANCIAL SUPPORT, took the brunt of the Vietnam War.\n\nThe Taliban fights similar, they hold no village and only attack occasionally a U.S. Patrol. But they hold nothing anymore. They hide in caves. If you want a real life example where the U.S. hands weren't tied look at ISIS. They don't occupy a single village anymorw and are almost obliterated.",

Now which side do you think has more money and a more stable economic system? A previously established yet tyranical and subjugating goverment or a large rebel force that is fighting for whats right but that does not have the organization or coordinationof a previously established nation? Now lets give the big corporations of America the benefit of the doubt and say 50% of them would forego profits to help the justice soldiers. That means that    tyranical government would still have control over 50% of the production factors, and would already own a very large army and equipment. They would not hesitate to secure a quick end to a war by destroying some (not all) production  facilities.",

        "text": "@Caffeine_Addict_2020 oh no... I don't even have my degree yet and it's doable. For heat seeking you know what's the hardest part? It's literally the glass dome. You need a special kind of glass to narrow the spectrum of IR light that can get through but the rest is commonly available. In college we made a wheeled robot that would seek a lighter flame.\r\nIt's relatively simple, look up the Sidewinder story, it's a marvel of simplicity. A spinning reticle \"chops\" the signal with alternated opaque and transparent sections and a translucent section to normalize the signal. This gives you both the direction the seeker needs to turn and the relative angle to the boresight. Then the control of the missile wasn't even computerized, the missile would be steered by the seeker turning in the plane's direction. But that was with 1950's tech, these days you can put one of those cheap \"system on a chip\" boards and actually computerize the control and the seeker itself. Instead of using spin-scan reticles you could use mirrors to make a rosette seeker, and since the chip will have memory you can use it as a pseudo-imager and feed it code to allow it to reject flares.\r\n\r\nRadar, that's slightly out of my league because I know very little about the field of communications so emitting radio waves isn't really my forte, but even freaking Matlab has a module to program solid state phased array. There's some tutorials on ranging radar online but it's more about a fixed tripod mounted radar that pings a range, then you move it sideways and ping it again, move, ping, etc until you get an almost \"bird's eye view\" of the place you're in, which is kinda neat but too simplistic and underpowered. Again it's not my forte so I don't even know the best way to output a powerful signal, but the principle could be employed on a mechanically moved antenna feeding the information into a computer. The tracking can be achieved through monopulse, I guess.\r\n\r\nI know the mechanical and chemistry side, I'd need an electronics guy or else it would take me forever to learn all that shit. So you wouldn't need a team of 1000. If anything, the actual teams of \"brains\" working for Lockheed-Martin and Raytheon are probably limited to teams of 10-20 people on each project, and it's mostly for redundancies and having trainees around so they can take over the older guys' positions when they retire. And their job actually involves shit that it's going to be sold for half a million per unit because it's expected to work from -70ºC to +50ºC conditions, pass salt-water tests and it has to work with a huge degree of certainty and also there's generals who will obviously get jobs there when they retire from active duty so they charge the government five times what it should actually cost due to corruption. A \"rebel\" missile? Who cares about perfect reliability lol just launch 5 of them, if one of them hits you spent 5,000 dollars to bring down a 80+ million dollar plus plane and endanger a pilot that costs millions to train. You could actually do it with two people, and I'm kinda dumb so...",

        "text": "Alright so you are a student, I was a student not too long ago, maybe I was a bit critical. As a student everything looked simple, I can sympathize. I'll point out a couple issues with your response. I don't know a ton about missiles so bear with me:\n\nBuilding a car that moves in the direction of a flame is easy: on the ground you have a ton of stabilizing forces that you don't have in the air. For instance, the lateral force of the tires prevent the car from spinning out of control whereas in a missile you don't have that. In addition, a missile (thrust coming from the aft) is dynamically unstable so that problem is compounded. Basically, if you need to turn the missile the thruster is actively fighting against you. The algorithm needed to figure this out would probably take a team of people. \n\nYou need a team to develop the engine. You need a team to develop the materials/shell of the aircraft. You need a team to develop the aerodynamics of the missile which, i'd argue, is the most difficult part. You need a team to develop the launcher (how do you launch the missile out of the tube without killing your man on the ground). You need a team to develop the computer brains - you mentioned MATLAB as a possible solution. MATLAB is a modeling tool. You never want to design a system that relies on MATLAB that you need to move faster than 2x a second, it's built for accuracy not speed. You need some sort of embedded chip, arduino's probably even too slow for what the missile would need to do. If you're developing your own antenna, you pretty much need a PHD for that; antenna's are notoriously difficult to design, it's basically wizardry. You'd need a team to develop the cooling and general thermodynamics. You'd need a team to develop all the electronics (launch, sensors, power supplies, etc.). You'd need a team to develop the payload/explosive system. You're right, maybe I overestimated the amount of people who would need to work on it, alot of these jobs could be done by 1 or a couple people. But it would take a long time, to develop it in, say, a year you'd need more people which would require managers and possibly managers of managers. Doubling the amount of people on a project doesn't halve the production time, it doesn't do close to that because there's always communication breakdowns between people working on things related toeach other",

I was pointing out how the \"brain\" of the missile, which is the most complex part, isn't even that hard to make.\n\n\"a missile (thrust coming from the aft) is dynamically unstable so that problem is compounded\" - there are literally dozens of videos here on youtube of people achieving stabilization of rockets through various means, including computerized ones.\n\n\"The algorithm needed to figure this out would probably take a team of people\" - I'm sorry, what?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuikoTp6HyA\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnUfsLCa8h8\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kd64VE3A1c (\"SpaceX style\")\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUgAvma_vBc\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp4mH3qZfFs\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7OqOj7GHuc\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrkwjZ_23l8\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj2EwQLwmN4\n\nSeveral individuals have managed it as a hobby....\n\n*NOT TO MENTION THAT FOR EXAMPLE THE SIDEWINDER MISSILE IS INHERENTLY INSTABLE BY DESIGN* - Roll is prevented by rollerons and pitch and yaw \"stabilization\" is always being achieved through constant updates of the seeker. That is why the AIM-9 Sidewinder jitters along the way, it constantly fights instability created by its own control system. The original Sidewinder did not even have an algorithm as the missile control was purely electrical - putting a computer running code inside the missile in the 1950's would have been nearly impossible due to cost and size/weight.\n\n\"You need a team to develop the engine\" - This isn't the Apollo program. Good thing that the basics have been covered by so many people: http://ddeville.com/derek/Qu8k.html and mind that the Qu8k is a high performance beast that achieved 121,000 ft VERTICALLY, which is completely overkill and over-engineered for a guerrilla surface-to-air missile. You're not trying to take out SR-71s, but targets of opportunity.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8dovKYULEQ - this is a sugar powered rocket and the first stage got to 20,000 feet. Second stage got over 40,000. Omit the second stage and replace it by explosive payload. Lethal at 20,000 feet? Sounds good to me.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=959E5Oh7gPM - look at this absolute unit. I'm in awe at the size of this lad. It's a freaking wood structure and the motor casing seems to be steel tubing with end-cap and nozzle bolted on their respective end.\n\n\"You need a team to develop the materials/shell of the aircraft\" -  Aluminum and fiberglass, the classics. The video I shown above has literally a rocket built out of wood and steel.\n\n\"You need a team to develop the aerodynamics of the missile which, i'd argue, is the most difficult part\" - http://www.military-today.com/missiles/aim120_amraam.jpg one of the deadliest, highest-performing missiles in service and it's literally a 7 inch tube my dude.\n\n\"how do you launch the missile out of the tube without killing your man on the ground\" - remote firing? I was actually thinking of a missile fired off the back of a truck with a support vehicle carrying the antenna so you could move around the country with the radar turned off to remain undetected, similar to the tactics used by the Serbs to shoot down the F-117 Nighthawk. But if we're talking about cheap, short range and man-portable IR seeking missiles yeah, line up 2-3 tubes several meters apart, a few kilometers away from an airstrip - when you expect a take off or landing, run into cover and have the firing trigger run off a long wire. If one explodes hopefully you set them up in a way that the explosion doesn't disturb the others and you got yourself an 80 million dollar crater right outside the airbase.\n\n\"You never want to design a system that relies on MATLAB that you need to move faster than 2x a second\" - obviously it's for setting up the phased array. I don't think anyone would feed the data into matlab.\n\n\"You'd need a team to develop all the electronics (launch, sensors, power supplies, etc.)\" - I'm sure one can get away with the use of off the shelf components. You know, like the amateur rockets I already posted video evidence of.\n\n\"You'd need a team to develop the payload/explosive system\" - explosives ain't hard, though. The most complex part would be the proximity sensor. And even that can be made out of off the shelf components.",

        "text": "Alright, so alot of your reply seems to center around hobby-rockets. But there is a large difference between hobby-rockets and a SAM. Mainly, hobbyists only need to get their rocket to go straight up, which is easy, and I will explain why:\n\n1. If a rocket is going straight up, you don't care about turning, you don't care about changes in atmospheric pressure (dynamic and/or static, yes both are very important. This is why every aircraft has a pitot-tube on it, a very simple piece of technology that hasn't really changed since the beginning of aeronautics), you don't care about changes to aircraft mass due to loss in fuel. I'll break these down further:\na. turning: hobby-rockets don't need to turn, this is a huge deal. They can always assume gravity is below them and the code generally only needs to correct instability. With turning, you need to push the missile into an unstable mode and then stabilize it again. I don't think this is as simple as you think it is, especially since the missile would need to do this many times a second in order to be effective\nb. pressure changes: the affect of your control surfaces (ie. the rollerons) changes based on your current altitude. Also, this changes with your current airspeed (not groundspeed) Again, not really a problem for rockets, and these are two important sensor reads\nc. changes in mass: as you lose fuel from the rocket the behavior changes\nThese issues are probably not difficult to solve, but there's always some bullshit  problem that complicates these things\nd. Missiles can't use solid propellant, i believe. A missile needs to throttle it's speed, you don't want it going full speed into a sharp turn. Throttling speed is another added complication. Also there may be added storage concerns for liquid fuel, like keeping it cooled before/during launch. You're probably not going to want to \ne. none of these rockets have payloads. Explosives are going to add significant weight to any rocket design. Explosives to blow up a jet weigh significantly more than a gopro\n\n2. \"This isn't the apollo program\" in this point you miss the difference between rockets and missiles again. You're not making a sugar rocket, weight is too important. You're not catching a jet, or even helicopter using an inferior fuel like sugar. Again, a rocket that goes to 20k feet is not lethal at 20k feet, unless you get incredibly lucky and the jet just happens to end up at the exact spot that your rocket is ending up\n\n3. materials: fair, but keep in mind that rockets don't undergo as many g's as a missile. undergoing a 90 degree turn at even half of rocket speed would probably destroy most wooden/fiberglass rockets. It's probably going to be steel or aluminum in the end. But I think you're right, I overcomplicated this point\n\n4. \"It's literally a 7 inch tube my dude\" - aerodynamics don't work like that, this is a drastic oversimplifcation. Everything is designed very exactly, and if you don't have the specific locations of all the internals and dimensions of the control surfaces a picture is next to useless. You may know the general location of everything, but unlessyou have a model to measure out that's useless. Aerodynamics is a fickle bitch; moving a fuel tank 1 inch in any direction is going to drastically change the manueverability of an aircraft. There's a reason other countries buy american systems rather than develop their own, shits complicated yo\n\n5. \" missile fired off a truck\" good points here, didn't think of that\n\n6. I guess I misunderstood you then, I'm not sure what you meant by phased array. Can you clarify? Also good that you realized MATLAB sucks at real-time computations, I had a friend who was incredibly smart who decided to develop an arduino/MATLAB hybrid for a project and was shocked when its update speed sucked ass\n\n7. Yes you can buy COTS products, the issue comes when combining them together. Making sure there's no noise on components (capacitive/inductive balancing or filters), making sure all your components are getting the correct voltage/current, making sure your servos are electrically isolated from your sensors/the rest of your system, etc etc. I'm sure an electrical engineer would have more to say, but no it's not just as simple as inserting components into a breadboard\n\n8.  \"eplosives ain't hard\" true. But getting them to explode at the right time and just the idea of them existing in the missile complicate things beyond rockets\n\nAlright I see I missed a couple ofyour points and I don't feel like renumbering so I'm just going to continue with:\n\n9. \"brain isn't complicated\" again there are many, many more complications between missiles and rockets. In addition to what I explained above you also need to add in the ir sensing and calculating the velocity/acceleration of the craft. You're not aiming for where the aircraft is, but rather where it should be. This is not trivial, trust me. PID is another one of those witchcraft algorithms, that shit can get you lost in the weeds real quick. I've never designed a PID (PD,PI, or whatever combo) that I've been satisfied with. It's a challenge to make a decent one, I don't know how to make a great one\n\n10. \"stabilization\" yes rocket stabilization is relatively easy, missile not as much. I enjoyed all the links, learned alot. I just want to point out that most of those did not use arduinos as you originally suggested, there was just that one guy. The reason being that arduinos were designed  for ease of use, not speed, not accuracy, not power, not GPIO, etc. Its a general purpose chip, and as such you rarely want to use it in a finalized product, almost anything is better. Also, arduinos vary alot based on where you buy them. I'm not even going to get into knockoffs, but OFFICIAL arduinos even vary based on when/which of the two split companies you buy them from. I've had SeVERE problems with them changing components out for no fucking reason - they changed a powersupply which completely fucked their Analog reference voltage, so sensor reads werejust bouncing all over the place\n\n11.\"sidewinder stuff\" I don't know anything about the original sidewinder, do you haveany sources on that? I find it hard to believe a missile was run purely analog that had any sort of seeking, but I could be wrong. A computer is very, very different from an embedded chip. Embedded chips have been around for a while",

        "text": "@Caffeine_Addict_2020 1. a) b) c) it's important to understand that early missile command was very simplistic. For example the issue of air density changing with altitude was solved by ditching pressure sensors and rather than giving a set angle to the canards, they have them a set torque. This would mean less deflection in dense air, more deflection in thin air. I actually had to look this up and got results for the book \"Sidewinder: Creative Missile Development at China Lake\r\" by Ron Westrum and the team behind the first Sidewinder actually had 30 scientists/engineers and 12 technicians which is pretty impressive considering that today a team basically only needs to use the existing literature and they had to solve never-seen problems with 1950's technology. The same book also states they wanted to make the missile as \"independent\" of aerodynamics as possible.\r\nd) You can use solid fuel and oxidizer in a hybrid system that allows you to throttle. (pretty long but there's a sequence showing how they built the hybrid engine https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJppeRWSD94) I don't know what would happen to commercial Nitrous Oxide sources if they were being used in missiles and the synthesis seems to not be worth it and I don't know if straight oxygen can be used. But that's not really important because many missiles do actually use solid fuel. Most missiles do not use any throttle, they typically fire everything they have for a few seconds and then coast. That's why pilots are trained in defeating missiles kinetically. While ECM, chaff, flares, etc are extremely well-developed systems they're not silver bullets (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzsbG4WX2R8) and it's preferable to use maneuvers that waste kinetic energy and prevent the missile from even getting near. You control the burn properties with the shape of the grain and that's it.\r\ne) Very true which is why I think the performance of those amateur rockets are impressive. Even if I cut performance in half, it could still catch a plane in some phases of flight.\r\n\r\n2. I'm kinda putting an emphasis on vertical performance because the intention is track planes as they pass overheat and try to make a launch that basically tries to \"meet\" the plane on its way, not try to make a \"horizontal chase\". It wouldn't be luck, just observation and patience. Besides, stealth is a thing now and planes will be shaped to minimize their signature in the next decades but the bottom of the plane will always be relatively flat and give the most reflection.\r\n\r\n4. Well, shit is complicated because i) everything has to be certified to the umpteenth degree even to the smallest part - you can't simply purchase bolts at a hardware store - there's security clearances involved, etc ii) For example NATO systems have to be compatible in a way that allows a French airplane with a Swedish radar to detect a target for a German aircraft firing an American missile so things tend to get centralized to the major arms manufacturers iii) we're talking about national defense and things have to be very reliable. So of course that most countries will not give this job to college kids when a malfunction on a missile can kill personnel in case of catastrophic failure or even worse, allow an enemy to pass through the faulty defenses and destroy a factory or a military base. But when you're firing a thousand dollar tube for a chance of burning several millions of dollars, a \"college level\" project is fine.\r\n\r\n6. Basically there's the \"analog\" antenna which sends a beam, typically a metallic structure with a parabolic shape. A phased array is several emitters on a flat dish, and by phasing the emitters you add the emission in the direction you want while cancelling the signal in directions you don't want it to go. Instead of pointing the antenna at what you want to beam the flat dish can manipulate the beam to point in the intended direction without moving. I don't even know if one could purchase the actual small emitters or make them, my point was that even high-tech stuff like complicated radar control can be modeled through software.\r\n\r\n7. That's definitely true but even simple projects have issues such as isolating signals from noise. There's challenges, but people more used to electronics can do it.\r\n\r\n8. The fuse can be a challenge. Thinking about it, I think the best bet would be a laser proximity sensor with a small radar sensor backup because even though it increases the complexity  to manage two sensor types it would be a massive waste to have a missile work perfectly and then get a near miss that doesn't explode. To make sure it goes off one could have the detonator control linked to multiple blasting caps to make sure there is no dud.\r\n\r\n9. and 11. I'll quote wikipedia: \"The Sidewinder is not guided on the actual position recorded by the detector, but on the change in position since the last sighting. So if the target remained at 5 degrees left between two rotations of the mirror, the electronics would not output any signal to the control system. Consider a missile fired at right angles to its target; if the missile is flying at the same speed as the target, it should \"lead\" it by 45 degrees, flying to an impact point far in front of where the target was when it was fired. If the missile is traveling four times the speed of the target, it should follow an angle about 11 degrees in front. In either case, the missile should keep that angle all the way to interception, which means that the angle that the target makes against the detector is constant. It was this constant angle that the Sidewinder attempted to maintain. This \"proportional pursuit\" system is very easy to implement, yet it offers high-performance lead calculation almost for free and can respond to changes in the target's flight path,[7] which is much more efficient and makes the missile \"lead\" the target.\" -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_navigation-- --- \"A rather simple hardware implementation of this guidance law can be found in early AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles. These missiles use a rapidly rotating parabolic mirror as a seeker. Simple electronics detect the directional error the seeker has with its target (an IR source), and apply a moment to this gimballed mirror to keep it pointed at the target. Since the mirror is in fact a gyroscope it will keep pointing at the same direction if no external force or moment is applied, regardless of the movements of the missile. The voltage applied to the mirror while keeping it locked on the target is then also used (although amplified) to deflect the control surfaces that steer the missile, thereby making missile velocity vector rotation proportional to line of sight rotation. Although this does not result in a rotation rate that is always exactly proportional to the LOS-rate (which would require a constant airspeed), this implementation is equally effective.\" - from what I am reading I don't even think the early Sidewinders even had a way of measuring closing rate. The important part seems to be this: *the voltage applied to the mirror while keeping it locked on the target is then also used (although amplified) to deflect the control surfaces that steer the missile, thereby making missile velocity vector rotation proportional to line of sight rotation*\r\n\r\nThe Sparrow, which was a semi-active radar guided missile, could at least estimate the closing rate from the Doppler shift.\r\n\r\n10. \"they changed a powersupply which completely fucked their Analog reference voltage, so sensor reads werejust bouncing all over the place\" - that's a problem I wasn't even aware of, thanks for the insight.\r\n\r\nMore information about IR-seekers:\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_homing#Scanning_patterns_and_modulation (describes the early spin, conical and crossed array sensors)\r\nhttps://basicsaboutaerodynamicsandavionics.wordpress.com/category/uncategorized/ (Ctlr+F for \"Infrared Sensors\" and go to the first mention, it pretty much gives the basic rundown of how sensors work, from the early chopped reticle spin scan to the modern infrared imaging arrays)",

So they're not in service anymore. They're civilians. What does it matter if it's an ex-cop who buried a crate of guns from the armory or a normal person who buried a couple of privately owned guns? The Danish resistance made STEN guns from a bicycle repair shop. The Polish made their Błyskawica in separate machine shops and mislabeled the parts to conceal their purpose.

Shit was informal as hell. \n\nNot to mention that marksmanship is a factor in 600 yard open terrain battles, not so much in the urban fighting of a resistance movement.\n\nEither way this was about obtaining weapons. Not that \"trained\" people fare better. But if the people are armed they will have the chance to train. Look at IPSC/IPDA or 3-gun/2-gun matches.

Many groups in Africa have slightly to much less (often caused by malnutrition) IQ on average while Asians have more than Europeans. But what does that mean in the end? Nothing because IQ has very little impact on reality (not everyone with a high IQ is productive, rich, happy or any other attribute you want to measure and vice versa). And in the end what is the utility of people? An economist wouldnt say it is his wealth or productivity but his own ultitly aka happiness and that is not connected positively with high IQs.\nOther than that - isnt one of the right wing ideas that the individiuum is more important than the group? So why judge groups based on an artificial number and then apply this to an individuum? It makes no sense...",

    "text": "You, sir, are a wonderfully rational human being. A rare thing these days. \nMy father fought in World War II for America. He was a paratrooper in the Signal Corps. He was also a major. He and his troops were dropped, do to a navigational error, in the wrong area. It was an area of heavy German troop movements. It was also shortly after Eisenhower had refused to surrender unconditionally to Hitler. Hitler had declared that he would then take all American officers that he captured and place them in death camps with the Jews. When my father and his platoon were dropped, they were dropped into a thickly wooded forest. Of course, the result was that they were all tangled up in the trees. Before they could free themselves a German Patrol came by and proceeded to shoot the entire platoon dead with the exception of my father, who of course was a major. My father was then transported to Dachau. Before the war ended, my father was moved two more times to Treblinka and Auschwitz, he was something of a troublemaker, constantly trying to escape constantly trying to help others. He did manage to help a German woman and her three daughters to escape. He had intended to escape with them but something went wrong and in order to cover their escape he led the German guards on a merry chase finally allowing himself to be recaptured. \nMy father could have instilled me with a deep hatred of all German people for the treatment that he received in those death camps. Instead, he went to great pains to teach me the difference between your average German citizen and a Nazi. After the war my father volunteered during the Reformation and was sent to Buchen as a judge Magistrate. When he arrived there the townspeople were starving because the Allied troops had locked up all of the towns weapons and refused to allow the people of the town to hunt to feed themselves. The first thing he did was to go to that to the armory, break the lock and allow the people to have their weapons back. There were other things that he did to help them, but mostly he was decent to them. When my father passed away in 1976, the people of Buchan printed a beautiful Memorial article on the first page of the town's newspaper. Later, after my father passed, I met the youngest daughter of the woman my father had helped to escape. She showed me her tattoo and told me the story of how she, her mother and her sisters had escaped from that death camp. This was the first time I heard this story as my father refused to talk in any detail about that time. With tears in her eyes and shaky voice, she told me that she owed her very existence to my father and she was very upset that she didn't find him before he died to thank him personally. I tell you all of this so that you understand the depth of my feelings when I say to you: thank you.\nI am subscribing to your channel.",

You're absolutely right; given what these same people feel about violence in response to hate speech, the first \"proper\" time for an armed Jewish response to German oppression would have been Kristallnacht, and by then it was far too late. And even that statement requires an asterisk, because Kristallnacht was justified as being a response to violence. If you try to create a coherent and consistent argument from the totality of Carson's or Shapiro's statements, then you have to imagine that European Jews would have been perfectly docile citizens right up to the moment they were taken to the trains, at which point they would have all grabbed their rifles and fended off the German military, ending the war and the Holocaust in a single day.",
