hey guys a special hello to all those new subscribers because since my last video got taken down twice my subscriber count has more than tripled but i'll talk about that a bit more at the end of the video for now i want to talk about gun control i'm sure that's a topic of which you didn't hear enough in the last couple of weeks but nonetheless there is a certain argument i want to talk about which started circulating again after the recent school shooting in parkland florida and which always shows its face when there is a big debate in the us about gun control namely that the holocaust is an example of what can happen when you disarm the general population and it's not just twitter weirdos making this argument last month when asked what the federal government could do to prevent school shootings republican don young responded how many jews were put into ovens because they were unarmed now he later backpedaled and said he was taken out of context but i think it's pretty clear what point he was trying to make the u.s citizens need guns to defend themselves in case their government becomes tyrannic and the german experience proves this to be true and this alaskan republican is in good company with his views about a year ago republican ben carson wrote a book called a more perfect union in which he wrote german citizens were disarmed by their government in the late 1930s and by the mid-1940s hitler's regime had mercilessly slaughtered 6 million jews and numerous others whom they considered inferior through a combination of removing guns and disseminating deceitful propaganda the nazis were able to carry out their evil intentions with relatively little resistance he later doubled down on this in an interview with cnn so but just clarify if if there had been no gun control laws in europe at that time would six million jews have been slaughtered i think the likelihood of of hitler being able to accomplish his goals would have been greatly diminished if the people have been armed ben carson is also not breaking new ground with his argument here the earliest instance i could find was at a hearing for the 1968 gun control act which sought to ban saturday night's special handguns in which the nra representative claimed no dictatorship has ever been imposed on a nation of three men who have not been first required to register their privately owned weapons depending on who is making this argument it changes its form from time to time like you can see here with ben shapiro i fear the possibility of a tyranny rising in this country in the next 50 to 100 years let me tell you something piers the fact that my grandparents and great grandparents in europe didn't fear that is why they are now ashes in europe now ben shapiro doesn't really say the holocaust wouldn't have happened he says if his ancestors and by extension the jews in europe or germany would have foreseen their government turning tyrannic they may have survived he also wrote an article defending ben carson's statement and we'll have a look at that later on it's truly fascinating but for now i think all of you get my point this argument that hitler disarmed the german population so he could carry out the holocaust with little resistance is a prominent one now let's take this point by point are bencas and all those other people correct in saying hitler disarmed german citizens and could therefore exterminate so many people with little resistance not really but to fully understand the context we have to go back to the end of world war 1. after the defeat of the central powers in world war 1 germany had to comply to a number of points which were part of the treaty of versailles one of the terms imposed on germany by this treaty was article 261 which said the following within two months from coming into force of the present treaty german arms munitions and war material including anti-aircraft material existing in germany in excess of the quantities allowed must be surrendered to the governments of the principal allied and associated powers to be destroyed or rendered useless but the treaty was only part of the motivation for passing stricter gun laws by the german government by the end of 1918 germany had just undergone a real revolution which ended the monarchy and also led the kaiser to go into exile from whom he would never return now i don't want to get into the topic of the revolution too much but just know that germany narrowly avoided turning communists or breaking out into open civil war but at the end the social democratic party got back in control by morally very questionable means by the way and passed legislation in january 1919 requiring the surrender of all guns to the government in an effort to stabilize the country this in combination with the law on the disarmament of the people which was passed to comply with the versailles treaty in august 1920 essentially banned guns in the weimar republic a real disarmament could never be achieved though since there was no prior registration of already possessed guns and after this law there were numerous groups active in weimar germany who wanted and outright tried to overthrow the republic with means of violence now these laws stayed in effect until april 1928 when the german parliament enacted the law on firearms and ammunition which relaxed gun restrictions but put a very strict gun licensing scheme in place a big part in getting a license for a gun after that was the reliability of the person asking for the license so when adolf hitler or his goons would ask for a license the government was able to say sorry you're not really reliable enough to not overthrow the democratic order so no license for you after hitler was appointed chancellor in 1933 this law stayed in place up until 1938 when the law called reis waffen gazette severely relaxed gun restrictions for the general population but got even stricter for enemies of the regime such as jews roma or previously convicted homosexuals and while jews weren't previously banned from owning guns after 1933 the nazis took measures to disarm the jewish population on a local level and after 1936 the gestapo was uttered to don't give out new gun licenses to jewish citizens jewish homes were also rated for guns although not nationwide as i said this was done on a local level a famous example of someone's home being rated for weapons would be albert einstein in his house they found a very dangerous weapon commonly known as bread knife now up until this point ben carson and the likes are both right and raw only a small fraction of german citizens were disarmed in the late 1930s and for the rest arming themselves was even actively encouraged by the government on top of that the nazis removed the heavy gun restrictions put in place by the previous government and also threw out the need for a licence to acquire long weapons and ammunition this also shows that this statement you know basically what i said is that when tyranny occurs traditionally around the world they try to disarm the people first and that's exactly you know what happened in germany you know and they you know mid to late 30s you know they started a program of disarming the people and by the mid-40s look at what had happened is greatly oversimplifying the reality of gun ownership in 1930s germany the people were armed even more after the nazis took over and enacted the reich's waffen gazettes just not certain people and the nazis never undertook measures to disarm the majority of the german population now one might say that ben carson and all those other people are not completely wrong since the main victims of the holocaust were disarmed and if they hadn't been they could have fought back and maybe survived this also ties in with ben shapiro's statement about foreseeing state tyranny my opinion on that is that people like ben carson greatly trivialized the predicament that german jews found themselves in during the 1930s and 40s they make the holocaust seem like this singular event while ignoring the systematic program of persecution implemented by a modern bureaucracy enforced by a well-armed police state and either supported or tolerated by the majority of the german population to illustrate this let's look at a couple of events that preheated the complete ban of guns for jewish citizens and for this i want you to imagine something imagine you're a german jew in the 1930s and you own a rifle when would be the best point to start your armed insurrection against the nazi government and keep in mind that this government is supported by the majority of the population and in this list of events i've included an event that was caused by a jew shooting a nazi diplomat and pay attention how that played out january 1933 the nazis cease power in hitler is declared chancellor of germany one month later the reichstag is burning the reichstag fire decree is issued certain constitutional protections are suspended and the nazis used the decree to imprison their political opponents march the enabling act is passed allowing hitler to enact laws without the involvement of the reichstag meaning parliament concentration camp dachau was established by the ss april members of the nazi party and its affiliated organizations organized a nationwide boycott of jewish-owned businesses in germany they also pass laws to ban jewish citizens and political opponents from civil service positions as well as limiting the number of jewish students in public schools and universities october the editor's law is passed non-aryans are now banned from working in journalism august 1933 former president hintonburg dies which puts hitler in the position of president and chancellor of germany shortly after hitler abolishes the office of president and becomes the absolute dictator of germany september 1935 the nuremberg laws are introduced which prohibit jews from marrying non-jews as well as putting them under other discriminatory prohibitions november 1937 the anti-semitic exhibition the eternal jew opens in munich about half of the german jewish population has fled germany at this point august 1938 lawn alternation of family and personal names is introduced which requires jews bearing first names of non-jewish origin to adopt an additional name israel for men sarah for women october the same year the reich ministry of interior invalidates all german passports held by jews jews must surrender their old passports which are then marked with the letter j and give them back 10th november 1938 the german diplomat ernst fondrat is shot by a 17 year old german-born polish jew in paris what follows is the kristallnacht or knight of broken glass it marks the switch from strong discrimination to outright persecution of jews as our paramilitary forces and also german civilians destroy and plunder 7500 jewish stores and businesses synagogues jewish cemeteries and prayer rooms are targeted of extreme violence and almost 100 jewish residents lose their lives while 30 thousand jewish men are arrested and taken to concentration camps such as dachau buchenwald and zucksenhausen after this night the jewish community is fined ten billion reichsmark in addition to the costs for the repairments daily telegraph correspondent you agree in one of the events in berlin mob law ruled in berlin throughout the afternoon and evening and hordes of hooligans indulge in an orgy of destruction i have seen several anti-jewish outbreaks in germany during the last five years but never anything as nauseating as this racial hatred and hysteria seem to have taken complete hold of otherwise decent people i saw a fashionably dressed woman clapping their hands and screaming with glee while respectable middle castlemen held up their babies to see the fun one day later an orders issued prohibiting jews from owning weapons of any kind including swords by removing restrictions from the majority of the population now to me if i had to pick a point in this timeline where a jewish individual or a group of individuals could have prevented the holocaust by putting up an armed resistance is never there was nothing they could do against a well-armed state that was just looking for excuses to prosecute and kill them and the population which overwhelmingly saw them as a physical danger to their society as soon as the nazis took over the german population was exposed to anti-semitic propaganda more or less non-stop from newspapers to movies to school textbooks the knight of broken glass demonstrates this perfectly one german diplomat was shot in a foreign country and this led to the biggest outbreak in public violence against the jewish population in germany up until that point the slow creeping process of discrimination and infringing on rights of minorities is part of the nefarious procedure of the nazis they never pushed it so far that they would run into danger of the majority of the german citizens siding with the jewish population on top of that the number of jews in germany when the gun law of 1938 was passed was barely over 200 000 and a country of almost 80 million citizens is anyone seriously going to make the argument that this amount of people including children and elderly is able to fight back against a brutal police state supported by the rest of the country and the military and succeeding and you know the reason why i'm so sure of this is because all those germans who were opposed to hitler weren't able to stop the holocaust from happening either they died or fled or just kept quiet and you might say well maybe they wouldn't have been able to overthrow the german government but they might have been able to kill hitler or something if we're just talking about what could have been more or less anything is possible but putting aside that hitler would probably have been replaced by himmler who was just as bad there were about 18 assassination attempts towards hitler and for ben shapiro's remarks the jews living in germany when the gun law of 1938 was passed knew they were living under a tyranic government it's not like most of the german jews had fled the country because of the weather in the same year about 10 000 children were sent to britain unaccompanied by their parents and this wasn't a school trip the parents of these children knew that their life was in danger and took this chance to at least give their children the opportunity of escaping from the nazis and in ra 15 wouldn't have done anything for them those of you who paid close attention during my explanation of the progression of gun control under weimar germany might now say maybe shapiro and karsan are both wrong in their statements when observed up close but don't they have a point if the weimar government hadn't put up so strict gun laws the jews may have been able to put up an armed resistance against the nsdip before hitler became chancellor and therefore preventing the persecution from even happening well you can say that and certain people would probably agree with you but ben shapiro wouldn't no you don't get to punch people in the face just because of their political views the idea of civilization is we can have disagreements about politics and still understand that violence is not the right solution here there is such a thing as a government official monopoly on on violence you know the idea that the police can arrest you if you violate the law but i don't get to punch you just because i don't like what you're saying no i'm in no way dismissing the fight of jewish resistance groups which did exist as pointless or a stupid thing to do the sacrifice and the bravery of these people who fought on in the sure face of death should always be remembered but the notion that the jews could have saved themselves on a grand scale with putting up an armed resistance to the german government is completely detached from reality and purely made to score political points it also leaves out the fact that the jews of countries like poland and france were defended with armies and it didn't do anything for them okay now you know why remarks such as uttar by benkasana incorrect in the sense that hitler did not really disarm the population quite the opposite actually gun laws got more restrictive for jews but were only banned from online guns five years after hitler took office and the claim that the holocaust could have been prevented if they had the same access to guns as the rest of the population stands on historically very shaky grounds at last let's look at shapiro's take on ben carson's comments if you don't know much about ben shapiro he is most known for being on college campuses and making students who don't have media training or experience like he probably has look foolish in front of a camera and is also the editor and she for the daily wire he's very good at thinking on his feet and articulating his points fast but usually i find his arguments lacking when looked into a bit more after ben carson made his comments shapiro rushed to his defense with an article and i'm not gonna go every line of it just the ones that i see relevant but i will put it in the description for you to check out shapiro's article is titled evil media rip carson say jews didn't need guns during the holocaust and this headline is bizarre in numerous ways firstly i assume shapiro isn't talking about himself as part of the media when he's calling it evil secondly i could not find one publication that made the point that owning guns wouldn't have been beneficial to the european jews in the 1930s and 40s and that is because ben carson himself didn't make that opposite argument he didn't say it would have been good for them to own guns i don't think anyone would disagree with that he said the chances of hitler having achieved his goal would have been greatly diminished if german citizens hadn't been disarmed that's what people objected to he starts off by writing it's difficult to think of a more evil argument than the idea that because jews living under nazi rule wouldn't have survived the holocaust even if they had been armed they didn't need guns right off the bat shapiro casts a moral judgment on the people opposing carson something that i really wouldn't expect from him because he always points out how despicable it is to frame one side of an argument as evil or not caring about a certain group of people enough because this is all about the moral disapproval of people who own guns and that's what drips from a lot of these folks is this idea that if you oppose them on policy it's because you don't care enough about what happened in las vegas and that really is that's quite disgusting on top of that i would say an argument can't be morally good or evil it can be valid or invalid again i really think this is a point shapiro would bring up himself facts don't care about being morally good or evil you know anyway he then goes on to reframe carson's statement as following carson who has been targeted by the media of late on issues ranging from abortion to mass shootings is now under fire for suggesting that jews could have used guns during the holocaust again that's not true that's not really what carson said and that's not why people call him out on his nonsense besides that shapiro does not mention the disarmament of german citizens at all in this article probably because he knows it's not true what he does however is essentially strumming the entire opposition to carson as if anyone would be saying jews should have turned over their guns shut up and died quietly anyhow i'm not gonna address the part of the article in which shapiro attacks the argument that jews didn't need guns during the holocaust because nobody is making that argument what i am gonna address however is this bit armed resistance did work for jews in the holocaust the warsaw ghetto uprising delayed german deportations by a month and revolts in death camps did redirect resources from the nazi regime and even led to the nazis raising a death camp in sobibor but more importantly jews should have had guns because resisting tyranny and evil is morally good firstly warsaw isn't in germany and ben carson was talking about specifically german citizens secondly it's a funny coincidence that shapiro picked this specific event to illustrate his point because in a different new york times article holocaust scholar ellen e steinweis picks the same event to showcase that ben carson is wrong the failure of jews to mount an effective defense against the vapham s in the warsaw ghetto in 1943 provides a good example of what happens when ordinary citizens with small arms go up against a well-equipped force the uprising in the ghetto possesses enduring symbolic significance as an instance of jew's determination to resist their oppression but the uprising saved few jewish lives and had little to no impact on the course of either world war ii or the holocaust and shapiro's ambiguous choice of words here can make his point seem stronger than it actually is when he writes the warsaw ghetto uprising delayed german deportations by a month he is right in the sense that it delayed the deportations from the warsaw ghetto by a month because that is how long the uprising lasted all other deportations continued undisturbed and he also doesn't mention that everyone involved in the uprising got either killed or deported and then killed while this uprising costed the germans about 300 men of whom 12 are confirmed the number of jews killed or deported after the uprising culminates at 71 000 that's hardly a working armed resistance besides that section of the article there's one more thing i want to put a spotlight on defending your own life is a basic human right even if you die in the attempt jews are human beings even if the media would hope to treat them as less than that but we shouldn't be surprised that the media and the left decry ben carson's comments after all they opposed jewish self-defense in the face of genocide today against jew murdering iranians and palestinians just as they say that jews didn't need guns to fight nazis so suggesting that people who don't want more gun control are heartless is disgusting but framing the media and an entire political spectrum as hating jews and actively wanting their genocide is totally fine and further instrumentalizing school shootings for your political goal is despicable but ben carson using the victims of the holocaust to boost in his argument isn't a problem at all to sum this up german citizens were not really designed by the nazis now would the holocaust have happened in a way it did if the jews in germany would have been out better well i don't know nobody knows it's just guessing really but carson's and shapiro's arguments for this being the case if you can even call them arguments are more than lacking and to frame it like an nia supporter if it's not guns who kill people it's not gun restrictions who commit genocides it's people who do and that's it for this topic folks that's more or less all i had to say about it comparisons to the holocaust really have no place in a modern debate about gun control and before you type it in the comments i'm well aware that ben shapiro is jewish himself and i thought about even making this video but honestly i don't care he is wrong and i know how much he and his fans dislike identity politics so his heritage and my nationality really shouldn't play a role in the validity of our arguments if that's all you were here for i thank you for watching and you can close the video now but i should address all the stuff that happened last week as some of you know one of my debunking the alt-right videos got mass flagged three hours after i uploaded it and after re-uploading it it got put into limited state again after multiple user reports now what happened then is youtuber and all around awesome person rational disconnect contacted a bunch of other youtubers and made me part of the hydra that is leftist youtube where you cut off one hat and it grows 12 new ones a bunch of people mirrored my video and my subscriber count jumped from 2000 to 7000 in a couple of days so i really want to thank rational disconnect and everyone who took time out of their day to mirror my video and redirect his followers to my channel i got an incredible amount of encouragement and nice words people i admired for years started following me on twitter and it turned out that the alt-right mass flagging my video was the best thing that could have ever happened to my channel some people even found my patreon which i hadn't linked anywhere up until that point and pledged a buck or two it's really incredible how this turned out and i'm very lucky to have gotten so much support from so many people and i don't know how to thank you all i hope i can return the favor in the future also thank you to all my new patreons some of you you can see here and if you want to support this channel you can join them the link is in the description and a big thanks to the people who math like my previous video because while i was kind of bummed out at this at first the whole thing turned out extremely positive oh yeah one more thing i was gonna do a q a at 2 500 and at 5 000 subscribers but this all now happens so fast that i'm just gonna do a longer one at ten thousand and that's it folks thank you for watching and until next time have a good one
