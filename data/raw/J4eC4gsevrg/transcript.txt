hello everyone Eddie Smith here from Midwestern marks wanted to hop on talk about Bolivia real quick obviously the Mas the movement for socialism won the Bolivian elections in 2020 following the CIA Us backu in 2019 that put a fascist right-wing dictatorship in power outing evil Morales the first indigenous president in Bolivian history and a socialist president and replacing him with a far-right uh Christian anti-indigenous government so I want to talk about the history of Bolivia Bolivia has a long history as most countries in Latin America do of having neoliberalism implemented on them right so in 1985 their president Victor P Ester Roo Ester Roa Ester Roa um he was a Social Democrat right so he promised to nationalize a lot of Bolivia's resources Bolivia has very rich resources rich in lithium rich in oil and natural gas um and he said he was going to use those resources to fund social programs which would help the Bolivian working class and essentially a right-wing Economist from Harvard or Yale I can't remember Nam Jeffrey Sachs went over to Bolivia um and worked with esosa to reduce inflation which basically meant severe austerity um so cutting all social programs uh privatizing everything allowing tons of foreign capital in to control the Bolivian lithium and the Bolivian natural gas and the Bolivian oil and esosa essentially sold the country out did exactly what the opposite of what he ran on which was strengthening social programs and instead went towards neoliberalism towards the the US economist method um which was terrible for Bolivia of course they had uh their unemployment skyrocketed to 30% multinationals were extracting tons of wealth out of their country while at the same time everyone lived in poverty so you had huge inequality you know those the capitalist became extremely wealthy from exporting resources whereas the working class and those who worked in the Bolivian mines and oil and natural gas Industries became extremely poor poverty was rampant hunger was rampant homelessness was rampant unemployment was rampant and uh ex um discrimination towards indigenous people was rampant as well and much of the working class who was getting paid garbage wages uh to extract wealth from multinational corporations um were indigenous Bolivian people so in 2006 evil Morales wins election democratically so he wins election for the Mas the Mento Al socialismo the movement for socialism and he is the first indigenous president in the country's history so Evo's first step is to renationalize all the gas oil and lithium mines kick all the multinationals out redistribute huge amounts of land to the indigenous people um especially those who suffered from the legacy of slavery and colonization and overall it was great so statistically illiteracy was cut uh poverty dropped 25% hunger dropped extreme poverty dropped 45% um as the the Bolivian lithium mines and the oil and natural gas industry were now being used to build schools to do social programs um to help the workingclass bolivians so um Evo eventually the Supreme Court rules that he can't as you know of course there's the us immediately starts trying to intervene right um the US has wanted Evo out for a very very long time and then eventually um Evo has served his terms and the Supreme Court he looks to the Supreme Court to allow him to run for more terms you know sort of like FDR was a three- term president in the US um Eva wants more terms and he's extremely popular he still uh is the most popular president you know he would win election if he ran if he was allowed to run so the Supreme Court passes a law saying that he is allowed to run for another term the US jumps on this and uses it as an opportunity to call Evo an authoritarian dictator who's ruling with an iron fist suppressing his people um and they use it as justification for regime change but the CIA was still in the background um there's a people's World article that explains the CIA ties to the Bolivian coup and the FBI ties to the Bolivian coup training the the leaders of the coup um but the CIA still did it covertly you know it wasn't a situation like Iraq where we lied the whole country into a war I would be willing to bet the majority of Americans don't even know that their country has been intervening in Bolivia and actually overthrew the Bolivian democratically elected government and replace it with replacing it with a fascist government you know if if Americans knew that the US was doing that you wouldn't see so many articles about how Donald Trump is threatening our democracy right because Trump's kind of trying to do a soft coup of his own and all the Liberals are freaking out like oh no our democracy it's like yeah the US doesn't really care about democracy we just overthrew Bolivia's democratically elected leader we try um we did try to do a coup of Maduro who's a democratically elected leader in Venezuela so anyways the coup puts Janine ANZ in power and Janine ANZ is a far-right um like Theocratic leader you know she's really anti-indigenous um she's tweeted and said horrendous discriminatory things about indigenous people and as far as economics she would Implement far-right policy um essentially the policy of allowing multinational corporations to extract lithium oil and natural gas out of Bolivia rather than nationalizing so post coup Evo leaves to Mexico and president Alma grants him asylum in Mexico um as anes takes power and there are mass uh there's a mass movement against the coup government so the unions go on strike the UN um of the industries who have been nationalized go on strike and they lead a movement to bring uh to bring evil back people protest they get out in the streets um polling show that the coup government had something like 133% support of the Bolivian people and the Bolivian union leaders start preparing for their next election because Bolivia has an election in 2020 and they can vote the coup government out so in the El on the eve of the election there's Mass voter suppression so International observers are foxed and threatened by members of the fascist government um there's uh there's reports of kidnapping and and Military suppression of of leaders who are try leaders of the Mas who are trying to get out the vote for the Mas candidate Luis aray who was a staunch Ally of evil Morales so following or so in the elections Luis aray wins with 55% majority despite V uh vast voter suppression he still dominates the election it's not even close the Mas wins in Luis R takes power and evil Morales comes back to Bolivia so a huge win for the international left honestly and and many socialists are skeptical about whether socialism can be achieved Through The Ballot Box you know um you they think a reev or some people think A revolution is the only way to do this and you know many Latin American countries have tried to do it via B Ballot Box and the CIA has always been able to overthrow them so here we see that kind of dynamic of uh Bolivia being in a battle to to build socialism via The Ballot Box their people want to do it the unions want to do it um and their and the Mas is very strong but the CIA you know hounds them at every turn um so and as example of that days after the election Luis aray was attacked with dynamite so there's already been an attempt on his life you know hours after he or days after he got elected um and also even more tragically Orlando Gutierrez who was one of the union leaders leading the strikes in Bolivia and leading the movement for socialism and the effort to bring evil back to the country was beaten to death and killed by a group of far-right fascist thugs um so it just shows the battle that they're fighting in Bolivia right now and it it does it also shows the importance of the trade unions you know the unions have been on the front lines of the movement for socialism um the Bolivian working people want it you know the working people are are less um they're less like simps like in the US it seems like all working people are simps who worship Donald Trump and anyone who is wealthy and they just think I want to be like that someday rather than hey my labor is creating the wealth of the wealthy why don't I get a cut of it uh us people all just think they're going to be billionaires eventually and whereas Bolivia recognizes that working people need to organize and fight together um especially when you have this enemy of the imperialist West uh trying to overthrow your democratically elected leader and Implement somebody who's going give your country's resources the way to multinationals so lots to learn from Bolivia one of the most interesting stories in the world right now um place where us imperialism has been focused for a long time and it's going to be really interesting to see what the next move is you know because you know the CIA is is pissed they're mad that Bolivia has a socialist leader back in directly after they did a coup um and many people are saying oh the CIA is lacking they're not going to do anything but I guarantee you the CIA will be back they already you know we don't know that the CIA tried to kill aray with dynamite or had the Bolivian Trade union leader killed but the far right is still there in Bolivia and there's no doubt that the CIA is going to try and work together with them to stop the Mas from from moving towards socialism at every turn because that's what the US Empire does and all they care about is getting Bolivian resources for multinationals we know this and it's important to stand with Bolivia and call for hands-off Bolivia um right to Elon Musk tell him that lithium is not his that's another funny part of the story Elon Musk went on Twitter and said we will coup whoever we want deal with it because his smart cars um use lithium to build batteries so he obviously had a vested interest in the Bolivian coup and his stock shot through the roof directly after the coup happened because people know that Tesla will know would if the farri government were to have stayed in place Tesla would have access to Rich or to cheap lithium so very interesting I hate us capitalists hate multinationals hate imperialism stand against imperialism stand with Bolivia um Vivo La Revolution Vivo Evo Viva Evo Viva Luis AR and rest in peace Orlando Gutierrez the union leader who was beaten to death um I stand with Bolivia and I hope you do too
