Lone Survivor starring Mark Wahlberg was one of the most popular movies of 2013 it tells the true story of Navy SEAL Marcus Latrell who was wounded in a firefight with the Taliban near the border of Pakistan for those who haven't seen the movie in IT latrell's company is on a mission in Afghanistan when they're spotted by a couple of goat herders they make the decision to let these civilians go rather than killing them but the goat herders informed the local Taliban forces of the American soldiers presence and they end up getting attacked tr's entire company is killed except for himself who has a badly broken back and wounded leg at this point he was taken in by a local man named Mohammad gulab who helped to hide him from the Taliban until the US military could come rescue him but trell's story quickly became a best-selling book in America however this put Muhammad gab's life at risk with the Taliban who were now Angry with him for Sheltering an American there were multiple attempts made on gab's life and he began to consider moving to America America in 2012 his nephew was shot in the head in an attack that was intended for him and at this point he gets in contact with Marcus Latrell and ends up going to America the Lone Survivor movie was set to come out soon and gulab and Latrell spent most of their time together promoting it doing Red Carpet Events and whatnot Latrell even offered to help get gulab a green card so he could stay in America permanently which gulab was hesitant to accept because he still wanted to return home at some point at this point gulab had never read the Lone Survivor book because he didn't speak English but during his time in America a translator was able to brief him on the specifics of the book and he said hey a few of the things in this book didn't happen like that in real life first of all the American soldiers didn't let the goat herders go they were attacked by the Taliban while still deciding what to do with them secondly gulab said there's no evidence that 35 to 50 Taliban soldiers were killed by the Americans as Latrell had claimed in fact no Taliban bodies had been found and this was confirmed by Andrew mcmanis a former Marine Colonel who helped search the area after the battle additionally Latrell was fully stocked when gulab found him having 11 fully loaded magazines which suggests that he didn't fire as many shots as he said in the book Latrell also claimed that he was on a mission to hunt an international terrorist with close connections to Osama Bin Laden when in fact the group they were hunting had no direct connections to bin Laden and were just a small militia with some ties to the Taliban Latrell also estimated that there were 80 to 200 Taliban fighters who attacked him and his company whereas gulab said it was closer to eight or 10 video evidence of the event seems to confirm gulab side of the story as only seven Shia militants are pictured gulab brought up these issues to Latrell right before they were supposed to go on 60 Minutes to do an interview and Latrell became angry with him gulab was then instructed by a translator to go along with whatever story that Latrell gave in the interview in that 60 Minutes interview Latrell would change his story slightly from the one in the book claiming that there were only 30 to 40 militants rather than 80 to 200 after the movie's promotion was finished gulab was deported back to Afghanistan with the movie now in theaters putting an even bigger Target on his head with the Taliban the green card that Latrell had promised him never materializing since that time gulab has been On The Run moving from place to place in order to avoid the attacks on his life recently he was finally able to obtain a visa to the United States and he now lives in Fort Worth Texas Marcus Latrell has ignored all of his efforts to contact him gulab is still incredibly bitter towards Latrell and says I'll never regret saving Marcus but I regret what I did to help the movie I pray that one day Marcus tells America the truth so yeah an interesting true story behind a war hero manufactured by Hollywood the SE pro-war propaganda movies like Lone Survivor and American Sniper rarely ever tell the full truth and their main purpose is to lionize and promote the US military and in this case it allowed Marcus Latrell to rake in millions of dollars off of his story while the man who saved him had his life thrown into chaos
