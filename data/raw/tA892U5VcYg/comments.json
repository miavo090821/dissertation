Which Gulab said it was all a big lie and encouraged Marcus to tell the truth or he would and that’s when Marcus got pissed and insulted the man  and got the man who saved his damn life deported back to Afghanistan where he had to run from the taliban because he saved an American and lost family because of it.  he promised Gulab a green card and instead he gets gulab deported for wanting to tell the truth.

        "text": "@DerekBush-x3tIt was clear during the first watch of Lone Survivor (with no knowledge of the book) that the scenes after Marcus was taken in by Gulab were fabricated for Hollywood gimmicks. He wasn’t thrown onto a log seconds away from a beheading. And there was no scene where the choppers stormed in and had a firefight with the village to rescue him. We know now due to After Action Reports and SEALs in the know, that it was indeed made up and so was 90% of the “original story.”\n\nAs for Chris Kyle, his total sniper kill count is greatly inflated and his book follows Marcus in being almost entirely dishonest. There’s a part where he claims to have positioned himself on top of the Superdome during Hurricane Katrina and shot 30 people who were looting. I was made to believe all these spec ops guys were heroes. And many of them that I met during my time, and after, certainly are. But not the ones getting book and movie deals.",

He even tells in a cnn interview when Murph was hollering for him he put his rifle down and covered his ears. And the most sad thing about it was when he was rescued the rangers asked where his team was and he said they were all dead so they took their time getting to them not wanting to get anyone else killed, they found Danny and Murph quick but after spending time looking for Axe, they found him sitting up against a tree and said he had only looked like he had been gone a day or two by time they found him but Marcus saying they were all gone slow played it, so yeah he’s absolutely full of it!!!",

Yeah Marcus did all that. That’s why he’s a coward and nobody in the seal community likes him. It’s not what happened during operation red wing that makes him a coward. It’s everything afterwards and making shit up so he seems like a bad ass when in reality he’s a big pussy.

That specific operation, you know just as well as I do that the only people who truly know what happened that day are those 4 seals and 3 of them are dead. So if Marcus is lying or can't remember or is trying NOT TO REMEMBER we really don't know the actual story. I came to his defense because he admitted on national television that he put his gun down and called himself a coward and basically humiliated himself. Now weather or not he truly meant it or was just trying to make himself look like a martr I don't know.

It is what it is I just hope when the time of REDEMPTION does come maybe that time around he does the Right thing maybe he cant bring back his dead homies but IF he uses his Navy SEALs training and experience to Protect the Innocent specially the children the elderly and the weak people who didnt do nothing wrong to anybody or the Special needs maybe if he uses his skills to Protect those people I say thats more than enough Redemption but like I said its not my right to judge people and I've grown more wisdom since last time I posted this 7 months ago",

It would be great to have you guys discuss and refute  Russell Dobular:s concept of how we in the working class would not be able to create a better society and just waste our lives getting drunk, or drug addicted once we had control of the means of production because everyone would somehow become idle, and not work towards a better society.  This was discussed on their latest episode of DUE DISSIDENCE on Friday.  Other people in the chat were also suggesting they get ahold of you guys at Midwestern Marx...\n\nI think it would make for a great show and give all of you more exposure to others.",

Watched it when i was only 8-10 years old and thought to myself that being a Navy Seal meant you were some sort of badass. Don’t be mistaken, it takes a certain kind of crazy to do 56 weeks worth of preparation to become a Seal. Their dedication, their commitment, their sacrifice both good and bad is admirable. But just because they’re some of the world’s most trained killers, doesn’t make them gods, far from it. And they’re also at the end of the day, human. \nAnd it sickens me to think that Luttrell could have been the coward Seal who ran away too early from the fight and left his team to die in dose mountains. Right up and till Lieutenant Murphy died calling for help, is where the movie should have ended. \n\nIn real life, Luttrell ran from the fight and got lost. Found safety in a village where he heavy sheltered and hidden from taliban forces, up and till he was picked up and saved. Went back to the states where, not wanting to sound like the coward of the story, wrote “his” accounts of what had happened knowing good and hell well, the american people would eat it up. He made millions off of this movie and risked the life of Gulab.",

I don’t hate him but my problem is he didn’t even fire a single round it’s like he gave up as soon as it started and then went on to lie about everything and turning his back on the guy the only reason he’s still alive is cause of gulab and he turned his back on him and got him deported back to Afghanistan with a. Bounty on his head for helping an American which got his cousin killed in a hit that was meant for him. Marcus luttrell is a piece of shit for that. Nothing is wrong with freezing up in combat it happens but to lie about it and backstab the man who saved your life shows his true character. Idk about you buddy but I actually been to Afghanistan for a year in Logar / parwan and kabul. Have you ever even spent a single day in the military? And if so have you even seen combat ? If not then you shouldn’t be saying shit anyways. You don’t know what positions I was in when I was deployed bud and Me as someone who’s been there himself says Marcus is a lying coward who let his friends die instead of dying fighting like a man. Knowing that your buddy 100% got your back in combat is everything and Marcus didn’t help nobody but himself that day and went on to lie about everything and write books smh. If you respect that then thats fine just know real veterans don’t like this Pos especially the ones who been in combat and actually fought back.",

I have seen everything from people performing comfortably and people falling apart.  Sometimes the same people reversing behaviors.  I have also seen MANY examples of something happening right in front of my eyes and seeing the same situation on the news and it being 100% complete bullshit.  So, taking from these few examples, I can safely say that we don't know dick about what happened over there.  Show me Gulab's actual words in video form and then we will have \"testimony\" but still not the truth.  I prefer to take the words of the man who survived as a SEAL, which means a lot.  He also set up the Lone Survivor Foundation, which still keeps taking care of gold star families.  Stupid details about how many mags he had on him mean nothing.  Even if that were true, which it may be, it could be that he gathered mags from his fallen comrades.  I know from experience you are hurling mags at each other in the middle of the shit.  Also, his weapon package wasn't for suppression or target attrition, he was setup as a sniper.  Snipers need roosts and spotters to perform.  They were on the run the entire time.  If you can produce to me, without bullshit from the media, ACTUAL proof of Marcus being a liar, please produce links.",

I trust his integrity because he was a seal, full stop.  You don't know what happened that day either, yet you choose to talk shit about a man who has done more than you will ever do, and it just doesn't sit right with me.  I can have my opinion about your opinion.  Not once have I displayed any kind of attitude that makes me think I'm better than anyone.   As a matter of fact and sentiment, I'm trying to bring all of you down a notch and not fall for this hate mail that is internet media.  They are going after Tim Kennedy now.  It's a \"SFBRO\" thing and it's odd.  So, the fact that we each have our own opinions and we are dealing with the same amount of data, yet you choose to hate and I choose to trust, says a lot about you and I and how different we are from each other.  Also, as my OP states, at least do some research about how combat actually is before you say stupid shit like \"he had full mags\".",

I don't have to have been in official combat to understand how chaotic and unpredictable a dangerous situation can be. Our opinions on this topic do speak volumes as to who we are as people, it's also funny that you speak about helping people not fall for things when I'd say you're the one who needs help with that. If you put something out into the public domain you have to understand that it will face criticism and questions, vets are not above that!

    "text": "I want to ask the following: 1. How much amo does a seal carry, with  ref to this case in point? With ref Marcus, do you have seal training? Do you know how to do what he did? Then it is common cause that the taliban removed bodies from the field in order to state victory, its called propoganda, do you know for a fact that this did not happen? Marcus did say he \"covered his ears\" why do we not take this into account why? Yes he was saved there is photos of marcus and his saviour in the us, how do you reconcile that? The version you state is easy to debunk, you only utilised bits and pieces to suit your version. The account of any seal or other divisions of the force deals with what they saw and and believe to be the truth.. example: you get into a car crash, I can assure you that your account will be based on what you think and believe occured, however, a bystander or the other driver will not  account as you, because they account on what they believe is true, does it make you a liar? Yes the movie did not account correct since he was saved, hollywood, but marcus set it right in how many instances. Again a car crash happens in seconds your brain record these seconds and set forth what you believe is true, the fire fight happend in \" seconds\" shot up badly injured dearh of his friends... trauma! Brain deals with it to protect you, he did not lie did he? He only accounted what he believe to be the truth. He made Millions? No he did not, then again see what he did with the money, after you did it, then talk. Seals are highly trained yes, but still human. Shock deals with the body in the same way that it would in you and a seal. The endurance and thinking difer from you and a seal not the normal function of how the body operates. Because of these operations 911 was avenged and bin laden dealt a death blow. Why did you not join? And what qualify you to remotly understand or attempt to understand a seal's mindset, actions, combat and the reality of all combined? Then again, only one man's opinion Regards",

    "text": "Several things here aren't concrete. So I've watched the videos released by the \"Taliban\" and from what I can tell is that BOTH Luttrels and Gulabs stories aren't 100% accurate. Yes the video shows way less fighters than Marcus claimed yet we still can hear gunfire the entire time the Taliban fighter 7-10 of them from my count estimate and none of these fighters are engaged in fact there moving TOWARDS the sounds of gun fire. So imagine this, the Taliban suspects there's Americans in the area, ok so what do you do?.you send out MULTIPLE scout patrols to cover the area and once ONE scout platoon makes contact they engage and alert the OTHER fighters and they begin to move towards the combat. That's what I believe the video shows yes 7-10 fighters NOT ENGAGED IN COMBAT but moving to the kill zone and if this one group is moving there I feel it's safe to assume to expect there was AT LEAST ONE other patrol already engaged with the Americans and very likely many more small groups closing in from different areas until finding themselves on that hill ..there's several other discrepancys in this story i keep coming across and many other ones in this video im not going to go into but the main thing i want to puont out is the footage releadef by the Taliban of this attack does raise very signifigant doubt there was over 50 fighters yet the footage ALSO disproves GULLABS account of only 7-10.As the footage shows that exact number of fighters NOT ENGAGED in the beginning of the video yet we can hear OBVIOUS gunfire in the distance. Also this account of how Gulab got deported is a bit rocky as well, all other sources ive read state Gulab left the United States AGAINST the wishes and advice of both Marcus AND his attorney. Gulab experienced unimaginable suffering because of helping Marcus Luttrel when on the contrary Marcus greatly gained from this story and I've read a great deal explaining that when Gulab visited America and step foot on Marcus's ranch and saw how well he was living apposed to himself he became very bitter and resentful towards Marcus and would in fact have a very good reason or at least lean towards the assumption Gulab had a good reason to try to disprove or shed doubt on Luttrels account...we may never know but there's allot of hate being thrown at Lutrel but fact is none of us INCLUDING Gulab were there for the initial ambush.",
