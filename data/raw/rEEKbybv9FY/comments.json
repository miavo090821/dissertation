        "text": "Tldr version. Experience is knowledge. Long version to follow.\n\n\nSometimes we make better decisions with less thinking, because we have through life experience got massive amounts of knowledge and experience on a topic which is subconscious and undefined.  So trying to rationalise why we don't trust our daughters new boyfriend is impossible. If we trust our gut reaction we will reject him but if we think about it rationally we will reach the conclusion that we don't know enough about him and that our judgement is unfair. When he turns out to be a cheating louse we wonder why we didn't trust our gut. The truth here, is your unconscious reaction is to imdefinable  knowledge learned throughout hundreds of thousands of interactions with other people and so it has more information than what is available consciously.    Im not advocating for not thinking, we should make decisions using the largest amount of knowledge on the subject we can. But sometimes we see people seeming to make fantastic decisions with seemingly little application of time and effort and don't realise that the time and effort has been put in through decades of experience. As a doctor i can attest to this. Sometimes i in know what a sick patient has within seconds of meeting them. My subconscious is noting their posture, their gait, the pained expressions, the choice of words such as discomfort rather than ache and my rational mind is trying to work out what evidence i have for this view my subconscious is throwing at me.  Often that got reaction is right. Naturally i don't start treating you for something based on it but i use the tools available to confirm if that reaction is correct which it nearly always is.",

        "text": "@michaelkeegan9260thats an interesting way to put it, I see things in the same way. there is much that we don't understand about the human body and I think there is much more to the \"gut feeling\" or \"thinking with your gut\" than we understand. The human gut micrbiome has only recently been studied in depth and what has been found is very interesting. I did a bit of neuroscience in university and I remember doing a project about the gut microbiome and what purpose it serves in the body. I read a few studies about how researchers  used humanized mice and compared the behaviours and gut microbiomes of ones that were made to be obese or depressed with normal ones. Depressed mice when made to swim will give up much quicker and thats how they measure depression. They then transplanted the gut bacteria from the depressed mice into the normal mice and they did the test again and the normal mice behaved the same as the depressed mice group and gave up earlier when made to swim. They also transplanted the obese mice gut bacteria into the healthy mice and the healthy mice became obese.  There are more nerve endings connected to the gut than anywhere in the body, it seems to me that the gut sort of functions as another brain and uptakes neurotransmitters that are produced by gut bacteria as waste which is then how it influences behavior and function of the body. Though maybe the feeling of \"thinking with your gut\" is just a secondary effect from processes happening in the brain. Maybe it is a reaction to something your lower brain at a more instinctual level realizes, but you are not consciously aware of. So we feel that feeling in our gut due to what is going on in our unconscious brain before it comes to us as a thought in our consciousness. \n\nIf you have a lot of experience, going with your gut is usually the best bet, but the plan of these authoritarians is to manipulate and brainwash the minds of the younger generations so that their instinctual gut feeling tells them to do the wrong thing. Its just like with all the covid restrictions and isolation, they are breaking people down and retraining them to obey without question. Not to trust their mind, their eyes, or their rationality because the virus is mysterious and invisible and so only the government approved bureaucrat doctors are able to determine what you should do at all times.",

Gives a whole new meaning to gut impulse or gut reaction.  There are also associations with asthma and alzheimers and a range of autoimmune disorders.  They've found that your white cells don't function without some of the hormones secreted by these gut bacteria.    But more in line with my point look up a book called 'blink' by Malcolm gladwell.  Fascinating read on the expertise developed subconsciously through experience",
