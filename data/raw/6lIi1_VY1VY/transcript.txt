I I don't have a question it just uh I've listened to a couple of your streams it seems like you really like to like go over the theory read the books and it's all good you know research knowledge and but the books don't cover like what this Theory when implemented what it how it manifests in real life of ordinary people like it's all you know this broad the of society and how this all going to B out and whatever but in the end like so I was born in in the early 80s of course my parents lived through all the whole USSR my dad was born right after the World War II as my mom was and so like I got the the end of it but my brother he's uh 10 years older than me so he got like the 70s and my sister so I got a lot of it's anecdotal evidence I just want to share that you know all this uh ideas of communism Marxism that everybody will be like I don't know the society will function productively it's not really happening in reality and what hear no when you go over like if you it's part to explain because you you haven't lived through it you you don't know what it is you haven't lived like you never had to go to a store like just just a couple of stories like I I'll try to be quick like when I was like a little kid yeah I was like five five six years old I still remember myself like I remember what I was doing back then one of the fun things to do for us was to go to a like a local toy store and like we went there like every two days and for years for years nothing changed the same toys same everything like right now when I like when I look at it it's like I mean it's depressing the life I was living in when the Iron Curtain fell I saw like what what my life could have been like my my aunt was uh my dad's sister lived in Estonia so they what like what their life became after the curtain fell when they got rid of Communism and all this dogma and stuff uh like my parents like they read my parents' generation they grew up on all these books of leninism and they read all the books in schools they got you know they were the Pioneers they wore the red scarves and everything they marched they they read all the literature they had the courses in University but what happened like all all these teachings what they should have taught you is like like I I saw a couple of your because I engaged with you on Twitter I saw a couple of your post like you helping the community and that's all great and you think that this will be you think that this will be maybe you have an idea that yeah okay point the point is it's all good and cool on paper in reality when everything belongs to everybody everything belongs to nobody and people stop giving [ __ ] about everything for good example is the people just live in the same Community um what what makes you think that communism is everything belonging to everybody because I'm looking at communist China right now who uh have a far better standard of living in their cities than we do in ours and capitalist America I'm thinking of my childhood where uh I was lucky to get a toy from a toy store because we grew up poor um and I'm not seeing how it's that different from your childhood at the uh admittedly like very seriously problematic end of the Soviet Union but I'm not seeing as how that is sort of the essential content of Communism when I'm seeing communis is M Thrive uh in China right now and their kids I have a 15-year-old uh whose future I'm very seriously worried about and in China they're very optimistic about the future they have something to look forward to um 25% of our entire country two years ago said they would have been in favor of a violent revolution 90 in favor of their government so like what I what I mean to say is that like I'm not sure that we're we're blaming things on the correct things if that makes sense well the whole so yeah I'm I'm giving you just an account of the person whose family lived through the communism well Noah and Carlos's family did as well that's like Carlos go and and we we've also lived through capitalism and we're Communists so what what does that tell you I mean in any population there's always going to be people that think differently that's why every Revolution takes the form of a Civil War I can bring to you right now A Palestinian who's very pro-israel but the reality is that the vast majority of Palestinians are pro Palestine they're against the entity that's carrying forth the genocide and what we can tell from what happened in the Soviet States is that the vast majority of people preferred overwhelmingly their life under the Soviet Union then their life in shock therapy Russia or even post shock therapy Russia with Putin I mean the statistics statistics are very clear it's around 80% in most of those States so it it could very well be the fact that you're in that small 20% and that's fine now I think an important point is Contex wrong statistic not correct if I may which is the fact that which is the fact that you grew up in the 80s what was happening to the Soviet Union in the 80s and what was happening to the Soviet Union after the uh horrendous attempt at D stalinization which was an utter uh failure and it started I think a period U of of you know a very long period of degenerating the Soviet Union you were at the culmination point of objectively anti-communist uh politics within the Communist party and uh what you experienced within the Soviet Union was not uh necessarily uh what what socialism was at its best in the Soviet Union what you experienced was a leadership that was a culmination of a long generation of leaders that had betrayed the uh actual cause of the Soviet Union that uh kept up only a formalistic sh of what socialism was I mean people just went into the party because it was the only place that you can climb a social ladder not because they were actual Communists and what sort of society do you end up with you know socialist capitalist feudal whatever it is if the people that are in the leadership positions are merely there to have their position and not because they actually believe in the ideals that the society stands for that's what ended up happening to the Soviet Union now China doesn't have a condition that's anywhere near like that now if people want to get ahead in their lives there's a million different avenues that they can go uh to do that through and the people that are in the party are the people that actually believe in the party and that are actual public servants the Soviet Union unfortunately because of the cruv uh cruite Administration ended up degenerating into a very corrupt shell of what it was and that was the Soviet Union that you experienced so what you're longing for quite honestly is a more stalinist uh Soviet Union which was what uh you know I think uh we all uh accept should have uh taken root uh after the death of of of Stalin and there were still people in the party at that time too who had good ideas for how to you know combat corruption and um fix a lot of the problems that were going on and they end up yeah right and people like Andre and they ended up being pushed aside by these other forces who were of course being backed by the forces of imperialism in the United States who absolutely plundered the post-soviet economies afterwards which is why unemployment increased malnutrition increased drugs and sex trafficking flowed back over the Border people lost the the universal daycare and Universal Health Care that was supplied by the governments and that's that's the reason why about 80% of people want to return to a Soviet style system it isn't ideological so much as it has to do with the everyday Comforts that were provided yes the system was corrupt yes the bureaucracy was bloated yes there were flaws but at least we had healthc Care at least we had daycare at least our housing um was about 2% of our income rather than 25% of our income paid to these parasitic landlords I mean it honestly gives us um a good way to ju the socialism at its worst or socialism not functioning well versus capitalism at its best socialism at its worst is still better for regular people than capitalism at its best because now in America we're all drowning under medical debt 60% of this country has medical debt which is something that would have been completely foreign um to a Soviet citizen or a Cuban citizen um where things like these Necessities like healthc care are are just provided so um yeah it's not communism doesn't work on in in practice you know let me just say one more thing real quick um even the Soviet Union at its most sort of decayed element in the late 80s is nowhere near as horrendous as Russia and the former Soviets got after the fall of the Soviet Union life got so bad there were so many people fleeing and so many people committing suicide and being murdered by gangs so their Apartments could be stolen and sold off to the highest better as part of their Investment portfol Portfolio that the life expectancy went down by 10 years new drugs were invented that put literal phosphorus into heroin to sort of elongate the Escape that people had to get because life was that bad and it's not even just them millions of people around the world suffered starved and died because the Soviet Union was no longer there to defend their country from my ruling classes economic blockades the Cubans call this uh period the special period their only trading partner for energy and to get actual Capital was gone for food because their soil had been so corrupted by the plantation system the Koreans call this the arduous March you hear about people fleeing Korea and Cuba it isn't communism they were fleeing it is this 90s starvation enacted by these blockades that the Soviet Union and its strength was powerful enough to go against and that means something for people all over the world and George Bush invaded Iraq um shortly after the fall of the Soviet Union because they were no longer there to provide that umbrella of protection for the third world and essentially allowed the US to Rampage across the globe and do whatever they wanted yeah you done can I speak yeah yeah go ahead go for it go for it yeah so you have this very cool ideological idealistic view of the Health Care system in the Soviet Union I went to the hospital it was [ __ ] I mean you would you would have di if you had something serious would have [ __ ] died on a chair waiting for a line so don't tell me about the good cool free healthcare well I have Healthcare debt and 45,000 people die in my country every year for the same thing so you don't tell me Defending Your Country man why you keeping bringing up your ass I'm not telling you the best country in the world I'm [ __ ] because there's no other alternative to capitalism than socialism there's no alternative to our system besides the Soviet system which did provide universal healthcare and try going to the Healthcare Systems before 1917 try going to the hospital under the Zar you think that was any [ __ ] better better than what better than what the Communists brought with the revolution they brought hospital system right now is better than better than the Communist thing they no no they brought Hospital even under the bombings of Russia their Health Care system is better than other Soviets you're saying that the zist the zaris like third world Russia was better than the Soviet Health Care System the current Healthcare System is better than the Soviets who build all those hospitals in Ukraine who was that who built all the healthcare facilities in Ukraine who built all the infrastructure in Ukraine who brought Ukraine out of poverty it was the 1917 Revolution well not the 19177 revolution but it was communism when when Ukraine declared independence the two Ukraine states that declared independence the Communist decided [ __ ] it we're just going to kill them and take their land which they did we lost well [ __ ] not true all right you have been indoctrinated by the banderite educational system which was designed to lie to you in order to accept what is essentially an ideology that is indistinguishable during the Soviet times you have been you have been lied to you said you were born in the 80s that means you got what until you're nine years old at the Soviet Union so you have been lied to systematically through the funding of the West and specifically the US in order to accept an ideology that is fundamentally just Nazism with Ukrainian characteristics even the Nazis themselves often told the bandite forces to calm down because they were taking it too far so if you are working within the framework of a history that has been Rewritten in order to support these forces I'm sorry to tell you my friend but everything that you have been told about your history me Soviet Russia did not invade newly formed Ukrainian States no correct they did not invade they did not take har they did not uh install their government they did not install the overtook the Ukrainian uh new like this stat what they lasted for a year and something because they decided not to you know build an you know what happened UK you're talking about the struggle in Ukraine against the banderites right no I think the right wi forces second world war what the hell man are you saying the banderites still don't exist in Ukraine or what or are you talking about pre pre-World War to Ukraine Ukraine first Ukrainian state was created after the fall of tarist Russia there were two states of Ukraine and so Soviet Russia invaded them took them over Soviet Russia kind of created the the Ukrainian State though and uh there was a lot ofan state was created almost same time as Soviet Russia look look what happens is that uh the Soviet of Nations is formed right and this determines all of the national policies for the entire Soviet Union which the people of Ukraine decided to enter the Russians didn't come and force them to be part of Russia they were always Ukraine as a Soviet Socialist Republic right and yes there were differences in lands from uh you know the Polish taking some the was it the the I want to say Austrian and German forces took some in World War I and then oh God I'm forgetting exact I don't want to say anything incorrect so that doesn't even matter but what matters is from there during the life of Ukraine within the Soviet Union Ukraine gets bigger and bigger and bigger you know what wasn't part of Ukraine at its formation as a nation state Crimea right you know this yes so how are you saying that the Russians are taking Ukrainian land when Ukraine kept getting bigger throughout the history of the Soviet Union you're not going to like do a Hello doore thing at me next are you I mean come on we should stay realistic uh can you do chronologically right so a Ukrainian state two states after the fall of sarus Russia were created in 1918 at the same time the Soviet Russia was created like the Revolution was still you know settling down right the the Civil War was going on and all the Soviets took over these two Ukrainian States that's not true what you just because there was force involved doesn't mean it was either an invasion or what you're saying it is there was genuine class struggles at play in all of these countries there was violent conflicts and all of them and just because your side was the one that was on the losing side doesn't mean that you lost because the Soviets intervene no it means that the people who were aligned with the Soviets in your country won there's a difference between there being these struggles and one side winning the way you're phrasing it is as if the Soviet Union just came in squashed all of you and that's it no there was genuine Communists in Ukraine specifically the Eastern Parts a whole lot of them and those people align with the Soviet Union and they won the battle when the the the existing state structure collapsed when that happens it's Force buddy it's force force wins out and the Communist one out which is what strengthened the Ukrainian which is what strengthened the Ukrainian State and allowed it as an Noah said to keep growing which is something that you didn't you didn't respond to that argument because you have no response besides oh Russia came in and held them at the barrel of a gun and forced them to grow and become a strong independent state how dare they this is tyranny no they backed the popular forces in Ukraine who established Ukrainian Independence in the first place there would be no Ukraine if it wasn't for the 1917 Revolution I agree with you on that but that's not [ __ ] oppression and also signant who in Ukraine was forced to do sports or did they did Stalin come in with a gun and say everybody's everybody's going to the basketball courts now everybody meet up at the park we're gonna we're gonna you want to know what it's more like it's it's more like if if if you want to reduce it to the micro level okay you have a house and in that house there's different people that have different different interests there's a patriarch that's beating the mother that's beating the kids and then there's a rebellion from those kids and that mother and the neighbor the friendly Soviet Union it comes in and it kicks the ass of the guy that's been domestically abusing the people that's the situation that you're describing and you're saying oh my God the neighbor came in and he beat me up oh my God now the house belongs to the same sort of sphere as it no there was there there was genuine grievances are you are you going to ignore the fact that Ukraine itself was not this homogeneous entity that it was fragmented by different forces it was people that stood with the Communists and people that didn't and the ones that stood with the Communists won and of course they had the help of the Soviets just like the people that didn't stand with the Communist had the help of the West in fighting against the Communist I mean this is kind of like it reminds me and you know what I I feel bad I feel like we're ganging up on you and I don't want to do that usually the show is just me but uh anyway I it it seems to me kind of like like King George complaining after the Americans boot him out off of the continent right like oh those evil revolutionaries wanted Freedom yes of course they wanted Freedom right that's what the Revolution was all about there was a period of chaos throughout the entire region and the Communist won and they brought order and they brought stability and they brought technology and trade and it took Ukraine as part of the Soviet Union from a third world country where most people couldn't even read to part of the second largest economic power in the entire world inventing space flight in a handful of decades that's not oppression brother it's just not you don't just give a country the most important port in the entire region for no reason by the way no reason still mostly Russians living in Crimea right you don't just do that to a country that you hate and want to oppress because of the the what the nature of that country no this is a Lie the bandis have been telling forever and you know why I know that because the CIA my country's government has been funding them since the end of World War II and I study what my ruling class does very in depth um I hate to I hate to cut you short brother but if you want to call back and discuss stuff in the future by all means we just we got one more call to get to and I want to make sure compared to their time so if you got anything else to to hit us with hit us with it yeah you like I don't know you bring up we're talking about one period you for some reason you're focused on the band R which I even never even mentioned but I mean dude if it's your Boogeyman go go for it you can't talk about anti-communism in Ukraine without talking about the bists right the band the only reason we bring them up is because they're the main reactionary force in Ukraine since the end of World War II up until today and the the forces the reactionary forces in Ukraine prior to the 1917 Revolution weren't banderites ston Bandera didn't exist at the time but those reactionary forces were what evolved into the banderites um and the people fighting against them have always been the Communists the left wiers the uh um you know more leftwing uh type of nationalists and the the Soviet Union and you know the main critique of of the Soviet Ukrainian policy in Russia Today is that they gave them too much Independence they gave them too much leeway and control and that led uh that allowed bandism and nationalism to fester and grow with of course the CIA watering it and fertilizing it every step of the way the the real critique dare rehabil so you're okay with the CIA going in and helping out the banderites but not the Soviets going in helping the Communists I get it and now you you don't get why we would bring up bandism you have the same position as the banderites I said peoples like you know Russians ukrainians Kazakhstan you know peoples not just men like people's self-determination people's not men's self-determination as in like women as well nonbinary they them determination for Ukraine ethnicities ethnicities peoples ethnicities you know self what about them the Soviets were the ones who established that principle and helped make worldent what's the problem self-determination we don't want that it seems that today in Ukraine um it is the western parts of Ukraine denying the self-determination of the people in donbas right in uh dbass are ukrainians they're not separate people wa hold on hold on you're you got to let me finish some what I'm saying what before so you understand the whole thing right um so to me it seems as if the people in Western Ukraine led by the Nazis uh the bists are the ones that are trying to deny the self-determination of the people in lugans and donet um I have friends that have been there and seen it firsthand right uh so if we're going to talk about self-determination this is precisely what all of the people of Ukraine did when they joined the Soviet Union nobody forced them to do that that was the popular forces within Ukraine winning a violent struggle right there were the the uh the MCH nites that were against them and the ultra nationalists uh all those people but they lost L what happens during a revolutionary era that's what happened here in the US in 177 6 right the people interested in self-determination won um and you're welcome a name I I try to be honest you know uh but anyway that's know that's all the time we got for tonight but I'm happy to talk about this more in the future if you want to call
