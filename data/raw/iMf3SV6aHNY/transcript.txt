I'm standing here in front of the ps139 hate Garden where the seed of hate has begun to grow here at ps139 in Queens New York where a vicious hate incident recently occurred a 12-year-old boy was arrested by the nypd's hate crime task force for the devastating crime that has terrified a community and that crime is drawing chalk swasaga on this very Playground now I would show you evidence of this vicious hate crime but unfortunately I can't for two reasons one it is so horrific that I do not believe that it is suitable for the eyes of children and two it was drawn in chalk so a mild snowstorm or the littlest effort from a hose and scrubbing would have washed off these horrible symbols of hate however don't let the mildness of the crimes method turn you off to the devastation that has caused in the community now probably the most devastating part about this hate crime was the message scrolled that said hail Hitler not H hail and as if to answer the hateful criminals prayers we have been blanketed in snow I'm Sean Fitzgerald for the actual Justice Warrior till next time what's up guys Sean here and today I want to talk to you guys about the NYPD arresting a 12-year-old boy and charging him with a hate crime on February 22nd of this year it was discovered that somebody using chalk drew a bunch of swasa on the playground at ps139 in Queens the NYPD is investigating after hateful messages were found at an elementary school in Queens the messages along with dozens of swastikas were drawn in chalk at the playground at ps139 in brigo park local leaders say they're disturbed by the images which have now been washed away so far this year 36 anti-semitic crimes have been reported in the city compare that to only 21 at the same time last year the NYPD hate crimes task force is now looking into the incident now this was actually the second time that this happened and being that Regal Park Queens is a diverse part of Queens I can understand why some people were really troubled by the appearance of the sasas on a children's playground however a quick examination of the crime scene would lead you to believe that this was probably not going to turn out to be the work of an evil racist and was likely going to be the work of a dumb kid there were obviously strange things about the swastikas the obvious signs included this person apparently drawing a hammer and sickle which if you're going to be a committed Neo-Nazi it doesn't make a lot of sense for you to also be a communist this person also put hail as in frozen rain Hitler instead of Hy which again if you're a Neo-Nazi you would probably know to get that right and the final big indicator that this was going to turn out to be the work of a dumb kid rather than an evil racist was that the message was delivered via chalk if you're trying to send an everlasting message of hatred chalk is the last thing that you want to use permanent marker spray paint all of these things don't wash away with the littlest bit of water however none of these obvious signs that you were looking for a young kid who doesn't know any better didn't stop the media didn't stop a member of the New York City Council and the NYPD hate crimes unit from going after this case like it was a huge deal and when the suspect was eventually identified and it turned out to be a 12-year-old boy all of these people congratulated themselves on a job well done the NYPD hate crimes task force official Twitter actually released a statement congratulating their work on Friday February 22nd 2019 an anti-semitic graffiti was found through throughout a queen's playground the NYPD hate crimes task force have the suspect a 12-year-old male in custody great job at NYPD hate crimes no matter the face of hate the NYPD partnered with the community has zero tolerance no matter the face of hate like are you kidding me the kid is 12 years old they actually arrested this kid and charged him with aggravated harassment which is a felony the kid is 12 they didn't charge him with vandalism they didn't charge him with the misdemeanor they took what should be treated as a school discipline issue or parental discipline issue and made it a felony they're making an example out of a 12-year-old to show that the hate crime task force is doing something look I'm not saying what this kid did was good or acceptable but we have to look at the scale of what this kid did and compare it to the reaction I'm sorry but this is completely ridiculous especially considering that there are legitimate anti emetic hate crimes in the city of New York that get no coverage there's no sense of proportion anymore when people hear the word Nazi they drop all reason and they just go in for the kill I'm certain there were people who were legitimately upset by this people who legitimately wanted NYPD to find out who did this but I'm sure if you go to those same people and tell them it was a 12-year-old kid a 12-year-old kid who clearly does not know what he's doing just based on the chalk drawings alone those people would rather have a conversation with the kid they would rather talk to him they would rather give him a more menial punishment than have him go to jail for a felony if it wasn't for the fact that this graffiti was already washed away because again it was chalk I would have had the kid clean the graffiti but how about instead of charging with a felony you put him on eraser Duty in his own school he has to erase the board at the end of the day he has to clean the chalk erasers Simple Solutions that are proportional to his mistake obviously you talk to the kid obviously you educate him obviously you tell him that this isn't a cool thing to do you explain to him why it's wrong but you don't charge him with the felony you don't charge him with a hate crime that's ridiculous and you certainly don't celebrate charging him with a hate crime that's extra ridiculous anyway that's all I really have for you guys today let me
