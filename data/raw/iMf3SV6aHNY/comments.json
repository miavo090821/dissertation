        "text": "Tucson Jim While I do agree that Actual Justice Warrior dropped the ball by calling this a felony, the rest of what you had to say is overly combative nonsense.\n\n\nFirst, Melody never said or implied that any of this is \"amusing\", and neither did Actual Justice Warrior. He called it ridiculous, and I agree. This is not amusing on any level, but how the NYPD handled this is even worse.\n\n\nSecond, sure being arrested isn't the same as being charged with a crime, but he WAS charged with a crime. Making this distinction is nothing more than a pointless distraction. In addition, he's twelve. Even if we assume that he is a nazi, arresting him is ridiculous. Do you really think he going to be capable of making the situation volatile? It's not like he had a weapon (which would have changed the situation entirely). A single teacher could easily handle the situation without the involvement of the police if it did get violent. This should have been handled by the school and not by police officers leading the boy into a squad car to be taken to the local jail. Which brings me to my next point: it probably wouldn't have gotten violent. \n\n\nThird, he's a twelve year old boy who also drew a hammer and sickle. He's probably just some edgy idiot who just started learning about communism and fascism in school or maybe online and thought it would be funny to piss a bunch of people off. I highly doubt that he's an actual fascist or communist. \n\n\nFourth, what does this have to do with the Republicans? They are a political party with millions of members and last I checked they don't condone this behavior either. So you found a literal handful of bad actors among them. Do I really need to remind you of the bad actors among the Democrats?\n\n\nFifth, funny how you call everyone else unempathetic when you are the one who is acting like an SJW. You're using shaming tactics, using this as an opportunity to take swipes at the republicans, assuming the worst about everyone who disagrees with you, and is in favor of using the police to silence people you disagree with even if that means arresting a child over what is likely an edgy joke that caused no measurable harm. Is it really so hard for you to understand why people are unhappy with the idea of a child being arrested over chalk drawing?",

Prolly has to be some element of violence to be a felony hate crime. \n\nTurns out the kid prolly will get just a fine and some community service. So, all in all, I don’t know if I really see a problem with all this. Blown out of proportion? Yes. But on both “sides.”",
