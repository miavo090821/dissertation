I thought today might be a good day to slay some sacred cows to talk about some of the quote unquote Heroes that the Boomer truth regime have told you are great men oh really um some of them aren't oh who could have imagined for example Martin Luther King Jr not necessarily the Paragon of uh virtue or today is the anniversary of uh the great Mahatma Mahatma Gandhi's assassination on this day in 1948 he was murdered right well before we go on then you mentioned uh Mr Luther King um what possible objection could you have to his personal conduct oh well if we're going to judge people by the content of their character let's talk about his character very Bri yeah well you know okay well let's start pass up to an opportunity let's start with MLK then because um one of the things that Trump did in his executive world I think on the first afternoon was sign a thing to release Files about the JFK the RFK and MLK files in the MLK one if we talk about MLK and it was less that I think there's Revelations about the details of his assassination uh but rather just all sorts of details from the FBI largely about his life and what was going on now one thing I would say here to start off with is that it's embarrassing both for the memory of Martin Luther King and his estate his surviving family but also for the FBI I can see why the FBI wouldn't want it to come out because both parties uh look bad cuz the FBI were doing bad things really yep but Martin Luther King wasn't great um so do you know where that is Westminster Abbey Westminster Abby actually real yeah yeah is that's disgusting terified by our bloody country St MLK go to the next picture it will show it a bit of a wider shot yeah that's the it's the front door effectively when we win that's being taken down yeah literally front and center as well yeah westmin Abit sanity I've said before one of the most incred why a genuine Gothic Abbey one of the most precious architectural jewels that Britain has got is far more important than St Paul's Cathedral far more important than the Palace of Westminster or Buckingham Palace or anything like that Westminster Abby is truly a wonder and they put Martin Luther King up there on there anyway so why is he so bad didn't he say cuz that speech most people would know his speech I Have a Dream speech I was completely I'm completely in agreement with the moral principle he lays out we should indeed judge people by the content of their character and so if someone was like you know watching a girl getting raped and laughing about it I might be like H I have questions about the content of the Char that didn't happen did it yeah oh right exactly that thing what what a weird coincidence that was the first thing that sprung to my mind as a man of bad character one thing just before we go on to it there's a link there about a bit of Lot's content that Harry and Conor did quite a while ago was in the old Studio there so check that out Harry's been blowing the whistle on this for a while now so yeah go and sign up5 a month and Harry's this is two hours long Harry's done a really in-depth uh thing but we're we're just skimming the surface and Conor made a good point on there which I completely agree with he says look the the I Have a Dream speech is good it's almost Flawless you can't really disagree with it um I do agree right yeah so do I yeah and it's actually inspiring if you go and listen to the underbridge thing is actually quite inspiring yeah right but so that's sort of the the the the peak the Pinnacle of of people's knowledge of MLK once you dig below that it starts getting murky very quickly so for the first thing to say was it was a hypocrite because he was supposed to be this um Conservative Christian as I say a paragon of virtue and stuff no no he cheated on his wife massively now it's been known for decades ever since the time really that he slept around that he was fander who's a teacher and adulterer he had children at of wedlock the women yeah he had one woman that he had a baby with almost certainly and whenever he traveled around the country see all the time and even the official biographers the official biographers of Martin Luther King said that in the few years before he was killed he had probably somewhere in the region of 10 to 12 Mistresses or girlfriends Jesus we now know it's more in the region of 40 to 45 so in other words couldn't stop himself how many how many Mistresses and bastard children do you have Nate I'd like substantially more than hero but that's that's the interesting point but juggling dozens and dozens of them it's it's that's uh doesn't phone to do it on either you yeah right sounds like a lot of work it's like one in every city a woman in every town or city right yeah difficult to manage really so so on that content of character Nate won Martin Luther King zero how he wasn't riddled with venial disease either maybe he was I don't know anyway you you'd forget you wouldn't how would yeah how would you keep track what did I say to this person what did I say to that person I need the message's that kid's name what's that kid's name I need the message history on Facebook what did I say to you last week right okay that's where we were saw a story once just side note of some adultery who had many different families and he called all the kids the same name in the different families smart like I can't remember I'm making this up but he all his daughters Louise or something so he would always that's that's that's Forward Thinking whatever um one of the worst things because so here's where there's a bit of a stain on the FBI like um your private life should be your private life if you're doing nothing illegal why would the police or the intelligence Services be should they shouldn't have I mean it's horrible to be an adulterer and a cheater but it's not actually illegal that's on your so why the FBI watching him and keeping tabs and counting all these mes and stuff but what if it does become illegal well he was involved in certainly allies again not necessarily illegal especially if the women are prostitutes and they've been paid for and they're consented whatever it's disgusting but right but no there is a criminal bit to it thing here how many or's got under your belt zero really yeah I've lived a very vanilla life yeah zero same I've never never been to an enough um enough so there's a Just Married with Kids M you don't know so yeah doing is Wide Shut billionaire party count as an O I haven't been to any of those either yeah anyway um there's a quote here um that King looked on and laughed as the pastor of Baltimore's Cornerstone Baptist Church allegedly raped a woman in the Willard Hotel I believe the will Hotel was in Washington DC two very Christian people and a pastor yeah yeah yeah I can see why we've got a stature of him at Westminster so that's that's criminal and obviously degenerate and disgusting and wrong but ALS but also same time you got to say like how did the FBI know that they were bugging his hotel rooms and stuff yeah he was a communist revolutionary basically so let's move on let's move on from the actual sort of private life stuff also he was and this has been covered by all sorts of people over the years uh just so he was of course a Christian so on some level he's not just a hard like what um uh so on some level he can't be a fullblown Marxist a fullblown sort of maist stalinist type communist however he hung around with Communists he was funded by them lots of his political theory is just communist what's interesting is that the critical race theorists have been trying to square that circle with with king um basically they view him as having a kind of Christian communism right there's a synthesis between Marxist dialectics and Christian faith um and so they definitely claim him as one of as one of their own and he certainly was explicitly anti-white yeah just saying you know things like we have to just dis like the the structural racism of whiteness and all the things you hear now actually he wasn't a liberal no yeah he was a communist so people think the only think of the I Have a Dream speech and uh everyone should be all black people should be free and treated equally that's all well and good but actually despised white culture and civilization and wanted wanted to see it ripped down and destroyed and stuff sure but the left the left would say well we we agree with that so we're not going to surtin Luther King but as Solinski pointed out you've got to make them live up to their own rule book right make them live up to their own standards so what I think that what we should do is propose that anyone who has not laughed at a woman being raped is eligible to have a statue on Westminster right anyone who has can't have a statue on W anyone on the left disagree with that just out of interest uh you know write letters on a post card you know if you're like no I'm a communist and I think that they should so if that that that'll be the standard going forward we can just remove any statues of people who have laughed at women being raped right not just in the abstract but in the room while it was happening laughing at it in real time not yeah not even in the abstract like directly at that I think that's a totally fair standard and one that the left can't disagree with yeah not just in Westminster but literally above the P of Westminster Abby revolting revolting stuff so okay that's there's various Revelations about Luther King most of the stuff we already knew it's just a bit deeper and worse than we thought and uh and the FBI come out with a bit more stained explicit we already knew really that they were going above and beyond their remit uh but we now know sort of for sure I haven't got any love for the FBI so I care if they look bad as well yeah no yeah scatter them to the winds yeah no the FBI are responsible for more human misery than than Dr King ever was in my opinion yeah so of course all right um but also it's as I said it's it is something we have to actually calculate right what you mean the amount of human misery King caused is not nothing no yeah sure sure anyway um right so also on this day in 1948 I thought why are we why are we sort of taking a pop at some of the Boomer truth regimes Lefty Heroes yeah on this day 1948 uh mahat MC Gandhi was assassinated we're told that he is some sort of paragon of virtue there there's a statue that is in Parliament square that is right directly front of there's Teflon Dave David Cameron on second from left there stalling the statue godamn it conservatives yeah look we're not racist we have a statue of an Indian man who did nothing wrong ever look at him I mean how could he do something wrong bow look at that wisened kindly face and his little stick thin legs he's wearing a big shawl come on he's obviously not dangerous he can't hurt anyone he's definitely not a meddling backward he's definitely not someone interfered with any children or is he [Laughter] well go on well he used to sleep with in the same bed with his niece yeah who was a small child at the time um but not to the angle was that he's demonstrating how great his self-control is Sorry by Sleeping with her and not doing anything to her sorry sorry he's sleeping in the same bed as a child his family his niece as a demonstration that he has self-control do we think that he demonstrated that every single night well I'm I'm probably not but I I I just I can't get over the fact that how's that an example of self-control like that that the entire thing is predicated on the fact that if you didn't have self- control you would just just crack on with your family mate and a child yeah who okay good thing we got statues of this guy it's a really weird argument oh there's one in Bloomsbury Square so there was already a big statue of Gandy in London but they they needed another one in Parliament Square itself of course um so yeah that that's just that's just weird isn't it with the nce thing it's just I can't get over that don't do anything weird with kids you don't need to prove it by sleeping in the same bed just simply actually don't do anything that's that's the proof isn't it really simp simply that you straight gror no excellent yeah now I'm going to bed with my niece um what of course Gandy take his word that he's not a groomer I guess was was give that man a statue Sor one of the headlines of about gandi is his his principle of nonaggression nonviolence um it didn't extend to his his own family CU he knocked his mes about oh yeah of course of course not if she go out of line a little bit of the old sh treatment do as I say not as I do if if a man beats a woman we should never have a statue of him is that a fair standard by which we can tear down the Gandy statues because I would say that it is right I would agree with that yeah I mean it's not like he beat a black and blue but if she got out of hand he he openly has has said yeah I have to knock her down I oh how many how many times you done that to your wife yeah weirdly I've never done that to my wife either Jesus um really weird world we live isn't it so that again that's just like States me around for not beating my wife these are the personal JBS which are kind of a low blow although absolutely not insignificant in my mind if you're certainly put statues up to people but then his actual politics I mean his his um his doctrine of non-aggression was to the point in my mind most people's minds unless you're a pacifist to the point of absurdity yeah so here's a famous quote he said Hitler killed 5 million Jews it is the greatest crime of our time but the Jews should have offered themselves to the butcher's knife so he's a holocaust denier as well wasn't denying it six million it's just oh right sorry yeah he didn't have the upate the quote is he said so that's not me that's that's the mahatma's words you um but yeah so the the thing of non-aggression is ridiculous yeah so if someone's been aggressive towards you that's fine just just let yourself be beaten yes or killed well put it in even stronger terms cuz he lived obviously through the War years he wasn't assassinated in 1948 he said about Brit he said um Britain's struggle against the Nazis during World War II he said uh I would like you to lay down your arms and um that you have as being useless for saving you or Humanity you will invite ha Hitler and Senor musolini to take what they want of your possessions uh in your beautiful island with your beautiful buildings you will give all of these but neither your souls nor your mind if they do not give you free passage out you will allow yourself man woman and child to be slaughtered but you will refuse to owe allegiance to them so how about no actually yeah I don't really feel fantastic L how about how about no not taking that kind of advice from a man who sleeps with his niece yeah and beats his wife beats his wife knocks his wife yeah weirdly my moral standards are don't sleep with your young family members don't beat your wife and defeat your enemies I think that's what he said to his wife listen yeah non-aggression right if someone comes to you and they beat you you just got to allow it B yeah down there yeah okay I don't really want any more statues of this guy Jesus absolute there just moronic there no why why doesn't pure idiocy why doesn't that standard apply to Hitler and bloody musolini though he's not lecturing Hitler and muscolini look stop fighting and offer yourselves up to the British bro no no no we've got to offer ourselves up to the fascist it's obviously because he just wants us to lose and suffer obviously you know his whole raise on Detra was anti-british and anticolonial and on I don't blame him as well so for examp there is one good thing I would say about Gandhi and I would agree with is that we shouldn't have been ruled like home rule in India is fine I don't want to be ruled by Indians in England sure the principle I'm not like a rabid Pro colonialist it is right really that Indians should rule themselves right I don't disagree with that but in India in India but I mean so again his politics I've I've talked about this before written about it before but um his politics were sort of what I would call backward they odds with M modernity itself with progress itself or to the point and it's all just to screw over Britain and and colonialism really so he had this idea the doctrine of the spinning wheel I mean you've got the spinning wheel on the middle of the flag of India to this day haven't you this all comes out of his sort of thinking and his doctrines is that in order to screw over the British trade in uh textiles y uh everyone in India should just have a spinning wheel in every home or in every village at least um and you make your own clothes and uh I did wonder why they had a spinning wheel on their I didn't know it was both literally and also as a metaphor sort of economic independence but also he would say things like we don't we don't need uh trains we don't need newspapers we don't need uh like formal all sorts of all sorts of just modern structure which make a nation state not in absolute backward AB poverty we don't need all of that stuff I don't like his wife beating an interfering with children but I like his nationalism and being a lite so you are Big L Big Time l i i I'm kind of in favor so now you've got you've got an odd an odd soft spot for lism yes which I don't share I don't share uh but nonetheless I think he deepened India's struggle with poverty profoundly yes and their ability to use toilets I I think his thinking and his politics and his doctrines again caused a large amount of of uh human misery yes um in India but yet we're told aren't we that he's a hero among men one of the greatest men that have ever lived I hate to do this but in the interest of time I think we might have to move on to the next cow okay all right no certainly well I thought why are we doing this while we're slaying some cows why not just mention uh Nelson Mandela look there's a statue of him also in Parliament Square there Nelson Mandela as we all know a Great Hero definitely not a terrorist you still my ly sorry didn't do nothing yep ever I mean look at his face he's a little old man how could he have ever done anything like killing people well as young on yeah as a young man in the 50s and the very early 60s he was uh in charge of uh the the militant Wing or the paramilitary wing of thec I won't try and pronounce it it's often just shorten to MK uh I really won't try and pronounce the actual name of it uh but he was in charge of that and to begin with they were peaceful complete communist by the way complete complete Comm um and uh by 1961 they decided that they just P purely peaceful resistance wasn't good enough um and so went on to quite a large scale bombing campaign oh oh a racially targeted and motivated bombing campaign of course of course so um a racist and a murder of women and children yeah got stat so CU they put him in Robin irand for like it was meant be for life and he I think he said something like 27 years or something it wasn't for nothing yeah it wasn't to be mean it's because he was the head of a terrorist organization that got people killed but there's a statue of him think this guy aowd statue of him all right yeah no Bob gildo said he was a good dude so don't question that well if he good enough for Bob gelof reminded Us in the mid 80s oh actually this dude is a is a terrorist convicted leader of a terrorist organization uh so in' 61 on one day in December 1961 57 bombs went off in South Africa Jesus relatively considering a relatively small number of people were killed but it's not really the point yeah back then that would have been you know we're saying relatively small amount of people were killed back then that's that's shocking that would shock people to the absolute sure now and it's not like f yeah his side of the equation hadn't been oppressed and the victims of vience I'm not saying any of that I'm just saying it's not really right to hold him up as this yeah as this whiter than white perfect ethereal being no no he was he was uh was involved in killings well he just went on a racially motivated bombing campaign he didn't beat his wife or anything sleep with his knes oh Winnie Mandela oh oh oh oh how is she she was well up well we had to her in the end because she was involved in necklacing and Abduction of people that young people that died in her house all sorts of we don't talk about that we don't talk about winie Mandela's crimes we haven't got a statue of her as well I don't think so God yeah some boy was kidnapped and was was found dead in in her home and uh you know necklacing when you get an old Tire fill it with petrol you put it over someone arm like that and so they got a big tire for didn't you've not done any necklacing not like that on fire and watched yeah Winnie Mandela said like stuff like we'll teach them but with our necklaces right yeah she was a scumbag yeah okay real scumbag anyway um just quickly to run through it then um in the early 60s um uh they did something like 190 sabotage incidents often it just gets mentioned it's sabotage they did they weren't to be fair don't know why I'm being fair but they were look like you know like a a modern islamist they're actually going for high deliberately going for high casualty events they weren't doing that they were trying to like blow up things where they were to minimize casualties however something in the order of 70 odd people died most of them civilians often quite often it'll be a Car Bomb outside some sort of government building and some random passerby just totally in the wrong place at the wrong time gets blown to smiing stuff like that but not always stuff like they blow up one more a white mall where women and and a baby was blown to Smither stuff like this um and then he went to prison in like 1964 but then through the mid '70s through to the late 80s uh the same organization did 1500 odd terrorist acts um so okay it's just the idea don't buy the narrative that this is a perfect person and then once they did get out of prison in the '90s and was became the first black president of South Africa then uh him and his government uh continuing this to this day ran that country into the ground in no uncertain terms and it went from being one of the best if not the best arguably depends how you measure it country in Africa to one of the rape and Kack capitals of the world no way brilliant and the farm all the farm murders yeah that go on there all the time again among the most disgusting things like the Mexican cartels one of the most disgusting things you can hear about there's definitely not a white genocide happening there not uh oh but with there's a statue to him so in Parliament square of all places must be a great politician remember live a I do so I remember Western liberals being like yeah just think about how nice Mandela is and we haven't really got the time I won't bother but I picked out a couple of Clips where it's the classic the way the the leoy media present it they'll say they'll say uh there was a bombing campaign but anyway like literally like that but also Amnesty International said he's a good guy or whatever International communist organizations on the Wikipedia on the Wikipedia page it quite literally says um there's no link to the details of all the bombings it just mentions ites it just mentions it and uh just moves on to the next thing or in the same breath mentions one of Nobel Peace Prize if you would like to watch the full uncut version that is also uncensored head on over to lotus.com to find out more [Music]
