And black racist and liberals have taken advantage of that fact. We have not been playing on a level playing field. The way things are in America today, black people get everything paid for while whites in the same economic situation do not qualify for programs that blacks do. Same with entrance exams, criminal justice, grants, scholarships, words, safe spaces, public assistance, and so much more. America needs to have everyone on playing by the same rules. We’ve done all of this to help black people, and the anti white racism is at an all time high in spite of all this. Hate crimes for a white person saying a word, while a black group of racist can jump and beat the hell out of a single white person while calling them slurs and it’s not a hate crime. It’s gotta stop! White people have to start speaking up in the face of the racism. Whites are the most hated people in this country even though our tax dollars are paying for everything.",

Where you wave at strangers and see many friends along the roadway as you drive. \n\nFind your kin folks.  The culture must speak from your heart!  Find that place! \n\nWhy is America such an angry nation?  You really see it when you leave it.  The world sees it.  I was speaking to a prominent minister in my country yesterday.  He has seen it. \n\nThe Americans have become Angry Africanized bees!  That’s what you get when the definition of life is consumer consumption and greed.  Broken lost souls are the result.  \n\nAt least with bees they work together as one.  In the USA it’s “every man for himself”.  Even families are broken.  I can’t ever speak to mine.  \n\nThe American culture, where Greed is Good, has stolen humanity like a Thief in the Night!  That's not living!  \n\nAll that firepower, all those prisons, all those bombs, all the wasted money, and yet the culture and the infrastructure continues to erode.  The malignant narcissists that lead them send more arms, more armies and more money to support destruction and foreign wars.  Wall Street speculators now cash in on corporate private prisons and the labor therein; they manipulate government, stocks, commodities, real estate, farm land, politicians, and humanity for profit.  And why not?  Americans get their morality from Prosperity Gospels.  \n\nThe result of decades of citizen neglect is that now the people in the USA hate each other.  They simply want to hide away in some shelter in the woods.  That's not living!  Sadly, the Americans have absolutely no ideas how bad they have it - And they lack the resolve of character to find out!  To honestly take a profound look at the truth at home; and contrast it with what lies over seas!  \n\n“We live in a society that demands addiction. The person who is best adjusted to this society is not dead and not alive because if you were fully alive, you couldn’t support the system.” Anne Wilson Schaef\n\nA question everyone there must ask: “Does Money Make It Easier to Sell Your Soul?”\n\n“Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad men.” Lord Acton",

So the (largely) white residents of St. George won their court battle, and instead of approving $$$ for a school and throwing St George residents a bone, now BR will get hit MUCH worse by thousands and thousands of taxpayer dollars lost, year after year.\n\n\"White Flight\" started decades ago in Detroit (and other cities), and this time the white residents were being dissed, crime in BR is brutal, so I don't blame St. George residents for breaking off into their own city.",

Oh boy they see the writing on the walls and bye bye. After that the cities fall into despair but they get what they want a city of thier own. Humans don’t really like each ‘OTHER’ we are kinda funny that way.

Their only big business is military, gov services, schools & planned parenthood: for late term abortions to anyone that walks in from any other state & the taxes pay for it by federal & state taxes. Then there is California where wealthy: mostly foreign investors, corporate offices that pay taxes & the working poor that can’t move out- supporting: illegals who collect & work under the table, generational welfare recipients who also work under the table (drug trafficking) & others collecting that contribute to the largest amount of funding in the whole country. Then there is the 1,000ssssssss of homeless which becomes another pocket program to collect tax dollars that only goes up in smoke to various agencies. So wonder the middle class moved out. I used to get laughed at for not taking advantage of state aid in California by peers when I was young for not taking advantage of the freebies even though I needed some help. But you could not go to school & get aid at that time. I choose education, stayed slim with a limited wardrobe of 501s & worked part time Jobs simultaneously.",

I stopped in downtown Baton Rouge to tighten down some loose bikes on back of my RV. Some homeboys saw me and my wife in desperately trying to replace the straps with 2 young children looking on through the RV windows. My heart sank. Told my wife to hurry as I threw the broken strap away and tighten the new strap. She ran to pick up the old strap. I saw the homies on the phones of an old abandoned store starting to move towards us. I was strapped and told my wife to start to get in and forget the old strap. I knew we were almost out of time and was able to run back inside, along with her. We just made it and drove off like a bat out of heck. She later said, what were you going to do. I said whatever it took to get you and the kids out of there, even if I needed to stay and fight. I had a gun on me. It was the worst feeling in the world and I felt so unsafe in the few moments. I will never stop in the $hithole again. I don’t care if the bicycles are dragging down the street. Baton Rouge is a scary place and ghetto. Please don’t stop there. Me and my wife are people of color. Hispanic and myself Indian and Asian. My kids are brown. I can’t imagine a white naive family stopping there to adjust there lose cargo being accosted by gang bangers. It’s a terrible feeling. So I don’t blame St. George for the separation and even putting up a wall to keep the rift raft out. You can tell Baton Rouge is a place of despair and bleak.

I refuse to use my taxes to pay liberal politicians and judges who destroy safe neighborhoods.  If the city keep out section 8, tough on crime, and have conservative values it will flourish.  My city doesn’t have a large section 8 or welfare class and almost no crime.  Police don’t really have much to do lol.

The police ignore the crystal meth trailer parks and the ghetto drug dealers or they catch and release them to keep the cycle going so the judges and courts can keep billing taxpayers.  This is all about money for them.  Nearly, 5-10% or more of the unemployed population of B.R. are into some type of crime or on drugs.

Chill tf out.\n\nThere is an entire 50% of white liberals that hold a ton of the blame as to why we're \"in trouble.\" \n\nCrime sucks yes most definitely. And blacks have our role in it. But we arent the ones forcing child mutilation, opening the borders, and funding random wars. While protesting for countries weve never been to. Its not us blocking traffic for trees or setting oursleves on fire in front of embassies. Thats yall.\n\nAnd the welfare comments are idiotic considering white people are the majority recipients.\n\nKnowing all of this. Getting rid of black people really wont save you if you live in or near a capitol city. Come off it.\n\nI'm a conservative. But sometimes you guys make it difficult to be here with the assinine comments like this one. Then you wonder why blacks don't help you win elections.\n\nAsk me if I care if \"the other side does it worse against whites\"\n\nI don't and not because I dislike white people. But because to counter it with hate from our side is zero sum and actually hurts the numbers and validates what they are saying.",

And I CERTAINLY do NOT want the riff raff I'm paying to keep my kids away from in the paid school on discount or for free. I have nothing against children learning-i want every child to have the best education possible-but the sad truth is most of these families do not value education and their children do not value education and that manifests in the classroom as a disruption to my investment. I know this on several levels. If children and families in these \"inner city\" schools came from a place of humility and giving a damn they would be flourishing regardless of the budget and resources. Look at children in developing nations with limited resources ranking above USA. Children in those rural schools would make complete use of the resources being wasted on the regular. I'm sick of paying for it.",

Now, I tell my friends not to go to Mardi Gras or visit the French Quarter after dark.  My medical school friends used to party all the time like many college students uptown, without worrying about shootouts or getting their cars stolen. Before Katrina - girls were able to go out at night and not worry as much about getting attacked or robbed.  Now, people report shootouts frequently, home breaking, assaults, etc. - even in uptown/downtown more posh neighborhoods.  The last time I visited which is almost monthly, New Orleans is not as safe as before but nowhere near as dangerous as Baton Rouge.  There are many safe havens 10-15 minutes from downtown, unlike Baton Rouge which is dangerous nearly everywhere.  I go to a place near New Orleans that has nearly zero crime and is affluent.  I will never mention these neighborhoods because I don't want them to get contaminated.  The neighborhoods are mixed with mostly upper-middle class and upper class and very conservative.  It is a paradise of city to live in with everything you need without having to go downtown or uptown.",

        "text": "There was a similar situation in Memphis. There were two governments; a city of Memphis and a Shelby county. The city of Memphis was notorious for mishandling their school money. They spent more money per student than anyone in the state of TN but had the lowest scores. When they could no longer get more money, they chose to surrender their charter to the county to consolidate the Memphis and the suburbs (Shelby County) schools to go after that money in basically a hostile takeover. The suburbs asked to make their own school systems for their small cities. After a lot of back and forth, it had to be taken to the state courts where the suburbs won the right to create their own individual systems. So the Memphis schools turned into “shelby county schools”  and the former county schools turned into five individual city school systems. These smaller school systems have continued to be some of the best in the state. The suburbs just wanted to maintain their level of education for their children. If they had allowed Memphis to take them over, their schools would have plummeted to the level of the city schools where a large amount of graduates can barely read. Had they surrendered their charter AND their administration (because they obviously sucked) this may have not happened. They just wanted to take over the suburbs and use their money as well.",

I’ve been to many mixed cities without crime in Louisiana where you can leave your door open by mistake and wake up safe.  The almost crime free cities are all ran by conservatives who don’t put up with crime or drugs.  The criminals don’t move to cities that will lock them up for life.  The police don’t allow loud music or disturbing the peace.  The cities don’t allow junk yards or unkept property and there is no section 8 homes.  These cities are for conservatives who like clean safe places and we pay a bit more for safety and vote conservative to keep the safety.  They keep the rent high to only attract working people and it works because the tax dollars get to go to the schools, police, and improving the city.",

        "text": "​@thomasreid4063WHY ??? Can you never accept facts, black Americans are too blame for their own situations, even though you are given triple the ammounts of tax payer dollars than whites, look when black run City's and towns are continually failing, the schools and teachers are that bad, and every City employees is rorting their hours worked, the people who run the City are corrupt as fuck, you have to start looking inward !!!, it is not because of the whites, and crime !!! among black Community's it has risen to uncontrollable levels, black people say they want to SUE stores like Walmarts and other chain stores, who are closing and leaving black Citys because of high levels of black organised shoplifting gangs, and at local Council meetings the blacks start going on how much the chemist/ drugstore is needed in an aging black population, and not having to travel on buses to get to parts of the City that have Supermarkets, BUT, YOU NEVER HEAR THEM EVER TALK ABOUT THE REASONS THEIR LEAVING, AND THAT ITS THEIR OWN COMMUNITY'S DOING ALL THE STEALING, OR THE BLACK COMMUNITY WHEN THEY HEAR WHATS HAPPENING, THEY NEVER OFFER TO COME DOWN IN  GROUPS AND SET UP PATROLS TO FOLLOW AND STOP SHOPLIFTERS, AND IF THEY CATCH THEM, HOLD THEM FOR THE POLICE !! WELL WE ALL KNOW THAT WILL NEVER HAPPEN, SO ITS WAY PAST THE TIME BLACK AMERICANS STARTED LOOKING IN THE MIRROR AND REALISE CHANGE ON A MASSIVE SCALE IS NEEDED IN ALL BLACK COMMUNITY'S,  THEIRS EVERY CHANCE IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY, THAT THEIR IS NOT A SINGLE SUCCESSFUL BLACK COMMUNITY/NEIGHBOURHOOD,  THAT ISN'T MOSTLY UNEMPLOYED , MASSIVE NUMBERS OF SINGLE MUMS WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF KIDS FROM MOSTLY DIFFERENT FATHERS, ALL ON WELFARE PAYMENTS , FOODSTAMPS, SECTION HOUSING,  AND THE KIDS ARE MOSTLY NOT CONTROLLED, LEFT TO THEIR OWN DEVICES, BEING KIDS AND CRIME AND DRUG RUNNING, HATING COPS IS PART OF THE DNA OF A LOT OF BLACKS FROM THOSE NEIGHBOURHOODS.  ITS WAY PAST TIME BLACK AMERICANS STOOD ON THEIR OWN TWO FEET, BOUGHT THEIR KIDS UP DECENTLY, MADE SURE THEY WENT TO SCHOOL EVERYDAY ETC, FORCE THE COMMU ITYS MAYOR AND LEADERS TO FIX THE SCHOOLS AS THE NUMBER 1 PRIORITY, UNTILL THEY CAN CHURN OUT EVERYDAY NORMAL EDUCATED CHILDREN, HAVE THE GOVERNMENT COME DOWN ON THESE RECORD COMPANYS WE'RE FINDING OUT ARE FORCING THE RAPPERS TO GLORIFY THUGGISH BEHAVIOUR, NO RESPECT FOR WOMEN, GANG BANGING ETC, ITS PRETTY SAD WHEN YOUNG BLACK KIDS BETWEEN 5 AND 8 YRS OLD, WHEN ASKED WHAT THEY WANT TO BE WHEN THEY GROW UP, GIVE A REPLY OF \"A PIMP\", OR A \"DRUG DEALER\", AND WHEN ASKED WHY, THEY SAY THEIR COOL AND MAKE A LOT OF MONEY, ETC, AND THE BLACKS AROUND THEM ALL LAUGH AND JOKE !!! LIKE FUCKEN C'MON MAN, NONE OF THAT IS THE FAULT OF THE AVERAGE WHITE WHO LIVES IN THE SUBURBS, THE BIGGEST PROBLEM FOR BLACK AMERICA IS YOU'S ALLOWED A RACIST DEMOCRAT PARTY CAPTURE YOU'S, DESTROY A INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL BLACK COMMUNITY ( NOT ALL, BUT IT WOULD HAVE SLOWLY INCLUDED ALL ), BLACKS IN THE 40's, 50's WERE THE FASTEST GROWING ECONOMIC MOVEMENT IN AMERICA AT THAT TIME, THEY WERE BUILDING BLACK BANKS, BLACK INSURANCE COMPANYS, AND EVERY OTHER BUSINESS THAT WAS NEEDED, AND ALL THE BLACK PEOPLE USED THOSE SERVICES, AND THEY GREW QUICKLY, WELL I BELIEVE IT PUT SUCH A SCARE IN THE OLD KKK AKA THE DEMOCRATS, THAT THEY CONSPIRED TO DUPE THE AMERICAN BLACKS, LIE ABOUT THE REPUBLICANS, AND THEY DID SUCH A GOOD JOB OF CONVINCING BLACKS TO STICK TO THEM LIKE SHIT TO PAPER, THAT THEY COULDN'T SEE FOR THE LIFE OF THEM, THEY DESTROYED BIT BY BIT ALL THE SUCCESSFUL BLACK BUSINESSES,  SHUT THEM OUT, BOUGHT THEID BANKS ETC FOR PENNYS, THEN DID THE BIG BREAK UP BLACK HOMES THAT HAD BEEN BECOMING AMONGST THE MOST SUCCESSFUL FAMILY UNITS ( WHAT SCARED THE DEMS SO BAD, THEY DESTROYED AN ENTIRE RACES ECONOMIC LIFELINE TO SUCCESS ?????) UNTILL THEY MADE SURE BLACK WONEN ONLY GOT HIGHER WELFARE IF THE KICKED THE MALE PARTNER OUT, AND HOUSING ETC, WHY WOULD A GOVERNMENT DO SHIT LIKE THAT TO ITS PEOPLE, OR WHY WOULD A DEMOCRAT GOVERNMENT DO IT TO THE PEOPLE THEY HAD CONNED SO PERFECTLY THEY WERE AND CONTINUE TO BELIEVE EVERY LIE THEY TOLD THEM, EVEN AS THEY DESTROYED THEIR ONCE INCREDIBLE AND SUCCESSFUL FAMILY UNITS AND ECONOMY AND BUSINESSES????, EVEN NOW, AS THEY ARE DITCHING THEM FOR THE HISPANICS WHO ARE GOING TO BE THE MAJORITY IN THIS COUNTRY, AS THEY SEE YOUNG BLACKS ARE SEEING THROUGH THE DISGUSTING AMERICAN DESTROYING ANTICS AND ARE LEAVING THE DEMOCRAT PLANTATION, BUT THE OLDER BLACKS ARE STILL CONNED AND RUSTED ON !!!!. BUT ITS NOT THE FAULT OF WHITE PEOPLE, AS MUCH AS YOU DONT WANT TO ACCEPT ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FAILURE OF BLACK COMMUNITY'S,  TRY DOING SOME POSITIVE SHIT, WE DONT MIND HELPING WITH THAT, BUT NOT TO THE HATERS. SOMETHING FOR YOU TO THINK ABOUT.",

But no, begging under the shade tree. I did notice he was getting a bit sun burned tho. It does make you want to scream get a job like everyone else. But 4 kids were there and they should have been in school.

It is new development so many types of businesses as well and nearly all have a help wanted or we are hiring signs in the windows or near the highway in front of the business. And hiw is it supposed to go? I don't have cash to give you begger...oh, that's OK I have venmo so here is my cell number...so that would be awkward for a begger I think. I know people can fall on hard times. I know this but begging for change isn't going to change your situation. Only drug addicts do this typically. Churches will help you. We have many in this area too plus food banks, an employment office, and where you would apply for assistance. The begging bothers me unless your car has broken down. But, begging is not legal here so they use signs and I doubt you have that if your car has broken down and all 4 kids had tablets.",

Now that they won't be having to pay for the freeloading majority of the city's residents for crap results, they can invest their money wisely in the section of the city that they're making an independent city.  One city will decay because they drove away the hard working producers and tax-payers, and the new city will flourish due to not having to carry the dead weight of lazy freeloaders.  Another thing that will prove the truth will be the higher crime-rates in the city that's being left, and the low crime-rates in the newly-formed city.  As for what they'll create, it will be improved safety, services, and schools that the city they left refused to provide, because they were wasting the tax-money from productive people on lazy freeloaders drawing welfare checks.",
