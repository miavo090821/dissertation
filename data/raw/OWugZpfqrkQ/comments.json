Du Bois was the editor of The Crisis and Zora Neale Hurston was one of his younger writers. They clashed all the time because he hated her embrace of the southern folkways and the vernacular language and expressions…he had a view that Black art was propaganda and had to fight the battle against white supremacy as it impeded citizenship…but he imbibed that so hard he actually was just an as to a young Black woman writer who he could have helped mentor. Hurston had more help from white liberal benefactors than Du Bois when he was literally her boss and in a position to best nurture her writing talent.",

I do worry about the right wing culture war they are waging trying to tear the sport apart but I think the WNBA should survive it and I think we can look forward to more talent and better product on the court inspite of them",

She's moreso just being used as a vehicle by the people participating in the whole thing. Especially the white folk latching onto her and putting her in that \"great white hope\" position.\n\nShe's just minding her business hooping. And the whole discussion it has driven sadly takea away from so many of the athletes that are actually hooping like crazy but dont get anywhere near as much attention. \n\nAnd admittedly she could probably end this all by disavowing the nonsense thats been brought up but i guess from a financial POV shes probably chosen to stay quiet/play both sides and basically let both sides assume what they wanna assume for better or for worse. \n\nBut yeah in any case the whole thing is a shame coz rather than cover the sport as is a lot of it has turned into the narratives nonsense and thats something a lot of those commenters feed on be it a Stephen A Smith or Shannon Sharpe etc and knowing folks like those they'll always rather talk and do anything for the bag than to just let people who actually cover women's basketball do their thing. \n\nKeep up the great work 🫡👊🏿💜 these videos are always very nuanced and insightful",

I just wanted to add that the innate purpose of frames is to create limits and boundaries around the full picture. Societal narratives will never encapsulate the full truth, but instead use the stories to manufacture consent and as justification for further exploitation/oppression. \n- Sports is the battleground for society's identity issues to play out.\n- This discourse as it relates to Shannon & the talking heads (sounds like a band name 😂) and the idea of Black athletes having to adhere to Black stereotypes for capitalistic success was covered in James Baldwin's essay \"The Price of the Ticket\". I'm always gonna advocate for people to read more Baldwin! \n- Love as always to Olay + friends 💜 This one hit close to home because my cousin plays in the WNBA",

I will say though that I believe similarly to Taylor Swift, Caitlyn Clark is their LAST great white hope and I say “last” because the tides are shifting and white people are having some sort of panic because they recognize that they are not the future of this country, let alone the world. \n\nI also think Angel responds the way she does in interviews because of this and she’s frustrated. Now does this take away from Caitlyn being a good player, no. However, I will mention she played against my university and I personally was not seeing all the hype but my school’s women’s bb team is really good so yeah. But this doesn’t change the fact that she is being used by racist white people to push their agenda. I’m sure she is bringing in ticket sales but even that I believe has a large part to do with the fact that these people aren’t genuinely supporting women’s sports but coming from a place of hate and wanting to see a white girl beat black women. \n\nThe support isn’t genuine, and I’m pretty sure if Angel wouldn’t have done that John cena wave, we would’ve never heard about Caitlyn Clark again because they wouldn’t have felt a need to protect her. They’re only rooting for her so hard because they perceive Angel as an enemy. You remove the supposed enemy and you lose the passion. Some people only care about something if they feel like there’s an enemy to beat.",

I definitely agree she should be more forceful in calling out those agendas, but I definitely think she is not okay with that and she does not want to be a part of that, but she may not understand exactly why she has become such a big part of the culture war. She also has said in press conferences when she had been asked about the physicality basically saying it’s basketball and those are basketball plays (except the Chennedy Carter shove that was not really involved in the play).

With the whole recent Caitlin Clark buzz, I'd been thinking about watching and supporting my nearest WNBA team. I hadn't considered how much it comes across like WNBA mattering now that it has a white face. Hell, in the suggested videos right next to this, there was a video claiming one of Caitlin's black teammates is ruining the fever she brings to the game by not passing to her. The misogynoir is real. I'll definitely try to be more conscious of what's going on and who talking in sports is keeping it real vs. who's just pushing Caitlin.",

Just b/c CC is the cash cow doesn’t mean she is the best nor does it mean she can’t critiqued it means she is an asset and they (WNBA) should capitalize off of her popularity regardless of her color to grow the game and revenue. If we want others to recognize the other talent in the wnba independent media should cover outstanding talent in the W rather than keep discussing CC. Her being on team USA would have not been a testament to how great she is as a player but her being utilized as a tool to get the league more attention. She definitely could have taken Diana T. spot. There numbers were comparable and I highly doubt it would have caused chemistry problems. Y’all didn’t really touch on the league not being able to turn a profit which is why uncle Shay Shay and SAS had those takes. She is not only reason for the WNBA having a great season views wise but she is a big reason and it is due popularity and upside not because of who she is now as a player.  I feel like y’all takes were more ethically/morally  based and Shannon/SAS takes were more business based.",

She even told reporters to ask her Black teammates questions that were sitting right next to her because she was getting all the questions. Why should CC downplay anything. CC talks about what she needs to improve in her game but she knows she's a great player. And she's a great player, not a good one. She's developing and has many holes in her game as does Angel. But CC is great at passing and if you don't think so, go  Google \"Theresa Weatherspoon Caitlin is outstanding at what she does\" and see what Spoon thinks of Caitlin. Or see what Taurasi said about her lately.  Caitlin constantly gives other players, black or white, their flowers, their respect, in comments. She even praised Chennedy Carter (who is a great player) as a player and always praises Angel as a player.",

If that's your threshold, that's your threshold, and you're entitled to it.

Also she does lead college in points made as well averaging 27 or 28 per game. \n\nAlso u have to factor in how many the other girls were making as well.

Last year in college she ranked 55th in 3pt percentage. Sure there’s some context as I’m not disingenuous enough to act like someone that only shot 4 threes all season and made 2 is a better shooter than CC since they shoot 50 percent. But once you start getting past 100-150 threes we have a good feel for how well you shoot. Pao Pao from SC was a waaaaay better shooter than CC. She didn’t shoot as many. I’ll say she’s a solid shooter being fair. I won’t call her average that’s a bit of an exaggeration. But calling her Steph Curry is a larger exaggeration.

If she's an average shooter now then she'll be good going forward. \n\nAnd u honestly were calling cc average (lol even in this u called her an average shooter). But u did fall for what u said u r tryin to be disingenuous on. Pao pao was def shooting at a higher percentage (47 is insane) but she was takin bout 2 a game. CC was shooting about 6 per game. That's why I'm like u have to account for attempts and makes. Pao was taking smarter shots that CC but im pretty sure her averages would drop if shot like how CC was shooting. \n\nIn my opinion CC is a shooter considering where she gets a majority of the shots from. Also top 2 in D1 in 3pts made (not just points made). She gets a majority of her shots from 3 which is how curry gets his shots. I think wen people r saying \"she's the next curry\" it's a bit of hype along with how her game has closely resembles Curry. All players have their coms. I think Breanna Stewart resembles Tim Dun a bit. That's just the nature of the game\n\nAlso I think people look at Harden as a high volume shooter becuz most of his points come from 3",

I’m just going by what is and since you’re already saying she’s a great shooter I’m arguing that point. She’s not. You also made a disingenuous point about Pao Pao matching my example of someone shooting 4 threes all season. She averaged 5 and and 5.5 3’s per game her last two seasons and shot 42 and 46% from 3. That about 200 threes. The season CC shot the least 3’s she had the worst 3 point percentage. I don’t buy that argument that’s why I keep referencing Steph since that’s the name people say. He’s never shot as bad as CC. Ever. Her best is his worst. And his best is far beyond anything she’s ever did. Harden had season where he shot 12 and 13 threes a game as well and shot 37% like CC. That’s not Steph. She’s a solid shooter. But there’s no metric that shows she great. None. Shooting the most doesn’t make you the best. Especially since you’re just missing the most lol",

You hadn’t seen CC. No one had done that before. That is insane. You don’t have the record unless you have insane years. I definitely think efficiency matters. I’m not impressed with a lot of shots with low efficiency. That’s how your team loses! lol. The fever have been better when CC takes less shots not more.

She's actually in something of a shooting slump. It's her passing and court vision that has me anticipating what she does in the next game. As far as this conversation above, I can't listen to it. Because you're Black, you don't have to love Angel Reese's game. You don't have to want her to be this or that. There is a point where you can watch a basketball player do her or his thing and say, I like watching them. I like a lot of non-Black athletes and a ton of Black atheltes. But it is what they do in their sport that has me interested. If folks want to talk about the silliness in the media, well, they will. I don't find it interesting. And I'm weary of Black folks saying if you don't act like we think you should act you're not Black. That mentality keeps us down.",

Clark became all time scorer in NCAA division 1 ball (male or female)…a record that’s been in place for decades.\n\nThere have been several white wnba players with similar play styles (Sabrina Ionescu most recently) that didn’t get the same hype as Clark…and Sabrina went to a all time program in UConn so the media bias and push was in her favor. \n\nClark plays a game that others can emulate, much like how Curry changed the game with his shooting. There are several black players that better than CC, but most younger girls simply can’t emulate their play (Aja Wilson, Brittany Griner, Maya Moore, Candace Parker all are unique and can’t be replicated). \n\nClark’s success with help get all of these some more money and attention than they would have previously…Aja Wilson got a shoe deal right after CC for example. This whole conversation may be trivial in a few years anyway once JuJu Watkins gets the league…she’s the actually future of the sport",

        "text": "I'm sorry but it is a weak narrative by folks with an agenda. Clark is another player who happens to be white. And Caitlin is only like Curry in that she takes really long shots effortlessly. But she's also like Stockton in her passing and court vision and that's really the most consistent and outstanding aspect of her game. Boston is becoming kinda like Malone but Aaliyah has her own talents as well. Both Clark and Aaliyah are really mature and express well in press conferences so they are very likable people to follow in that sense.  I don't give a crap if Clark was Asian, Indian, white, Black, or Latina, I like what she does out there on the court. (that's not to say she doesn't have a lot of holes in her game or needs to develop) The media is the media, using her for publicity, clicks, ratings.",

    "text": "There have been Caitlyn’s before.  White guards who were picked first.  Sue Bird, Diana Taurasi , Kelsey Plum, Sabrina Ionescu.  \n\nAll of these players were considered (skill for skill) all around better players coming out of college.  \n\nJason Whitlock would claim she’s not part of the “Alphabet gang…”. Neither is Plum.  I don’t know about Sabrina…. And plum is CLEARLY better looking.  In fact all are arguably better looking, including Diana and she doesn’t even present as feminine.  This statement was just in reference to marketability.  \n\nSo why is Caitlin being hoisted?\n\nIt’s not because she broke the scoring record in college.  Because she broke Plum’s record.  So Plum would have been hoisted.  Truth is, She is the only one of these 5 women who had the one thing white people rally around  more than all other things combined:  a black foil.  Angel Reese is more important to this narrative than Caitlin Clark.  If Bird, Taurasi, Plum, or Ionescu had a black foil, this response from the collective yt community would have happened then.  \n\nWithout Reese, CC would be no different than those other 4.  Her long range shooting is NOT the thing selling out arenas.  It’s a thing, but it’s not the thing.\n\nNone of the other 4 were tasked with saving the collective white sports soul of America.",
