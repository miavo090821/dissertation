capitalism on its own is never going to free us because we've been the capital because they recognize how respectability politics work they have no problem with the fact that to play the respectability politics game means to entirely discard SWA of black people black athletes in general have to kind of embody this Buck existence where they become physical vessels through which white fantasies get to play out if a white girl would have went like that to Caitlyn Clark we're not talking about it in the same way it does just kind of seem like a lot of misplaced energy I I don't even understand the angle for real there's a lot that happens with a lot of like black women athletes is like this masculinization hello beautiful black people let me tell you why I've convened you here today I want to talk about angel Reese and Caitlyn Clark like particularly just the way not cuz I don't watch I don't watch nobody's sports but I have covered I have made a video before about angel Reese because the treatment of Angel Reese always seems to come across my radar but all what I have seen is a lot of black men jump out to like wrap Caitlyn Clark in in the cloak like protect her at all costs meanwhile they're like you you angel and and and everybody else so that's and I brought Chris to give us the details because that's Chris versus Forte that's what Chris does that that me up cuz from the outside looking in being completely disengaged it might just be the nature of my feed I've only seen black men thirst after Angel Reese for the most part and throw a little shade at Caitlyn Clark I haven't seen that so I'm just I want to protect that energy really have c not except for Stephen A Smith you said I'm G have the best representation of Blackman on my Fe yes I I refuse FD said word that's what they've been doing yes the brothers have done what you see you see the disappointment in my face when you mention it I was I did not know this was happening all I've seen is memes about being the NBA house husband the WBA house husband oh yes and and you know random thirst traps from them walking into the games which I'm like this is great also jokes how many men think that like it's going to be House Husbands like that's that's also funny to me how many of them have centered themselves in in a lot of fantasies that ain't for them it will be interesting to see how Caitlyn Clark gets treated by her white fan base once if if and when because I don't know but I I've I've seen the I've had you know queer folks tell me give tea or offer tea that she's not playing for the team that the conservatives would prefer her to play for um so we'll see it' be interesting if and when it happens because you know they they they only take their tokens so often they they already got what is it uh Rick Rubin Nick Rubin Jim Rubin what's that dude name Dave Ruben Dave rubben I don't get I think it's that all every every name ex James Ruben Tom Ruben right okay so full Us in Chris what's been happening what's been happening is yeah uh as you mentioned a lot of black you know current and former athletes have been showing their asses on the timeline just propping up Kaitlyn as his Savior and that she should be treated like the Messiah the next Messiah and it's really disappointing Shannon sharp Stephen A Smith good arenus Nick Young Austin Rivers uh Brandon Jennings Rashad MCC the list is so damn long that it gets really frustrating because while I'm glad FD that you've seen black men you know appreciating Angel Reese there's also black men who somehow or for some reason they have this desire to put her down and vilify her uh namely emo AO um who I have a lot of disdain for right I've tried to keep his name out of my mouth um for several reasons because it just messes with my spirit but they vilify her and they try to act as if Angel Reese wanted to become the villain but the villain role was placed onto her by mainstream media and so when she does something where she's trash talking or maybe she gets an ejection people come out and say well see this is why she needs to get off social media this is why you know people don't like her you know it's all this this ghetto behavior and you know she's trying to be act all big and tough but when you know the [ __ ] hits the fan then she starts crying when the woman was hypersexualized during her career at LSU right the woman was being called out of her name so many times I've lost count for everything she does she shits flowers right it's fairy tale ending she can do no wrong and so for people who have such a big platform like Stephen A Shannon sharp saying look Caitlyn Clark is the reason why y'all got this why you got charter flights while you're getting raises and salaries eventually so y'all need to be grateful it irks my nerves to the furthest in because I'm a black man and I know the privilege that I have as a male right but for some reason these guys they don't and so that's part of what we've been seeing you know on the timeline and just in mainstream media and the other thing is and then I'll shut up um Kaylin Clark is being used uh David Dennis put this greatly from handscape and ESPN she's being used as an avatar for people to express their disdain for black women and she's also being used as an avatar and a face for the Maga community yeah and just this day somebody asked her uh great respective reporter Jim trer asked her hey uh how do you feel about your name being used you know for culture wars she like I can't control it you know what I'm saying it doesn't bother me that people weaponize my name to get their agendas off which is in the name of white supremacy um so it's a lot of [ __ ] that's going on in in the WNBA right now question didn't she not win the the championship this year either she is not a champion she's not she W cuz cuz Angel won last year and that's like for me that's the first women's basketball moment I've paid attention to since since I was in high school watching like home girls play I had like a couple of highlevel I think our our senior year they won like second in state shout out to the Thunderbirds and [ __ ] um like but I hadn't pay attention since until I saw Angel Reese put uh put put put not put hands on it but like throw down and like win a championship that moment right there yeah that's the moment that Sparks the entire emergence of women's basketball to like get mainstream attention I want to be clear I'm not trying to like underp undermine yeah but but yeah sorry like to kind of prepare to this for this moment it starts with them in college and they kind of put them in a Larry um versus uh magic magic type of context so it's it's wild as a person who's not paying a ton of attention to to hear this reversal of the story where the one that's never actually won a championship because they beat Angel this year in the final four but then still lost if I'm not mistaken in the lead yeah and then they they lost to the Gamecocks it's funny that you bring that up because that's actually one of the points of contention that they've been [ __ ] on Angel with that I keep coming across Angel they basically a lot of you see the the a lot of these black men these black commentators that Chris has mentioned have been basically the narrative that they're crafting is that everybody Caitlyn Clark should be given essentially special treatment she should be treated and talked about they should be as soft on as possible as kind on as possible and everything because basically everybody in the league ow owes a death to Caitlyn Clark because if it were not for Caitlyn Clark we wouldn't be talking about or thinking about women's basketball meanwhile Angel Reese what she puts forward is what I know to be reality she was like no it's not just her it's me too and because it's Angel Reese that put them put women I ain't thought about nothing ree before Angel Reese I like I said I have a video on my channel a year ago about angel Reese and I don't watch nobody's women's bask I don't watch nobody's basketball nobody's nothing nobody's Sport and I'm like Angel Rees is the one in popping up in music videos with cardi and and lotto and doing stuff and being at the Met Gala and what have you what are we talking about like why are you acting as though we weren't for start thinking about her as what what she buy you Barbie like all of that like what I think Angel Reese oh God no you you go angel I think Angel Reese I think it's important there's so much to unpack here because just like a lot of I'mma Al lesan McCoy ass in there too oh yeah yeah but these commentators keep bringing up the fact that Caitlyn Clark is the reason why the NBA is getting the WNBA is getting all this attention why they're getting uh different charter flights heard you but let's talk about why that is and we're not digging deeper into that it's like okay she and even Don Staley when Don Staley beat Caitlyn Clark last year and went undefeated with her Gamecock she shouted Caitlyn Clark out for the fact that Caitlyn's game has brought a lot of new eyes because what what I'm not gonna do is diminish her game she could play in college she was hooping okay she's still hooping now but she's got to learn that [ __ ] is different you've reached a new level in which you have to be more physical and they're going to guard you different and she's learning that the hard way she's still competing at a high level even now but with that said you know two things can be true yes you can bring eyes to the game but also Angel Reese a black woman doing this in front of in your face caused a narrative and understand in sports it's so much about the narrative as well sell me a story line and so that story line is what caught on and and what made people really really interested the people who don't watch women's sports who don't watch basketball we're like oh what's going on and the underlying thing there is that it was about race if a white girl would have went like that to Caitlyn Clark we're not talking about it in the same way well I remember I think I think if I'm not misten but that that's my entire point that is not what we were talking about she did that the fact that this black woman did that to what they consider to be the second coming of Larry Bird was too much and now we can create a narrative around this because we have a villain and we have a victim and we know this story all too well and it's even happening now you know you see Caitlyn Clark playing the WNBA has always been physical always you see her playing sure she getting hip checked falling to the ground her ponytail might fly heard you Angel Reese was getting knocked the drug out like I forget the is who did it but she Wasa Thomas Thomas I don't see us talking about it in the same way and it's it's interesting when you think about Shannon it's interesting when you think about Stephen A and this white gaze that they're so hyper aware of and that's connected to capitalism and them climbing up this this corporate ladder and then in addition you see them um dealing with this this white victimhood it's like this brute thing with it it it's so entrenched in our history it's so wild to see it play out and then to see um mon the the Monas the tailor that like the joy like all of them come out and try to explain to these men to take a beat to step back and hear what we're saying see it with clear eyes and understand that there's Nuance here that you don't want to discuss is so disheartening like I used to love Shannon sharp I humanize him I love him still but I'm like damn that southern upbringing and this money you up dog that's big time I never saw it I never saw it as clear as I do now of of how oh jum because I haven't paying attention to to this particular Sports activity but there one thing I'm pretty strong background on it's like black male athletes and like the culture produ both produced by and produced in tandem with them and um there's Shannon and especially AO um and a lot of these dudes um there's a specific type of trajectory that you you have to basically it's a mind stat you have to put yourself in especially for football players basketball players as well but if you notice there's way more FL I'm going just say I don't know how much you gotta bleep out there's way more in football than basketball yeah because of the way those two sports are produced um like if you think about it B basketball they ain't perfect this some wild hotepery that goes on there but it's never it's doesn't seldom look like what ao's on a lot of times or what Shannon sharp is on let alone like her Walker you know what I'm saying Y and so like OJ right like black athletes in general um have to kind of embody this Buck existence where they where they become physical vessels to which white fantasies get to play out um that that is the nature of the black athletes existence and value in these games and so many of them just kind of managed that because it's like look this I don't like how this feels a lot of times but I'm about to sign a $30 million contract I'm about to change my whole family's lives will be bucks as garbage men too the game is the game the game is the game but those who like continue to penetrate and they seek um leadership and accolades within those within those venues have some of the most Insidious like Behavior because they can still wrap it up in all these like it's not like Hershel Walker or I don't know insert give me some one of these weird the super weird black conservative types Hodge twins you know people that's like they're never around black people so like you're not actually paying attention to them whereas you pointed out Antoinette Shannon sharp is of the culture that's a Down South Uncle Shannon it's Uncle Shannon he's still Uncle Shannon he's also Uncle Tom too I got know some Uncle Shannon a lot of black folks got a Uncle Shannon an old negro that got their money went and found their white wife to prove their value to society and ain't said a nice thing about a black woman uh since their mother died in the 80s like well he I don't know if he does he he has I have heard him talk about angel Reese in a positive way I H I have yes but there's something to be said about it's when you said he went and got his money he went and got his money and he knows how he had to operate in in order to get it and so his Pathway to Liberation and freedom is deeply connected to white gays it's deeply connected to to doing right by white folks and it's deeply connected to capitalism and that is not how we are going to get free but for him he's uprooted his family from poverty he's never had this much um I I mean his cache right now he got a million and a billion shows right now right and he's he's this is on the heels of him being with skip who we all know there were some issues there and it played out right for us to see and then he takes this risk to go and do it on his own on his own but at the same time he still has to be mindful and he still has to operate in in a way that doesn't upset Massa and I don't and the the the deepest part for me is that I don't think he's aware and that's what is so they would aware yeah they beat that out of him by by college real talk a shout out to um Arian Foster shout out to Aaron Maan these are two brothers that both play in the NFL at high levels that that help me like develop this analysis and they talk about having to you know embody that white gays um that affinity for the white gays and like take so much [ __ ] and that the people that don't take that [ __ ] never make it they become um attitude problems and and team non team players and stuff like that like when you hear about I don't know DeAndre Hopkins some years ago getting in trouble and all these other players even the Kyrie Irving although Kyrie's a a weirdo a lot of levels yeah but part of that is because in his flawed way he does have a anti buuck ethos around his personhood as an athlete and when you have that anti- buuck ethos we don't really hear from when you're when you're comfortable in that position you get to be shanon sure and that's what IO trying to do himself AO trying to intellectualize it you know he's but yeah I'm sorry I cut off Chris go ahead man no I think no uh the other thing is like capitalism that is never capitalism on its own is never going to free us right because we've been the capital for so long um and I hate yeah the fact that Shannon sharp did what he did on first take the other day um by just denigrating and insulting Andrea Carter and Jana gum um two WNBA analysts who are really good at their jobs um the next day he announces he's get a contract extension so it just goes to oh yeah I'mma do what M says right I'm a shuck and Jive I'm gonna appeal to the white gays and that's going to give me a lot of money people like Andrea Carter said look I don't care if I'm going to be underpaid because Stephen A made the point that listen Andrea you're going to be underpaid for the rest of what I think is going to be an lusterous career if you don't understand what marke yeah the whole man's planing thing let let's talk about how when Monica said wait I'm so sorry finish what you were just saying I'mma write the Monica thing now because it's important when she gets into integrity that's so important yeah Andrea said look I don't care about if I have to get underpaid I I'm not going to sacrifice my morals and integrity I'm going to stand on what I do I'm still going to be entertained in as but I'm not going to operate the way you want me to and if I don't make as much money then so be it but yeah go ahead scoffed yeah they sced at it I mean you have to see it to believe it they they were like sister you not taking heed to what we trying to tell you it's like Aaron find a clip what if I could jump in I'm sorry Christine were you about to talk cuz I know you no I'm learning let me tell you too okay I like I didn't we didn't want to hog I've known like three names out of every name everybody I got find the clip and I gotta run in a second anyway so I got to get my I gotta get my darts in before I bounce um so what's so funny is a couple of like a month ago Stephen A was just going in on um the worst of them Mall oh uh big dude y know Whitlock Whitlock yeah and it's so interesting cuz my first instinct before I enjoyed him dragging Whitlock cuz Whitlock is trash like so Steve Stephen n is like Malcolm X compared to Whitlock that's how bad Whitlock is because Whitlock is an unadulterated like unabashed Stephen is the kind of like black person you know in your life who you know don't identify as a [ __ ] but in turn has a bunch of antiblackness yes Stephen N is a lot of us if but God which is why I try to like engage with that mostly empathetically because it's really easy to point and laugh at because they're funny and they're awful and they deserve derision however so many of us are uh a lack of scholarship away a scholarship or two away from or a scholarship away from you know what I'm saying so like I give I give Stephen a rope every once in a while whereas Whitlock is like you like said unabashed but I do I want I brought that up because what the Stephen A's as o just said and the sharps and whatever don't realize it's kind of this like black eth Excellence this black Excellence mythology is so tied to it's it's it's it's anti-blackness at its core but in practice and like in its branding and marketing what it looks like is we the talented tth and all the that can't get right and if y'all would just get right Monica if you would just pay attention and listen to what we saying and and brand yourself appropriately home girl you can have this this this and this trust me I'm Uncle Stephen A I've been doing this for years it's like Uncle Stephen A you also be doing some [ __ ] though you you you've been chucking and Jing since you came on here with that that sanord and Sun speaking voice that you had from day one and the scariest part I think like you know we don't always get to contend with and I and I usually have my my cape on if uh but the scariest thing I think is we we often assume or you want to give them the benefit of the doubt that this is being done you know in some kind of way because you're being they're being mused to by like the white man that's really cutting the check or the white man above or the corporation or whatever have you but I've been on the phone with a lot of a lot of people it is my time and that I've I've given the benefit of like multiple times I've talked to I assumed you were being you know what I pulling your strings and they've been like no no actually this how we get ahead sister but that shows you how effective white supremacy is right it's like even when you're not being this is psychological warfare at this point like and you see it play out of of oh you can't even see how you're being harmful you can't even see how you're being used and you can't even see how you are being dis powered y like you can't see it and it's so disappointing and interesting and all this for you know a young woman who currently I mean her team sucks but they're I think second in the league give me a break and they're talk and people are talking about she should have been on the Olympic team K yeah they're one of the worst team yeah they're one of the worst team searching for it I was searching for it I can't remember if it was St but there was like a direct comparison between what they had to say for like Angel Reese like oh she needs to you know like wait till she make it struggle no problem thank thank you s I'll text it right on to you thank you let me go the only thing that I've seen no I have nothing to add going to be to be fair it it's it is you so well not to be fair let me cfy so we have a robust economy of denigrating black women in media like that is a economy of its own a genre of entertainment of its own um so I want to be clear on that and that it's just for one of the first times but not for the first time entering into the sports world because we also have Serena Williams similar similar song and dance um but I I did want to point out that the way white supremacy is is only interested in gender when it's most useful and so like we saw similar s [ __ ] with with black men with with Lamar Jackson last year as he went on to his MVP season and one of these mother he wasn't quarterback enough um and and I think right and and I feel like Shannon was one of the one of his main critics um over and over again yes go back and forth so you know it's it's just and and it's because and I want to be clear just probably right after this you don't hear that about um momes you hear a little bit about Dak but Dak isn't very good it's it's no shade to all the shade to Cowboys fans Dam and uh there certain type of black athletes will get the benefit of the doubt because they will shuck and J they will dance and then Lamar is a perfect example although something something about Lamar don't smell right to me I'm just putting that out there now I've always not liked his energy he just remind me of some of my cousins I'm like oh Lord but I feel like you got you said some [ __ ] you it's coming well but beyond that he's also not a dancer he's not going to dance for y'all and so they always have attacked him in unfair ways because he doesn't dance um and so that is the economy as a whole of just how these white supremacist structures will utilize the the the Corporal material of these black bodies to play this sport to to scream and clap for but never to hear from unless they're hearing the the company line you have to you have to hear this before leave FD so thank you for finding for me anet cuz I was searching so Shannon sharp this is what he had to say on Shakari uh Richardson not making the Olympic team he said quote she should have competed she didn't qualify to compete stop the bull Jive Antics train hard Sports aren't sympathetic you do or you don't then on Caitlyn Clark not making the Olympic team he goes name a more popular woman basketball player right now than Caitlyn Clark sounds about right you have to you have to consider the strategy in the media and Caitlyn Clark's cache Shakari has no um cache in in Shannon's eyes because she's not valued in the same way she's not going to draw she's a black woman who doesn't present the way that mainstream media will grab a hold of her and and embrace her fully with both arms I didn't even know she was clear there you go and and like I don't know what the appropriate terms is but this is also with Angel it's also that they're Hood I was just politics I was about to say they're married to respectability politics like that's what it is and like instead of because they recognize how respectability politics work they have no problem with the fact that to play the respectability politics game means to entirely discard and like swash of black people for what they're worth show yeah until they show because hasn't Shannon been on the air with the Hennessy and the and up his yeah like but like when you portray it as like some as an inform entertainment you're feeding into menstrual so you want to be respectable until it helps you get your we ain't going to talk about this upside down Hitler mustache he been rocking for the last like year it's a soul real real quick I'm about to I gotta run out a Shameless plug I had I did do a black athletes video um a couple years back it's one of my favorites but um it's you know also one of them joints whenever I do Sports [ __ ] be like we don't want to hit that talk about mosphere so you know Shameless plug go ahead put that in the description it' be there when yes I got you I'm G do that s make sure I get the right one because you got several several sports videos true true true that one is I I I'll send it to you peace and blessings y'all yes thank you this clip we have evidence that shows that has happened in the past number one and number two because I absolutely adore seeing you on television I really really do so allow me to give you some words of advice Andrea I strongly suggest you rethink such positions especially when it comes to you because marketing matters it's how you get paid if you don't know that you better hear me and hear me good I am telling you right now you are going to be underpaid for the rest of what I consider what I believe will be career unless you get your mind right about that marketing it matters it matters T you know I'm right I hear you know right I hear you Stephen A but I will not sacrifice my basketball knowledge and my Integrity in terms of the game for marketing my marketing is doing just fine and if has to slower to hold on Team USA has we've have in the past excuse me I just maybe they're not trying to do it this year Ste Stephen Andrea Andrea Andrea USA has won seven straight gold medals this is ADV how much they the game screaming at it's crazy because they're literally screaming like Stephen A is screaming at her the entire time she barely gets a few words out she can't even finish her sentence and then Shannon starts screaming that thing they do like women like women are being hysterical like calm down calm down like he has to shout her down meanwhile she's not being hysterical all the other man is screaming hysterically oh my God and this is all just because she didn't go on the Olympic team she didn't make it right she make the conversation is so the conversation the the context is that Caitlyn Clark who is a rookie and it's very seldom that that rookies make Olympic teams was not selected to be on the Olympic team it's like the biggest deal to these men because of her marketing cache and if they want to grow the WNBA she should be on the team gu what crazy such the Olympic team has never had an issue the the women's the American women's Olympic team has gone and dominated people watch like their their stat are their stats their marketing is their marketing they're also trying to get a gold medal they're not running around and trying to be the most popular the WNBA is a different thing the WNBA is growing its popularity now but it's not just on the back of Caitlyn Clark it's on the backs of Don Staley Asia Wilson Caitlyn Clark included we have Angel Reese like it the the whole conversation around why this girl should be propped up is simply because White America loves her she's selling out Arenas they've gone through and they and they have the the numbers to back it up right that for her fever team the the Arenas are bigger the her her um her games are being televised like people are engaging they want to see her play and when she comes real fast when she comes to town right people buy those tickets right great fine fine that does not me Merit her getting a spot on the Olympic team it's just ridiculous speciically what's happening here because it's like this is this is white white supremacy and misog are working so hard that it's like overtaking not only just like regular plan day sexism but also even what they're saying even on their shallow level of marketing or anything because if they really cared about marketing and all of what they're talking about would be singing the prases of an Angel Reese who branded herself a bayou Barbie and immediately has her sneaker line we know about it's popping out in in music videos was at the Met and then immediately won her game is being a baddy all around the place right like if they cared about those things if they were even having the usual sexist shallow arguments they have there are so many different players they would be talking about for being like for style for good looks who they have paying attention for all the different reasons Caitlyn Caitlyn Clark I'm not going to comment on what that young woman looks like but people watch but also this is in tandem with the same the conversation I have seen and the clips I have seen is her flopping on the field because she don't have good good footing and she and people say it's the and and listen right I want to say this so this is the thing that I want to say it isn't even just that they're not even watching her just it's not even regular white like it's not just regular racism it's not just like or just like they see themselves and Her Like She's the white girl there first of all there are other white girls who are not who are not a part of controversy that are down there with their black teammates and not a part not being used yes who are speaking out against problematic [ __ ] and the misog war and the racism and they don't like them [ __ ] they're not showing up for them you know what I mean they they're not showing K Caitlyn Clark is nice no one's taken away from her talent but that's not the reason these white people are rallying behind her they're rallying behind her because they didn't like when Caitlyn when Angel Reese and these other black girls were getting attention and being and being celebrated and winning and beating her they hated when she lost to Angel re someone they've been [ __ ] on all that time and then that's when they decided to start propping her up so yeah she's good all of that but that's not the sole reason why they're rallying around her and that's why it's crazy to see like Shannon sharpen them y'all know what the is up like it's it's crazy when you like you can never you can't beat the machine that is white supremacist America right like they're gonna go and be behind Caitlyn Clark all the way they're gonna back her all like and and and that's unfortunate that's unfortunate for her in in in many ways too in so far as she's not a in so far as however she however much she's not aligned with that but doesn't want to alienate her own base her own family base or where she's going to make money or whatever that's her own thing to deal with but the fact that Shon sh and these black people are going out of their way to go and like not only like join in on it like when they know they can consciously see what's happening but to like help kick the back in of people like Angel Reese and and black women they could easily celebrate and help prop up just as much I think she is a part of it though because there's it's not just like she sure she's she's nice okay I'm not clearly the basketball connoisseur here but I think she plays into this whole white fragility and white I'm a weak white woman yes I think she plays that 100% because that's what I've been saying the the C the one thing I can't add is I've been seeing the clips of like her flopping on the on on the court and like little bumps that are just like she's acting like she's being attacked and people talk about her being attacked and um just a game plan too you want the call oh I know you want the call but she's being I've watching enough basketball I'm like you doing too much you're doing way too much LeBron does that if we Le talk about for that too she there's a very specific I think for women's sports in general there's a lot if that with a lot of like black women athletes for sure is like this masculinization down to people talking about them looking in transphobia down to them talking about they look like men and they're not like real women and that just happens in sports in general this masculation to have like f l clar who can be a good female athlete and lean into this I'm a weak white woman fragility is like you're hitting two you know two birds with one stone and that is the angle that I I personally she's leaning into that I don't know I've seen no she is because I'm glad you brought that up because not only does she do it on the floor where she you know is looking for the ref to bail her out right and that's not you know exclusive to her but it's also what she says in the press conferences where she says yeah I feel like I'm getting hammered you know people get away with things that other people wouldn't get away with honey what what did you think was going to happen when you walked into the WNBA you're going to get physically beaten up right and within the rules right and for you to have that mindset that oh yeah you know people are essentially have it out for me and I'm a victim when Angel Reese says look she gets choke slammed by Alyssa Thomas who gets ejected you know what her response was in the press conference look I'm glad she didn't take it easy on me they're not supposed to take it easy just because I'm a rookie they're doing it to everybody and I'm glad she did that because I got back up and I showed the fight those two resp responses really indicate how Caitlyn loves the narrative that you know she's this white fragile woman that people need to cuddle compared to Angel said I'm a dog you you can lay into to me but I'm getting back up 10 toes down you ain't stopping me like I'm here I know what I signed up for those those responses are indicative I want to go back to what Shannon said about Shakari it's indic ative of the treatment right if you are coddled your whole life you know and I'm not saying Caitlyn Clark has been I'm just using this as an example and you're not taught yo you're GNA get knocked down you got to get up life is hard if you're taught no life is amazing everything here in this country is for you and that's been reiterated in every way whether it's on the court whether it's you getting pulled over by the police whatever it is you get the benefit of the doubt and you also get a certain amount of privilege if you are Shakari or angel or any of us on this call we were reared to know you gotta get the up [ __ ] ain't Fair what's wrong with you toughen up and so there's less there's less codling there's less care and I'm not saying that I I don't believe that we should there's a delicate balance there I don't believe that black and brown people should be fed that narrative that oh [ __ ] is just going to be hard so you got to deal with it I would have loved to see Angel ree say that was completely inappropriate but guess what I finished the game here I am still standing I'm right I know how to move forward but not no angel you shouldn't expect that you shouldn't expect that from her you shouldn't expect that from the police like it's bigger than the game it's we are we seeing how like the Two Worlds Caitlyn and Angel are in two completely different realities completely different Angel was crying last year I mean not last year you think it's last year because they don't get any time in between the season but she's crying at the end of her college career because she's talking about her unfair treatment she's talking about the death threats that she receives and we have acho being one of them these black men with these platforms go on and say well you shouldn't have been the villain you chose that yeah it's two different worlds go ahead Olay I'm sorry no I think I think there is a thin line between believing you need to prepare black people for a hard life and and and coming to believe that black people deserve to have a hard life and I think some I think there are a lot of black people especially a lot of black Elders who grow up in this world of knowing that black people to work three times a hard four times a hard five times a hard and because they know that or that's what they expect you know what I mean they come to believe that that is what you are entitled to do and that is what is that is that is fair that's what it's supposed to be and they don't and they don't realize it because Shannon sharpa he does this repeatedly like to to respond on what y were saying about Ka Caitlyn Clark I have I have a video on my channel I had analyzed when when this happened right when when they were all on injuries after Caitlyn Clark did it too um and the way Caitlin Clark responded to that to let me know I knew immediately what kind like where she was right she's she's the middle of the road like she's a she's a white person who will who's a liberal without intersectionality right like she was like how she responded was basically to all the controversy to all the bar stool Daniel poroy and all these people uh David P Daniel whatever he name um being racist being racist and doing all this nonsense around um K angel doing that and what she said was she was like no you know I don't think anybody should get criticism for it you know like you know we all talk dirty or whatever whatever have you but she never acknowledges why Angel Reese is receiving you know what I mean it'll be like oh you know we all do whatever but she'll never acknowledge why this is happening and then when the controversy was Joe Biden um was like oh they should they should to invite them to to come up to the White House how she responded to that was like you know no the you know the winning team goes but I'd like to go another time it would be cool if we go another time like there's never it it it's never a firmness of this is actually wrong this is messed up this is happening for this it's always like she doesn't denounce the thing she she doesn't name the thing she knows what it is she not and smart and if you combine that in a world where people deal with a shanon sharp right because and I have another video on my channel analyzing uh Jamar and how Shannon sharp talked about jamaran it was a very like condemn him throw a book at him this is the worst like because it was some real respectable respectability politics thing he didn't like how John Mor looked to the public like what this representation is and he was coming down on him very very like incredibly hard and so there's a way that he talks about and a way that they see and they perceive you know these these these black players and I think a lot of it is like I don't think it's the conscious it's the conscious uh um I don't I don't think they see the the the internalized anti-blackness in it because I believe they believe it comes it's rooted in that same like your black Elder thinking that they're looking out for you but it's cross it they don't even know where it's it it's veered off it's it's veered veered all the way off that's my my contribution to that you hit play on this video you want to finish him screaming at him no oh you want to hear it yes done I asked you earlier I want you to tell me the WNBA player that's been more popular than Caitlyn Clark just give me one that have been able to average 177,000 even though they're on a crappy team give if they try to go to game Andrea do me a favor finish that initial thought that you were saying about sacrificing your integrity because that was an important point for marketing yep I it's just not something I'm willing to do and right now it doesn't seem like something Team USA is willing to do it it just doesn't and whether you think that's a smart decision or whether you think that's not a smart decision I also just want you all to think about this everything you all are saying is from speculation of how Caitlyn will play on the floor if if we were just speculating and you just want her with the team you just want her walking around with the team on the sideline I I tell you what I guarantee you if I come out with a replica Olympic jersey with Caitlyn Clark she'll out sell the top five combined I hear you and that's fine Shannon but my point is is what have we talked about with Caitlyn in the W so far what's been one of the biggest topics of conversation I like that he's not actually you think you know what's really sad about it is like they're not even making the case that she's the best they're not making the case this is like some exceptional circumstance that's the worst part so it's like they are going this hard for a white woman in the league when there are black women that they know are are better than her more talented than her more senior than her and they're like we could give a less and if creat this new argument that they wouldn't receive in any other capacity because when since like should should she be the mascot for their Olympics team to make sure like she should she wave should she walk direct people to their seats like to ensure maximum this is time that Asia Wilson like made history with her stat line it was like 35 points like 10 like six assists like five Steals and like three blocks of some crazy [ __ ] yeah it was like 35 and 14 or something yeah it it was ridiculous against Dallas nobody's talking about it because they unfair they weren't talking like this no they talked about it for one minute they were they're what AJ Wilson did was put in a quick take segment vac where they do takes for one minute and then they move on to something else so yeah they they could easily grow the game help grow the game if they wanted to by shining a spotlight on players like Asia Wilson or Kalia copper making her first you know Olympic team Kelsey Plum but they choose not to and again they have no basketball argument for Caitlin Clark being on Team USA and Stephen A said it we didn't hear it there but he was like yeah it's not that you're wrong but we don't care no they're strategist now they're they're marketing strategist you expect like again I expect like the people that you expect to be behind the Caitlyn clar to be doing this kind of thing like you expect them to move the gold post but to see black men moving the gold post even from like I said I think you know I think what is interesting to me just a generic this the sexist arguments you would see pop up about women's basketball all throughout my life but on my timeline and stuff throughout the years you'll see all these men act like oh if the women were better looking if the women were this if the women did that they have a league full of bad [ __ ] like a league full of bad [ __ ] playing their ass off dressing their ass every time I see I follow a bunch of players in the in in the league for no other reason than if it's be going crazy when they show my going into I don't know them I don't know what team they on I don't watch nothing to fits those nuts you know what I mean and even who are who are playing their ass off who are who are who have better stats and they could give a less like the stats moved away from even the sexism on they didn't get no points for good-looking they didn't get no points for being better they didn't get no points for winning they get you see all these black men who you would expect to be in the space who would expect to like offer them some kind of protection right like you would think that would be like a place if you're a black player you would expect to get some more Grace by the black Outlets the black commentators the people you think of his Uncle Shannon and whatever and to have them like move the goal post in this like nonsens cuz I'm not even like I don't even really like I said I don't I'm not even like really tapped in I don't I barely know who like any of these people are for real for real but this does like it does just kind of seem like a lot of like misplaced energy just kind of hearing the like what uh the the complexities of the situation it just kind of feel like they're like I I don't even understand the angle for real you know what I mean well they they want affirmative action in Dei for kayin Clark and it's not just them like all these people who are complaining about oh no you should you know you should have her on the team you know because the game is going to grow so much you know exponentially with her being there even though even if she doesn't play okay so di works for her but not for people who look like exactly how affirmative action worked in real life white wom were beneficiaries of affirmative action in real life hello and also without any real consideration as to if we grow the game in this way right if we sub come and submit to the fact that white eyes are the most important thing when it comes to the WNBA what does that mean for the game how does that impact the actual game y'all like the long-term ramifications of following that type of strategy that's what I was saying earlier like it's the sickness of realizing that they are totally comfortable with the idea that the worth of of swash of black people get totally disregarded if you play the game according to the way they think it's okay cuz it's very clear that in their mind they're saying it aloud in it they what they they're saying the quiet part of loud they're basically saying listen white people like her that's the white character that white people like and so she should be given all of the special treatment because that's what is going to bring the money and you know what's the funny you know what's funny about capitalism brain capitalism brain doesn't even make you analyze like who gets the money in the end right because it's like who's the winner they're saying like oh white people like her and so white people will back her and so she should get all the opportunities because that's what's going to bring in little more money but it's like for whom you know what I mean but they don't do that yeah when it's for about the men yes I have listened to Shannon argued down about certain NFL players and how they are on pedestals because they are white especially quarterbacks especially running backs he is he is very passionate about that and how black NFL male athletes have to work twice as hard he gets it then when it's about a man M he does not get it Mass the when it is about these women yeah they see white women they see white women as golden tickets privilege that's it's massir and them looking at white women like oh my gosh we finally got our like light white s princess milk magnesia and and that's big te and and that's fact son because even if you look at you know Maya has Maya's world has a great video on it but like Shon sharp when Shon sharp one time like goes to go talk about his his daughter his his his he's like oh you know my daughter got uh long hair and that's all real hair like the fact that he felt the need he couldn't even unveil his dark skinned daughter without being like but you see let let me show you the way that sets her apart from from from your your understandings and thought processes about this other this genre of of of black woman so that's what they that's what they believe in right it's like they he can understand it's like even with his commitment to to the status quo or the system as it is right which is functionally white supremacy but even with his commitment to that at Le like as a black man who has played the sport he at least has a lot more sympathy for an experience that he has lived for a black man who he can more see himself in but when it comes to these black women and I believe and and you know that like we know those you see those blind spots in the community like you know you you know those blind spots how how they exist right with these like especially like old older black men who don't believe that they like dis hat black women or dislike black women or they think of themselves as being still like fatherly or protecting but the thought processes that they have about women and have about black women show up in this way tricky I I I'm curious to know since we are we talked about Asia Wilson right making history are we a part of the problem because now we give all of this attention to how frustrated we are by I always question this by what Shannon sharp and AO and Stephen A and all the these Jokers are doing are we are are we then incentivizing them to do it because now it's like well either way they're getting their views they're being talked about they're becoming more popular it doesn't matter if we like them or not right so I I often go back and forth of like what should I be giving my time to versus when maybe I should just be talking about Asia Wilson Britney grinder the fact she came back and she hooping like yeah I don't know I don't yeah right got a baby on way I don't know because you want to you know speak up and defend the black women her being disrespected in the league and in this case Andrea cter CH gum um and Monica mcnut mcnut in another clip um yeah but on the other hand you don't want to give this nonsense so much oxygen right so I think if you just at this point I'm at the stage where I'm sit start ignoring whatever they have to say about the W and use my platforms to talk about the amazing stories that are going on in the W but I don't think it hurts to call out you know white supremacy or people you know doing things to uphold white supremacy but I do think if you spend too much time on it then yes that's what it is that going to incen that's what it is there like there's like a medium you yeah I I guess you know you know to the malx quote about right you know the least protected woman in in the least protected person is a black woman right in American society I guess the thing that I I I agree with that right like I'm always worried about what we talk about and what we engage like people they don't care if you're mad about it they care about whether or not it created the engagement and the clicks and the views or whatever what have you but that being said mogy war and mistreatment of black women is so much bigger and not algorithm motivated I think like that existed this treatment this like misog like what black women experience in these fields and the like would happen if the internet disappeared if the algorithm wasn't there if engagement wasn't there like that has always been the thing and that um and I think a like I think the the I think the reason why I think we have to there has to be way much more way more calling it out before we get to a place where we think that us calling it out is going to Fan it because in in this case right this isn't even like a system Where We Are united front is black people fighting against white supremacy's treatment of black women we are fighting in-house we haven't even made it over to the side of people that really back like are in this world doing this or are are celebrating um or idolizing a Caitlyn Clark at the expense of these black women we're just talking about inhouse how our own people are are talking about it and treating and how uh black men are commenting on that and I think if we don't say something it it continues to happen because what often happens is black women are not received as people who need to be protected like we're always always we're always seeing as like oh she got it she good she could speak up for herself like Angel Reese looks tough you know what I mean her response to when this happens is okay you know I expect this what have and that becomes a really I think a lonely a lonely painful experience for for black women and it's what leads black so so what you said earlier an that like Angel re shouldn't have to say like oh this is totally fine I expect I expect this whatever this is the game she should be able to say that's unacceptable but I rolled with it but she can't she can't in a in in in a in a world in a climate where black no one no one comes out to support you when you admit like when you say oh I did need I did need help or that wasn't that wasn't right or I was treated unfairly or I need that so I feel like we have to we have to lend voice to that especially as black women right because like who G who GNA defend us and speak up for like that particular experience and call out that that mogy war with that Nuance if we don't right I think if you embedded the way that you did it within the conversation it works really well like I didn't know Asia Wilson right that's like I didn't I didn't know that until you said it but it was because in this conversation it got weaved in as we're talking about like black not being protected and ped having this white woman on a pedestal but this is the people that we should be discussing so I feel like as long I see what you mean that a lot of people if we're talking about marketability like Shannon they hop to the the [ __ ] that's the most popular or what's getting trendy you know what's going to get the clicks I feel like there is a way to talk about that stuff and be like you're going to click on it because I am addressing it but I'm also going to bring in something that I find that is important so I think we're doing a good job I'm learning like I said this whole time been like I've been Googling this whole time like literally like I'm like let's haar it all okay I'm I'm let us finish this clip and then I'll let us give our final thoughts and then I will free y'all my beautiful black people all right the grow of game fee feea rules are way more physical than the W way more physical than the W so you want to see Caitlyn with zero chemistry with anyone on the team zero connection to the coach at all you want to see her potentially get a few minutes here and there potentially have a hard time with the physicality and potentially not be able to connect to her teammates not to her a fault of her own but because she simply hasn't had time with them you would rather see that than wait four more years for for Caitlin to have experience for her Jersey to sell out and for her to have an impact role in the team you would rather want immedate OIC Deb potentially in Los Angeles look as someone who has played for USA basketball and understood the nature in which these cuts are made what Andrea is speaking to is correct familiarity is a big thing my sister did not make the roster despite being MVP I believe in the qualifying tournament right before the Olympics happened that's how difficult it is to make the roster one yes there is an obligation that we believe especially given the the moment that we're in right now with women's basketball that we all want to see the Game grow but when it comes to the Olympics that the Olympics already are marketed itself the Olympics are the Pinnacle of international competition everyone's number one goal there is to win and while you think that because of where we are in women's basketball that is what the same thing that should be determined at the Olympics that's not necessarily the case when it comes to the committee selecting their decisions so overall I think yes Kaitlyn it would have been great to see her there even if it was in a marginal position I think the USA committee calculated that let's give her time to grow with this next Generation before he we roll her out there because we know that the stakes are going to be higher than any other player in the history I think it's funny like just to like you're not obligated by having been on in in the league you're not obligated to be on the Olympic team but the way it's spoken about is though she is like there's a spot with her name on it and someone wronged her by like it's like it's like she it's like she someone's not giving her access to her trust at the time she wanted it you know what I mean that's they're talking about it like oh as though it's it's a foregone conclusion that this will be hers and like the discussion is just about whether or not she should be given it's like and I hate the fact that because the way that it's been the way the men are framing it and the way they're so like ravenous on the topic that she has to even make the case to them why it happened she feels like she feels obligated to concede that like of course she deserves a spot at some point she's gonna get a spot because if she even if she even dare remind them that Caitlyn is not like entitled to a Goddamn spot to the Olympic team they would lose their minds over there it's also a team so to be very clear there what are there 12 spots total yeah 12 yeah it's a team I saw people saying well they could have left Britney grinder of that's a center Caitlyn is a guard what are we even talking about like y'all don't even only have one true Center yeah right it's like what are y'all talking about and she's not better than any of the guards on this team so it's just like all right y'all got it go ahead cook y'all got it got no final thoughts go ahead ol look yeah uh I'm just I want at this point I don't even expect Shannon Stephen A and AO guys like that to to be better um but I'm going to invest my energy in people you know who do talk about the game and the outside conversations in a responsible and insightful way because race will always be a factor right in this case you know sexism ass Noir is going to be a factor until people unravel and unpack all the internalized hate they have for black women um and and that's just that because I can't it gets so exhausting talking about uh Caitlyn specifically because she's such a lightning rod for culture wars and people who are disingenuous about growing the game Britney Griner was detained in Russia for several months and now she's going back to the Olympics that is an incredible story talk about literally bring that up that's talk about that doesn't get like cons in the relevant like when they talk about the discussion on who made like the WNBA relevant in in public discourse and like irrelevant seemingly I guess they were all talking about it nonstop like the president had to comment on it and [ __ ] but like I guess I guess that's irrel man before before this that's what really put W made on the like radar I think on like on a International yes standpoint especially in terms of pay like especially in terms of pay that's a good art yes Chris that's the reason why and it also goes to show you that yo in international countries they are respected so much more right that's why wnb players use the offseason to play in China to play in Russia in Turkey because they get treated like Legends and Pa as they should be and paid paid exactly so yeah so who we okay Chris so who should we before we get out there tell us who we should listen to then who are who are good people we could listen and do for sports that aren't being this well the uh Paul George podcast uh I forgot yeah I think yeah I forgot the name of it but he has a podcast where he brings on different WNBA athletes and he actually listens and respects them as individuals and hears them out uh so that's a good one then you have the three on three podcast which I'm a part of with uh my co-host tarica Foster brasby and Terina Cole that's really good the Knuckleheads podcast uh with um Quinn Richardson and darus miles they also have a bunch of WNBA current and former players on and they actually watch the games and talk about things that are not related to you know the latest controversy um I'm trying to think else who else on the top of my head Taylor Taylor Rooks is good although I think she's going to be doing more because the way she's platformed um she hasn't her voice hasn't been used for the women's game as much joy Taylor too podcast with joy Taylor is really good M when when you time to learn an how do you have a side side my parents met on the court so basketball is basketball healthy loveing basketball that's so cute amazing that's how they fell in love oh that's you said healthy Love and Basketball but that's not what I thought I thought just right I love just wright an like immediately an I became common and queen latifa's baby and I something I don't support common so I go with the love I don't know why I just can't I'm like something ain't right something ain't right trust it's chronic why the whole chronic monogamy The Chronic relationship something that I don't trust I seen him move and I'm like no that is hilarious maybe you just got to listen to b again put B on after I might have to go back I was just going to say I I think my final thought and something that I wrote down while we were talking was like growth is great but at what cost and so I want to see the WNBA grow but I'm also like I want to see it grow in a healthy way in a way that is representative of That League and not where it's too costly right because it could get tricky real quick and as content creators as folks trying to do this out or excuse me it make this our means right many of us it's real easy to Teeter on them lines where you about to do some [ __ ] that's not representative of Who You Are You Gonna Get You Get or the leag because the gag is right is like everybody going off to have all this smoke for like black women like in particular like all this mogy war and I'm like it's a black woman's League like you know what I mean like this is it's it's crazy because you're you literally want to prop up one at the expense of many the majority great to the court uh with Jordan Robinson and the legendary Cheryl swoops four time WNBA Champion that's a really good podcast as well the 9450 podcast Kevin Lewis l bike that's also really good um Andrea car anything Andrea Carter's on t gum uh player CV as well um there's a bunch Lina Robinson uh I don't know if they still have it but around the rim was really good it's a podcast so those are just a few and my final thought would be look for the people who are just hopping on the train of women's basketball shut up and L right and then for the networks that have these openings to give people the platform make sure the individuals who have been in the trenches from day one are the ones getting these sh these opportunities to shine and opportunities to get paid the way they should because a lot of people out here are not getting paid who do the grind day in and day out so you have to see steveen a Shannon sharp and all these people getting paid millions of dollars and they don't give it they have never cared about the league until as Janette put it the Great White Hope arrived the great now I gotta name this episode The Great White Hope that's pretty good though gooded I didn't even know this a Great White Hope okay [Music]
