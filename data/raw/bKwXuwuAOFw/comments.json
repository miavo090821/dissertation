        "text": "Totally agree with this. In England in a big city a few years back, the fash were in town. They had around 2-500 people and on the anti-fash side, we were about 100, maybe up to 200 being generous. We were separated by the police and I remember thinking that we would've been absolutely fckin battered by those fascist thugs. The left needs to toughen up. This isn't about being some roid-head macho man but you know what I mean. I love this guy's videos because people will listen to him. Too many people associate liberals with \"the left\" and that's where this stems from I think. The doctrine of revolution is ultimately one of violence and we have to be capable, but there are too many people cosplaying whilst at university - we need to be ready to fight because the other side are, whether that be the state or their fascist foot soldiers who I mentioned before.",
