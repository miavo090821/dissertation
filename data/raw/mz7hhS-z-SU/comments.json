This \"toxic masculinity\" stuff has gone too far and has demoralized, demonized and emasculated a lot of men. It makes me sick when I hear a lot of young women ( and their male \"feminist\" cohorts) saying \"men suck\", \"we don't need men\" and \"all men are toxic\". Some people think that the world would be better without men. I disagree.",

I'm not about to get on here and explain the places that they volunteer and the things that they do in their spare time that also contributes to society. But yes, having a job and paying taxes and being responsible is contributing to society. One of my electrician son's favorite thing to do is to find people broken down on the freeway and help them. He helps fix his neighbor's cars and his friends cars. He's very good with his hands. Pointing out that you don't think that just being a good person is not contributing to society says a lot more about you than it does about my boys. It actually is contributingto society to just be a good hard working person. Much more so than being a crappy human being living off of the government and being lazy",

Yes certain people say that, but that’s not what it actually is about. It’s about allowing men to have feelings which we want. We also want men to stop on loving themselves, but because of the standards of toxic masculinity upholds, a lot of men feel I have no way out except unlogged themselves, which is sad so yes, we need to fight toxic masculinity so we can save men’s lives.

Another relevant psychological effect here is the illusory truth effect (look that up too if you don't know what it is).  These, together, are the reason why racism still exists (and has actually gotten worse since the year 2000). Democrats control academia.  THEY KNOW THIS IS an INEVITABLE effect of their propaganda and have been using it to perpetuate this exact thinking for over two decades.  WHITE DEMOCRATS who control their party ARE ACTUALLY the ones who are RACIST.  Sure... there are definitely racist Republicans nowadays (in part due to the illusory truth effect), but it is Democrat policies that make it harder for non-whites to be class mobile (addicting people to perpetual welfare to the point they SEEK children to get it, KNOWING that non-whites will be more affected from statistics.)",

DEMs like to expand Big Govt because they can get very rich off of the crumbs that are stolen by Non-Profits (directed to the NGOs by crooked DEMs) they get free funds from the Big Govt money spigot, and keep most of it ('admin expenses') becoming multi-millionaires courtesy of taxpayers while they do jack shit, nothing worth the taxpayers dollars.  Republicans shrink Govt because fiscal entitlements are killing our country's ability to build for power and international influence, needed to sustain our position.  The fact that the USA consumes 34% of Global Production, seems to indicate we have a successful & wealthy nation... able to spend one out of every three dollars spent on global product each year, that's 300million people taking 34% of annual product while the rest of the world... 8billion people, divide up consumption of the remainder of world production.  AOC was garbage in college, she never took an economics or finance course in her life.  Basically she wasted her time and learned nothing of value, she's a simpleton demagogue that's getting rich as she pretends to advocate for the poor (and represents the poorest district in NYC).  But its a gimmick, she will say anything to stay in politics where she can take payola and get rich quick, if you can't recognize a faker pretending to be a pseudo communist (like the other idiot from NY, Bernie Sanders) you're not looking in the right  place, her personal bank account.  Politics is dirty b/c its all about who controls the money spigot.  A whole lot of people are as dumb as she is, so she gets to play the role and incite the dumbest people in the nation.  But since Republicans shrink Govt rather than expand it, it points to more honesty instead of thirst for big pork bills like DEMs always put forth, and genuine focus on finance rather than theft.",

This bigot is probably incapable of fairly administering a class.

Lots of people with troubled histories just cannot seem to treat these classrooms as professional space. Therapy terms like \"safe space\" constantly creep in. Maybe the similarity between group therapy and these group discussion sessions indicates that the discussion sessions are inappropriate, circumventing the rational mind. Some universities anonymize tests (including written essay tests) so that bigoted teachers have more difficulty discriminating (consciously or subconsciously).",

So before it was actually working it hit it's peak around 2015ish but now 20years of it and you have kids of the new generation that have grown up with people being racist towards them for the color of their skin and poorest of the poor being told they have white privilege and it being socially acceptable and promoted by MSM. Their words are all lies and mean nothing. Now we can finally say we are proud to be white and what are they going to do ? call us racist like they have for the last 20 years. That game is over. We never cared about skin color until they kept calling us racist for just existing and openly saying they the white man is the problem on national TV and we have to end whiteness. That's real racism.",
