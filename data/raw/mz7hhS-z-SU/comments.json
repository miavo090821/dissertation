I think the notion of picking your battles with your wife and just agreeing to prevent the argument has led to women actually thinking they are smarter than men. That's not to say they are dumber, either gender has their areas of strength. Economics and finance is not a female strength but they KNOW socialism would be better than capitalism, but it's based on emotion rather than data. Data and history would show you all you need to know about that debate",

He was a full-blown adult by the time Nelson Mandela was released from prison and Apartheid was abolished. \n\nStay on topic. We’re barely three generations removed from the end of Jim Crow segregation. The prejudice “white” people, specifically “white, straight” men, are experiencing now from left leaning folks is NOTHING NEW. It’s just a rebranding. “White is right” turned into “white is evil” (when it’s convenient anyway). That’s my point. If anything, it’s tame compared to what was happening in the 20th century and earlier. That said, it can easily get much worse. Fortunately, this country is still wealthy enough that a Adolf Hitler esque radical probably wouldn’t amass enough public support to gain enough power to effect sweeping changes. But crazier things have happened. There was already an assassination attempt on President Trump BEFORE he was elected. The hit on Charlie Kirk was successful. Political unrest leading to violence has always been the precursor to something much worse.",

I just don't think that Jews are helping us in any way. They are in fact undermining our societies for their own financial benefit. They are extremely pro migration to the west, but not for Israel.

He helps fix his neighbor's cars and his friends cars. He's very good with his hands. Pointing out that you don't think that just being a good person is not contributing to society says a lot more about you than it does about my boys.

Whenever I bring up that KGB were in the country back then, people only associate it with espionage and stealing intel. What they don't think about is how intelligence agencies operate. They embed themselves into the communities, disguised as your average citizen. Some have missions for espionage, some have missions to influence the public. Just look at how the CIA operates and how many regimes they have toppled or coups they caused just to put someone in power that is more open to American interests. Don't think Russians wouldn't do the same or have already done the same. Socialism in the US post WWII is not an organic idea from citizens, it was a seed planted in our population by external actors in order to spread communism during that time. If they could get the US to embrace it, global communism had the best chance to succeed since the US was the poster child of western society",

DEMs like to expand Big Govt because they can get very rich off of the crumbs that are stolen by Non-Profits (directed to the NGOs by crooked DEMs) they get free funds from the Big Govt money spigot, and keep most of it ('admin expenses') becoming multi-millionaires courtesy of taxpayers while they do jack shit, nothing worth the taxpayers dollars.  Republicans shrink Govt because fiscal entitlements are killing our country's ability to build for power and international influence, needed to sustain our position.  The fact that the USA consumes 34% of Global Production, seems to indicate we have a successful & wealthy nation... able to spend one out of every three dollars spent on global product each year, that's 300million people taking 34% of annual product while the rest of the world... 8billion people, divide up consumption of the remainder of world production.  AOC was garbage in college, she never took an economics or finance course in her life.  Basically she wasted her time and learned nothing of value, she's a simpleton demagogue that's getting rich as she pretends to advocate for the poor (and represents the poorest district in NYC).  But its a gimmick, she will say anything to stay in politics where she can take payola and get rich quick, if you can't recognize a faker pretending to be a pseudo communist (like the other idiot from NY, Bernie Sanders) you're not looking in the right  place, her personal bank account.  Politics is dirty b/c its all about who controls the money spigot.  A whole lot of people are as dumb as she is, so she gets to play the role and incite the dumbest people in the nation.  But since Republicans shrink Govt rather than expand it, it points to more honesty instead of thirst for big pork bills like DEMs always put forth, and genuine focus on finance rather than theft.",

Another relevant psychological effect here is the illusory truth effect (look that up too if you don't know what it is).  These, together, are the reason why racism still exists (and has actually gotten worse since the year 2000). Democrats control academia.  THEY KNOW THIS IS an INEVITABLE effect of their propaganda and have been using it to perpetuate this exact thinking for over two decades.  WHITE DEMOCRATS who control their party ARE ACTUALLY the ones who are RACIST.  Sure... there are definitely racist Republicans nowadays (in part due to the illusory truth effect), but it is Democrat policies that make it harder for non-whites to be class mobile (addicting people to perpetual welfare to the point they SEEK children to get it, KNOWING that non-whites will be more affected from statistics.)",

        "text": "​@barbaraibiel I'm not sure that the YouTube comments section is the place for me to respond to your assertion here, but I am going to make an attempt.\n\n\"The Right\" isn't attacking abortion access (it is not a right, and yes, I am going to play semantics here), _some_ of the groups on the right are attacking abortion access. We are talking here about the Christian right, which is NOT representative of \"The Right\" (despite what loud Christians might have anyone believing.)\n\nAbortions are not a right, and to frame it that way attaches the issue to unhinged women who use it as a method of birth control. Now, that is not to say that barriers to access should have some sort of moral judgement from some other person before the procedure is performed. It is an emergency procedure, and sometimes an elective emergency procedure. Be that because of r@pe, finances, health issues, etc., it is inherently an emergency due to the ticking clock on a baby growing.\n\nPersonally, I want planned parenthood completely prevented from performing that procedure. I want that to land solidly and ONLY in hospitals with proper oversight and ethics boards with legal requirements to offer counseling before and after said procedure. I want paternal rights more strongly considered by the medical staff, not as a deciding factor but as an actual co-participant, considering the woman didn't get pregnant by herself.\n\nI realize that what I've stated as my opinion can be perceived as subjecting women to male control, but that is more due to the limitations of a comments section and being concise rather than laying out the nuances of how exactly I would see that playing out.\n\nUltimately, if women do not want to have children then prevention is the most ethical and healthy choice. Again, abortion is an emergency not a method. Chemical (including copper) birth control methods are not the only option, they are merely the only method talked about or offered but the white lab coats in the medical establishment.\n\nTo reiterate my response to your comment, \"The Right\" is not trying to block access to abortions, the _Christian_ right is. They are not one in the same and I would argue that you and I, and many others, are proof of that.",

However, looking back as a grown-ass man, I regret doing that and wished that I had stood up for myself and my beliefs.  I wish I would've confronted these persons on their BS (in a assertive way, of course. )  So at some point, you have to stand up for yourself and call a spade a spade ♠️  and call them out on their BS.

I would grant some grace to this person if your son was interrupting emotionally or otherwise disruptive, but I would consider that quote a not-at-all subtle slipping of the mask. This bigot is probably incapable of fairly administering a class. I don't trust her to tell the truth about how each student performs.\n\nThese little classes with group discussion can feel a lot like group therapy sessions. Lots of people with troubled histories just cannot seem to treat these classrooms as professional space. Therapy terms like \"safe space\" constantly creep in. Maybe the similarity between group therapy and these group discussion sessions indicates that the discussion sessions are inappropriate, circumventing the rational mind. Some universities anonymize tests (including written essay tests) so that bigoted teachers have more difficulty discriminating (consciously or subconsciously).",
