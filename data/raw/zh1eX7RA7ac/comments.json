    "text": "This is what it actually boils down to. How bad do you want, what you want? This is an important question that gets ignored quite often. The only reason people bitch and moan about inequality is because they aren't getting a piece of the pie. The reason they aren't getting a piece of the pie is because they aren't willing to take the same risks successful people take to make their way up the mountain. \n\nWhining about how unfair life is seems to me to be a waste of time and money. Greed and selfishness are the same thing and most Americans are spoiled beyond reason. \n\nMilton Friedman was a genius, as well as Thomas Sowell. Being a businessman isn't easy. If anybody wants to be in business, the first thing you have to understand is this; \"There's no such thing as fair play.\" That's the shit they print on the label to sell the package. \n\nAlso, learn to lie well. No really, learn to be deceptive and of course don't over do it but if you're gonna be in business, you have to learn to lie in order to spot the people that will be lying to you everyday. My customers lie to me everyday. I have my moments as well. Businessman have to do this to keep the wheels greased. It's just that way. \n\nHow much is too much? That's another question I ponder. I am just as greedy as I am generous. I give and I take. But most importantly, I fucking work hard everyday. I earned everything I have. Capitalism made everything possible for you and me and everybody else, well, if they truly want it and are willing to work for it. Sure, there will be a percentage of humans that just aren't going to go anywhere, but why feather them? We need to go back to natural selection and obey the laws. The weak perish and the strong thrive with lots and lots of toys. I don't need a lot to be happy but most humans, if they're healthy and have any kind of work ethic, can have more than they have now. \n\nI inadvertently became a liberal when I was younger because I hung out with musician's and artist's of all kinds and it was fun but I gave all my shit away constantly ...lol... living a liberal lifestyle made me too nice. It was too expensive living that way. I'm re-embracing capitalism because I now realize that without it, everything good, stops. You'll see, you won't be half as cocky as you are now. ...lol... Capitalism is here to stay. Without it, all there would be is a bunch of drum circles with large gatherings of people doing absolutely nothing constructive. \n\nWe were better off when times were hard. Our technology has made us all neurotic, impatient, pushy, and most of all, selfish and lazy. We don't care about the right things anymore. This Utopia you people keep bragging about doesn't exist. Capitalism doesn't fuck anybody. Stupidity, arrogance and ignorance are the three culprits. But what do I know, I'm just repeating what I hear on YouTube. ...lol...",

        "text": "“There is no such thing as fair play”. And Marx would probably agree. That’s why he recommended the working class seize state power for themselves and flip history (history being minority rule over the majority; owners over Labour). Marx, Engels, Lenin and so forth were all part of the revolutionary tradition Marxism itself also springs from. Life isn’t fair but we can work together to make it better.\n\nP5: this paragraph essentially boils down to the now debunked lie of “hard work results in success”. Hard work results in failure. In the real world hard work can lead to a dead-end career. You know what has been proven to result in success? Luck. And getting a leg up using your wealthy parents (other peoples) money; Musk, Bezos and Trump are perfect examples of this phenomenon. \n\nP6: I worry here, you might be making the common American mistake that socialists/Marxists/communists = liberals. If you believe this then, boy, do I have news for you. Hate to spoil it for you but...liberals are capitalists, my friend. Capitalism is part of the ever-evolving stages of economy that has been going on for ages and not a natural thing in any way. And it will go away just like every other economic form throughout history. Replaced by something else. History doesn’t end because you wish it to no matter how much you try. Capitalism is NOT natural, it’s totally artificial (oops, spoiler warning). Without capitalism there would be “a bunch of drum circles”? Absolutely, mindless chauvinist non-sense. What dream filled utopian nightmare did you get this idea from?\n\nP7: no. No we aren’t better off when times were hard. It was worse by definition. Demonstrably worse. It’s in fact capitalism that created the material conditions that makes people “neurotic, impatient, pushy and most of all selfish and lazy”, blaming it all on whatever biases you hold against modern technology is wrongly narrow sighted. What are these “right things” people should care for who are struggling to survive capitalist debt slavery, and modern colonialism, hmm? No one is bragging about utopia on a scientific and dialectical Marxist channel, please put this ignorant idea to bed it risks making the rest of us dumber. Capitalism fucks over the vast majority of the planet, including the planet itself, and by that extension everybody. “Stupidity, arrogance and ignorance are the culprits” how very liberal of you. Ideas aren’t as much the problem as the existing material conditions created by the imperialism of capitalism and its conditions. You shouldn’t believe every thing you hear on YouTube nor should you blindly repeat it in the comment section, but I think this was mostly just a joke...lol\n\n*The rest is undignifiable ideological garbage. Milton Friedman was a greedy POS neoliberal asshole that destroyed a whole generation, just like Hayek and the rest of their lot.",

Physical labor doesn’t exist with people. \nMarx was a lazy dickhead that promoted manipulation and perfected it as he made his way up other peoples ladders. \nThere’s so many excuses. If you want something bad enough you can attain it. You just have to work for it. \nThis bullshit about hard work killing, well I guess it would kill weak minded people but with most of my successful friends they made it by working for it. \nThe left have a bad habit of demanding the things they want. \nOn top of that you people want everything for free. \nNatural Selection Homer. \nIt’s the only way. Everything else is pointless and this continued trend into a government subsidized existence will surely sink this ship we call America. \nAlso, I wanted to explain why Milton Friedman smiled a lot. His always had that shit eating grin. \nHe’s actually smiling because it is kinda funny the way weak minded humans try to function. \nAll they do is blame others for their bad days. \nThis is why government doesn’t work well when it has to compete with private enterprises. \nThe part that freaks my shit is the fact the left think this is going to end well. \nHumans are going to continue to lie cheat and steal to get what they want. Of course it will be somebody else’s fault if the assumed utopia doesn’t wash. \n🙄",

This is why inequality is going to continue to grow throughout the 21st century. The lower class is going to continuously grow while the concentration of wealth is owned by a shrinking population. In the future, most of the upper class won't even 'work' for their money, it'll simply be inherited.
