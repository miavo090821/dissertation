I don't think there's a question uh vice president kamla Harris will be the Democratic nominee on the ticket in November five are the only group that identify themselves as marginalized people but vote majority in Republican right along with white men in general and I get it I want to get over the stress of politics and this and that I'm like well that's also how we end up here again in another four years generally you're you're dealing with a very unpopular Administration that needs a lot of rehab in order to get people invested enough so here's what they're going to start throwing at you here's are you about to get ready we don't have much [Music] [Applause] time hello beautiful black people I am going to tell you why I could be you here but we all know because I really think there is nothing else to discuss right now other than kamla potentially um being the nominee the fact that it's still potential I think is ridiculous but anyway Kamala um running for president and a potential Kamala Administration and whether we think kamla can win will win or if that's even a worthwhile discussion I don't I put up my thoughts like I put up a short YouTube video um saying what I think I think she has an incredible uphill battle um because of a million different prejudices and silly reasons America as then there are some practical reasons when it comes to like the fact that she's a former prosecutor this is next thing dependent on how you politically feel about that um I think I hope she wins like I would like to be wrong I think there are a lot of things working against her and I think the America that I know I am not confident I am not like I see people I'm like people want to be optimistic and I think that's nice but I think there's a a thin line between optimism and delusion and I see people trying to talk about it like it's a oh of course like like you're being ridiculous to even think these things will happen or these kind of criticisms will be made I'm like they're making the criticisms already they're already doing it this say the forcing ourselves closer to Fascism like the past two three election Cycles I do not know we're but yeah he could never win wins no he could he could last two terms I'm not trying to be surprised again I remember when Hillary won I was I mean Hillary lost see look at me trying to rewrite history and I think that's because a by the way that's what a lot of people in my comments be doing they on this video I put they keep being like but edit Hillary did win she won the popular vote oh my God like that could you come here to reality with me did I miss her term like let's actually like you could it might be nice if it worked that way but it doesn't so you understand what I'm saying right and also why are we acting like this white woman with all the connections in the world and who' been primed for that spot and her chances are the same as what Kamas are why are we acting like we also didn't K's never run for president before so we don't have any sense of how the public feels about her or how the black community feels about her or what you know what I mean I think there are still some a lot of other different circumstances I think it's exent you know what I mean like the Trump thing but I think people are underestimating the overwhelming amount of people that would need to turn out to beat what will be Republican voter turnout for Donald Trump and I think people are underestimating just how Prejudice America is and it's really given me the amount of white women who have been in my comments saying things like I think you're being too pessimistic and oh she's pretty or oh she's this and all these shallow things they think will work for her they were like oh the new generation the youth will love that she's a woman that's inspirational I was like what I'm a black woman in in America so I just don't know where the yall live I'm like really seeing what they're saying and I'm like wow that's how you think it they give it up for Black Folk like black wom it's crazy are we watching the same yeah yeah as a like you said as a black woman watching everything unfold so here's a couple of things just for me right and I say this is my opinion and mine alone um I know that initially if this was not today in the circumstances that we are in right now how tight it is how rocky things are um how we have just but nothing right in between us and having Donald Trump as possible president so whatever we can get that's where we are right now but if this was not the situation and we actually we actually had options in time you you know it wouldn't be Kamala for me but right this is it there's no other conversations to have except for I feel like uniting but still being clear that hey this is going to be hard y'all sitting here acting like oh this is just so easy and you know she's she wrapped that pink and green so it's going to be easy um she's she she's black so it's going to be easy she's Asian so it's going to be easy you know but here in America they don't like people with vaginas right and especially if they say that they're black a woman America hates them a black one or somebody who is identifies we don't know because I don't know I never heard her said she was black she probably did or Asian whatever she's a minority right and they don't like them product of migrants don't like it's going to they're going to spew out so much nastiness and so much hate and I reposted something that Scotty uh had tweeted out basically saying y'all no matter what party you stand for what it's going to be very we got to it's going to be hard especially for women the people that are going to have these think pieces with microphones is gonna get on not only is it gonna be F it's GNA be people on their podcast talking about the value of a woman and it may be really daunting they may be trying to really find things to say how women can't lead how they're not good to all these conversations are going to come into play and they're gonna and people are like don't think about those things like girl it's going to be everywhere when Donald Trump was um running in 2016 it was so much hate right just from his Campa his campaigning so much hate and then under his presidency so much racism the uptick of violence the uptick of people using using the nword hard eer online to people's faces um mass murders directed towards black folks it was so much of this and people are like but it's not it's it's just not no it it affects us mentally it does so it is something that we can talk about but there is a job to be done right now I can say that too there's a job to be done right now um but we can't act like it's going to be easy acting like I think what's interesting is that either no matter which way we look at it this kamla election coronation whatever we want to call it it will at least be a referendum on our side right because what I constantly think about is that for the past four years it's been drilled in my head by everybody Gen X and above that but Trump but Trump anybody but Trump we need to we need to to uh vote call from up in because but Trump for me the way I'm looking at it then when we switch to comma the argument should be the same right like we it it it will be a time when at least I get to see I guess me as a younger Democratic voter like how how fake how fake really is the party because I I have heard people said that like oh if they the only conversation that's useful here to me is the one about vice president because that's at least something that maybe can still have we can have an effect on or we can pontificate on but oh we do Peete Buddha judge as the VP oh then she's not electable at all what happened to the but Trump like the the AR the argument never never centered on any strength which is which is the whole flaw is no we we don't present any strength on the Democratic side it's just like we just need someone who is an alternative to the dictator uh and if so that's the case every everything else should be irrelevant every I think everybody like I feel like what I'm getting a lot from people is everybody wants to talk about like what should be they want to be contending with the situation we're in as though America is what it should be instead of what it is and like I think the best way you defend against attack is an attack is to be prepared for it and people are have this energy like they don't want us to say what are the kinds of attacks the Republicans and not just Republicans the Republicans are because that that I'm not even worried about them I'm talking about the regular liberals who y'all think Democrats voter base right though the independence and all of them I'm talking about the left I'm talking about America what America really is if you are a black person a black woman or a mixed one or an immigrant in how many different lines of attack and how many different criticisms and how many different ways uh comma Harris is exposed but people are having this energy like that's you trying to be negative and it's like pretending something isn't going to happen isn't going to make it not happen like put put putting your head in the sand and the reality is when America and elections and stuff have a lot to do with narratives it has a lot to do with media it has a lot to do with what takes legs and so it's best to take your your knowledge of what you've seen America count like do countless times and and be prepared for what they're going to do and what they're already going to do they're going to kamla is at um a disadvantage even when you look at it because to what to what Rebecca was saying right it's like we know what we're supposed to be doing we know we're or we we should be having a conversation about VP right but the fact that we can't really necessarily have that because there are still people in you have an endorser and still it still seems like the question is up whether or not they're going to try to have a open convention or something that end of itself is going to be something that irritates the out of black people that whole circus is going to create a whole another thing then you have the problem of the fact that they a bunch of black people who are going to feel like com we already see it right even you say like oh is she black so then they're questioning her Blackness right then there are people who question uh question her Blackness they're saying oh she's not black cuz she's biracial but she is Indian you know she biracial okay so there saying that then you see the people who feel like oh because migrant or because she has an immigrant background her parents were immigrants um so that's something that they're attacking her and and not feeling the need to Rally around her she is exposed in a lot of different Nuance ways that doesn't like lend her the same kind of support and I think like we have to remember to me a good uh marker to look at is when kamla ran for president herself the first time I remember immediately saying listen a lot of people have liked her online enough generally enough so far but the minute she runs for president then you going to see The Narrative completely switch he's not going to be someone who could get the black vote in the way that you think I don't mean that the majority of black people won't V Democrat but the amount of black support to black people rallying behind her you see for a figure like a Barack Obama you'll never see faka and we immediately did see that black people did not get behind her that's when the cop come you know what I mean cop all that different kind of narrative started in a lot of respects I think and I I don't think it's going to be that black people aren't um going to get behind her I think this just going to be we're going to see a lot a lot a lot of different like attacks coming out and it seems like we're not positioning ourselves best to defend against them right because we're going with this like America's good we we're so great you know what I mean like this is it's gonna be great it's just yeah yeah I I mean I'll say this okay I want to take us back to 20072 2008 when black people did not support Barack Obama like they literally thought he had no chance black people black political figures were endorsing and coming out for Hillary Clinton because they said listen this is America and black people don't have a shot a black man doesn't have a shot at being president doesn't matter if he has a white mom doesn't matter if he went to Harvard doesn't matter if he's a senator he doesn't have a chance and so it really took Barack Obama winning the support like winning primaries winning support of the mainstream debating performing well giving great speeches in order to really give black people the confidence that they needed to come out full force for Barack Obama and have incredible turnouts in 2008 in 2012 and those years are important because the black turnout in those years where black people were voting for Barack Obama at 90 95% that is actually what secured his victories like those black walls that we put up are what secured the victory for Barack Obama all criticisms not withstanding uh win with black men events you've seen close to a 100,000 people show up online on these calls black people to support kamla haris in a way with energy I'll be honest it's some it's some 2012 energy on Facebook right now like like we are like we are a couple steps away from Grandma's putting kamla Harris's face on the mantle on a piece of china like like we are so close like she's getting real close there's some energy and I think that energy is important and I'll say this is the last thing I actually think they kind of played it perfectly like Joe Biden set the bar God bless him for all the good things he did and whatever but like Joe Biden set the bar so low for what people got to like approve of and like be excited about and commit to going to vote for that vice president KLA Harris looks incredible right now in comparison like we were gaslighting our eles to believe that this old man who accomplished a lot like whatever you want to say and did his thing you know whatever but we were convincing ourselves that we had to go out and vote for him and that he was the better candidate though he was like anything's a better candidate than Donald Trump but like we were convincing oursel and so now you have KLA Harris here who is vigorous can make an argument can complete a sentence is able to debate like is able to make the case for the policies that she wants to push forward and I think that just relieves a lot of the pressure that people were feeling that they had to go Gaslight their friends gas like their family members Gaslight themselves into saying that Joe Biden was the best for this country and and so that changes the Dynamics in a way that I think is really important for voter turnout I think the vote was severely depressed like you were not going to see voter turnout in Philly or Atlanta or Detroit in ways that that they need and now there's a chance and I think that's a significant part of this conversation that we can't Overlook I I hope you're right I hope you're right and I think she's a better chance than Joe Biden I think that for sure I don't I I don't I don't dispute that I don't know if I think she has the best chance or if she if it still means that she'll win right because I think first of all I I think we have to remember what kind of especially when people are comparing her to I don't know like Obama like Obama's time or but Obama's time Obama as a candidate specifically Obama is inspiring to people in a different way for a lot of different reasons that is special to Barack Obama like all things considered Barack Obama is somebody who who branded well communicated well who gave speeches that made you feel to this day even with the knowledge of what I know of hindsight and everything and y y y and Obama speech will still hook me you know what I mean then Obama is also somebody that gave black people like also what we what we what we like to see Obama might have been mixed and all those different narratives but Obama had him he gave him an unimpeachably black family the black nuclear family black success black Excellence all the things that we like like when you think of that he was cool when you think what we talk about like the fact that Barack Obama had no scandals had this there was a lot that Barack Obama did speak to that made him that figure and I'm not saying that it's not I hope I don't have Facebook I want kala I want it to be like where to some degree right like when it comes to I believe like I I believe Donald Trump is an Abomination so I obviously want the Democrats pick to win right and that if that's KLA I want it to be it's KLA I want KLA to win whoever theats have because I've explained this a million times why that is that being said if we were having a conversation Beyond this If This Were a private back like a private home conversation amongst us as as black people of what I want to see in this world ah I don't look forward to what the what the what the actual cultural impact will be for the first black woman president to be a former prosecutor and this is beyond the discussion of he would people want to have on whether or not she was a tough on crime prosecutor she was a progressive prosecutor I don't give a prosecutor at all right like what that means for black people continuing to invest in to the criminal system and believeing if they become you know actors with it with it that changes the whole systemic I think we already have a problem right now I believe of black of black politicians who are former law enforcements or have law enfor law enforcement sympathizer kind of opinions and what that has bred in our community in terms of how we feel and what initiatives we do and don't support so I think culturally in terms of in just how I feel personally I think the impact will be miserable for the generations of black girls that I know will be want to go be prosecutors too and I want to go do this but that's just my PRI that I don't think that feeling outweighs I think the pressing moment the urgency of not letting Donald Trump take hold so I want kamla to win I want her to ride I want it to be that she that people feel like you know but I just I have a hard time I'm going to read a thing from Frederick Joseph and I want to hear what y'all think wait wait can I add can I add one thing real quick uh to your point about uh she's better than Joe Biden but against Trump uh um I was watching the news today and I I just want to put out a point that says that yes in the decision to for Biden to step down it was through them showing polling data that uh kamla barely beats Biden on almost all on almost all polling points that matter however she loses to Donald Trump in every single Battleground state so when we say like we don't have a plan we have a we have a plan it seems like we're we're baking on a plan for us to just on the Democratic side accept her as a nominee and not knowing that just generally you're you're dealing with a very unpopular Administration that needs a lot of rehab uh in order to get people invested enough however to Garrison's point and to your point I think that you can sway a lot of the American public through being a charismatic speaker through being a good speaker and we haven't been able to see it this is my hope I could be projecting but like I don't think we I don't think we've been able to see it due to like the role she's had to play but in I'm getting I'm getting head shakes U but I'm saying like if she uh when G say she's kind of coming in with the perfect as much of a blank slate and a firestorm that you can come into she kind all she has to do is be the type of person to to uh to Rally people with enough speeches and have a not [ __ ] policy and here's what y'all don't get I'm GNA let you talk Daddy I I swear right now I think what I have to say is what y'all don't get is what seems charismatic what what a a person is supposed to be that's charismatic for a man is is penalized vilified on a woman right that's the reason why they talking about calling our cackle and this this this and the next thing there is not like there's no angle like they you you're GNA see something something special I feel like we we haven't we haven't In Our Lifetime obviously we have the Shirley chisms y yeah Hillary Clinton is a woman but she's not a black woman you know but in terms of what our lifetime is you're going to really see the kind of scrutiny a black woman gets and how difficult it is to win I'm telling you that on a lesser level of being in the courtroom of being on the TV of all the ways in which they critique black women the things that you would traditionally would make a Barack Obama seem like a powerful speaker like yes you could win him with a powerful speaker people there's something visceral that people feel when women are powerful speakers when women command the room when a woman is is you know what I mean so it's different like that's the thing right it's like yes those things are traditionally what you would need to you know what I mean to be a winner to be a this but if that were if that was how it worked for women that would be how it worked for women but it it isn't you know what I'm saying like so you're going to see the opposite extrem is the same way like Hillary wasn't personable and likable enough right like you know she's scowling she this but then they call in KLA talking about howas cackling you know they already trying to attack like what was her dating history and this is the next thing and we have to also recognize that a lot of misogyny war and all these different things that KLA will get in terms of how she's perceived and whether or not they even wrecking because you know what I found crazy to see in my comments what I'm getting a lot I see this word a lot and it actually blew me because KLA could be many things but incompetent she is not but I've seen that so many times why because they're already trying to make that take hold so there's a lens there's a lens that black women are viewed through that even with all the credentials in the world the goalpost moves they find a way to dismiss that right they'll talk about Toni Brown Jackson is the most damn educated and decorated one of them on on on the Supreme Court in Rec times remember how they talked about the exactly so what I'm saying is it's like yes technically on the rules on the pap it applies for everybody else it's like yeah it would only need to be a a charismatic speaker this this and the next thing but if any of those rules actually applied in this situation we wouldn't even be having this conversation because K is Li tiar more qualified than a Joe Biden or a Donald Trump or any or any of them right so like the fact that we have to have this talk in it of itself is a reflection of there's no like that's all you have to do when you're in the position that she's in and she's going to get the scrutiny from every direction he going to have the fact that she can't give the same like even when you think about the like shallow things right even when you're able to mobilize people for shallow [ __ ] like what like Obama's hope you know what I mean and get people to buy in or like the the image of the Obama family how everybody everybody knew we know the Obama's dogs I know sunny and them like KLA doesn't have isn't able to give them the same thing already taken pictures that Viral pictures that just posted on her husband you see her and this white man they questioning her her you know all this so it's all of that right like it's all these different things and I'm not saying she can't overcome it I just think we have to really really really really be prepared for that it's not a just like she doesn't have to just be charismatic she doesn't have to just be competent she doesn't have to just be better she could run Circle first of all Donald Trump isn't even trying to have the debate with her to like even allow her that you know that win but she be run and would run circles around him and they would be like she's rude she's arrogant she's angry she's this she's [ __ ] you know all these different things and for a woman we've seen it women are indicted in the Public Square for being unlikable that's all you need I think the just we need to be thinking instead of thinking KLA just needs to be charismatic and all that or whatever I think we need to think KLA only just has to be portrayed as unlikable or some shallow thing and that's enough for them to be like people to think that's because to this day you know how many people like when you to this day even after we've seen a Donald Trump Administration we've seen all of it we know what happens and still when people you bring up Hillary people are like oh but Hillary is just exceptionally unlikable to me and blah blah blah blah blah and blah blah blah blah blah and all those things to them still is enough for them to be like yeah that's not as bad as you know I couldn't pick her though Donald Trump is this but I couldn't pick her so yeah Daddy I'm sorry no no that's I mean I agree with all of that because it's like you know talk about uh like you said a charismatic speaker or whatever we already we already have an idea of how they going to treat a black woman in the White House based off just look at what they how they treated Michelle Obama and she wasn't even president she's just the first lady you know so even when people are like we need Michelle to come running D I'm like y'all see what she went through and y'all y'all think the country gonna get behind no y'all already hated her and then secondly it's like with KLA even in in terms of being a charismatic speaker and creating a narrative that the people can get behind I think on her part she uh has like we said she we have it the black community hasn't rallied behind her one because of okay her past as a prosecutor but also I think people just haven't uh felt connected to her narrative she doesn't really pres you know come out and claim like I'm here for black people I'm you know I'm I'm standing for my people I'm a win for me is like a win for black people whatever and then also is she talking about her South Asian I is she is she going to be the the the voice that women women white women are going to get behind so it's a lot of communities that she has to uh ra like rally together but then at the same time the country hates a lot of these communities individually so if they see all of these communities coming together a Rainbow Coalition it's like okay well then us white people are really goingon to get left behind if we get behind her so that's where I see the idea of them getting behind a trump um you know just to maintain that white supremacy but when we talk about all these questions of or not even questions but when people just say you know okay she can't win she can't win because of this and da d da okay at what point do we get to a conversation of okay what does she have like what can she do you know I think we which is right we don't have a choice at this point it's like we got figure I think that but I think that's critical the what can't she do and to you're like an amazing point you make on people not feeling connected to her right it's like cuz I've seen and bringing up Michelle Obama because I've seen in my comments people be like oh it's not that she can't win because she's black because polling shows Michelle Obama would win right first of all no one is arguing that she she just can't win because she's black that is not what I am saying no one I don't think anybody's [ __ ] saying that right Michelle Obama has the she the Barack Obama stimulus package I think people even don't consider how much Barack Obama is the reason Joe Biden is President nobody Joe Biden has run for president several times no one ever wanted him the only reason the country was so desperate to accept him as the person to beat Trump is because people were clamoring for yester year they felt like Trump had radically changed the country since 2016 and they wanted what felt familiar and Joe Biden felt closer to the the the Barack Obama days that's what it is right so Michelle Michelle Obama has that she's Michelle Obama this is now but kamla hasn't had that in the years we know kamla y but kamla has not become somebody like we don't have a bunch of things that generally like the average person throws out about Kamala and and it works to her negative in so many respects right like because I think even the people who throw out negative things about Kamala even when you you talk about Kamala being a cop or kala being a prosecutor can't talk about that too much in depth about what her actual record is it's like just what little things have been thrown about out about her and mostly it's been negative or things that the average black American doesn't feel that connected to I guess like her biracial identity her white husband her this whatever the next thing she does have like you know at I think oh the thing I was supposed to read to y'all for y'all from Frederick Joseph and y'all tell me what yall think about this this he wrote a larger article but I guess this is just a like a little piece like expanding on of his Instagram he said respectfully it appears that the mechanics of electoral math are not fully grasped by many kamla Harris cannot Ascend to the presidency on the strength of Mayor Vibes and internet memes the previous election saw Donald Trump secured the second highest number of presidential votes in history tallying over 74 million for com win she must likely exceed the substantial figure people must question where these additional votes will originate kamla will secure the same black turnout and loyal Democratic votes that Hillary Clinton and black Obama and Barack Obama did Joe Biden an allh man managed to draw support from Republicans it is unrealistic to think kamla can replicate this and even if she could why would she court that demographic thus W remains are the margins on the left young voters Pro Palestinian Advocates and the disenchanted she will likely need to engage these groups to solidify a win that's what he said you do damn if you don't situation I mean for me right like again if we were not in the circumstances that we're in right now my conversation would be so different but right now I feel like we we have we got this right so under being able to identify which is great that you because I feel the same way oay to point out this is going to be a nice long stretch into November and we have to understand that there will be difficulties if we just sit in the black president first female it's a beautiful moment to feel I love it but they don't allow us to just sit there we have to identify where they trying to pull up and pull one on us while we over here just celebrating AKA and black woman right it's beautiful I I would love to stand right here and and be joyous in this occasion like the white folks um um that celebrate Donald Trump could celebrate the mediocre stuff that he does and stand just talk about that forever we can't just do that over here because we're trying to win something so I think that we gotta get ready for whatever they're GNA try to throw because how easy was it for people to like kamla until she was running for president now we're like who not the cop yeah not the cop see we don't want to have that be narrative and we want to stay focused on you know what this is a difficult time that we're in this is not just do we want this and this is what I I I said this um in my own uh covering of this I was like now she's not and I seen this on on it's funny because I've seen it online too she she's not the hero that we wanted that we may have wanted but listen okay she's what we need right now she's all we got so we got to roll with it and um so being honest and and and you know Garrison you too you brought that vibe that you're talking about I felt it on day one it's great to feel it but we can't unfortunately we can't just stay there it's great to see it and acknowledge it the the beauty of the black women I loved it all I love whether or not I'm on the that side of it where I'm like you know I [ __ ] with kamla you know or not it was still beautiful to see regardless black women coming together being on a phone call saying hey this is what's going to happen this is what we're going to do being able to raise that amount of money and less than how like three hours yes and then do that for for her um and having black women who probably don't even get along on a regular day black leadership just getting on that call to do what they need to do we that it's beautiful to see but we have to um we have to understand that this is going to be difficult they're going to try to plant stuff in our minds to look at her sideways uh which we already know these things but right now we have to focus on getting her to the Finish Line it's what we have and did point out about Obama true enough um we were and we me because I don't know how old y'all kids are but you know back in that time I like I remember when a lot of like my daddy damn there was like he can't win just it's good to see a black man but he can't win and we were uh the Millennials at the time the babies and we were just like no black this black man we're g to Rally every day we're gonna do all this stuff and then he became president um but he had to win he had to go out and do do the work in that that small amount of time too he had to go out I remember him and his wife coming on to famu's campus a couple of times showing face uh going around the schools he stopped that he stopped at FSU but for like two seconds and went over came over the tracks to the black side and he really invested into the community um and so wanting so seeing kamla do more of that I said this um last week she has been in the um like they call her the Dei um we treated her like that too everywhere that we saw kamla because you know the running joke is we ain't never seen her but when we did see her she's on BET talking about you know I be outside no sis no what are you doing because no right I want the representation to be I want her to show up as somebody who is competent because we know she is she doesn't have to give us um you know the the hood slang or this you don't have to they're like show us what you are capable of so in this time up until November I want to see more of her doing that and I have seen you know her coming out and speaking and stuff but girl what is on the agenda what are we talking about how are we gravitating towards what we're going to do more for the black community like or or for because since you've only spoken about or you've only shown up like on the shade room and stuff like that like that's what they pick you for like these Tik Tok videos those things I want to see more and this is that time it's it's beautiful to know that you're in AKA it's beautiful to know that you're black it's beautiful to know that you're a product of migrants um but we want to see what what else what's the work going to look like what we talking about I want to see more presidential conversations in that respect so do you do do y'all think that if she does decide to to try to EMB Embrace either side of our identity more she oh I'm here now it's a lot it's moving us around I wanted to say because as I hear Rebecca talk I keep thinking like man I and maybe I'm just Twitter brained in which I'm like that you're right that is literally what Kamala needs to do she needs to at least try to in good faith bring in the black community to say like I want to I I want to be a part I identify and I want to help but then another part of me says if she shows up to trying like looking like she's trying to court the black Vote or trying to be Embrace part of a culture because there's not already that documented uh breadcrumb it like turns backwards right because they are already starting narrative that she's only black during during election times and I think to something Rebecca is saying about um like the the Obama Administration or or or us having Obama I think a lot of black people now feel disenchanted with like oh what they thought Obama would be and like oh voting for Obama and kind of feel a very like the opposite you know what I mean feeling towards um um black candidates that I think might hurt her and I also I'm gonna let Garrison talk right now um and then I'm I'm going to bring up what I think is the Boogeyman in the corner we need to talk about which is the white woman's vote Garrison go oh well okay I'm I'm going transition then back to you CU that's was what I was going to talk about I was going to say I think it's important for us to recognize that they politicians kind of create these windows they create Windows through which they want you to view them and so the black window is going to be KLA doing the little dance and it's going to be her being an AKA and it's GNA be you know that kind of thing that that's going to be the black window and I it's it's terrible but it's politics it's the thing that that raised you know a 100 Mill or whatever however many million dollars were raised specifically from black people and because they did that I'm just going to warn you because they raised all these millions of dollars from black people in 48 hours doing that the aka the Frat the HBCU playing that game that's a signal that we just sent to her campaign that that connects to us now we're on here saying like hey that doesn't connect to me but the money is saying that that connects and so they're going to continue to do that I'm warning you right now you're going to see her show up as the black person for black people but you're also have to recognize that over the last year year and a half however long it's been since dos I think that was 2022 she is effectively communicated to white women about abortion and access to abortion as being a fundamental right that Donald Trump is actively opposed to that his Supreme Court Justices and his court appointed uh judges are actively working against and that has been a really effective message in that space so the window for white women will be a lot about abortion that's how she will show up in those spaces and then of course you're thinking leftists so they're going to talk about lgbtq rights of course they're going to talk about climate change those things are going to be a really huge part of it Netanyahu is in is in the country this week and so she's she has a real decision to make on how she navigates this Israel Gaza conflict the genocide that's happening there is it's really important that she comes out I think as left of um Biden but it's probably also important that she's still somehow managing to hold a center kind of position right and so she's going to have to try to keep all of these coalitions in tension um from a legislative perspective what I will say is that I do think the Democrats learned from 2020 I think they leaned in really hard on the Justice kind of tone I think they leaned in in a way that has proven to be a mismatch with the rest of the country unfortunately I mean you have to think back in 2020 KLA kala Harris then Senator Harris ran on like kamla for the people that was her motto that was her slogan for her Campaign which when you think back that's kind of crazy it means nothing I'm so sorry like I have no idea what that means whereas especially if you compare it to say like Elizabeth Warren who had like you know she has a plan or whatever the case may be right and and I think I think those lessons of clarity and and and positioning yourself as a forward or or futur looking person I hope that they've learned those lessons I anticipate that they have and that they will Implement that as they as they March to the country the good thing is that they have money they have money to go to Pennsylvania all over the state all over Wisconsin all over Michigan and hopefully when in that that very specific corridor on messaging alone and they have some very senior you know campaign officials who I think can help get the job done in in general Mal Dylan and others who I think are are effective campaign managers and so I think there's a I think there's a chance to to Really position the campaign in ways that connect to people and the last thing I'll say is that the gift I hear you I hear you Olay and I agree with you and I would never be one to try to diminish the black woman kind of like um hurdle that is very present in this conversation so don't hear me say that but I do think a gift in this election is Project 2025 you can no matter what always run against the explicit Heritage Foundation plan that is out there that has been authored by so many of Donald Trump's people who he plans to reappoint in his administration because they are loyal to him and so as long as you are position positioning yourself as a counterfactual to that reality I think there or to that potential of project 2025 I think there is some connection point I think it has worked from a messaging perspective um for the American people I first of all I want to be clear I want you to be right Garrison I'm rooting I'm rooting 1,000% for Garrison to be right no part of me wants to sing l i in fact listen I I am fully prepared to like say whatever it is that I can say and in service of her winning you know what I mean as this goes on as soon as they give us something because as it currently stands right this is the thing I think something people are like failing to consider when they think about the left in general is a lot of the left the left itself not just like the Liberals and the progressives or whatever but like the left vote is is not going to consider her a suitable alternative to Joe Biden because they're going to impute everything her Administration did his administration did dir because she was the vice president so they're not having that right anybody who is like no because of Palestine no because of this like I think it's nice and hopeful like that people have like what what what is it the quote she's saying you know something something unburdened by what which is which is kind of charismatic is what like the or the coconut huh we made it a Mee but like it speaks towards OB Obama had hope it's not Obama's hope but it's a cat phrase I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know what it means to live in the context of what came before me and unburden but yeah yeah that I'm like I don't know if that that that wouldn't work for me right like like like if I was just using my common sense like you were a part of this Administration like I don't know who told you you unburdened by what has been I didn't unburden you like actually still trying to hold you accountable but like that being said I know like the leftists who feel that way who feel like because of Palestine because of Gaza all of these different things like Joe Biden's Administration they're not going to be um moved by her then as it comes to white women I think listen this is not me just like you know saying this isn't even a lie of me this is an understanding of History like white even white women's version and retelling of women's rights or suffrage or whatever white women were squarely and explicitly on the side of them [ __ ] cannot get anything before us like that has been the feeling that and I have not lived my life in a way that has told me white women don't coign that belief system like I that's not been and white women are the only group I said this in my video that I put on my on my YouTube but white women are the only group that identify themselves as marginalized people but vote majority in Republican right along with white men in general in general even with the threat of like even when they had a Hillary Clinton even when it was a own white woman even when we explicitly last election when we had the threat of what was going to happen to roow and everything or whatever they still didn't give a so now I do think that KLA I think specifically when it comes to that vote I would be shocked I would I would be shocked if white women show up the way that would need to be showed up show um showed up for Kamala because because I think they see it as like it's the way think about how they that Hillary lost I feeling like that was gonna be the first and I just don't see that being the thing like yes we got Obama and Obama Obama's a black man think about how many white men there were before we got that one black man you know what I mean we Ain had not n one white lady okay okay I can't believe I'm on here sounding like I'm defending Democrats oh my God okay so like this is crazy but okay I will say that a big difference between 2016 and 2024 is that you know vice president KLA Harris actually has two white wom emissaries to go before her right she has Hillary Clinton okay whatever but she has Gretchen Whitmer and Gretchen is very popular very effective communicator and can help to like deliver Michigan which is a critical state for them to win if they're going to win this whole thing Gretchen is gret Whitmer is incredibly popular in her State and she can Tour the State and bring people out and have that and she can speak in a white woman's voice to white women in a way that I think will be important and I think it'll be important I think you're right I'm hoping I want in Obama administration like instead of an anger translator a camera translator like feel like yeah Rebecca see what you gonna say white women because my shirt says think black women but white women um so I posted something on threads and so many of them that I reposted what Scotty posted about you know listen black women take care of yourselves in this time you know being mindful talking to us then white women came in I'm GNA be right there beside you so many of them were in the com you don't have to worry because that won't be me and I'll be right there beside you I've seen so much in the comment section white women um they're under other people's stuff uh there's this one girl that posted about hey people who are not black um she she must be in AKA she said you know we'll meet to discuss how we'll be marching like a little joke how we'll be marching uh to the the polls and all white women were like I get to be AKA for a day um wow so it's more so oay you're like I recall you saying at the beginning that they're looking at all like of like oh she's black and she's pretty and she's an AKA and those cultural black things that they want to be a part of and that's what white women are drawn to I have seen a lot of the other white women outside of that group of white women here we go the soccer moms right they're the uh Drew barryma more they're repeating mamala and you know they're like she's like a mom to us we want like that black motherly and then so she got that group of people and then um it it makes me uncomfortable because these people like I don't I'm just not sure these white people these white women so I I I haven't seen the ones and they might be out there they're not there might be I know that they're out there but on the left side these people want some kind of um to remove their to remove anything that Associates them with Supremacy it's just let me associate myself with just I am voting for a black Asian woman so I'm not racist and she's a woman and I'm proman so that's what I'm seeing more of and it's so funny to watch the discourse online a lot of them there there are white women who are wearing t-shirts that say um a black woman saved me they're doing a lot of the you'll see it's all on my timeline so that's what I'm seeing a lot L of so a lot of white women in support of it but just not being I want them to be naturally in support of her but they're just doing all these cringy black things like like to try to make them seem less like H because I white women I know should someone tell them though people are telling them they're just going there's and there's it's a large group of them like if I go into their comment section their posts are going viral from them um just mentioning her and saying that they're with her and that she's you know badass and all this other stuff and some of the things that they're quoting of her like the coconut thing you saw me rep about it like I didn't know nothing about where this coconut thing was coming from but then I went to go look it up I went down a rabbit hole because I had a problem being a woman who's a product of uh Haitian immigrants I remember what people used to tell me when it came to the coconut thing so when I saw white women posting up this coconut thing I'm like are they being racist or like are they calling her some kind of you know product of what I need to know what and so when I saw it I'm like oh I think we need to rethink that whole thing but even some white people were like let me know if this is racist so I can either jump off of it or jump on it because they even were saying it was coming out racist so they're confused but they're trying to attach to her as any way that they can as far as I'm seeing from the left side but it just seems not genuine but just kind of like attaching to her because okay she's a woman and it's a feminist type of movement and it's this type of thing but I guess whatever vote is a vote is a vote I guess but that's what I'm seeing is cringy I want y y'all hear me I want to be so clear I want y'all to be right oh I I really just here like I remember in my contracts class my first here law school the contracts professor said that there was like a study and they like told all these like couples about to get married they were like oh what's the divorce rate is this right like and they're like What's the divorce rate let's say the divor rate divorce rate is 64% like 64% and they're like all right what's the chance you get divorced 0% and they're like everybody statistically speaking everybody has an optimism bias except attorneys like everybody like that is literally what he told us and it's just so factual like you combine that with the fact that before I live in New York City now but before this and the majority of being in America I live Ohio West Virginia we lost you for a second o oh you didn't hear me where where where I cut say you combine just for the last like five seconds I say you combine being an attorney with um where I lived I live in New York City now but I lived in West Virginia Ohio and Florida before that and I'm like I know these people like I like I know that there are lots of wonderful white ladies on our side of the internet all right lots of well intention super well-meaning white ladies in our comments and in our world I don't think that's the majority of them but I'm not I know not respect too as someone who has a large like a of white people who who like me right white people who like me and white women who like me the way they like you and how they perceive you and how they critique you and the lens that they see you in is insane you know what I mean they like how they look at kala that's what I'm saying but they're how they perceive her how they're talking about her but right now but I just mean it'll be it won't be too long them same white ladies will like you and it's real mommy this they real mama owe me too until somebody somebody get a little good narrative going on you being angry you being this you being blah blah blah I'm like listen just don't hold too firm on white ladies this all I'm saying is ask is that like four four oh you got it I I feel like with a lot of these uh white people who come out in support of KLA for you know like how we're saying like they're almost trying to be more Pro black than even she is and I feel like it gets to a point where they like that ident that idea but then when it let's say she does win and then she does actually start stepping up on some Pro black stuff that's when the narrative changes too because it's like they want a black female president as long as she's their Fe their female president not their their actual black female president so I think we also have to start question and that's what I expect yeah but then but because I even think of like let's say even if KLA does win this goes back to what Rebecca was saying earlier about like you know people expecting an election to be easy or whatever and a lot of times we're expecting it to be easy because yes we are voting for a candidate who we want to vote for a candidate who we feel represents us and uh and is going to fight for what we want but at the same time we know a lot of times the system isn't G to do that but we have to hold our our our people accountable because when we look at like when we got Obama it's like okay it was cool the idea of a black president but did we actually apply pressure when Joe Biden gets Trump out of office white people celebrating like racism is over and then here we are again with you know the lack of enthusiasm to vote for him or getting to a point where he's gone we're confused about who we're going to vote for because we basically voted for someone just because it's the right thing to do but we didn't actually do anything about it once we did the right thing to do so that's kind of like where I what I think about at this point where it's like okay cool let's say let's say we do get her then what do we do how do what do we how ass accountable will but will they we're not going to let Obama happen again is I feel like with a lot of people's ideas right like we we want to hold this president to be accountable but but my thing about this being more uh pragmatic than optimistic is because I guess truly in my mind I'll show my own ass like the only way I can see these these two the bad timeline ending right like Trump getting in would have to be CNN telling me that in historic numbers white women either voted for Trump that voted for Hillary in 2016 or what ever metric they're using or they just didn't come but I but I I think part of me does have a like voting especially if you're white in like of a certain economic class is like an activity that you will do almost every cycle so it would be either they're specifically not voting for Kamala or somehow all those people vote for Trump now I'm not saying that can't even happen that's why I'm not saying I'm not being optimistic but pragmatically that seems so unlikely because it might start like a civil war like if all a you found out like Karen's didn't [ __ ] with us that much uh but I I realized I sound naive I I readily admit that I hope I hope she I guess My worry is I hope that she rolls out some kind of strong platform but I feel very confident that she won't because I think what they're going to go with right now is that she's just not Biden we needed someone more competent than Biden and they would did be I feel like the Democrats be scared to rock the vote and really suggest any strong platforms or policies or anything that would open up more to a debates or any like specific lines of criticism and so then I think because we all have the and rightfully so the energy now that like we just need to get her over the Finish Line we're at the ninth hour we need to try to like defeat what is Project 2025 and Donald Trump so there isn't you know like I said people don't even want to you to talk about what we think the lines of attack are going to be let alone demand anything of her if we were right now like saying if I said right now oh I would like a platform or for K to be telling us what you do sh shut the up right now like you know what I mean not none of that right now we know what we need to do rather than than Donald Trump y yada Y and that's fair and that's true but I'm like if we don't do it now and it's not gonna happen now I'll be giving a platform now I'm like you know likely kist presidency is just I think I just want us to be I think us to want us have the right expectations like temporary expectations the same way you set yourself a a fail thinking Obama was going to do something re revolutionary and you kamla is just going to be a more competent version of the Biden Administration like she's not going to and and that feels and that's just know that you know what I mean I'm just saying like just know that because that's gonna be the case I think you know like I said we've been so sad and down for so long so it's like this having this moment is nice and having the thought you know me I'm you know positive Patty so U I love thinking positive I love to be on that side of it cuz you know we all every day we've been mad every day we been marching for justice every day we fighting against something so having this is like a like a nice glare again I I I never gave a damn about Hillary Clinton okay she never ever never I'm Haitian so if you know you know however um KLA Harris didn't care for her either but this is we're in trying times right so I'm kind of like hey yo put that lady in put her in the seat put her in the seat and we will hold her ass accountable when she's in there we will put that fire it they will do it they will put that fire on her like they will make sure like okay now girl you in there now you know they will do that and it will be the same pressures that we know that she's going to feel right now just being a woman and just being a woman who is a look I have Asian and black um and you know running an office in America we already know what she's gonna go through so we got to make sure once we get her in there to hold her accountable especially because we're going to start to see her lay out her policies what she's going to be campaigning off of we have to really focus on that because she's going to start saying things that sound good you know like they always do which politicians have to do um that sounds sweet to our ear and we can't just let her get in the seat and just be like we just got her in there no we're gonna hold her ass accountable and then if she don't do right we got to start putting in place and molding and shaping somebody for that when her ass is out you know hopefully she wins um but when her ass is out we actually did the work in that time to put some we actually replace them with somebody good instead of not being ready not being ready like we have not we have not been ready okay that's why we're in the situation we are in now and the Republicans right now don't have to do much they're rallying together we saw what the RNC looked like it was a KKK rally there there are people it was whistleblowing of possible whatever they're telling their people to do you know cuz we we hear they're calling them Trump ites now they're saying to you know be ready stay strapped using verbiage like it's going to be a war to prepare for so we're tired okay so just to have a moment where we can just kind of put our hair up in a ponytail sleep with the Bonnet on knowing the Bonnet GNA stay on type of Vibes that's what we needed for a night but now we got to get to work because it ain't going to be just like you know it's not going to be those nights that we had like what three days ago when all those black women got on that call it's going to have to now like really like invest in solidifying that seat pushing conversations educating people and I was saying right now like what we're doing with the show what we're doing on our platforms is going to be having to educate people on why we need to vote for her but not just get to know who she is and what we're up against like project 2025 what they've already done what they pushed I know Olay girl it it ain't it ain't easy it ain't easy and I get it but we have to like this is at least I can say if she don't right if she doesn't win at least I can say like this is the only option that we had and I I fought for that to be a whole thing I'm not saying that doesn't change my perspective on who she is but right now I'm going to put a pen in it so that we can get her ass in the SE this is okay I think Rebecca you're hitting the nail on the head for me which is that we've never been more clear than we are right now there's no like crazy optimism there's no like oh this going to be like there's truly no new November like no like KLA is not going to get us reparations or whatever it is like no there's no like pie in the sky kind of approach to this we are very clear on what's Happening Here and I think that is an opportunity to develop a very clear political change theory as a community like like like I I was listened to you earlier Olay about like and even Rebecca about how like white women are kind of kind of like being a little corny right now let them be corny yeah yeah I thought that too yeah don't in no way them don't them to discour take it away from them you're right when they said I'll be there for you I didn't didn't dislike it I just looked at it like it's kind of weird get off me it's a little but okay it's a little cringe but you got it you actually got it for the next four and half for the next5 days you got it after that like maybe not but like go do what you need to do don't get upset or turned off by Angry whoever it is and do and like I think that's a really powerful place to be in that I think over the the the many many decades black people have always been very cleare eyed about the decisions that lie before them but I do think that politicians have gassed us up they have manipulated us and made us believe that we were going to get more out of something than we would but I I'll say this other thing like when when Joe Biden won in 2020 I was living in DC and and I was out to brunch and people were driving through the city blowing their horn like standing on top of cars cheering it was the corniest thing that I've ever seen But the relief that folks had experienced by knowing that they would not have to deal with Donald Trump for another four maybe plus years was palpable was real and it was really powerful and I think if we can and I felt a little bit of that over the last several days like people feeling that relief of that that Rebecca's describing of just like yo like I don't have to be stressed out about politics in the same way that I've had to be for the last nine years that's crazy I think it's a really powerful thing that we have to capture and and I think a part of the problem of the Biden Administration is that they've never been particularly good at messaging their wins and messaging their legislative agenda and so you have things like the chips act I disagree with their fracking policy but Donald Trump is literally running on more drilling like I was at the RNC and the number one chance was drill baby drill well we've actually never drilled more than we are right now we are currently drilling more than ever before in the history of the world and so if that's what y'all want this is your person right and like I think like there's the there's a real opportunity to change the narrative and to talk about the accomplishments of the administration and the things that it seems like are widely popular but have not been accurately or adequately messaged and and and and on top of all that you don't have to worry about like the stress of Politics as it has been under like Donald Trump as a potential candidate and I think that's powerful Daddy I think I agree I think that that's that's real and but I think I think my issue a lot of the times and I get it we have our reason for why we're here but I think people focusing on that idea of like I want to get over the stress of politics and this and that I'm like well that's also how we end up here again in another four years it's like it's not let's vote for combo so we don't have to do nothing it's like no no no vote for her so and then like I was saying before apply pressure so we have to also have go ahead no you go Daddy no you go no I I was really just gonna say that's how we have to change our mindset in terms of what we're you know how we're voting why we're voting and and and um and just our respon responsibilities as voters because it's it's we you can't talk about changing a system or dismantling the American Empire if you're like I don't want to stress over politics for the next four years yeah come on you that's not Revolution then right and I think that just requires us to temper for me all it is is I'm not these are not critiques like any of what I'm saying is not a critique it is me just I think being clear about what I think the situation we're in and what I think is going to happen and I want us to be of that because I don't think the reality is I don't think I agree with everything gar Garrison is saying about how cleare eyed we are right now right and like it's un it's undisputable to me that Donald Trump is the threat that we need to you know get out of the office and whatever and this is what that requires that being said I think because people are so clar out I think those because that's how people perceive the stakes I don't think KLA is going to start rolling out like policy or offering us like a platform and anything like that I think like I said I think we're going to get a more competent Joe Biden Administration and I think because of that because we're so CL eyed because we are not expecting you know the revolution or a bunch of things or crazy and we don't feel like we can request that now once she's in office everybody is going to have the understanding that we didn't expect anything crazy of her that that's not what kind of candidate is I think people are going to lay lay back in their chairs I also think because she um because she's going to be overly criticized but but by virtue of who she is black people are going to recognize the over because even right now black people are not we don't like we're not crazy about her but even somebody I I recognize that she it's ridiculous that this person is so much more qualified like that we live in this world we recognize what racism is and the fact that we even have to have these conversations and how much unfair criticism she's GNA have and so we as black people don't stand for that right like we're gonna we're gonna put we're not going to try to add to that we're not going to dog pile Patrice Neil actually has a good joke about this with Barack Obama and his stand up elephant in room but we're not going to PO on to that so I don't think we are going to hold her accountable where're like in the sense of we're not and hold her accountable isn't the right words because I don't think you could hold somebody accountable by criticizing them for doing some not doing something they never told you they was gonna do and I don't think she's gonna tell us she's gonna do a bunch of progressive [ __ ] so it wouldn't you hold her accountable but I think I don't think we're gonna move her left I don't think because I don't think we're gonna try I don't think we're gonna because she's gonna be getting a bunch of [ __ ] and we're gonna feel like we knew what it was we didn't think she was going to be that candidate she didn't promise us any of that and I'm not saying that to to be a huge terrible thing right like in the sense of um to what Daddy's saying that I think you know people that's not what causes the revolution but that being said I think a mistake people have been making in terms of like what their activism and they're organizing or how they think they move towards um more revolutionary future is thinking that they were they were going to get it through electoral politics I think people too focused there so maybe you know if we message right and we talk about more what people should do maybe people this four years will be an opportunity for people to look more inward and like more community on how they could organize and recognize and it doesn't come from there and maybe people would put less Stakes on these presidential elections and of itself so we don't have this kind of hoopla circus and you know I say that to say I'll do my best to try and message around like project 2025 why that's bad what the stakes are what this is is the next thing and I and just kind of I just want to be a I think to me I feel like threats are more neutralized if you tell people ahead of time like if you tell them what the white supremacist are going to say when they hear it it doesn't sound so to them the bigger threat is also uncertainty people hear stupid straw man arguments and bigoted arguments all the time because it's the first time they ever heard it they think it's deep I think if we told everybody ahead of time if we recognize the kind of [ __ ] that they're going to say about KLA and we tell them now when they hear it from the right the threat is ah it fell on it didn't do anything so to me I'm just trying to let do not perceive any of these things I think that they're going to feel as me being pessimistic about kamla's chances it's me trying to be prepared for chances and trying to temper our expectations no I agree we have to um that's the cuz the over like like I said we we unfortunately don't get the opportunity to stay in that beautiful moment we have to be like all right it's been a day but we got we ain't got much time so here's what they're going to start throwing at you here's how you about to get ready here's what you about to this is the fact that you gonna throw back at them here's what and then you know a plan needs to be put in place that we got to start following we don't have much time please stop talking about who you please stop telling us about man because I really feel like you know what I'm saying oh oh old boy from that other party would have did right listen he's not not gonna bring him on the T we have kamla and that's it like let's start talking about that let's start moving forward and building a plan so that's what I'm like yeah you're right about that though I do agree it's I would love to stay in the in in this beautiful moment in the accomplishments that we have done but unfortunately we don't get to do that we got to start you know getting down and dirty and and and educating the people and doing the work and to your point daddy yes I believe that once we get her you know in seat hopefully um we can also start holding her accountable or like you said or just discussing things okay that we also also it's like for me it's not even just about KLA I'm like like when I say people getting feeling the ease of like you know relaxing after the election I'm saying that's the issue it's like it's beyond comma it's like the next four years it's your all the other elections that have to go on we yeah we should be we shouldn't be relaxing like we got a lot of [ __ ] to fix from Biden from what KLA will do from what uh you know Trump so it's like it's not you can't go into this with like okay yes everything will be peaceful with but I get it some people do need that I think the most American the most American ass [ __ ] I think the most American ass [ __ ] is having a heart attack every four years and still refusing to work out that's actually so good that's gonna be your sound bite in the intro oh okay that looks like a show it's a show oh wait wait I

we had to address about K which is how are we going to get her the PO how are we going to get her the black and the white vote how are we gonna how are we gonna heal that race uh the race relation and I knew you guys thought the same thing I thought when you guys were thinking about how to solve that problem Family Feud so I wrote down like think about this think about like we have to deal with Steve Harvey for like 30 minutes but if you put kamla Harris against a mixed family a mixed liberal family and like has and then have Steve Harvey like do like you know cuz the whole point of Family Feud is like what does America know and then they rig it obviously because you don't know [ __ ] about the American people but like that she ends up winning everybody gonna be like oh my god oh the K
