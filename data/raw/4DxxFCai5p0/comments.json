Obviously a former neo colony and having Dutch disease like you say doesn’t go away over night, and I suppose having such a profitable industry and a poor population in need of social programs, ofc one would fund those programs to help the populace. I just wonder if you have any further insight in what they were trying to do since you seem to be well read, enjoy the videos and your TikToks!",

        "text": "I think this is a really good question, and I'd love to hear a response from Elliot. My guess would be that, as a consequence of Dutch Disease, Venezuela's economy and infrastructure was largely built for, and therefore is largely based around, oil production and distribution. That coupled with the sanctions currently on the country is enough to make it really difficult to reinvest in other areas and stimulate growth. As Parenti said, you don't just kill a nation when you colonise it, you kill the nation's future too.",
