hello everyone Eddie Smith here from Midwestern marks coming at you with chapter four of Lenin's imperialism chapter four is on export Capital um and my my uh copy here it's one two three four five five and a half pages so really short uh but one of the most important chapters I think uh to understanding Lenin's theories here um so in the last chapters we talked about the growth of Monopoly capitalism and the growth of banks as a way to move Capital around much easier as an intermediary between capitals and then the joining of the banks and the industrial capitalists which is what's going to create which what lenon calls Finance capital okay so Lennon starts off where or starts this chapter where we left off in chapter three um talking about under free competition uh goods were exported so uh Commodities were exported um around the world and traded um but now under this new stage of capitalism the stage of Monopoly capitalism rather than Goods being exported capital is exported so capitalism is going to develop and monopolize and those monopolies are going to begin exporting Capital so capitalism Lennon's going to point out develops sporadically um and it's Mo it's going to develop first in the west so in European countries um and in America also and um Lenin is going to refer to the Lesser developed countries as backward countries so we would kind of think about those as maybe what you'd call developing countries or or um or uh the third world is something we call them the term developing countries kind of comes from the idea that that these countries are going to are going to develop um which they will but but colonialism and and imperialism is also going to keep them in relative poverty um so the term developing world has been has been critiqued and questioned but that's who Lennon's talking about here and he's going to say there forms a super abundance of capital in the non-developing countries so in the most developing developed countries who are on the west um there's going to form a super abundance of capital the capitalists are going to get much richer the banks are going to get much larger there's going to be these giant um essential these giant uh Monopoly corporations I I almost said multinational corporations but but we're getting to that they're going to become multinational corporations um so these monopolies are formed and some countries have a super abundance of capital um so so when you have all this money the capitalist what are they going to do with it right um so they can't continue to just move it around in their own country they have this super abundance and and of course they we know they're not going to use the Surplus value that they have to increase the living standard of the society they live in right they're not going to focus in Lenin uses the example of Agriculture um because agriculture was lagging far behind the development of Industry so now we have enough food we produce enough food these days to feed everyone we just don't distribute it to everyone um but back then agriculture was lagging behind and lennin was saying of course capitalists won't invest in agriculture to raise a standard of living of their own country what they're going to do is they're going to start exporting Capital to the developing countries um now because of banks because of this these intermediaries which will move um capital is capital around for them like that like we've talked about in the past episodes the banks are going to allow these capitalists these industrial capitalists and these Bankers to export their Capital to the backwards countries as they call as Lenin calls them and of course the backwards countries are going to be able to pay crap wages and they're going to be to be able to extract resources much cheaper than they would in their home country um so lenon lenon uses a series of graphs here um which I think is interesting he talks about um the increase in Banks and the increase in uh in finance Capital that exists in France Germany and America uh sorry he uses uh the US France and Germany and the UK and he talks about the increase in Banks there and then he talks about their increase in foreign investment and if you watch from um the 18 I think he goes from like let's see I'll take a look at it actually he goes from 1862 to 1914 um and he and he tracks the amount of Banks and the amount of capital invested abroad and it increases drastically in Great Britain France and Germany I'm sorry the US isn't in this one I I messed up in mentioning the US and the distribu and he also tracks the distribution of foreign Capital so where EX exactly those countries were exporting their Capital too but essentially he goes um goes to the the statistics um of the economy you know that were probably being published by capitalist by Business Insider you know today or whatever Financial Times whatever these these stock market Outlets are and he looked at what was going on with the capital um and he looked at where these countries were exporting their Capital to and he used that to make his observations and um and that just shows uh lenon Lenin's commitment to the to materialism and the scientific investigation of the economy that was started before him by Marx so Marx's the you know if you read Capital it's filled with these accounting books and with these long tables and statistics about um what uh different uh factories are producing and the growth of capital and the movement of capital and where they're investing um and you see lennin following in that tradition here while he tries to explain imperialism right he goes he goes to the substance what can we see what can let's look at what's happening with um the capital and and what's happening is it's monopolizing itself the banks as well as the industrial capital and it's exporting itself to countries which are less developed so um oh yeah and okay sorry and now moving on to the next part um so capitalism begins to develop faster in these countries where the export capital is going right so you start to develop a Bazi and a proletariat or peasant class or a working class um and the exporting country the super abundance compan country who's exporting all of the capital um has has almost full control over how the country they're exporting to develops right because the capital is controlled by multinationals who exist in the Western countries in um in the super abundance countries they're able to control what that Capital does and and the development of the country that they're exporting to so uh an example obviously I'm going to jump to Venezuela because that's you know the country I've studied more than anything I mean they people love to jump on Chavez and Maduro right even socialists they go oh they have NE they haven't um Diversified the economy right they're too dependent on oil um which is true and and that's my one critique of them is that they you know they should have tried to diversify the economy more than they did but the reason they're so dependent on oil isn't because of shavez and Maduro and you hear people try and pin that on them all the time oh they tied the whole socialist program to oil they tied all the social programs to oil um that was their mistake the oil industry got too big and it was a disaster because oil Global oil prices dropped not exactly so British Petroleum and Dutch Shell um were the export Capital that the UK was sending I think it was the UK well it was British Petroleum and Dutch Shell so these these giant multinationals based in the west were extracting tons of oil from Venezuela um under like a neocolonial kind of puppet government who is ruling over Venezuela extracting tons of oil and only oil so so they got to control how Venezuela developed and Venezuela developed completely de dependent on oil they developed what's called Dutch disease where one industry in your economy is so big uh that it dwarfs all the other Industries and the other Industries don't grow and they lag behind so Venezuela because of the amount of oil they have and because of the amount of profit Dutch Shell stood to make on that Dutch Shell and British Petroleum did exactly what Lennon's saying here exported Capital to Venezuela and started extracting resources for cheap labor and the Ven and they got to control how the Venezuelan economy developed and it developed extremely dependent on oil so when Chavez took over in 1998 the Venezuelan economy was already entirely dependent on oil that had nothing to do with him and he tied the social programs he had a 60.6% increase in Social programs and launched literacy campaigns and and all the things that socialists try and do it was funded by the oil industry because that's all Venezuela had at that point was the oil industry but that was crafted by the by the capitalists that wasn't crafted by the Socialist Party of Venezuela um which is exactly what Lennon's talking about here um once these countries export Capital they get to decide how countries develop and then if we're looking and studying Latin American countries or African countries or what Lenin calls the backward countries today if you try and analyze those countries without understanding how they economies were crafted by capital in the 1900s then you're not going to be able to fully understand the country so just thought that was an interesting anecdote and it shows how um how Theory can help us interpret the real world so um Lennon also talks about how you have countries asking for loans from Super abundance countries and and these loans work exactly how we know loans to work today when when uh large Western countries or the IMF or the World Bank are offering loans to countries in the global South these loans come with stip ations right you can buy from us or we'll give you loans but you also have to get rid of all your social programs and make trade unions illegal right um Implement austerity right that's how they Implement neoliberalism um as they they do these loans and and Lenin talks about the French uh the French would would tie stipulations to their loans they were giving and they would say you also have to buy weapons from us right so if if we're going to give you these loans you need to buy weapons from us and here you can see what what eventually will become the military-industrial complex starting to form um where where imperialism is being done solely for the sake of weapons and also you see how now the export of capital also becomes the export of Commodities you have French Goods going to the areas they've colonized um based on these loans with with ties attached to them right these will give you a loan but you have to buy weapons from French military companies right and now all those companies are based in the US like uh rathon Boeing locked Martin Halbert um and it's the same exact thing uh that's going on and then I also want to point out uh after Lenin in 1945 you had the after World War II you had the IMF and the World Bank who were formed whose job was supposedly to stabilize the world economy but of course um since we live in a capitalist Society they became tools of private Capital now the IMF and the World Bank have become infamous for their structural adjustment loans right which are those loans we were talking about loans with strings attached we'll give you all this money um but you got to cut austerity and then these right-wing um and sometimes right a lot most of the time right-wing military dictators take over in in the global South and then they end up just you know being totally corrupt um taking all the money for themselves implementing austerity and allowing the masses um of the global South to live in poverty while there's like a rich few who are exporting Capital back to the west or not who are uh who are involved with export capital from the West um so lenon finishes saying Finance Capital spreads its net worldwide um and these these super abundance countries essentially divide up the world um between themselves and and then he leaves us on a cliffhanger and says and they're also going to divide up uh the the actual physical borders of the world um which is what he's going to talk about in chapter five so I'll see you guys back for chapter five then a short chapter today um so I went pretty in depth on everything hope this was a good explanation I hope you're enjoying the series um whether you're reading along or not I'm really enjoying doing this it's helping me um understand the book and and what lenon was saying and his arguments better uh just because you know one of the best ways to learn something is to teach something so I'm really enjoying this and I hope you all are too thank you for all your support like comment subscribe come back next time peace [Music]
