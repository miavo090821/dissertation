    "text": "Democracy (defined broadly) is when the people take power over how they are governed. That is the foundation from which Marcus starts. That is his tautological assumption. Essentially what he is saying is this: You don't like your government? Then change it. It does not matter whether we have a \"real\" democracy. Taking action is an act of democracy, even when it is met with violence and death. Maybe especially then. \n\nI believe Texans do have choices. I suspect Marcus said what he said to simultaneously highlight the failings of Texas republican voters and point out that voters have choices. Could he have said it better? Yes. However, there is a certain clarity to what he said that I appreciate. The people must recognize both the consequences of their actions and inactions. The vote is real, even if it is deeply, deeply flawed. It gives us options to act without turning to violence. When we stop believing in it completely, we get the Jan 6 riots or worse. \n\nTexas was the launching pad for George W Bush. Al Gore took climate change seriously, and while his policies might not have been the radical step we ultimately needed, the incremental changes he probably would have implemented would have meant a lot more today. As far as I am concerned, Texas Republican voters have a lot to account for. Texas liberals too, many of whom have simply not done enough for mobilize for change. \n\nNone of what Marcus said had anything to do with Texas voting for Trump. \n\nDemocracy in the USA only exists where people take ownership in its results. We need more public deliberation, and less of this two-bit, slap-happy publicity. Who knows, maybe deliberation could even eventually lead to class consciousness and some brand of socialism? (There's a reason capitalism and authoritarians alike make deliberation so difficult for the working class.) Or maybe not. Maybe the end of history takes some form no one can even imagine yet.",

    "text": "Re climate change:\n\nClimate change on average will increase global temperatures. Polar vortices are caused by low pressure low temperature air currents around the poles, hence the name (polar vortex).\n\nPolar vortex's in winter sometimes get disrupted by warm air currents moving northwards, this can lead to an unusually cold low pressure air current ( also known as a low pressure front). \n\nWhen low temperature low pressure fronts move southward they can result in unusually low temperatures and high precipitation because water particles condense in the air.\n\nClimate change can impact this by making higher temperature fronts more common, but this would also occur naturally from time to time as well. Basically think of it like you and wrestling: You're (from what I can tell) a kick ass wrestler. If you took steroids you'd theoretically be able to win more matches, but since you were winning matches beforehand no individual match could be said to be the result of steroids. \n\nThe same is true re climate change, big storms happened before climate change, climate likely impacts storm frequency and magnitude, but no individual event can be attributed as \"caused by climate change\", we just know that climate change can impact events",

    "text": "You've made another great video when it comes to modern politics and political news. However, there are a few points I'd like to add on. Particularly some of the narratives you peddled in your video. I agree that like most Liberals, Marcus Dipaola they often fail to provide proper analysis to current events and I'm glad to see he's getting much criticism for his reporting. However, when you talk about his point on blaming Texans for voting republican, you keep confusing it with Biden vs Trump. When I don't think that was the main part of what he was talking about. In general it seemed to be the generic narrative of the \"poor little conservative being bullied by the mean liberal who doesn't care for workers rights\" that I take issue with. No, I don't think homeless people should die on the streets from natural disasters because of how their state voted. \nHowever, Marcus isn't entirely wrong when he tells them you get what you voted for. When you have a very conservative state that continuously votes Republican for years. You get anti environmentalist governors like Greg Abbott. Texas is suffering from huge power shortages because of the politicians like Abbott that Texans vote for every year. His refusal to diversify the energy sector in Texas away from Fossil fuels is why they're energy is lacking during a time of crisis. https://www.texastribune.org/2021/01/28/abbott-biden-energy/ https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/local/texas/dallas-texas-electrical-power-outage-ercot-failures/287-50797307-0afe-43eb-8175-b78e7e4fc13a \nAgain, you get what you vote for. So, I don't agree with this narrative that \"Liberals are just big meanie poopy heads that don't care about workers\". Another thing you went on about how voting for Biden is pointless because he's \"A Corporatist democrat who doesn't have the interest of the working class\". I agree that Biden is a moderate Liberal which means he won't do nearly enough to solve most of Americas issues. However, this doesn't mean he should be dismissed like he isn't going to do nothing. You even admitted yourself that Trump did more harm than good by pulling back regulations and worsening deals to help with Climate change.   https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/04/biden-climate-plan-1352663 https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/14/joe-biden-climate-jobs-plan Again, I don't think Liberalism will be enough however, this doesn't mean it won't do anything. Biden does actually have policies that he wants to implement to help with climate change, Trump doesn't. When Trump offered 2000$ checks, not because he cared for workers, but only to posture and make himself look better. Biden actually was drawing plans for stimulus checks. https://www.cbsnews.com/news/stimulus-check-1400-dollars-covid-relief-2021-02-07/ When Trump did more to harm immigrants, Biden actually does have policies to improving living conditions for immigrants and to improve the immigration process. https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6573546-Biden-Immigration-Policy-EMBARGOED.html \nGenerally speaking Liberal reforms often are not enough to properly address the issues at hand. But doing the whole \"SOCIALISM NOW!\" and not wanting to put any effort in slowly building up policies to get to that point, won't do anything either. Democrats are just better when it comes to environmental change than Republicans. You don't just need to be comparing Presidents to President. You need to include Governors and Mayors too. As seen with Greg Abbott, conservatives are part of the problem. Anyways, good video.",
