right now texas is facing a giant winter storm that they were completely unprepared for because texas obviously isn't used to winter weather so most of the experts are already saying this is climate induced obviously there's a misconception out there about climate change that is just going to make everything hotter but in reality there's more energy now trapped below the the atmosphere every time i talk about science it goes wrong i'm going to do my best here though there's more energy now because of all the all the fossil fuels and all the greenhouse gases that are being emitted um and it creates a situation where you can get more turbulent storms and crazy weather conditions in places where we're not used to seeing them and you're seeing a perfect example of that here with this with this winter storm in texas um and and i think there's an interesting way in which the liberal media is covering this um and marcus diapola i think that's how you pronounce his last name as a famous uh news reporter on tick tock and he covered the story and he has gotten in insane backlash for how he covered the story um and rightfully so so i'll just play his clip and then we'll talk a little bit more about how this is being covered um what's going on in texas and then what we can do i'm gonna shout out some mutual aid organizations in the area if you want to donate and help the people in texas right now all right let's watch the clip texas electricity is all up because republicans wanted electricity to be run like a business instead of a government service as we all know businesses have to make a profit in order to exist the problem is that businesses generally do what's necessary to make money and don't actually give a about customers so they have to be forced to take care of their customers by rules created by the government well republicans don't like rules either they call them government regulations enjoy your power blackouts texas you voted for them all right so that was a very interesting way of covering this um interesting as in bad condescending classist people are very very mad at marcus for this take and i agree with them you know to to say at the end there this is your fault texans you voted for donald trump four years ago you bought brought this on yourself as their roofs are collapsing because there's too much snow and their houses weren't built to withstand the snow as their their power lines are being shut down for who knows how long it's going to be before they can get people to rebuild those and these you know what are frigid temperatures for people in the south i live in the midwest so like our houses are built for this you know we have clothes for this we prepare for this you know because this is what the weather's normally like it's not normally like this in texas you know people are saying this is a climate change induced storm as i said in the intro so obviously this is a classes take again a lot of the people who are dying too in texas and there are people dying from the storm are homeless people you know so you're going to tell a homeless person this is your fault because you didn't vote for trump i mean because you voted for trump what what is your logic there and even by that logic texas almost went for biden you know it was about 50 50. it was a swing state this year they almost voted for biden so even by your logic it doesn't make any sense your take you're you're blaming them um for what's going on right now um but but here's the the main problem with this taken which with liberalism in general is that he thinks he's diagnosed the root of the problem right he looks at what's going on in texas and he says the problem here is that these people voted for trump and they didn't vote for enough democrats if we had enough democrats this wouldn't be going on i have diagnosed the root of the problem i know what's wrong with the country and with texas um and these stupid people don't and that's why they're in this situation because they voted for trump but that's not the problem this is a climate-induced storm what is biden doing for for the climate crisis other than getting us back into the paris climate agreement which is essentially propaganda it's essentially all the countries coming together and saying oh let's trick everyone into thinking we're actually doing something you know and it set quotas and some countries are trying to follow those quotas but under obama the u.s wasn't even on target to hit the quotas that they agreed to for reducing fossil fuel emissions and of course everything's been deregulated under trump but marcus acts like if we had democrats in office like they were about to nationalize the fossil fuel industry and move us towards renewables and a system that's sustainable with the environment that looks to eliminate these problems of metabolic rift it's called um and climate change but they're not that's not what joe's calling for joe's the president right now he's done nothing to crack down on the fossil fuel industry despite other than the keystone pipeline which we're just gonna go get our oil for elsewhere or from elsewhere right the only thing that can solve this is eco-socialism which is not something marcus supports he doesn't understand the root of the problem is capitalism assistant based a system based on constant expansion on a planet of limited resources right he doesn't understand or he doesn't agree that humans are destroying the planet and the fossil fuel companies are destroying the planet and the only way to stop them from doing so is to seize them have the workers seize them and smother them as we replace them with renewable energy and move people into new and better jobs in the clean energy sector that's not what marcus is calling for he's calling for you to vote for joe biden he's like oh yes we care very much about climate change we're going to sign this deal telling everybody that we're going to do something and then don't worry about it that's not going to help texas that's not going to help puerto rico who got hit by a climate storm uh they're a climate hurricane recently you know you have not diagnosed the problem yet marcus as you sit here condescendingly telling people that that they're the problem because they voted for trump you know par a huge part of the problem is that people think once every four years they can show up vote for the democratic candidate and then everything's gonna be better and then homeless people won't die of climate change storms in texas no you're wrong and you telling everybody that they're the ones who are wrong i mean looks really silly and looks really condescending and it shows why conservatives you know vote for trump why they hate liberals in the political establishment so much they feel talked down to like you are talking down to them in a time when people are really really struggling when people are dying and losing their homes um again homelessness a lot of the homeless people are dying is biden gonna stop homelessness in four years are there still gonna be hundreds of thousands of homeless people in the streets of america yes he's not calling to nationalize housing we have more empty homes than there are homeless people biden's not calling to move those people in there he's not even calling to set a price ceiling for what rent can be he's not calling for any of this all the people in texas could have voted for biden he could have won a hundred percent of the vote in 2016 or or you know hillary could have won 100 of the vote in 2016 or biden could have 100 of the vote in 2020 there'd still be homeless people there would still be a climate storm and the liberals still wouldn't have a solid plan for how to fix it because they're corporatists and if you can't recognize that as you're talking down to working people you're not helping anything you're just being classist and you're and you're putting the problem on them and not only putting the problem on them but you're alienating them right you're sitting here in in this comfortable position making tons of money off the tic toc creator fund i know because i'm a tic toc creator too and and you're telling these people this is your fault that your house is flooded you voted for trump this is your fault that you're homeless and and now you're trapped in the winter weather which plea marcus have you ever been in a situation like that have you ever been in a situation like that and if you were would you want a media personality to walk up to and go well shouldn't have voted for that guy when that guy is the president now and he's not doing jack to help texas so what's your point here but this is the problem with liberalism in general it's a misdiagnosis of what's wrong with the country right the other side is wrong the republicans are wrong no both parties are corporatists they're not going to implement eco-socialism they're not going to nationalize housing they're not going to make public utilities publicly owned they're not going to make all utilities public and keep the price down they're going to continue to screw people they're not going to launch a giant infrastructure project that we need because the u.s infrastructure gets a grade of d and you're seeing our power grid and our power grids and our housing is collapsing in the middle of a winter storm because our infrastructure is also completely unprepared to face climate change what is joe biden's plan for that what is he planning to enact to fix that nothing so why are you telling me that if everyone voted for biden these people in texas wouldn't be struggling they still would ridiculous so uh that's that's my take on this and us as socialists or communists we do want to help right we we want to help these people and we want to show them the way forward the the way to fix your problems is eco-socialism to plan production quit letting these billionaire uh fossil fuel oligarchs like the koch brothers destroy the planet and underpay their workers while making insane profits nationalize them move to renewables quit letting landlords evict people from their homes and prevent homeless people from having shelter because there's a price gap because we have to let landlords be this parasitic instrument collecting millions of dollars for for doing no actual labor get rid of landlords nationalized housing this is how we help the working class especially in the era of the climate crisis because this is going to keep happening and it's going to keep getting worse and liberals are going to keep saying uh you know you just gotta vote for our guy and it'll get better these storms will stop happening if you if you vote for our guy and we need to be there to say no you need to implement eco-socialism you need to make sure housing a human right you need to make public utilities a human right and we need to launch a huge program giving tons of people jobs to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure in a way that's going to be resilient to all the climate storms uh so i'm going to leave some mutual aid organizations and some other organizations you can donate to in the description down here if you want to help the people in texas there's one for mutu austin mutual aid they've launched a gofundme campaign bringing people food and shelter there's a texas division of emergency management a group called feeding texas that'll give you a list of all the food banks in various areas all of those will be linked down in the description um and i hope you guys enjoy this video solidarity um and just good energy towards all the people of texas um we'll be thinking of y'all and trying to do everything we can financially and and with our rhetoric to get you guys the help that you need um because eventually climate change is gonna affect us all right texas is just kind of one of the first places it hit and this you know there was a climate change storm in puerto rico a few years ago where the same thing happened you know uh um the u.s government didn't give them any relief and then all the liberals said ah it's trump's fault you know yeah trump's a buffoon he's a dum-dum but we need to recognize that both parties have been bought by the ruling class of america and the ruling class doesn't want to do anything about the ills that exist in our society homelessness climate change endless wars need i go on alright thanks for watching everyone check out those links in the description and we'll see you later you
