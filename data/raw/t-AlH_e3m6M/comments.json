They're just as white (or more honestly) as they are black. This one drop rule stuff needs to go. Let Drake be the white man he is inside! lol",

Even if his nationality is called into question, it's because of how he acts and moves in Black American culture. He syphons off of it and doesn't respect it or other black Americans and our individual cultures, just uses it for cosplay while not having any real respect or attachments. When your reping for America and the black American experience as someone who isn't even from here, of course your nationality is gonna be called into question. It's crazy the amount of times I've seen this victim hood complex come up in this conversation like Drake isn't the biggest hip hop artist, as if the weekend isn't number one whenever he drops music, these dudes nationalities aren't even brought up majority of the time. They are black and seen as a part of us even if they aren't from America.",

    "text": "Drake is an old man, he is god damn near 40, and he is being treated with kids gloves. He should do like Kendrick and go to therapy. How are you 37 and moving like a child. If he was a teen to maybe 30, I would understand, but he is grown. How has he, with all his riches, all his success, not figured out who he is yet? How is it that he is able to still not be authentic to himself? All I hear are excuses from Drake fans as to why he is the way he is, and yet nothing to show for it. Just emptiness and vapidness. Drake stands for nothing, yet weaponises everything - his blackness, his struggle with finding a place, his 'nice guy' persona. \n\nDrake is a weirdo, and, if all these artists who you put on no longer mess with you like that, why are you not self-reflecting on that. Why don't people want to be around you? What types of people are around you? This shows that Drake is not smart. He is not a deep thinker, he is not about the betterment of anything, let alone himself. He is literally everything that is wrong with the culture. He is fast food. Good in the moment, but adds nothing to your overall health.",

Like, recently, I can appreciate why Macklemore fans like that he is talking about Palestine, but the ones that have said \"this is real hip hop\"... Ridiculous. Of course that doesn't mean that just because a person is Black doesn't mean that what they say is law or should be uncritically listened to or make them a monolith.\n\nSuffice to say, I loved this discussion. Olay & Friends is a Sunday highlight for me.",

He's rich enough to live off the royalties forever. He could go and do his healing, and the idea that he is owed the continuation of his platform is playing into that whole whiteness thing imo.",

Do you understand why a competent criminal org that traffic would love Drake? Can he be used to convince vulnerable people to do stuff, especially without violence even? Then you can compromise blackmail and profit? I'm not sure how criminality works where you are, but the Hell's Angel's out there would 100% be wearing full kente cloth like Pelosi, and saying sir to Drake if what he suggested is true.

Over and over, she was able to be both precise and nuanced in her articulations, particularly in the connections she was rendering between the cultural disdain some folks have for Drake, and his willingness to move in(to) whiteness for his own benefit. I appreciated her energy throughout. \n\n- I've only ever heard Marlon in the context of being a comedian or charismatic host. It was cool to see him bring this much insight and ease into a conversation that hinged upon cultural critique. \n\n In general, I agreed with a lot of the points that were made about the particular cultural figure Drake is, and how hip-hop culture views him in this moment. I was really looking forward to this episode, and I wasn't disappointed by what you all offered.",

I should have been way more disappointed than I was at the time. Thinking of all the Toronto hood rappers that could have made it that had sheer talent but just needed the opportunity that Wayne gave to him and Nicki …. Bruh he slept with Wayne’s girl while he was locked up :( just actually not a good hearted person nobody is perfect but it’s like he hasn’t ever really tried to be a good person I should have realised when he stole from DRAM and made hot line bling",

If Drake is getting famous off of the ATL and TX culture, they should be allowed to get their lick back. Which is why I appreciate FD's point on the capitalism of it all since the \"innovation\" of capitalism is how it benefits from and upsets existing patterns of power, and they were all playing the game. \"They culture vultured him\" was crazier work though. Those with less power should absolutely be allowed to strip the carcass for all its worth.\n\nBut the thing I don't understand about Drake not fitting in is that we do like Drake with the melodies! Best I Ever Had IS a masterpiece. People keep referencing the Lil Wayne chat for Drake to keep it Aubrey. I can't remember whose point it was, but homegirl was right to call out Drake's tragicness of feeling unable to fit in. He made the choice to pursue capital.\n\nEdit: I commented this before Antoinette asked how much are we willing to sell our culture for. Bars.",

There's a moment of dread as you try to reconcile these different  perceptions from reality and unsure where one begins and the other ends. \n\nReally great discussion. It's nice to see the passion everyone has, and also, I love yall setting boundaries and speaking up and saying \"I'm not done talking\" when others would jump in because yall are so passionate.

We don't all feel desperate to \"fit in\" with Black Americans like Drake (whose immediate roots are from Memphis; he been disconnected from his OWN roots for a long time fr). Many of us are very comfortable making the music we make; we're just priced out the sector (also applies to anywhere else in Canadian entertainment industry too).

        "text": "@AllTheArtsyThe narrative that Kendrick was favored from the very beginning is a false one, and that bothered me from this panel. In Round 1, the panel spent an hour talking about how everyone counted Kendrick out: he took too long to drop a diss track; Drake was winning because “Push Ups” was great and Kendrick hadn’t dropped. Drake was everywhere! He had support from the industry. I traveled to New York, Atlanta, Chicago and saw Drake billboards everywhere I went! Drake was being promoted on the streams. He was being promoted by Ak, Mal, Adam and many in hip-hop media and entertainment. To assert that Drake was the underdog is quite frankly a lie out of the pit of hell. When people assert that Kendrick is an Industry Baby, it’s just simply untrue. No one was on Kendrick’s side. Even Kendrick fans doubted him and felt that he was never going to respond to Drake and many felt defeated and crowned Drake before “Euphoria”. Before Euphoria, everyone was talking shyt about Kendrick—-even after the great performance on “Like That”. People were still counting Kendrick out in the beginning, which is so baffling given that Kendrick is a far superior lyricist and rapper than Drake. So now, I see folk trying to change the narrative to claim that Kendrick was favored all along. That’s assertion is simply not true!",

If you keep applying that logic about white and black keys, well, it's a bit of a stretch, but you could say that B sharp is a white key playing the role of a black key.\n\nWhat I'm saying is, Drake dissed himself with that line.",

        "text": "Yeah, it’s interesting how everyone is talking about what Drake did for Toronto when The Weeknd is a much bigger artist in many ways.
