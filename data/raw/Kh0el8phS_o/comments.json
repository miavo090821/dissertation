        "text": "@josephburke2553 the term “AR-15” is a bit vague, in popular usage “An Ar-15–style rifle” is a lightweight semi-automatic rifle based on, or similar to, the Colt AR-15 design. The Colt model removed the selective fire feature of its predecessor, the original ArmaLite AR-15, which is a scaled-down derivative of the AR-10 design (by Eugene Stoner). It is closely related to the military M16 rifle. ArmaLite sold the patent and trademarks for both to Colt's Manufacturing Company in 1959 after the military rejected the design in favor of the M14. After most of the patents for the Colt AR-15 expired in 1977, many firearm manufacturers began to produce copies of the rifle under various names. While the patents are expired, Colt has retained the trademark to the AR-15 name and is the sole manufacturer able to label their firearms as such.  My point is that there are copycat rifles to the Colt AR-15 being sold as “AR-15 style” rifles, so getting all OCD and ‘well akshully’ about nomenclature is beside the point, which is that the AR-15 *is* an assault rifle, given the definition that matters, the one made by the US Federal Government.  From 1994 to 2004, the Federal Assault Weapons Ban restricted the sale of the Colt AR-15 and some derivatives in the United States, although it did not affect rifles with fewer listed features.  In 2009 by the US National Shooting Sports Foundation coined the term “modern sporting rifle” in an attempt to deflect attention from the fact that the AR-15 had been considered an assault rifle by the government.\nTo me the irony of all the debate comes from the fact that my dad, who was Infantry in WWII, was a big fan of the M1 Garand, and that was the rifle I learned to shoot as a kid, and I suspect that the current popularity of AR-15 style rifles is due to good marketing, not inherently superior quality or design.  Plus, the sheeple like to own what they think soldiers like to use.",

        "text": "⁠​⁠​⁠​⁠@TheSunsetHero256 Not every point has to be extended to the most extreme version of that argument. You seriously took \"Slander doesn't harm the dead; it harms the truth\" and jumped all the way to \"How dare you justify desecrating a corpse!!\". \n\nCharlie Kirk's reputation should be mud. His words alone are enough to condemn him, let alone his actions in helping to establish and justify a government that has devastated the lives of millions of Americans. He was a cruel, petty little man whose life revolved around gleefully spreading hatred towards minority groups and manufacturing consent for their persecution. It is a lie to pretend otherwise - that he was merely a simple defender of free speech who happily debated any and all people in good faith.\n\nI could say that I'm sorry that he's dead, but frankly, that would be a lie. I don't agree with political violence. I think murder is wrong, and every human has intrinsic value. I regret the pain and sorrow his death has caused for those who genuinely loved him as a person. That being said, I'm not going to sit here and pretend that I wish he were still alive. I don't celebrate his death, but I understand those who did - because they were celebrating the death of someone who actively sought to ruin their lives and the lives of those they care about. \n\nWhat truly disgusts me is how those who professed to care about him as a person have gleefully celebrated his death as an opportunity to achieve their political aims - using him explicitly as a human sacrifice. It's obscene, and deeply disrespectful - although I would hazard a guess that Kirk would have happily seen his death used as a tool to crush those he wanted to oppress.",

        "text": "​@BambiTrout It's called the logical conclusion to an argument/belief. Don't hate me for just following the concept of \"You can't harm a dead guy\" to it's natural conclusion. 'Cause that's the great part: 99% of people don't want corpses desecrated. Folks in this comment chain and Three Arrows have put forward this argument that's universally agreed to be absurd. Again, not my fault that you didn't bother considering the idea to it's conclusion.\n\nThis is going to be a fun one to unpack. Short version: You're wrong. Longer version: Countless folks like you have confronted Kirk, over and over and over again about how he's everything you just listed. Every single time not one person could actually back the claim up. Because Kirk isn't anything like how you've characterized him. You only get to this mindset about the guy by intentionally avoiding his actual words and arguments by forming your opinion off the characterization by others. And this is patently obvious to half the country that watched him die. \n\nIn your moral grandstanding, you fail to realize losing one Charlie Kirk created a million Charlie Kirks. So you can try to play games with your made up version of his character, while every single thing you hate about him is multiplied and magnified across the country and world. It's entirely avoidable, but you guys can't help yourselves. Enemies aren't capable of nuance or principled positions. They must be destroyed at all costs. And so you slander his name. So you celebrate his death and call for the deaths of others like Kirk. I don't care if you haven't done this personally. Leftists have so many demons on their side, and they play defense for the demons, I don't care anymore. You guys are demons, and it's not up for discussion.\n\n\"Using him as a human sacrifice.\" That requires that the right have killed Kirk. Which is a claim you can only make if Leftists are so deranged, so possessed by an animalistic urge to kill, that they lack accountability for their actions, sure. I'll agree to that. Then it really is the victim's fault. No, what you're really doing is looking at the people who loved Charlie Kirk in-life, following his lead and not letting his sacrifice go to waste. Because he was sacrificed. He was sacrificed on the demonic alter your people worship. Like a cultist chant, every single day you demons say \"He's a fascist!\" \"He's ruining lives!\" \"He's taking away our freedom!\" \"He's killing democracy!\" \"N@*s need to be attacked!\" Violent rhetoric, day after day after day, then someone with the means acts out the logical conclusion of that rhetoric. That was the sacrifice, and like good demons, you cheered. Celebrated. Thanked your god that he's dead. \n\nAnd you don't see a problem. Oh well. I'm not here to warn you or to save you. I'm here to say \"I told you so\". See you in a year.",

And if you spent years and years making things awful for everyone else because it doesnt affect you specifically until one awful day? You dont get to cry and apologize especially when everyone else was pointing out the obvious harms of your actions. People will rightfully sneer at you for finally \"seeing the light\" because you failed all your life to see beyond your tiny little bubble.",

Like you know that tumblr meme of someone wanting a surprise reveal of an empty casket at the funeral, only for there to be a spotlight that shines upwards showing their corpse tied to a fan as the music starts screaming \"you spin me right round baby, right round.\" Like do that, if you're gonna make the funeral be a joke, actually commit to it, make it so absurd it can't be taken seriously. Don't just make the funeral be gross as hell.\n\nAnd I'm not even against a celebratory funeral, I know of many cultures and people who insist on treating funerals as not a sombre event, but a celebration of their life. That's not what Charlies looked like. If they wanted pyrotechnics, they should have done normal fireworks, that would actually be understandable as a final sendoff. Rockstar stage fire beams?

We will not be taking off on the federal holiday.\"\n\nEdit: this is the actual tweet, word for word, bar for bar\n \n\nIf Juneteenth was really about emancipation, why not...\n\nSeptember 22, 1862 when Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation?\n\nOr January 1, 1863 when the Proclamation took effect?\n\nOr December 18th, 1865 with the ratification of the 13th Amendment?\n\nBecause it's not about emancipation, which was one of America's great moral achievements. It's about creating a summertime, race-based competitor two weeks before July 4th, which should be the most unifying civic holiday on the calendar.\n\n\nHe is literally calling the day on which slavery was abolished a \"race-based competitor before July 4th\".

He quite literally called juneteenth a direct race-competitor to 4th of July, hence blatantly calling the 4th of July a white holiday. \n\nStop virtue signalling. We know who's ignorant and who's not. You're wrong full stop. Now you can proudly say that you support a racist or shut your trap you weirdo.\n\nSome more examples: \n\nCalling for the murder of George Floyd to be free\n\nSaying that if he sat in a plane with a black pilot, he would feel uncomfortable\n\nHis constant promotion of the great replacement theory (the most referenced to and supported theory by white supremacists)\n\nI mean, he believed that the civil rights act of 1964 which ended segregation by saying that it was a “permanent DEI-type bureaucracy\". \n\nI mean he said this in a fest in 2023. In 2022, he called MLK a hero, but in 2023 he started calling the same MLK a \"horrible human\" and said that he would release content to discredit him on MLK's birthday . Do you think that a non racist person would discredit the civil rights act and then create content to discredit one of the most important black activists ins USA's history?\n\nAgain, you are 100% wrong.

Ah yes, and there is also the statista polling after his death, that showed that around 50-60% of american democrats where not condemning or even celebrating CKs death.\n\nSecondly, can you tell me which stream? Never heard of it and I don't know anyone who does. And even if it's true, (which I heavily doubt, since every other misrepresented quote has also been completely debunked) it only shows, that CK is not a perfect human being, but it never was a central or even consistent point in CKs ideology or arguments, since he always expressively condemned EVERY political violence in any other instance he talked about it. In turn it is though a central and consistent point in the ideology of those sick individuals who celebrated his death like the streamer destiny (which happens to be another case of evidence to my first point as well).\n\nEdit: I remembered it wrong and researched it again: it was not a statista polling, but the Network Contagion Research Institute, that found that 55% of leftvoters find it somewhat justified to murder Trump und 48% said the same for Elon Musk.",

That's what you wish, because you know I'm generally right, witz what I'm saying.\n\nI researched the CK quote that you are referring to and it turns out, that is a peffect example in favor of my argumentation. Here is the quote:\n\n\"Of course you should reject any link. [...] And why is he still in jail, why is he not been bailed out [--> like all the reverse cases of violence he actively condemns within this exact stream]? Btw if some amazing patriot out there in San Francisco or the bay area wants to really be a midterm hero, someone should go and bail this guy out - I bet his bail is like thirty or fortythousand bucks - bail him out [and now the part that leftist media leaves out cherry picking] AND THEN GO ASK HIM SOME QUESTIONS. I wonder what his bail is\" --> the last part is implying, that because of political bias, the attackers bail is probably much higher that the bail of crimes commited by people that don't fit in leftist ideology like by people of colour.\n\nThe quote goes on:\n\n\"I'm not qualifying it. I think it's awful. It's not right. But why is it, that in Chicago, you're able to commit murder and be out the next day\"\n\nWhat CK is saying is not \"bail the Pelosi attacker out because he did good stuff\",  but he said \"look at the double standard in bail out judging and practice, when the violence that I condemn is commited by supposed right wingers, bail him out and ask him, why he is stupid'.\n\nSo even in the case you presented the actual message that was put out by the guy was anti political violence. And the irony is, that under the TYT presentation of the CK quote, you can very often read in the top comments \"bail out Tyler Robinson\". I think it is clear that this does not come with an added condemnation of political violence in general my friend.\n\nI won't call you a liar as you did to me, but truly your media are the ones who constantly misrepresent stuff and lie my friend.\n\nIf you are actually interested in the truth and not in being right here, watch some content like the videos of Metatron, Amir Odom or The Comment Section and see for yourself how all of these CK quotes are being completely misrepresented.",

Even if it's not strictly speaking his personal top issue the Second Amendment in particular will keep coming up because his own death was literally a school shooting, and it represents an absolute best case scenario for gun rights to prevent violence since the campus he was on allowed open carry of firearms, and yet none of Kirk's followers were able to stop the shooter, while it's also the starkest example of how gun control could work since the shooter wouldn't have been able to get the firearm anywhere near Kirk if he'd merely been stopped by campus security and informed he wasn't allowed a hunting rifle in a school; as it stands, the shooter was actually operating completely within both the law and the campus rules right up until he took aim and pulled the trigger, he could have walked up to Kirk face to face with a Glock strapped openly to his hip and just pulled it out and shot him in the face if he wanted to and no-one would have known or cared what was about to happen until he pulled it out of the holster",

One example is his video critiquing Robin DiAngelo, which had a strong thesis against neoliberal thought. He correctly avoided blaming men for systemic issues there—but now he does exactly that.\n\nHe doesn’t handle feminism well. He sticks to identity politics, which are essentially liberal moral arguments rather than systemic critiques like those in critical theory. Critical theory is dialectical, but he’s become binary, often essentializing groups like men as the “outgroup.”\n\nIn the Robin DiAngelo video, he critiqued her for blaming all white people interpersonally rather than addressing systems and structures. He said it would be wrong if he did the same about men—but now he does. This shift shows a move away from dialectical thinking toward oversimplified binaries.\n\nIt became clear to me that he prioritizes his donor base over principles or consistent, well-sourced thought. Even when he references Foucault, he misapplies him—like claiming people with autism or ADHD just aren’t trying hard enough, which is the exact kind of disciplining, normative logic Foucault critiques.\n\nIronically, he also banned anyone who disagreed with him on the autism point, which is another twist against the spirit of Foucault’s ideas.",

Vaush is objectively irrelevant to anything mentioned in the video because he has not mythologized Charlie Kirk, he has not defended Shoe’s takes or perspectives, and he is not and has not been related to her in any tangible way for a long time. \n\nYou can freely hate Vaush and think he’s a neoliberal, I can freely be indifferent to him and think he has some dogshit takes and some acceptable takes. But bringing him up out of nowhere and shoehorning him into a convo makes zero sense to me.",

You just were incredibly over defensive of vaush because of this pedantic reason that I said shoe0nhead was affilated with vaush and it wasn't recently, just two years ago, that's not recent -- leading up to her engagement in politics now. That's why you were aggressively calling me obsessed and dumb. \n\nAlrighty then .... 🤨\n\nI brought him up because it seemed relevant to me. Her entrance into politics was preceded by her affiliation with vaush, that's how I know shoe0nhead at all. Maybe you are different..... and that's what pissed you off so much ..... ?",

Not HOW they say it, not how they present themselves or their arguments, the ACTUAL WORDS and rhetoric they say. Especially if it's something they frequently repeat, or fall back to. Because you can easily spin some of the most vile things and make them sound reasonable or not that bad, depending on how you present it and yourself.",

I'm not even pro-life, but to equate a moral dillema like abortion, to the literal murder of somebody is insane. Which is NOT a morally gray area, makes no sense.\n\nSure, I disagree with Kirk on the fact that the families referenced had to go through that, but I understand that the people who might defend that position, are concerned with the possibility that the baby might survive (I still oppose this because it is unlikely and the family shouldn't be forced by the state to have it, but understand the point doesn't come from evil, and they're not \"ok\" with the baby dying) and in their view, that would be better than letting somebody take the life of the fetus because they think it's murder.\n\nUsing this guy's exact same logic, in the view of a rightoid, you are responsible as a pro-choice of the deaths of potential human beings, who will be robbed of any experience because their parents decided you were not maybe economically convenient or another reason (I think the abortion case presented in the video is very reasonable, but doesn't change the pro-choice position on other cases).\nThat's why Charlie held a debate platform, on the principle that you discuss these difficult subjects.\nYou don't have to think he was a good person, but this moral relativism about \"let's compare suffering\" in order to discredit the impact of a murder is beyond ridiculous.",

His argument was \"People constantly get released over that the next day, but he was not\". He did not justify violence. He did not agree with the punishment.\n2) \"But he wished for Biden to get the death penalty\"\nAnd? Yes, that's because he believed Biden was a criminal. Guess what is civilized way to deal with such issue? Use court and find the truth. Guess what isn't?? Suggesting violence. \nDo you not see the difference between this methods? First leads to a fair process (as much as it can be), the second leads to terrorism.\n3) \"He justified gun violence because he justified 2nd amendment\"\nThat's terrible logic. Promoting and accepting the cost is nothing close. If you wanna have a baby, you're going to suffer during birth giving. Does it mean you want the suffering?? No, it only means you see it as the most rational choice you can have, considering the cost.\n\nIt's like saying we should not have police, because some policemen violate human rights. An illusion that somehow a world is gonna be all rainbow and peace.\n\n4) Your position on David is moot, how can you defend Charlie on his stance.\nI'm gonna ignore your paranoid comment on my stance and say next:\nI don't agree with Charlie on that.

        "text": "​@Insomni-Man\"For some individuals it's more real than God, which I think is preposterous, but, as a society gets more secular, unfortunately with it goes its moral conduct and behavior. Now, I am a fierce proponent of the separation between church and state, I think it's actually been positive for Christianity in the United States, I think that the less government has endorsed state-run religion, the more the church has been able to succeed, as long as our religious liberties are intact, preserved, and protected. The point being, is that if you try and have a theocracy like some of the European countries did in the 50's and 60's or the 20's and 30's, people inherently try and rebel against it, so for example, Spain had that huge argument, \"Should we become a pseudo Roman Catholic state?\" and that kind of started a little bit of a conflict, a little bit. Um, the point being is that the protection of the — uh, individual liberties is super important, but looking holistically, you — there, there's a coincidence — there's no coincidence, there's no argument that one of the reasons behind the rampant, um, escalation of I would say immoral behavior in a lot of these countries, in North Korea or China and the former Soviet Union, is that when you remove God and you say there is no God, government replaces that and the reason is, motivational leaders want to create themselves to be a God-king. And that's, that's what Mao tried to do, Mao was revered as, as a God in China, and Stalin was revered as a God, and there's nothing more evil than that, a human being trying to become a deity, in and of itself. So I am a harsh critic against the American atheist movement for a lot of different reasons. Um, mostly because I say, how could you possibly be so certain? Like, like if you're agnostic, I get it. Like, I understand you're searching for answers, you're always open minded. But an atheist, like, they're so committed to knowing that there's no God? You believe in nothing. And so when you have nothing there's all of these questions that automatically come: Where does your moral conduct come from? What is our point of origination? Are we good or bad by nature? So as an Evangelical Christian I'm very, very worried that as [a] society we get more — we get farther and farther away from our, our Judeo-Christian beliefs that really created Western civilization, there's a reason why the USSR, the alcoholism, the infidelity, and the rampant immoral behavior was so widespread, because when you remove God, I would also argue that, uh, with it you remove the core set of morals that helped create the West.\"\n\nLiterally the same philosophy as Carl Schmitt, the premier legal and social Philosopher that influenced Nazi Germany. \n\nPeople who cry and defend crypto-Fascists are legitimately a threat to the modern Liberal Democracies, and as history has shown, this kind of speech will lead to the end of said Liberal Democracy, the foundation of the modern West. At least Schmitt was brave enough to claim he was a Fascist. \n\nJust because he has been assassinated and such assassinations are to be condemned, doesn't mean that he wasn't a Crypto-Fascist.",

There's no harm in believing the first, unless you follow the second, which means infringing on a person's right to self determination.\nHad Charlie said \"you should obey your husbands regardless of what they do\", THAT would be a problematic statement, but he said that wives *should obey their husbands *if they are loving husbands. Even if he had said the first thing, you would still need to prove that he caused somebody harm in order to claim he was a violent man.\nHe was not violent, he did not deserve his death. There's still no reason to be happy about his unaliving...",

Him being absolutely not normal because he's got a massive audience of millions of listeners who tuned into him to listen to his show that generated tons of money giving him massive political influence financially and with his words and killed for that would make it what would be an assassination. \n\nThe usual Conservative use of this scary \"THEY\" \"YOU ALL\" boogeyman to say \"You all murdered/assassinated him\" shows you clearly can't pick if it's murder or assassination yourself.

They would be pushing for free and universally accessible condoms and birth control policies. But they don’t… because it’s not about abortion. It’s about controlling women.",

He didn’t say school shootings were acceptable, he said that we need to put armed guards at our schools. He said “if our sports, our businesses, and banks are armed, why aren’t our children? Why does our money have guns and our kids not? We should have armed guards to protect all schools. He was not against civil rights, he specifically said that the civil rights act should be a one letter bill, making discrimination by race illegal and punishable by law. He said this because they are trying to use our rights (I’m black) to put men into women’s and bathrooms and sports. He also spoke out against black violence, because by capita, black people kill many more black people, which is sad for my race. Goerge Floyd was NOT a good man, he had multiple criminal convictions. I don’t think he deserved death, but he has actually harmed people directly. When he spoke about jasmine, yes, that was hate fueled, but not racist. He was angry that he didn’t get it. I cant blame him. Shouldn’t’ve said that.",

They're going to complain and cry on the internet for a week while figuring out exactly how to best monetize the event, then they'll move on to the next grift. I mean, Trump himself nearly got assassinated, and it didn't trigger civil war 2. I think the right-wing base is just so chock-full of zero-attention-span cowards they can't really motivate towards anything. They just want to sit at home eating tendies and rage-bait in YouTube comments while ICE goes around doing their dirty work for them. The irony is that ICE is cut from the same cloth, and they're so scared of the public that they've been run off by pedestrians on a whole lot of occasions.",

Will they now believe their fears have been proven right and feel they have a right to ‘retaliate,’ regardless of who actually was behind the initial shooting?”\n\nThese aren’t celebrations. Some are deflections from the event, some express apathy, and others still simply discuss the political situation surrounding what happened.",

Kirk responded to that and he said that we are all equal and race is a construct and you should only care about character. That was his whole thing. Turning point USA has 50% people of color conservatives but of course people won’t point that out nor that he worked with Candace Owens on blexit to go to inner cities to create a scholarship fund and a black conservative leadership summit with 500 people each year. Not to mention the several friends he had from all different classes and Creed. I mean, if you hate his views that he was a Christian conservative why don’t you debate his views with full context instead they are labeling him a white supremecist and Nazi when he wasn’t.

        "text": "@bbro1810 I did read from the BBC about Charlie Kirk working with people of color, and I know some people took certain quotes out of context (not all of them but for instance the “empathy” quote, which was really a semantic discussion but I think people believed it to be similar to what Elon Musk said about empathy when it wasn’t). Charlie Kirk used a lot of long-winded rhetorical devices that made it easy for people to take out of context then and now for a variety of purposes, and it doesn’t help that there’s a growing dissatisfaction with a style of political debate that is hosted and posted online by one of the sides within that debate (prone to biased representation).\n\nI honestly didn’t know much about Charlie Kirk before and still don’t, but I would say certain positions expressed are quite a bit more conservative than the mainstream (although they may not be Charlie’s actual positions, as it’s common to play devil’s advocate in debate). Shortly before the shooting, I know Charlie Kirk was having some misgivings with supporting Israel, and I do think there is a sizable difference between supporting Israel and supporting Jews. There is also a significant difference between supporting “black” communities financially or organizationally and viewing an individual as less qualified for their job on the basis of race (even if in the context of hiring quotas or other controversial strategies to reduce hiring bias), as both can be done by the same person at the same time. You can be racist while fighting racism, and you can be bigoted against minorities or be fascist without being an antisemite.\n\nDo I think Charlie Kirk was fascist? I don’t know enough about Charlie’s political ideology to determine that, but I do think Charlie had some level of bigoted beliefs. That’s not justification for being shot, but it might explain the behavior of people afterward who had believed Charlie Kirk’s (apparently pretty popular??) platform was directly contributing to the suffering they faced.\n\nSometimes we need to take a step back and realize that a lack of support isn’t the presence of hate. We need to stop thinking so monolithically that a large group of people are equally celebratory about something, equally hold the same set of views, and are equally guilty for the same crimes. We enter debates presupposing a partisan narrative and never get anything done, and those who can walk away with a simple “but I don’t believe all those things” are the ones that narrative can’t refute, who eventually change the narrative to suit their more fringe politics. If we decide our politics purely on the basis of allegiances and reactions to the actions of others, our political ideologies all become inherently reactionary and relative, so those with clearly defined goals such as the ethnonationalists continue to gain ground. Look at how so many have turned the Charlie Kirk issue (and many others) into Democrat vs Republican or right vs left, but ask yourself who actually has something to gain from that narrative. Good vibes don’t secure our constitutional rights, so why should bad vibes threaten them? Why should we separate out tragedies by the political affiliations of perpetrators and victims, demand that others repeatedly mourn for “ours” first while not proceeding to sacrifice that time for “theirs”, and continue to sacrifice time for our emotional ingroups while we witness the death toll rise for us all? We don’t have space for the performative outrage of people not feeling the right way out loud when it is the goals and actions of those who have felt privately in some very extreme ways that are deciding the political environment of our nation.",

He also made disparaging comments about specific prominent Black women, questioning their intellectual capabilities and suggesting they received positions through affirmative action rather than merit. Also, just because he hired gay and black people, doesn't mean he was not fascist. Hitler got his Jewish doctor out of Germany before he started his genocide, and the leader of the nazi stormtroopers Ernst Rohm was openly gay. Does that make the Nazis not fascist?",

It combination of Extreme nationalism, Dictatorial leadership, Suppression of opposition, militarism, Control of society and scapegoating.\n\nMost of the left wasn't closed to criticism, It was asking to base it from the scientific facts.

The problem is a lot of the right don't believe in scientific facts and get butt hurt when ever it said just boiling it down to “woke”, denying the multiple evidence presented to them. \n\nSo because I base my beliefs off what experts have proven makes it fallacy and shows I have no depth of thought?

My friend has never been the same and talks about this child that never lived as another one of her kids. It's been 15 years and she still breaks down about it. It impacts her other children. It's torture for people who can give birth to be forced or coerced into going through full pregnancies and giving birth to dying or dead babies. I believe people that do this just want to punish mothers they see as \"bad\". Like their baby would have survived if they were a better person or something.

I think it's sick to force a mother to carry an already dead baby to term, turning her into a tomb for nine months, only to retraumatize her again when the baby is born dead. I think it's sick to force a mother to watch her infant die painfully after being born because it was clearly determined months prior that the baby would never survive. I want people to have safe, healthy pregnancies. Forcing people to go through dangerous and nonviable pregnancies often ensures they won't have more children due to serious complications or devastating mental trauma after. People already are in pain when a pregnancy fails, even in the early months, why do you think it's acceptable to exponentially worsen that pain and possibly permanently damage their mental wellbeing?",

        "text": "​@TheBohemianCat I think Floyd was a guy that was murdered by a cop that was out of line. Whether it was racially motivated, I really don't know. Some people argue it clearly is, I feel it's more of a subjective feeling for a lot of people. I remember the riots that followed being pretty destructive. Lots of shop owners lost their businesses. However, that whataboutism doesn't justify Kirk's hatred that ultimately leads to many crazy people on the right grabbing their guns and deciding to shoot up a bunch of random people in churches and parking lots because the woke minority group mind virus is going to destroy America or whatever stupid thing is on these lunatic's minds. \n\nThere was violence on both sides over the past 10 years, but the right's violence has been much more destructive. More people die in shootings caused by people with right-leaning views than left-leaning ones. Ultimately I think people need to calm the hell down.\n\nAnd before anyone says \"don't both sides things\" No, I will both sides this. I will, and you want to know why? I don't want to be part of a hivemind. If you don't criticize your own side then you're being one-sided. If you're being one-sided you aren't getting the full picture. You aren't getting the actual truth, just half of it. And the full truth is uncomfortable, so get used to it.\n\nI'm personally done with taking sides. Being team left or team right. But I still champion views that I consider good causes. I think the left has more of those good causes, but I'm not going to jump at the bit to support a politician just because they're on a team. I support people that I think have good ideas, and that's it. There's no left idea, no right idea, there are just ideas that work and those that don't. There are many corrupt, spineless, and stupid people milling about in both parties. People on both sides have trouble coming to terms that their politicians, their very beloved politicians are corrupt just as much the bad politicians that they're taught to hate. If I don't know enough about a subject, then I don't take sides. You don't need to take a side for everything. Have you ever actually thought about how every single view under the sun can be classified as a right or left leaning view? Why should that even be the case? Every single thing is politicized. Why is that? There's quite literally nothing that you can believe in anymore without somebody calling you a fascistic pig or a woke libtard. And if you believe in two things from both sides then nobody likes you. If you're moderate and just want people to get along then nobody likes you. It's really really dumb if you actually think about it. Our society can't keep going on like this. Eventually some ideas will have to become considered neither left nor right if we want society to function. People will continue to be fighting with each other as long as there's two teams for everything. \n\nThere. That's my take. If you hate me for it, then I ask you to be less hateful. Hate is what's destroying our country at this very moment. Both sides think their hatred for the other is justified. Maybe it is, but it's still hate at the end of the day. I've had my share of that. At the end of the day, after all of this, we're still going to need to find a way to get along. Our president is certainly not helping keep people united despite our differences. We're the United States. What we need is a president that can unite us. The people will follow by example, and we can put this whole mess of a time behind us. All I want is at least some person with dignity in our highest office. Somebody who can turn down the temperature, and someone who cares about facts over their party's feelings on the facts. Honestly I care more about that than any culture war things. Why should I needlessly stress out over trans people and their pronouns or evangelical pro-life people everyday? Why should I sacrifice my mental health, my time, and my faith to placate and suck-up to groups of people that I barely ever interact with? Being normal is comforting in a time when everyone wants to be the farthest thing from normal.\n\nMy point with writing all of this is that I wish people would just quit being so stuck in their ways and actually try to understand each other a little better. Yeah okay, maybe their beliefs make you uncomfortable or disgusted, but these people are your neighbors. These are people you'll be sharing a country with for the next decades to come, maybe you should make an effort to get along somehow.",

    "text": "Shoe0nHead is just a lying grifter. There is no reason to take her video in good faith, it is a bad faith video all around. Her attempt to frame Charlie as just some guy is an obvious lie because Shoe knew who he was and what he said for ten years. She knows he is influential and she knows how influential he is. Her attempt to highlight all those videos were an attempt to signal to her supporters that people harass those she showed doing Tiktok's and contact their workspace to get them fired. All these videos are the same, they will always try to wield conservative outrage against their enemies and they all have no empathy speak of cause they're all motivated by a grift for money. Nothing else.\n\nEdit: Holy hell, 520 likes? You kidding me?! Thanks! I wanted to clarify a few things, I was there when she made her debut into the YT. She made a splash making fun of tumblr sjw types that were being exceptionally annoying and pedantic about the thing's that kept offending them when they tried to cancel it or try to change it or make a huge stink online about it. At the time you had holier than thou groups attempting to make inroads into gaming spaces and change a bunch of stuff in nerdom. You had one of them, whose name escapes me, cringe inducingly denounced GTA's \"toxic masculinity\" and break a game disc on stage to a cheering crowd of about... 15 people. They were basically progressive Karen's who would write articles on the white supremacy inherent in the Legend of Zelda franchise. Not kidding with that last one.\n\nAs for what videos she did that were good on that and other spaces? She did a fantastic video calling out Warren's bullshit with Bernie Sanders back in 2019. She had great videos calling out people who advocate for boys to hook up with older women or their teachers. She did a great video calling out incestuous relations that got flagged. And she did a video duology on what she actually agrees with Anita on. Her relationships as far as people have mentioned here, range from Chris Ray Gun to Armoured Skeptic. I don't know what her other relations are or if she currently has one right now. I just know that video she recently put out is apalling on several level's and I just scratched the surface.",

I was raised in the south, and white people love to pull this line of speaking out as a sort of virtue signal, but really they're just saying that they settled with the church that had the most people that spoke like and looked like them. It's a softball way to start to roll out the \"I'm a conservative\"  flag, but your reaction to hearing that is what dictates how far it gets unfurled.",

And even if I am a leftist, if I had the power to undeo his death, I would do it because as much as I dislike him he didn't deserve \"death\" for his positions. But that does not mean that I have to experience grief over his death either. Or that there isn't some irony in the fact how he spoke and how he died in the end.",

It's that he held an extreme position on the case where he wanted mothers to carry out children, even if those children had zero chance of surviving and in fact could actually lead to the mothers death, for example due to a sespis. Which happens actually more often than people think. Mothers died because of this in the past and will continue to die because of so called \"heart beat\" laws in the future.",

You can say a political has a responsibility on what their audience does, without blaming the acts of their audience entirely or even mostly on the commentator. Because people take things subjectively, and one cannot establish a direct pipeline between what somebody says and the action of a third party in response to that. UNLESS we're talking about a direct order to commit a terrible act, like killing somebody. THAT is inciting violence.\n\nI don't care about the Brocialist and any of that stuff, that has nothing to do with what I'm saying.

Something that, to be fair, Kirk was apparently starting to change his mind about supporting.

It doesn't really seem like it leaves a lot of room for discussion, if you went straight to more obscene language and assumptions. Saying that he lied about everything all the time is pretty strong. Have any evidence of all the cases you think he lied in?\nAnd other than that, well, the perception of words and their meanings of course that's not \"bullshit\". It would be foolish to assume that a word will have the same exact meaning for everyone, specially on stuff like empathy, or justice, or love. I'm sure that someone you know has said what love means to them, for example, and you might not agree with it. It might be the same, no?",

I could go on a rant about the things you discussed with the other guy, but I think it might be quicker to point you to turning point usa 2024 (at least it was one of those events). Charlie literally cycles through like 18 different right wing dog whistles. Including saying something along the lines of \"only one gender can give birth\" and then following it up by saying vaccines don't work and that you can survive covid by just taking vitamins and shit like that. \nMind you that turning point is a massive right wing event directly paid for by trumps heritage foundation. I think he even founded turning point. So it's easy to see how deep in that propaganda machine he was. at that point every single thing he says needs to be scrutinized and assumed to be loaded in some way.",

Whether you call it trolling or asking questions, my point is that citing specific evidence is how we move beyond assumption and accusation.\nYou mention he \"literally cycles through like 18 right wing dog whistles\" and talks about vaccines not working and surviving COVID with vitamins. Those are very specific claims. If you could point me to a direct clip or quote of him saying something like, 'only one gender can give birth' or the stuff about vitamins, that would be appreciated, as is your burden to give proof when you say that, you cant just say \"hey, it's there, look it up\" when you are the one sustaining that those things back up your argument.\nGiving evidence is the only way to hold anyone accountable and have a discussion that isn't just about 'whose side sucks ass more'.",

It hasn't been my experience at all with the conservatives I know.\n\nSecondly, people were saying the same thing about Trump as Biden, too, tbh, except actually saying they hoped for his assassination. It's important to note that Charlie Kirk wasn't running the country so we can understand who exactly is being celebrated for dying here. Wanting the assassination of your country's leader, of course, isn't acceptable, but it is expected and seen throughout the world like in Australia or people's reactions to the Queen dying. Charlie's job was to be the messenger, not the leader. \n\nThirdly, the media isn't directly responsible for people's behavior. They're indirectly responsible. It's still mostly the people's responsibilities to think for themselves.\n\nFourthly, if there was a political assassination of Biden unless they're hardcore Trump cultists, they wouldn't condone it publically on Tic-Tok. Right wingers have kind of been on the side that does more private political assessinations for the longest time. They at least know it's a bad thing to do and to keep it private. George Floyd, for example, they knew not to celebrate publically were they to be evil enough to celebrate it.\n\nFifthly, the left constantly uses rhetoric against the right that the right is violent. You don't throw stones in a glass house.\n\nFinally, the people lionizing charlie kirk are setting a good moral precident for behavior in the right. Political violence is now off the table for the right. This is a good thing. I don't get how everyone here seems to be twisting it as bad.",

        "text": "@mostlysure1077 Your not personally knowing anyone is ALSO anecdotal. Stop being disingenuous.\n\nPeople also being afraid of Trump getting elected or being sad that he didn't die really doesn't have any bearing on whether or not people trying to tone police the current situation would have celebrated a similar one for one of their enemies. I'm not even sure what you're trying to argue with that. But also, don't try to \"both sides\" it when only one of those sides actively tried to overthrow election results.\n\nThe current media landscape being largely responsible for the increasing political divide is pretty commonly accepted. You can't expect people to be personally responsible when they're only being fed heavily biased and often entirely incorrect information. Unless you're expecting them to be more responsible at seeking out more accurate information, in which case I hate to break it to you, but going by most third-party fact checking organizations, it's people listening to right wing media that are far less responsible.\n\nYou referring to Floyd as a \"political assassination\" is bizarre and seems to demonstrate a somewhat warped view of politics. And while there may not have been people celebrating it, there were no end to people saying it was just and deserved. I don't know what timeline you come from. But for a more recent example, you only need to look to the attack on Nancy Pelosi's husband, where plenty of people were memeing on and joking about it. But those are just random people online? So are most the people saying they're happy about Kirk. Don't be unfair.\n\nWhat leftist with a major platform on a national level that reaches millions of people uses explicitly violent rhetoric? Because many of the right-wing commentators using it ARE at that level. Take care of your own glass house first. But again, \"the left does it too!\" is kind of completely irrelevant to my point.\n\nI don't know how you can look at the public comments made by right wing figures and claim that violence has been taken off the table for them. They've all almost exclusively used it as an opportunity to rally for more political power for themselves while attacking the left and minorities. I haven't seen any of them talk about who Kirk was as a person or celebrate his life. Calling that morally good really just makes me question your morality.\n\nYou called me gross for making a comment based on my personal experience and are now trying to deny that experience while also bringing in a whole bunch of points that I never made. Without ever retracting the original insult. You're not interested in having a good faith discussion, so I will not continue it any further.",

        "text": "​@-tera-3345By the same token, your annecdotal evidence is also invalid. Where does that leave us? \n\nPeople being sad that Trump didn't get successfully assassinated has bearing because that means it's an issue from both sides and is normal. The Joe Biden example, even if true, is not a good comparative to Kirk since Biden was president it's normal for presidents. It's also extremely disengenuous of you to bring up the election overthrow, when only one side actually tried, and failed, to assassinate Trump. \n\nI'm not sure why you're bringing up the political divide. It has little to do with people actually celebrating assassination. Same thing goes for people on the right, working class as they are, not having the time of day to be politically informed. It's still their decision to actually act on their limited politics and celebrate murder or not. \n\nFloyed was a political assaasination. His skin color 100% had to do with it. You calling it \"bizarre\" doesn't take that away. People weren't saying it was just and deserved for the reason you suggest. You're manipulating the fact that they thought that way in the first place because they thought, incorrectly or not, that police holding people with a knee is due process and he shouldn't have been unlawfully high. \n\nPeople were memeing on the attack of Nancy Pelosi's husband because the guy was a Qanon conspiricy theorist wacko, it was absurd what the attacker was trying, and her husband wasn't actually killed. It's again, not a fair comparison, just like your Joe Biden one. There are few examples of political assassinations of publically popular people from the right, unless we go all the way back to MLK. \n\nPeople keep saying as you are, also, that Kirk had \"violent\" rhetoric. But every time I look up the quote and find the context, it's taken out of it. It's not at all what he was saying. He was pro-life. That's the most violent thing he believed. Again, leftists shouldn't be throwing around \"violence\" in a glass house. If you're fine that you're in the same party as people who openly admit they like assassination without you disowning them as ShoeOnHead did, then you can't go and call out people on the right. If you, right now, disown the people who celebrate his murder from your political stance, then we're all holding eachother to a higher precident, and that's a good thing. \n\nAlso, I struggle finding actual specific examples of right wingers using charlie's death to gain substantial political power specifically in order to call for violence. Charlie himself would roll in his grave. \n\nFurther, I wasn't calling you gross. I was calling what you were saying gross, just like how you went and called what I was saying gross. I'm not going to be a coward and accuse you of not arguing in good faith, because I'm above that. I realize that people think things I don't, for reasons I don't always peg exactly. Occam's razor, however, says to assume ignorance rather than malice, because it assumes less",

They might understand when a rape victim cheers when their rapist dies, but the concept of non-physical harm being done is beyond them. \"Kirk was just saying words, he had no impact on anything, he never hurt anyone physically,\" is genuinely how these people think. Politics isn't a matter of life or death, suffering, torture, fear, etc to these people. To them, politics is making their money go up and anyone harmed to do so is whatever. \n\nSo many of these conservatives who are mad at people celebrating Kirk's death want to be able to tell people to mourn their abusers deaths. Because to them, Charlie never did anything wrong. They are too simple minded or rather, too immature to comprehend that words have power. Its for a similar reason they think Trump did nothing wrong on Jan 6th.",

People who immediately and without evidence posted claims that the man who assassinated Minnesota state representative Melissa Hortman, her husband and attempted to assassinate Minnesota State Senator John Hoffman and his wife was a radical leftist, communist.  Something they immediately did with Kirk's assassin as well.  Their demands of civility and charitable reconsiderations of one's legacy only extend to those on the right. When political violence is dealt to those on the left, or center in the case of the Pelosis, then not only are there no calls for civility, but instead there is unfettered mocking and insulting of those who were attacked and/or killed.  This makes it very hard to take their demands seriously.  The social contract goes both ways or it doesn't go any ways.",

When the right here is caught cheating, grifting, lying, I’m ’yeah that’s what they do’, shamelessly. It’s human nature to give in to avarice and fall from grace, just as it’s the breath of life for right wingers, no fall required, it’s a feature not a bug. In the US yes, Dems were captured by money a long time ago but occasionally they pass the affordable care act or inflation reduction act or CHIPS and Science act. Get rid of the electoral college, bring in term limits (to reduce your gerontocracy), overturn Citizens United and maybe you stand a chance, but I think it’s all over for you. I’d better learn mandarin…",

I blindly took their word on it, and I'm not going to scrape Twitter just to find the \"hot takes\" of random anonymous Internet chuds, many of whom would probably be saying stuff like that purely to provoke anyways. And I suppose if I don't stand by that, the whole double standard talking point goes out the window. 😅\n\nTo the first part though: the constitutionality of revoking visas because of \"dangerous speech\" is still legally undecided. The current administration is just going through with it anyways, so we'll see how that turns out.\n\nHere's my powerless little opinion on the matter. Speech can be grounds for barring entry, sure, but both documented and undocumented immigrants are distinctly covered in many (but not all!) amendments of the constitution, including the First Amendment and freedom of speech. So it's going to take some serious mental gymnastics (or maybe just a red-majority Supreme Court LOL) to construe the revoking of these visas as anything but an infringement of 1A rights",
