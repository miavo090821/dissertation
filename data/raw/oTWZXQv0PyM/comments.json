Some analysts warn that heavy-handed security measures that do not address underlying social causes like poverty and inequality can lead to a vicious cycle of violence in the long run.\n  \nIn essence, El Salvador did not \"purge\" crime through traditional prison sentences but rather used a controversial, comprehensive, and widely criticized state of emergency to physically remove a large segment of the criminal population from society at an unprecedented scale and pace. El Salvador s security strategy has provided unprecedented short-term safety, but experts and human rights organizations largely agree it is unlikely to be sustainable long-term and risks eventual collapse. When or if it collapses, El Salvador will be in for a hell of a Crime war on its hands, it would be  better off killing those men in prison. There is significant fear among many experts and human rights advocates that if El Salvador's current security model collapses, the potential release or resurgence of gang members could lead to a return of extreme, unprecedented violence, potentially even a \"war\".  A war like you have never seen that would take the country with it.",

We can't exactly help that \"God\" made it where animals can't communicate to humans. We can't help that all loving all-powerful \"God\" made it to where both humans and animals have to take from living things, including killing them, in order to flourish or just survive. Animal essence is compassionate, honorable, and has a lot of fortitude.\n\nWe also can't help that \"God\" put a bunch of lower-vibration uncaring people on this planet, moreso than on any other individual planet out there, percentage-wise. Mind you, these lower-vibrational souls, as well as the higher-vibration ones, came from the very essence of what \"God\" was. The lower-vibration a spirit innately is when it was made, the less good heart energy it tends to have. \n\nIf animal essences were in human bodies all along, the other way around, I guarantee you there would less problems of sorts on this planet.",
