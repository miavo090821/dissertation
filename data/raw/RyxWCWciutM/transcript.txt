the real races don't believe you can do it so we're gonna make it harder for you to do it so you can prove them wrong but I believe that conservatives and liberals figured out they Insidious ways of being able to replicate liberalism in a way that always leads to anti-blackness Supremacy they always walk in Supremacy they will always walk in whiteness what about me well why can't it be this well why can't it do this your reason doesn't you don't the struggles don't match the races should have their way and we shouldn't have this policy in place because giving you opportunities would undermine the belief in your capabilities that we already don't [ __ ] believe in do you want to be blind or do you want to be American [Music] thank you that brings us to why I've convened us here today right um affirmative action um my my fellow learned Negroes um I listen it is maddening but it is not surprising at all for a number of reasons like it's just not like the reality is we have a kangaroo court that is literally going to roll back every opportunity they get that comes in front of them to roll back a right a previously recognized for is gone let's understand that I've been said that from time and that's not like that's not me just thinking that because they're Republicans or the Republican majority they have said as much they have actually started peeling back the actual final depressant yeah that's what's happening baby that's not 40 years ago listen yeah so that's not surprising for that reason and then as far as affirmative action is specific they've always had it out for affirmative action affirmative action has been introduced two other times in American history and they've gotten rid of it each time and then as far for different reasons they did they introduced it in um During the Reconstruction you know and then um the most recent and in the last in the cases from like 2003 I think it's a case called gretter versus Bollinger um where they they upheld affirmative action but the majority opinion called uh introduced what they call a sunset provision they were like basically yes we will we find now that diversity is a compelling enough interest to survive strict scrutiny right so let's let me walk this back anywhere in this on in in the Supreme Court anytime an opinion um a law that's being challenged can be found that it made a classification based on race it is subject to what they call a strict scrutiny meaning it has to have the highest most compelling reason outside of race for a while to have this right so in the case of affirmative but and I think this is important right the 14th Amendment literally is there to help black people but just like how hate crimes always sold to us as though they're going to be for our benefit and then they're used against us same way with strict scrutiny being applied to affirmative action to help the white people for the equal protection that's supposed to be there for us but put that aside then Greta versus Bollinger in the early and I think 2003 or 2004 the court said diversity is a compelling enough interest because everybody benefits they were like oh it's not just black people but white people and Asian people and everybody else benefits from being able to be in proximity with different cultures different you know races and ethnicities and so that's why they should have it but they said they wanted a sunset provision where they they conceived that in 20 25 years in 20 years no more racism in 25 years we will have done away with all all that bad and it'll sorted itself out and your girl RBG wrote a concurrence you know um she wrote a she wrote a concurrence and going into you know major detail uh uh you know using international and comparative law to explain why she thinks that you know the sunset provision or she didn't she didn't sign on to the specific 25 years of the sunset provision but what she said is she thinks that she'd have some definite end date in the future so I want to be clear America ain't never been [ __ ] eight 2003 they was they had a 25 they're about in keeping with what they wanted to do even before we had this republican-led Mickey Mouse operation The Good the good justices the good ones had it out for this too so let me tell you something we thought conscious just touched on it just a second ago 40 years from this this affirmative action ruling was around for 45 years 45 years that means that black people have been denied education for longer than we have had access to it in this country period Point Blank period so when you're talking about the the idea the overall idea of this entire thing is that if we remove race-based admissions then everybody is at an equal playing field quote unquote everybody is all Merit but what cannot be overstated is that my race is how I am perceived in the world it affects every part of my life because I move through the world as a black woman this will not change how I am perceived even to admissions committees which remain mostly white at almost every University when you read someone's name why people will code that as as your race when you read someone's personal statement about where they come from their address if they come from an HBC you people will black people especially will continue you to be coded via their applications to these universities they will continue to be denied based upon those simple things of course I mean yeah because let's be clear they're not they're you know what they're they're not getting rid of race being a consideration value of you a person they're not coming they're not coming up with a policy that says never consider someone's race against them to create a colorblind admission which is [ __ ] but that's not what they're saying what they are saying is that we have previously allowed for a positive for us to consider it a positive A diversity a compelling interest the court is recognizing this is a positive to have black people or to have other other um uh people of color or minorities perceived minorities you know um be admitted what we're saying is now none of that positive [ __ ] they're not saying oh you don't get to know that they're black or blah blah blah no no what they're saying is hey we don't like that [ __ ] and if if we had it our way here's here's the thing and and I and I don't want to engage these people's drawing my [ __ ] that they come out with all the all the just blatant racism and coonery to keep you happening around this reality is this America is a racist a racist country period Point Blank That's the End of the T that's been the history that's the rep that's the present day so the country recognized hey because this racist country that enslaved you that subjected you to Jim Crow that subjects you to a prison industrial complex that is racist towards you in every facet will work overtime to ensure you never have these opportunities we would never admit you because we would deny because of your race we use that to keep you out that is why we are saying okay we are we are recognizing that and we are trying theoretically theoretically and I do heavy and theoretically level to play and feel because that's not Realty because the reality is affirmative action is benefiting more white women than anybody [ __ ] else that is just quite frankly what it is so it's not about and and the way like white people and racists and coins alike will pretend that what it means is is that black people who are not qualified or not capable don't believe who or no deserve to be there again no what it means is you believe that innately about all black people we know you believe that and so what we are saying is we are now putting a policy in place to rebut your presumptions but the reality is there are very few of us there are very very few of us in any institution very few of us and we have to be the [ __ ] best to be this and I would say this I'm a person I recognize racism for what it is racism is about dehumanizing us racism is about not recognizing the facts so I don't feel compelled to like oh you I didn't get in school in affirmative action we've all been to school you know and experienced that I just read Eli miss those uh um op-ed about it you know we all experience them perceiving our presence as that but that's what race is going to do anyway that's what race is honest the whole point I think the beef is though is when you're able to have individuals to mobilize the authoritative perspective like Clarence Thomas and be able to take their personal resentment in the way they've been able to individually internalize black inferiority and be able to be the speaking feasts or literally the black person in the room and you can tell that's the type of black person he pretty much been his entire life for me when we talk about representation I find that's to be what I want to make my race my racial illiteracy analysis said a lot of times we think about it in the 1960s let's say it was two percent [ __ ] at Harvard two percent [ __ ] said yeah two percent [ __ ] that I'm saying Dartmouth to Cornell the fact that white people can recognize in 2023 they have to be around ten percent black people in those schools it makes them feel like they've been slighted on the level of representation and to make it feel like you know what my daddy only has to go to school with two percent of you [ __ ] now my classroom got 15 something is wrong and you ain't gonna never see that and that's the craziest part is I'm sure that the numbers are very similar to the two percent absolutely I'm confident that they know 50 for 15 and [ __ ] oh this is really that's the speaker point though yeah yeah exactly all of this and knowledge is everything I'll let you know I'm an epidemiologist they want to all lives matter this um this whole thing it could even how we're talking right now it's almost like when we were like hey black lives matter so let's go ahead and do this it's not enough that we made our own schools because historically you guys have always been challenging us pushing us out making us create our own now I want to get mad at our universities and try to be like well what about this and then create this or take away things that we put in order for us us to be able to be seen at these other universities it's just not fair you want to all lives matter this thing now we're sitting here on this panel telling you are you are you out so mind like this is why we're doing this we got to work six jobs historically we've always had to work six six jobs you took away right historically you've took away our education you didn't even want us to read or write or do anything so now we got to do six jobs to show you that we're more intelligent we're doing all of this and that's still not enough you guys want to be included into everything y'all ain't gotta work as hard as us you ain't got to do as much as us we can't even half of us can't even afford to go to H even hbcus we're work we ought to do all of this stuff it's so much that we got to do to even be included on this educational conversation and it's just white folks wanting to take over it's the supremacy they always walk in Supremacy they will always walk in whiteness what about me well why can't it be this well why can't it do this your reason doesn't you don't the struggles don't match like you were saying Gabrielle the math don't math isn't that I'm not getting the equation I'm not getting there's no solution here what you got to do is take taking things away from us to make it much more harder yeah it's not play on a level representation does not operate on a Level Playing Field representation that's not a level it's not on the living playing field so we'll be able to have legislation that is able to sensationalize the amount of white people that are LED or admitted or given scholarships at black universities and we can acknowledge the very existence of that black universities because black people were excluded from White institutions to me it shows like and when I say this it's not liberalism in terms of bipartisanship it's liberalism in terms of ideology but I believe that conservatives and liberals figured out their Insidious ways of being able to replicate liberalism in a way that always leads to anti-blackness I was able to show that hey even in 2003 when we had to quote unquote good justices there was already some solidarity sympathizing on antibins because it's racism reinforce in racism right because not only like we already know we all know we work we have to work so much harder to be in those rooms and whatever it is and that we we have the any black person I know in a classroom always has the most credentials to dance around the white people there because that's the only way they could be in the room but even let's pretend it even was their world where they come up with this is what they say to us oh America is racist and we'll assume so if you America is racist about letting you all into schools and the admissions process and the educational opportunities so for that reason we we have this policy proposed in order to level that but that would lead the racists who already believe that you're inferior to them to further say you are inferior and don't deserve to be there so we should thus happen the races should have their way and we shouldn't have this policy in place because giving you opportunities would undermine the belief in your capabilities that we already don't [ __ ] believe in ain't that some [ __ ] yeah the real the real racists are the real races don't believe you can do it so we're going to make it harder for you to do it so you can prove them wrong no the thing about white supremacy it's most useful and hardest to uh address tactic is white supremacy renders itself invisible yeah it it makes it impossible to point out its action and what it's doing unless it does unless it kneels on a black man's neck for 10 minutes and then everybody can be like there it is and then we're like hey all right so now that you see this can we can we follow can you follow us back to life the white supremacy is the death but it's not the over policing that put the police there to do it exactly I love that I love the way you phrase that empty it has to render itself invisible because then once we once we as minorities no matter what group it is start bringing up the things that affect us because of our race then it is all now you're using this as a cudgel using your race as a you want special treatment and whatnot regardless of the fact that it affects these things matter it affects how we move through the world so whiteness has to render itself invisible it has to render itself as a default because that is the only way it can straw man its way it can red hair in its way out of accountability that's the thing like see I don't know how much y'all are on Twitter I am smart people so I just have to think I got off Twitter in the last couple of weeks because I got in trouble from a handful of of Anglo leftist folks for uh calling out the uh we'll say conspicuous nature of interracial relationships being overly represented oh and and uh in media the swirl propaganda is probably right and so in in the the response I kept getting from White leftists is this sounds just like something a white supremacist would say or or if a white person said this right if a white person said this it would be blank blank blank and that's the same logic they're using to attack affirmative action because in order for that logic to have any useful like case in in this discussion you have to believe that we're operating from a true place of equality and that my interests 11 playing field and that my interest in seeing black representation that is more realistic and more relevant to the reality that the vast majority of black people experience is special treatment and that's what they want trying to do that's why like I never forget before he died Rush Limbaugh popped up on The Breakfast Club which is the most surreal thing you know what I'm saying and I and I tend not I tend to go easier on The Breakfast Club than other folks um because it's like Breakfast Club interview and I ain't know that person so you know I I don't have no reason Charlemagne listen Charlemagne when you see this bro we are so black this is so black of you hold on let me finish let me finish for you and so for the for and so to their credit they're trying to have a conversation with Rush Limbaugh about racism because Rush Limbaugh I don't know what made he was dying so maybe he was like let me just see him see these [ __ ] um and so and so they're like almost almost there and then Envy or Charlemagne I can't remember who talks about systemic racism and the conversation basically ends because white folks even the most racist white folks they're so excited and happy to point out the racist among them and pillory them and put them out on the cross to say this is what we don't do but as soon as you have try to have a conversation about these system of racism that they only participate in it's like no no I don't want to hear that that's not true that special treatment speaking of them not wanting you to point anything out right you know I put out a video um when this happened on I was like white women need to have a meeting and they do because at the end I was like right if we look at what's happening right uh abortion is a white woman's Flagship issue we know that black people and black and marginalized people will always be disproportionately impacted by anything in America but we know that abortion is a white lady's issue we know how they feel about their abortion right but yeah the majority of y'all the majority of white women white women are the only people who consider themselves a marginalized group and I'm emphasis and consider themselves because you're one of the largest voting largest the most powerful voting blocks in the country and people so anyhow but anyhow they are the only ones and in keeping with such they are the only ones that vote like overwhelmingly Republican everybody else don't vote that way only them voting against what are there and this is perceived interest because we have to have the conversation about whiteness and where they prioritize that over whatever you know gender how um right so I said white women need to have a meeting because at the end of the day y'all voting this way abortion just happened and now affirmative action which in reality benefit to y'all more than anybody else y'all need to talk it on one Accord so of course oh you know when I said I know also RBG that's yours girl but let's go all the way there though I feel like I think that I think that to me the selective outrage on race-based affirmative action it really makes my answers you see what I'm saying in 2020 in 2020 when When Donald Trump had the Platinum Plus plan and he acknowledged disparities in banking he acknowledged disparities in health care he acknowledged disparities in education to me why is that not of him acknowledging affirmative action for white people so yeah I want to give 500 billion dollars to [ __ ] I how is that not me acknowledging that there's a race-based preference in the system of banking that allows for white people to be more likely to get a loan for housing or banking y'all bullshitting me you feel me y'all [ __ ] you you feel like you you feel like you just you given how despite that though I will say that College of course being a microcosm of just Society in itself this is just one policy that emphasizes the anti-blackness then and really exposes how a lot of policies a lot of laws a lot of just legislation in general is in response and in reaction to just blackness in general I mean like why why do you have to get called to the ball align me like before that you didn't have to like I mean like there's so many different instances of which like they were just they don't get me started because every single person I know every black person I know in New York had to to so let me just tell you a little bit about getting admitted to be an attorney right you have to tell them yeah every [ __ ] movie your whole life yeah every goddamn thing right now there's a there's a then you you go through you do this whole packet whatever whatever you send it to the character what do you call it the character and fitness right and they they assess you and by the time they assign you a person to do your interview with or whatever it's supposed to be before you're swearing up in a ceremony you're already fast tracked you're supposed to be approved by then it's like a formality every white person I know it was like a formality white people I know with DUIs and Records it was a three minute for a nap from Ali I had to interview three times because they ended because they they running me down about why I owed Sprint money in college and like regular brochures no I swear I swear to you like just think about who that's gonna impact if they're telling you oh a woman I count on your collection so you can't get admitted what wait okay get your credit report here and it's indicates that you're a [ __ ] yo it was a gatekeeping black lady believe it or not hey the coins I'm not lying to you they're supposed again formality right formality right boom I get there I see that you know the pockets on the desk where it has the Committees like a recommendation and his approval to put through to approval this [ __ ] closed the [ __ ] file close that [ __ ] that and decides wide I owe Sprint money in college why do I own why is my bill with National Grid not paid whatever it is I'm like I'm [ __ ] that's why I'm trying to be a lawyer yeah because it applies to what you're saying right now I do want to Circle back to what you said about white women needing to have a meeting because of what you just said right then they have had that meeting they have had that meeting they have decided together as a unit that being though they do operate a duality of of Womanhood and being able to co-op feminism they have come together and decided that whiteness is too powerful it is too much of a unifying force at contosio economically politically to relinquish it to stand in solidarity with the rest of us but in that same vein what you just said about admissions their time is coming their time is coming because let me say something in the state of California it's already happening one Professor I believe is uh suing USC and a couple other universities out there it was a Forbes article about this two months ago they had everybody talking about it a professor is suing two different universities for um um gender discrimination against men in admissions scholarships so he's trying to get rid of gender scholarships Jordan Peterson did it I want you to know man man have been white men have been taking jobs and having that um so that's that's also RPG's claim to famous intermediate scrutiny for gender-based classifications so trust and believe white man rolled up there a while back um I remember oh I got to break out mine go get in my book on my thing there's a specific case I'm trying to remember what it was they created some law like white men white men have maybe a high Insurance Russia I don't know something they went up they've been went up there talking about all this but I feel like at the core of it it's like hey if I think that your mere presence brings down the value of a space in place we gotta deal with that yeah like like think about it in the black community we know I got to work 10 times it's hard to get to where you at regardless of that being a reality that we know that's been going on for Generation generations for Generations in the white communities to say that hey black people are unqualified and specifically for 45 years there's been a whole bunch of hard-working well way more qualified white folks that's been getting skipped out on for these unqualified ass [ __ ] so when you think about that you put it on the course like AP game like you said credential like in grad school I could dance around them white folks with any dance they want to do I was way more qualified than all the white people I was in class the Consciousness Point real quick because it reminds me of this the [ __ ] yet again and the credit score and the idea of credit is yet again in reaction to Blackness yeah like the important like that wasn't even the case and it goes back to like a more so overarching principle that I had to like really ruminate with while I was in the states after seeing people of my Hue constantly being denigrated in just for existence us people are darker than blue especially in the states I really want to know the same question for Norman had do you want to be black or do you want to be and it's a very difficult quandary that a lot of people have to come across because as hard as it is to be American and as much and like I not to like start no no um diaspora War real quick but like a lot of the times you know yeah but I'm essentially I'm essentially saying that just as white women will will find ways to placate whiteness just for their proximity to it will throw whatever Womanhood their their femininity is second to their whiteness in many ways you have a lot of black people in the States you will not find us of any surprise we're there Blackness is secondary to the american-ness and you know what I find frustrating about that Clarence is one of them yeah I'm just going to say I just want to say and that's cool ones so like let me tell you what I find frustrating about coins and their belief that they have that question to make is that you the thing about Blackness is you don't have a whether or not you're going to be black American you don't have a choice in the views of white people that see white in American and synonymous that's that's the reality that's the reason why every time it's convenient for him clients have no problem invoking race and racism right because that's the team Clarence Clarence is quick too when when Anita Hill accusations all of a sudden he really was lynching right it's a high-tech Lynch and he black he remember racial identity when [ __ ] like that happened right and what I find interesting let me tell you this is the problem with with cool like cornering and internalized anti-blackness and wanted to be in proximity a whiteness right and just wanted white approval and hating oneself and it makes you blame your community for stuff that logically you know don't make sense don't make no [ __ ] sense Clarence will talk to Lee blue in the [ __ ] face about how affirmative action tainted his yay Legacy blah blah blah blah blah because all the racist that they don't even refuse to acknowledge his racists are the ones that believe he was there for that and don't deserve to [ __ ] be there but that has not stopped him from having his Republican billionaire sugar daddy Holland Crow donate over a hundred [ __ ] thousand dollars to Yale to make [ __ ] he didn't push back on that I'll push back on that because you said that there is there is no choice in that regard the essence of tokenism is that choice that that foreign said between being black or being American tokens who are typically the people who are it like that woman you described who are pulling up the ladder that they themselves ascended to get to that space to be the only one in that space that is the essence of it but the functionality of tokenism because that's not the latter in their mind that because there's a difference in deeply in the spirit of what is a token and what is a coin because I'm sure many if we learned Negroes have been the token in a room to black people to in a room full of white spaces I'm sure we all have I'm confident I know every single one of us with a platform is that to several thousand white people resentment is every black person Derek Bell talks about this and faces at the bottom of the well when he talks about rules of racial standing and every single black person is presented with the opportunity to [ __ ] or legitimize anti-anti-blackness by repeating white talking points we all have it what the Coon's problem is is not that they want to pull up the ladder because they don't perceive us as being on the same ladder their problem is that you're not playing the video I want to hear you out but then I want to respond go ahead the functionality of it is absolutely the awareness that you have to shut that [ __ ] door behind you for anybody else as a [ __ ] as a token and that goes hand in hand I do believe there is a functional awareness of that of shutting that door behind you to any other black person any other minority who's coming after you so you can remain the only one in that space that is the white supremacist functionality of tokenism of coonan but when it comes to affirmative action though and specific and when it comes to Clarence Thomas understanding of affirmative action and if we really keep it G real about this is like we say affirmative action is only in rhetoric what listen and they're very interested in the appearances and their parents are rolling back all these things and whatever perceived as wins to us but affirmative action has never been an application something that has done a [ __ ] thing Venice and we all know to be in the room you got to be the most decorated [ __ ] around they're not just letting they're understanding what they think that is is to be that so the reality is Clarence Thomas is not even trying to his world at a ladder that's pulled up are for unfortunately are for the learning Negroes let's be honest like the [ __ ] like us like I'm still gonna get into school I got in every way you know what I mean my children are gonna get into school your children get into school y'all went to school we are not who they're talking about so he's not even concerned about pulling up the ladder underneath for those that followed the path he knows they're [ __ ] good yeah it's much it's it's there so I think it's a both and uh to kind of like try to marry her um I think I think to try to marry uh Olay and Gabrielle's um points it depends on what position the [ __ ] token is in um I'm gonna go with the coonover token because I think I agree with the fact we've all yes seiku makes I want people to respond to what I'm saying and not going into your Lexicon and your [ __ ] ass speaking points so I'ma call you a white supremacist sympathizer or anti-black apologist and force you to respond to what I just said instead of whatever you rehearsed about while who Uncle Tom really is or how cool is you know what [ __ ] you I don't hear about that [ __ ] you you are being a sympathizer of white supremacist respond and to me I think that that is kind of the the the the the the great thing that a lot of black Republicans and black countries have been able to do been able to take the very sentiments that people say on the surface level and say you want to accept people for being people hey conscious you call yourself an ally of the the trans people but you don't want to let me be conservative yeah I hate that argument so much FD thinks everybody he disagrees with is anti-black races and it's like oh man so this is what it is right I feel like there's a lot of layers to this and one of those layers is white guilt that to me is equal to our allies right and um not with all of our allies but white guilt is how they come into these spaces especially when a lot of these um well we we have a lot of uh officers killing people or when those when that outrageous is happening it's very selective for them right in that season they'll go go look for a platform to follow they'll be in the comment section like oh my goodness what can I do how can I and as soon as that dies down they're trying to make suggestions on how you can be better who you need to bring on how you need to be more black what you need to do to include all of them yes like I want to be included in Juneteenth how can I be included go to work don't talk something in my cash out okay like just don't don't all of it yeah so this is how I feel about it all of that and and and you know and but in retrospect too when you look at it these people especially and I don't know if they I want to say they mean it but they don't mean it but I don't know I can't speak for white folks so I'm like talk to yourself have your meetings but it's like when you go onto these platforms and you're a part of these platforms they even the white folks Can't Stop functioning in their whiteness it will never be like it will never be where they can just take it off it's almost like okay Olay for a second and it's like okay Rebecca Rebecca I hear you but and especially me being a black being a black woman in the space um and then like sometimes I love my producer he knows I love him sometimes I gotta be like hey that wasn't okay he's a white guy hey that wasn't don't don't do that because he wouldn't talk to the other people here like that but there are sometimes it comes off just straight whiteness and I need you to simmer that down when you're speaking to me all right tone the whiteness down when you talking to me one thing I want to give uh shout out to I may have said this the last video and I've said it some other time shout out to um Hank Green YouTube OG uh dealing with cancer yeah dealing with cancer right now um he said one he said in my way back in the break the first break bread he said some of the realest [ __ ] about white people that I've I've ever heard and this is why like I wish white people would spend more time talking to each other about have those meetings as you said he was like the thing that I've realized being in these like white liberal spaces is a lot of white people they're not looking to solve the issues of racism they're looking to render its effect um they're really looking to create a situation where they don't have to think about it yeah and for some of them for for a select few shout out to these select few that means being anti-racist and for others it means censoring themselves or censuring censoring black people whenever the issue becomes too hot for them to deal with in the moment they just want to not be able to think about it and so yeah when it's you know when it's normal racist stuff they cannot think about that's why I always say I'm of the mind that uh Ron DeSantis could beat Joe Biden before Donald Trump can the only reason Donald Trump lost was because he was too obviously racist and the white folks in the suburbs couldn't bring themselves to vote for that but Ron DeSantis is much more um low-key much more Insidious racism is way more dangerous and they will vote for him behind closed doors exactly if if Trump were to not beat the scientist in the primary he's designed this will be Biden and I I feel very confident in that yeah I hate using them as the as the as the the list though because they're both I hate his name is what this has because that's kind of the conversation that's Brewing online right now I hate using either one of his lips let me say something even the wokest white person you know the most left is what are not willing to sacrifice any personal relationships any familiar relationships any kind of they're not really really willing to put any true skin in the game in terms of having those conversations that FD is talking about about holding people to the fire about racism the wokest white person you know the woke is one like the most tangle dashiki wear white guy somewhere is not willing to do that so regardless that casual racism is is to me as equal as what DeSantis and Trump both got going on and that's what I appreciated by afro pessimism when I was in college because it showed me how it was something real sexy and real attractive to how anti-blackness work it'll make you what people always already bind to the fungibility of black people or you are already thinking about how can you Flinch and make it wear whatever black flesh is being [ __ ] over they ain't got nothing to do with you so you can Center yourself and make it where that's not me though you know what I'm saying well I think of my favorite meme one of my favorite memes you know what I'm saying is is a is a Paul Mooney he's a picture of Paul Mooney and and the meme says white people do not want to be blamed for their ancestors actions but they sure as hell want to hold on to what their ancestors left for them in fact when I think about that that's really how whiteness and the white identity operate is being able to disidentify empathetically sympathetically financially anything so um take the profits lead the dead right here is a beautifying nature of anti-blackness consciously that is the unifying nature of anti-blackness because and that's also why it's inextricable from capitalism I love that you brought up the economic aspect of it because for capitalism to continue to going on there has to be a permanent underclass so if every everybody can unify around anti-blackness you keep a permanent underclass and you keep those social economic tables moving upward and away from black people who have historically always been the permanent underclass yeah but and then talking about that uh Asian business that's in the black in Asian business in the black and community and we think about how policy not some uh uh pro-black pseudo uh I watched tanik Rasheed and I'm on some Hidden Colors [ __ ] no no I did some research showed I did the policy and was able to show Hey listen in the 1963 Civil Rights Act then we had the open Immigration Act of 64. then we literally had where we had the the American government Outlaw any Chinese I'm saying here coming into the country then the Korean government is able to say hey but in order for you to sit in here out this country a guy you made by one of us first suddenly see 40 years later 50 years later what the impact is that and it's like okay if we want to have a black owned business that wants to do nail hairs we have to deal with that business right there and we get to see now in terms of coming back on Full Circle so the same way that you're able to use policy to be able to give you these economic um send access to my community is the same system you were able to go and complain and say hey because these [ __ ] is getting into this place right here me as a well-meaning Asian there's way more qualified for them [ __ ] they taking something for me and you know what I think is so funny and it was so unfortunate about anti-blockness right because there many many Asian people many Asian people that get it right that are not that are not racist or are not that recognized they do not appreciate you ain't you leaning into these um um what is it the the uh the the minority the myth of the modern minority and I was like wow this is stereotypes they really have like the the select time few of Asian people that want to live by this stereotype explaining how a stereotype about us is the reason why that a system should be a way in order to benefit a stereotype about them and I'm like this is [ __ ] no I'm like and you know what I think is so crazy about the level of privilege in it like why anti-blackness will always be what it comes down to it because it's this idea why does everybody but black people get to believe in ownership and why does everybody else feel entitled and like they own and everything belongs to them beforehand but we are not allowed to feel entitled or like we own the [ __ ] we're special in every case we get into it if you do own and if you do succeed it's just got a little lucky you know something special you should be so you should be so [ __ ] grateful I always think that's interesting right because in the case of them right you're going with this model minority stereotype right I'm like I'm a [ __ ] decorated academic Google me I got into everything law schools I got in every [ __ ] way I grad graduated with triple honors I dance circles around every [ __ ] body and they will still every affirmative action every blah blah you don't hear me but I don't get to feel like and I don't feel like by the way I applied to Georgetown I did not expect to get I did not expect to get in that was my chopped school or whatever and I got in and I was so shocked and I immediately in the same breath that I got it oh it is so great oh my God I got and I know I wasn't going there because I could pay for [ __ ] that right but I didn't feel there was no part of me I've never felt you felt validated and I wouldn't have but I wouldn't have felt if I didn't get in I'm not like what the [ __ ] every school that didn't give me a full scholarship and others said I didn't feel like oh they oh they owed me of this I'm like be for [ __ ] real life that is a certain level of privilege and entitlement and how you view the world because you don't see you truly don't see anybody else like are you living in this world like you have A's you think oh you have a g you think there's nobody else but you know what makes you competitive nobody else in this world turning up in the classroom like that's what they really think it's me I think to me I feel like to to hit home on this anti-black analysis and the fungibility of Blackness and black people uh the military academy exception in the affirmative action to me was very telling um to me it says that uh diversity and the way that we can include black bodies in the spaces can never be good unless the institution of America benefits first and foremost the [ __ ] got to benefit less so if you're trying to experience your upper mobility and get you a couple degrees for you and your community [ __ ] that [ __ ] you trying to take stuff for somebody in the military Navy the Air Force ah we looking for the increase of diversity and we were not only looking for we will yeah it doesn't matter let's take a look at um our own White House right when we we have where um Kamala Harris right who's the vice president she's our black representation um in the White House at this moment and um when I'm talking about George Floyd Brianna all of that was hot okay it was brand new these streets okay and what happened was you know covet was at the same time we were all dealing with this and we understand that a lot of Asian hate was happening we understand it was an influx we started to see more of you know Asians getting beat up or attacked or um blamed for bringing covet here um and that was all due to uh the previous administration Donald Trump so they instantly recognize as we were screaming out in the streets that black lives matter as we were protesting amongst kovid um as we were getting shot with rubber bullets um as we were getting shot down by anti-black people who blamed everything on black lives matter um all of that was going on that Administration sat there and Kamala Harris herself who was our black representation said I do not think that America is racist and then turned around and then she turned around and said and created and signed and sat there an anti-uh uh hate for Asians um bill or something I'm glad you brought this up yeah that's that's a great example because you know the even the people who are supposed to represent us in some way shape or form even them they'll sit there and and they have to walk in some kind of lightness or something close to it in order to like well let's keep it to know that's what I was about to say let's keep a g-real right so let's go through the because I think kamala's presence there illustrates several points I think it illustrates one what conscious was saying right the willingness they'll make this military carve out or whatever because now you're serving it Kamala is not there because black people like her in fact Kamala was chosen to be there right after black people demonstrated on wax that we don't she decided she decided she was going to run for president we said no you're a cop go sit down you're a [ __ ] prosecutor ass locking people up and that is the reason because she is a oh that's a whale black woman like right prosecutor lock [ __ ] up because she serves the state's agenda that is why karma is there right but to shoot another point though let's talk about it because Kamala is way more of a of a decorated lawyer and academic than [ __ ] Joe Biden let's talk about something they talking about affirmative action right let's talk about it is Joe Biden was at the bottom of the class failed the bar and was a public defender for two seconds so [ __ ] law school class and decorated in every [ __ ] kind of way for her to be on the Supreme Court and for her to be chosen by that mediocre white man but Joe Biden has only ever been mediocre only ever the only reason Joe Biden is President is because of Donald [ __ ] Trump and because we didn't know what to do when he gave up White America some familiarity from the from the from the Obama days and obiden and Obama has got himself as a moderate so let's keep a g real Joe Biden has tried to run for president a million and 60 [ __ ] times and he'll never go nowhere he is mediocre he's only ever been remarkably mediocre but that mediocre white man is the president of the United States of America to be in a position to choose a much more impressive black woman for a lower position that everybody questioned her deserving this up when is the holder when is the last time the the president hasn't aside from Obama when's the last time the president has been like truly talented you know what I'll I'm gonna I'm I'm gonna have to tip my hat to my to my to my crime Bill brother saxophone plan oh [ __ ] Clinton was mediocre too though I mean you know what I'm saying like people getting people yeah right but the the way that Bill Clinton was sold to me in terms of his upbringing and what he did it's like hey this white man from Arkansas his mama was a it was another mediocre Bill Clinton is Joe Biden is a CVS brand Rite Aid brand Clinton that's what he want to be let's keep it G real all right Clinton is a mediocre Joe Biden is better than I think I think Joe Biden Mo decorated than George Bush himself Bill Clinton was known for running around um the campus pulling [ __ ] walking them to their dorms Hillary let's keep it real Hillary is the one who always had the ambition and wanted to be there she's like hey [ __ ] I got a plan let me come get it come get on the winning real life Hillary is the one like her or not real life no literally no that's literally it Melly realizing it was easier to package fits but that's what Bill Clinton is and I will say I'll give him this Bill Clinton has some great speeches these I would I will always respect a good order I thought he was in his bag with his speeches he was given in the Monica Lewinsky stuff who came before Reagan was that Carter [ __ ] around Nixon might have been the last well-qualified president damn y'all going way too far but like for real in terms of like I'm just saying like so you're gonna get away how do you remember we're getting away from we're getting away from like the actual politics yeah but just like to bring it back to affirmative action what's the point I'm trying to make mediocre [ __ ] get [ __ ] media yeah that's that's my point that's the like the perfect case the case study the perfect case proof of case what is it case something perfect proof of whatever there's a phrase there I can't remember what it is for why affirmative action should be a thing is the fact that the last eight nine presidents have all been mediocre in every facet of their like existence except for Obama right you have to go back to Richard Nixon who was I think the last person that was an accomplished that was a high level student the problem is an accomplished person if you get to control the story and you get to decide what is great and what is Elite they never conceive of themselves as mediocre as mid they always can see they they perceive themselves as truly innately divinely special and deserving and that's their spots and these are their institutions and they are they are they are putting it onto was a favor like they are Grand you should be you're welcome this thing that you innately because this is their country you know I feel like we'd be on the anniversary of July 4th right the way that they see it we know what they celebrate when they talk about independence and freedom and who and blah blah blah and whose country who was free who runs this they perceived this as all of the [ __ ] is theirs if all of this [ __ ] is mine you should be so [ __ ] lucky and give you any [ __ ] thing and if I perceive you to be I don't give a [ __ ] if there's three of y'all in a body of ten thousand that's three [ __ ] too many because I truly believe that all 10 000 spots deserve to be occupied by white people because innately I am divinely more talented and qualified and special than your black ass than you and that's how Carter operated because I better listen that's how President Carter are you and Jimmy Carter yeah like that's one thing that in particular makes me mad about any political science is worth his worth will actually talk about how Jim Carter is one of the most upsetting things about American presidentialism because he yeah political Talent if you look at Henry fairley's political time he had it the only better one than him would have been hot my [ __ ] Gandhi but guess what this man this man is one of the most upsetting he he chose to be mid I always it's not particularly kind to him just because of um the things that he advocated for being you know you know his environment I love himself and all these different things and yada yada I feel like that's why they'd be dragging him yeah I always forget that's why they're doing probably about we're probably about 10 years out from Trump getting the same treatment that the bushes are getting now because George Bush being able to be this cut Leon sweet white man well if he came in a real conversation we want to talk about who I think are very like very fundamental in that that propaganda switching is the Obamas at the speech [ __ ] she's in drag for that but my mama liked that [ __ ] yeah something rambling to bring good because we ain't brought it up yet there is a intimate relationship behind how we were able to turn over I mean overrule affirmative action and overrule the uh matter of fact and I've seen you talk about it uh yeah the the the student loan forgiveness and thinking about how the increase of black participation in higher education also led to the more uh subsidized and unsubsidized loans that we was getting so for me it's like okay if you have overruled these race-based admissions [ __ ] overrule these old race bases as long as you gave me you know what I'm saying especially my student loan debt I mean don't return that and let's not forget and then I think that that the student loan was day one um affirmative action was day two and then the next day was uh uh clear discrimination yeah um it's basically legal here oh yeah I think the faction was first then student loans then the gay uh uh the information you know I listen they've really been on a bag with some evil [ __ ] so much I even I almost forgot that's right I I definitely you're [ __ ] right and let's let I like I don't think I don't think the destroy I do not think the Twitter limit on sharing and seeing information is a coincidence with that I don't think it's a coincidence a [ __ ] civil liberty librarianist that bought the app to keep their videos like oh hey this app that you're supposed to use they're gonna limit you can't see nothing I don't want you can't okay nobody's gonna see your stuff I don't even tweet like that but I go on there to see the conversations you know I'm nosy so I wanna I wanna I wanna read the threads but yes you're right back to back these things are happening they're people a lot of people are being stripped they're hurting us a lot of the movement that we have that's supposed to be considered forward which is like literally just a little toe tap in in in the right direction but they're taking that away from us so where where are we gonna how are we starting what are we gonna do what how are we supposed to keep riding in the streets they want us to keep coming out here just being crazy and burning [ __ ] and just like seriously they want that from us they do to being down is helping Biden though because let me tell you something he's starting to spiral that that media clip circulating going viral and whatnot of a reporter asking him about how he felt about essentially providing quote unquote false hope to millions of Americans suffering under student that he you know shouted at him oh Republicans and I didn't do anything all the Twitter being down is helping him in that regard but don't get me started on student debt because that also attracts back to the mindset around affirmative action because you cannot say that black people occupying these faces are all just being given handouts and all just being you know they're special and whatnot when we can't and aren't deserving of their positions okay or being given special treatment being able to go to school for free because and then and then at the same time ignore the fact that we carry the majority of student debt it is a prominent myth in fact I had a viral tweet uh last week about it it's a prominent myth and I've heard it said to my face before a lot of white people believe that black people go to school for free in this country you hear that a lot we hear that a lot in the South the same thing about Native American students as well they believe they believe that hbcus are Havens for black people to be able to go to school for free I think I've heard all my life I need us to understand that white people racist and specific let me be clear because you know I don't need y'all to come to me not me eat I get it uh races are quite literally invested in making you believe that they have a a non-race-based reason for why they believe they move away towards you why they conduct themselves this way listen to me and listen to me good there's no [ __ ] way white people in any large number truly believe that [ __ ] are going to school for free they wouldn't allow it are you [ __ ] crazy about the thoughts that two of us are in class nah but that's the to me that I think that the two things you know I like buzzwords so the two things I've been keep on repeating for the last couple days is legal illiteracy and racial illiteracy you don't know how the law work you don't know how race works so you're just making a whole bunch of wild ass claims the wildest [ __ ] though is that the concept of affirmative action is based on the fact that the government has done this [ __ ] for white people the whole time yeah you know going back to the to the 1900s um uh not nice but like the earliest night early 19th century one thing um shout out to uh Pasco Robert because always [ __ ] up his name um at this revolution podcast put me on this book talking about the Italian the growth of Italian Americans and how Italian Americans like all that Mafia [ __ ] was because like they was they were Hood when they got here because they were being discriminated against because they were too close to [ __ ] according to white people at the time um yeah and so Italian Americans were getting uh were communities were as bad as any black community you can think of now at the time and then the government started giving them money yeah and started a representation baby you don't know it is but in this line you are white yeah we gonna work this out for y'all and so they got all these stop programs for decades the Irish the same thing like pretty much every white population has benefited from government um investment um at some point in time over you know hundreds of years ago while we were still asking for just the right to not die in the street right and uh and that was that was something that King talked about like the video the clip I put in the conservative video the first one that I love the most is King in his bag and what I'm assuming is a black church when he's like we're coming to Washington DC to get our check because he's like yo you gave this [ __ ] to everybody else already that didn't go through what we went through so y'all [ __ ] owe us based off that alone yeah but that speaks to I mean I just love what concerts I gotta go back to it it speaks to what consciously was saying about like the social economic impact of anti-blackness there's a book um it's called Uh working towards whiteness and this means just what you were saying FD I think Italians were not really considered white until roughly like the 1950s 1960s around that area and whatnot because just like many other immigrant groups who came here as time went on it became more politically expedient to have them included in whiteness even if you look at like U.S census rates and whatnot in terms of how race is classified that changes roughly every 10 years or so how people are classified and whatnot it changes because it's a point whiteness is a functionality it's a tool these things are not real but they have real world consequences and so when it became and then I always tell people especially in the conversations that we're all having in terms of um the labor unions and whatnot the South used to be a union stronghold until segregation happened and they saw that whites were unifying where blacks in order to be able to get their laborers to be able to get you know a quality living and good um working hours and whatnot and then they said you know what you want to be unified with these [ __ ] I mean you want them around your daughters that's you all on that give you some money right we'll chat we'll take care of y'all but Chill on all that with that with the news that's the whole that's the whole purpose of whiteness as a construct within capitalism right because the idea is wipe it is to white people's benefits it is the white people's benefit but especially working class white people to be in solidarity with us the policies and the things that we want they are suffering under the same system as us but if you live in a country that then says Ah don't focus on that [ __ ] all that capitalism in a way let's talk about whiteness and privilege and convinces them that what's actually happening is your rights and the things that you should have and the reason why you're in poverty and why you're struggling working class white man is that these black people and these these minorities are taking from you and then they focus it there so yeah that's the vested interest it'd be the ones from like literally like when we see DeSantis come out right the standards has taken a whole bunch of things that's affecting y'all too um out there in Florida right I'm from Florida so I know but it be the ones that live in West of nowhere foxville and they literally no teeth no insurance nothing just ain't nothing to the front toothless they can't even ain't got can't even afford the internet don't get nothing not just can't afford internet because I'm in Georgia now I remember that with Stacy Abrams and they haven't even bothered to build access to energy living communities that are being just like um these other communities where uh uh uh they make internet like a accessible for a lot of the kids and and here's the thing like we know what's a problem the internet is a damn utility y'all issues is back there y'all living in Backwoods ain't got no kind of y'all still using them little TV with the Turners on it but y'all out here saying that black folks is taken away from you because Ron DeSantis said that and you see what I'm saying like we all in the same issues but because whiteness is what it is like you said people will function in whiteness they make it a Supremacy they make it Supreme uh you know and if they look at black people they no matter what state they're in like ain't got no home ain't not no roof but they're looking at you and being like you are inferior to me at least I'm not a [ __ ] yeah I gotta I gotta run because I gotta jump on with somebody else in a second but um I never forget the scene from uh [ __ ] uh California governor Newsom getting on the uh Fox News dude head about conservative States in uh liberal states in the economic you know what I'm saying uh visions of these states people saying so so uh you you take Mississippi's economic you know what I'm saying uh what you call over Californians and when I say he got it I'm gonna find a clip and post it when I tell y'all this man got in their ass and for me it made me think about all the various ways as a southerner I've been indoctrinated think about you Northern Yankees and how y'all live yes talk about it like hey we have a cheaper living down here because we better this than the other but now I learned now it's like no we have a cheaper living down here because you suck at building economic infrastructure we have a cheaper living there is because you [ __ ] you getting paid and pimped out about them lobbyists bottom interest groups and bottom bureaucracies you know what I'm saying you don't tell me that part you mean to listen All That Old socialism [ __ ] you talk about getting out of living on the state living on a good man the red States live on government assistance way more States and living off the blue States yo stay so poorly ran as soon as a hurricane don't talk they don't hit that [ __ ] you know we don't call Federal New Jersey because you know I got to speak on it for Louisiana one thing about it just what you said I'm born and raised in the South College from Texas I'm born and raised in Louisiana I'm born and raised here 61 of babies born to say Louisiana are born under Medicaid 61 we are one we are I think we duke it out every other year with Mississippi over who is the poorest state and let me tell you something it's so easy going back to what Rebecca said it's so easy to put rule rule white people as the face of racism because it makes you feel like okay well that's just those those people down there in the South and so that's those red State people it's not really a problem out here and whatnot sometimes we have to really interrogate they're poor anyway so who cares nobody's gonna really interrogate that no I was the only black girl in my epidemiology program at Tulane University School of Public medicine I think it had like a 10 acceptance rate the last time I checked I was the only black girl in that program and I have seen too much from rich white boys who feel as though having anybody who doesn't look like them in a space is something being stolen from their people who feel is the who feel the same way those rural rednecks feel about black folks it's too it's a unifying factor it's just that rural white people are the face of it so DeSantis knows what he's doing appealing to the base but he also he also knows exactly who the entirety of who he is talking to they're not the only they're just the rule of white focus is more likely to publicly espouse it but the Sanchez knows who he's talking to we have us down here in the South we peep that [ __ ] because we inherited this battle from our parents our grandparents we know the dog whistles too we know who you talking to we know who you talking to we know what you saying we hear that [ __ ] in the South we're not dumb that hey we know what the [ __ ] you doing anything in reality yeah just helped me it was Mississippi Burning yeah it's Gary Oldman talking about his father the the this more of this story was that he had done something horrible and the whole point was I may be poor whatever all these horrible things but at least I'm not a naked and if a [ __ ] is higher than me then then I can't stand that and something has to be done about it and that tracks throughout so much of like the problems of America and explicit the problems of white people because um I was talking to I'm working on this prison uh video and I talked to a homeboy a very radical brother named two black from the black Power Media Network he was talking about he doesn't like how people talk about prison and slavery because 65 70 of all prisoners are white men and like that that just doesn't job with him but it speaks to the way that I don't know if it was you Olay or somebody said white people don't care about other white people they care about whitelists that was me okay and like that's such a powerful like thing to consider and why they need to start having their meetings because we may be shouting the loudest about it we may be getting the most um coins off or or getting the most uh tweets off about the [ __ ] but at the end of the day everything we're arguing and fighting about is affecting the majority of white people way at a much higher number not more proportionally but like the raw numbers of this [ __ ] the raw numbers of people suffering under these systems are middle to lower middle to impoverished white Americans and they are busy fighting us fighting women in general fighting queer people fighting immigrants they fighting everybody but they [ __ ] Rich uncles and it needs to stop and I think that's the problem with teaching people I don't I think that's the problem with teaching people to to not to despise the system but to despise their place in the system like everybody is constantly trying to replicate they love they Revere these systems they love capitalism they love this they love all these different things but they have a problem with it is where they're at in it right you see these people you know the handful of Asians they're using to push this model minority myth right their problem is not an in systemic uh uh institutional disadvantage their problem is not any other problem is the idea that any idea that black people could be where they're at because they recognize a hierarchy where whiteness is at the top and they're trying to be in proximity to whiteness so any like every any level of inference of being a black people be in Hell God forbid in your perceived mind above you in some way is a disrespect the way you get but the problem is they're not challenging the system and I think that's also the second part is the problem with always teaching we have to stop teaching white people and non-black people and and people who are supposedly to be our allies that they're doing us a favor I think we need to Dad allyship like the idea because it leads them to believe that they are being altruistic good people and going out of their way to support something out of the goodness out of their heart because they care about you they're so good to care about you as opposed to caring about themselves I'd rather people just lean into selfish rhetoric and say actually no no this system harms you you're being [ __ ] too and so you should be out here because it's for you not because you're doing it for me not because I need to convince you to be good but that speaks to the greater issue about the narrative around racism around anti-blackness because the general belief even after everything we've experienced from like what 2015 with uh to now even after George Floyd is that racism is something that is simply just a mindset a difference of beliefs a a personal feeling about black people or people of color and that is something that affects you at the individual level and you need to work on that and you need to be more learning as opposed to what it actually is which is a systematic dehumanization of a group of people for socioeconomic gain and profit yeah until you until you interrogate that then the Compton what you just mentioned cannot change because yeah if they believe that racism is something that just affects the individual okay well I don't feel hatred toward this person or what I don't feel I don't have any hatred hateful feelings or whatever then I'm not racist that's not what this is yeah and that's why they can't meaningfully interrogate what is going on and why they feel the way that they do and it's not but also at the same time it's not a it's not I don't like to lean on ignorance this is not these people the same numbers that we do in fact last month there was a viral article a young student young Asian student 18 years old applied to of course this basic Ivy League schools and um one of the schools he applied to was Berkeley Berkeley is 30 Asian so you're probably just a loser that you didn't get that you didn't get in there but here you are on TV blaming black people who are probably at least they're like 1.2 of that University it's easier but it's a black person's fault that you didn't get in now you on TV being given a nationwide platform because about why you didn't get into birth you know why because in a society in a white supremacist society that prioritizes or that centers and that celebrates whiteness as the default whiteness is what is great they will not even entertain you suggesting that the 60 of white people there that any white person is undeserving of the spot but they will jump at you saying it about black people and ultimately what you truly care about is unseating somebody you know what I mean in your mind yeah okay what do you think this is like what do you think this is like first of all in any in any school that you apply to what in-state students are going to get preference uh um Legacy students are going to get preference there's a certain amount of money allotted for athletes to be able to come and they're going to be on scholarship like there's so many other things that go into that like what employees uh uh Legacy kids and donuts it's like I think that that makes up well more than black population and motion and most of these D1 universities especially the ivy league so it's like a young lady gave five million dollars and your ass got a 2.5 GPA and you have horrible scores SAT but it don't matter because data gave how many million oh you get the building after you ain't get to get into the school okay your mama been working here for 40 years you feel what I'm saying she's been a a a d student your entire life but you get to get in here because hey your mama you know what I'm saying [ __ ] work over here in the English Department uh when you ah [ __ ] before you was even born you know what I'm saying your great great granddaddy was already on there you know I'm Sam with dean's list so you was already on the missions list for you even was born so so you think about it and yeah 30 and yeah and yet they don't and I think that goes back to what I've been saying from the jump like what this is truly about is what they see in terms of ownership and deserving this and being innately entitled and belonging to them because they would not see that as them getting something they don't deserve again because in their mind it's mine it's mine it's ours it's for us you know what I mean it's not about this Merit and all these other things that they come up with these metric systems when they want to criticize because they don't care about that because I don't know I can't tell you how many times I've had a white person I go to school with that I outperform in every way shape or form suggests that I'm there because of affirmative action and you know and it's like you think to yourself how could you think that when they had a staff because they don't give a [ __ ] because at the end of the day what they're saying is this is for me this is for us this is all country these are all schools these are institutions this is our lord it's not coming that's what they make it clear just the fact alone that we black people yeah they have an entire lgbtq Community everybody right now is getting their rights ruled by because what they're telling us what they're trying to tell us repeatedly on waxes this is all [ __ ] this is ours anything we give if you consider it alone [ __ ] and we can't even even if it's not even theirs they're gonna they're always gonna claim it it's not their issues it's not their struggle it's not none of it they will still claim it and that's why they can capitalize off of you see what we're talking about right now you'll look at another platform and it's all white people having the the same talking points and they will flourish you will see that more in the algorithms you'll see that where they're get they're get paid to literally say exactly what we're saying they watch how we move they will watch and stuff like exactly what we say typically and yeah without no flavor yeah the water down 1 16 version of it that doesn't offend them personally yeah but they yeah that's true too but they will literally say these things and be like you know and happy talking points and be like you know black people deserve and then they'll listen to us and like this and this and this and this and this and this and all the white people be like they'll do you one worse they'll do you one worse they'll steal the the white liberals or whatever the white land whatever they'll steal you know a handful of the talking points from us and then they'll bring on a cone to the show for the cool one to be saying and legitimizing all the anti-blackness and all the questions [Applause] and they do that on purpose because if we have somebody black this is my black friend and my black friend said it because I couldn't say it so and the audience is like that's why I like hear the here we go that black person is different yes that black person it's that one black person in the group he's not like the restrooms racial standing there well right back to it and I and I want to very quickly just like mention the point as this all goes back because yet again from the outside looking in because despite me being born in New York I I can't claim nothing over there um and the fact being you go back to John Locke like I want to draw the line in the sun very much it's a very American core Centric and I mean like if you go back to your unlock life liberty and the pursuit of property and let's like let's like not change it let's not um equivocate with what they actually mean and yet again going right back to a black folks were brought there rendered from there rendered from their actual tribes and brought there by no means were they citizens and yet again like when we talk about like everybody's rights being rolled back it's being it's literally they've told you this make America great again and when we were talking about if you go back to the founding fathers initial um discourses Blackness was not at the table it was never supposed to be in the plan this in the the even the exercise of debating it and this goes back to the afro pessimism can sometimes be an actin in futility because like your your acting as though like there's some recall some redress even King somewhat optimistic to think that you can hold people to a law that never really existed for you and for it Tony Morrison backs you up in that regard Tony Morrison said the same thing she said that in its Essence racism is a distraction it requires you to continue to justify your reason for being and continue to argue in circles about what it is like why you are here on this Earth and what it is your purpose to do and that's what Tony Morrison said and I believe that Kimberly Crenshaw also backs it as well when we talk about how the uh uh uh Plessy versus Ferguson as well as the Brown versus Board of Education how when we reading it how the the way that race is coded within the law is one that is always based on racial literacy how are we talking about but place it was placing Vice Ferguson was trying to Define what it meant to be black and we see the course yes didn't have the capacity to understand that [ __ ] we see that in 1950s when the born versus Board education go they said it not had the capacity to understand how to define race and that's what we're beginning at and I felt like that right there set the precedent to make it where it's always going to be a slippery slope and a question of interpretation on how we're able to define race who gets to be race and what it means to be black and who gets to Define what it means to be black and I think that that's always what happens when it comes to policy and legislation about black people because you think I'm saying yeah showed me in the Constitution where the word race is there I I think you racially obsessed Negroes just talk about race there is nowhere to 15 minutes it talks about race hey hey I bet you you can't tell me the Constitution is racist it doesn't even talk about race they have my [ __ ] nerves on that one this has been very blocked yes thank you thank you my learner honestly I feel like we can Rican rap thank you my learn it learn to D girls well imagine this man still I literally go say let me wrap it up for him since he's leaving and oh baby he's he's Caribbean you gotta go you gotta announce listen on my time see ya the man still does something before I can say I can't believe it look I wasn't even shocked I knew he was leaving when he said that oh they're not random like it's not random black people from the street on my show these are black people who feel like got that on my show and come together millions of followers bases platforms right but in his mind a black celebrity is equivalent to a no one white person you're gonna say like that's the same level of importance of Worth right like you see that and he still think
