    "text": "I'm your cliché Asian American, and I really learned something from this video. Thanks.\n\nI grew up entrenched in Chinese culture---the food, the artistic language, the poems, hearing about my parents' struggles with the Gaokao and immigrating to the U. S. So when my loved ones told me Affirmative Action was racist towards Asians, I hated it too. But I wanted to hear what Black people thought. And I'm not completely convinced, but this video raises great points---\"When you're accustomed to privelege, equality feels like oppression\" is especially true, when the 2% becomes 10%.\n\nOver 60% of my school is Asian, but the teachers are the most lib-left people possible. So at school, we write essays on systematic oppression to appease teachers and get an A, but at home everyone believes the opposite. So I hated school for what felt like censorship, and I was more partial to my parents. But this discussion helps me understand that while my Chinese parents are fighting against you guys, you're fighting against white people. The comparison of \"all lives matter\" to removing AA was a great point about how AA sheds light on ignored struggles. It's an interesting new perspective for me.\n\nEvery other video quotes famous peoples' thoughts, but never the ordinary community. So thanks for providing this insight into how some of the Black community feels about AA. I'd love to hear more.",

Because the law also adversely impacts poor whites it isn't considered racially discriminatory but it's often overlooked that white military recruits are more often groomed for Officers Candidate School than their black and brown cohorts. That is some baked in white supremacy right there. \n\nThe classist component is that the children of wealthy whites aren't aggressively recruited for military service because their parents have the resources to enroll them in school districts whose school boards have adopted a policy to either ban military recruiters or withhold their student directory, options public high schools in urban areas don't have if they want to keep their doors open.",

I made a similar point in a paper I wrote about the systemic violence of our immigration policy. I talked about how it bothered me the way liberals talk about undocumented people and immigration policy, ignoring the massive role that US imperialism has played in fostering conditions people are fleeing from and talking as if immigration happens in a vacuum, that we should loosen immigration policy because it’s the morally right thing to do and not because it’s something these victims of imperialism are owed. Black people are OWED affirmative action or financial investment because they were robbed of the right to self determination, the ability to build intergenerational wealth etc. for the entirety of the history of this country. You’re not doing them a favor by correcting those wrongs, these policies are OWED",

Especially in university, I never understood these white women, especially teachers and department leaders that would be so vocal about feminism— but when it came to Latinos, Black peoples, religious minorities, lgbtq+ issues, there was this “well there’s nothing to be done…” attitude.",

Like, this is a serious question, I am completely on the side of what is being said in this conversation. \n\nI would give it away, but it it kind of attached to my skin… As a young one, I dressed in outlandish ways, in part to signal my non-compliance with the system, and in part to not reap the benefits of being a young, pretty, white woman and signal my solidarity with the oppressed. This is really no longer possible — my piercings and bright hair are all nicely integrated in our society now. I can even get a job now, dressing the way I do! \n\nI am honestly at a loss on how I could give up my privilege, but I would. I have no desire whatsoever to climb the hierarchy, acquire lots of stuff, be respectable, etc… And I honestly enjoy the company of the marginalized so much that I have not taken a lot of avenues to take advantage of the privilege I have cause I despise being around the powerful. \n\nAnyway, ideas welcome.",

The event during the protests where white moms got together & formed a barrier between the police & the Black people came up in that interview. What the white allies saw as a good/beautiful thing, the Black woman explained how harmful it was to the Black community;  stated that she knew the white women's actions were done in love, none of them asked what the BLACK PEOPLE in the community wanted. Wow. She was completely correct & justified in her thoughts & feelings. The Black woman had also stated that the Black women must lead the way because Black women are the MOST oppressed in the US (spittin FACTS right there)  & that the Black men are people their Sons, their Partners,their famies that Black women have raised. That exact moment lead me, as a white woman, to take a step back behind the Black women & to support them, acknowledge Black women as the leaders of these kinds of movements & it is on myself & all other white people to acknowledge our white privilege.

    "text": "Love this panel and discussion.\n\nI completely agree with Foreign's Frantz Fanon assertion about do African Americans want to be Black or do they want to be American. This is so so so prevalent in black travel groups and the way they talk about traveling to or potentially moving to places in Africa. It's often very colonial and paternalistic in the sentiment and they don't realize it. Thanks Foreign for calling this out.\n\nFD thanks for calling out DeSantis's insidious racism. It's so obvious but people love putting on their blinders or saying that he's better than Trump as if that is flex. 🤦🏾‍♀️🙄\n\nI love Olay's point about how white people feel entitled when they don't get into certain schools where black folk are just like it is what it is. It's the entitlement for me. Heck just look at Abigail Fishers failed attempt at taking down affirmative action a few years ago. She still didn't have the grades and still felt entitled to go to UT.\n\nSadly it's true that a lot of white people think black people go to school for free and/or automatically get into any school they apply to because they are black not because they are qualified. \n\nThe white mediocrity is real in these streets.\n\nAgreed stop putting rural white working class people as the face of racism. They aren't the ones making the laws. \n\nAs a black woman who grew up in the South, went to school in the NE, and has worked and lived in the Western US, racism is everywhere. At least they're up front about it in the south, and ironically that is sometimes easier to deal with.\n\nI completely agree with FD that white people don't care about other white people, they care about Whiteness. Preach! This goes back full circle to his Frantz Fanon comment at the beginning about do African Americans want to be Black or American.\n\nThe whole spectacle of using Asian Americans as the face of affirmative action was orchestrated by Edward Blum and there have been many articles in the past 10-15 years talking about how that group feels maligned by an Asian quota and allegedly underserving blacks because of Affirmative Action. Um, why not address the white mediocrity? That yearning for proximity to whiteness is blindingly real to many.\n\nThanks for all of the quotes, books, films, and knowledge.

Here in the UK huge swathes of the country have virtually no dark skinned people at all, and you can clearly see where the privilege of whiteness is not extended to white people from places like eastern europe, or if there's no immigration to speak of, the dehumanisation is extended simply to the white poor.",

    "text": "Any time I hear people going on about affirmative action and how black people somehow get special treatment as a consequence of that, I think about Devah Pager's criminal record study.  So, in her study, black applicants without a criminal record received callbacks 14% of the time.  How low this number is is what people tend to focus on, but I've always found the specific number interesting.  Black people make up about 14% of the US population, and the goal of affirmative action laws is to ensure proportionality in hiring.  So, ideally, the black population of any given workplace should be at least proportional to the black population within the community where that workplace is located if these hiring guidelines are followed.  The percentage of callbacks so precisely mirroring the national proportion of black people in this country, to me, has always hinted at a suggestion that the only reason it's not even lower is that employers are, on average, required by law to provide black people with a bare minimum opportunity for employment.  Should those laws go away, how much lower might these sorts of numbers drop?",

    "text": "I loved a lot of the points brought up in this discussion. I kept thinking that the words \"human hierarchy\" needed to be brought up directly. In human hierarchy that has technically existed since the agricultural revolution which reportedly is when patriarchy began, existence has been about being on a greater vertical infrastructure chart not based on anything \"natural or biological.\" So the first supremacy ever to exist is male. From male supremacy came every other supremacy including white which is why the dominant cross section of \"white and male\" sits at the top systemically and culturally. Out of male supremacy has come hetero-supremacy, white supremacy, able-bodied supremacy, etc. Men are the original and largest supremacist and dominant group on Earth. So when it comes to any \"allowance\" that loosens the leash of suppression and oppression, look at what the men do first. I agree that white women have been psyops in the sense of their prioritizing whiteness over their womanhood but to the points of black tokenism, I watch how black men move first. Clarence Thomas is a big example of \"maleness over blackness\" without knowing that intra-male hierarchy exists which is where conflicts between men on intersectionality base start and continue racial/cultural wars which are often a distraction from the sex/gender wars. There are a lot of black men who will side with white men against black women to be acceptable to white men because of the commonality of being ideologically male supremacist/patriarchal. Clarence Thomas is only a symptom of a 12,000 year old and counting mass problem.",

That one cis girl that was everywhere talking about how a trans athlete stole her scholarship... She was in 5th. There wasnt a scholarship in that for you if the trans girl had lost, and whos to say that in that alternate universe where the race was without trans kids you woulda won at all? There were 3 cis women better than you. But she's only upset when a trans person is present. Theres this entitlement of whiteness where you think youre owed a win, and if you fail and theres a marginalized person nearby you? Then thats why you didnt win. Couldnt be bc youre worse at swimming. No. Some trans person is how you came in 5th. Even tho the other three ahead were cis, that doesnt matter. If there wasnt a trans person somehow you would've come in first, bc you're the cis white woman. You deserve it.\n\nInsidious, ego driven shit",

    "text": "A word of agreement about the statement that ww white folx shouldn’t treat being anti-racism as a “favor” and something we do to feel good about ourselves…\n\nOpposing racism and capitalism should not (just) be about “being good.” While I don’t begrudge the warm and fuzzies that many of us get from being correct and altruistic, the reality is that capitalism is unsustainable, and we will ALL eventually suffer because of it. Even the richest people will go thirsty when we run out of water. Even the richest will have their lives shortened by shitty air quality. \n\nOur appeal is an appeal to all, and yes, we need to oppose fascism and its attendant -phobias and classifications of oppression, but also, we simply cannot continue as we are. All of it sucks for everyone. Patriarchy fucks over men, racism deprives white people, transphobia forces cis people in more calcified gender roles, capitalism in general will eventually simply destroy this planet, etc etc etc. \n\nHuman beings are very generous and care about their fellow humans. True. We are also selfish. And we can come to anti-capitalism from both places. I think realizing this may bring our ideology forward: they don’t have to *like* any particular marginalized group — they simply can protect the marginalized because it means we are slowing down (and hopefully stopping) the march of fascism. We need to stand in solidarity with each other because *all* of us will eventually need help, and all of us will eventually be affected by persecution and climate change, and all the other horrors of the current system. \n\nI have often used this rhetoric with my white friends, and particularly with people who lean conservative, and I think it is a usable strategy, particularly for us whites. I imagine that, coming from a black person it would stil be interpreted through the lens of you “trying to get something from white people” , but I believe us whites may need to try sowing seeds using this more. \n\nThank you all for the wonderful work you do!",

Reading personal statements and collecting information in a firestorm while being a full time faculty member, you absolutely will infer everything you can about a candidate through all information available in a matter of minutes. Names, addresses, statements, countries, and we have diversity essays on top of that. Oh, trust, we don't need the race multiple choice indicator to know the race of the candidate, there's so many other proxies in most university apps. Additionally, graduate levels have interviews as well. When institutions still have majority white professors and administrators, anti-Blackness will default, this will also affect Asian-Americans. AA was a failure but we definitely need an systemic alternative that work directly for ADOS Black American candidates moving forward.",
