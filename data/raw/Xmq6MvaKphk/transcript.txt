hello everyone welcome to the midwestern marks podcast episode eight i'm back with my co-host carlos burrito and today we have a very special guest bay area four one five um uh here to talk about china chinese socialism uh we're gonna talk about israel-palestine a little bit because that's been in the news lately um we'll discuss all of our favorite works of marxist theory and yeah it should be a great discussion we're excited to talk to bay here so yeah how you doing today bay i'm doing well thanks for having me uh really excited to uh be on here and talk a little bit about uh china with you all and uh what's going on in the middle east along with some favorite works of uh uh ours on the team and whatnot but uh really appreciate it for sure yeah we're we're pumped to have you um so the first question i want to ask or hear how you would um elaborate on this or respond to this is china socialist this is probably the number one question i get since i started talking about china people you know it's a bit of a simplistic question the answer i usually give is that sort of a non-marxist question to just look for these sim simplistic yes or no answers um sure and and we've got to look at the context uh and be dialectical and materialist and how we analyze china um but how would you answer that question um if you're asked uh is china socialist an enthusiast uh enthusiastic yes uh i would just say straight up uh not only is it socialist but it's one of the most important uh socialist societies that's uh in existence today ever since the soviet union um it is the largest country that calls itself a socialist under the communist party of china and with the accomplishments that it has done under its system and is towering over the western uh capitalistic liberal democracies uh i think it is incredibly important that more and more leftists see uh china as socialist and you know main reasons is first off we know economically and you know among leftists and amongst uh marxist leninist we can obviously say that economically china is not socialist obviously uh the means of production is uh technically under the state and it is transitioning towards uh more uh you know socialistic and communistic pathways those are the goals but currently with having uh markets and uh sort of having these special economic zones where uh there's a more capitalistic element in the uh in the economic sector and whatnot it's really looking like more of a state capitalist or something that lenin described in his tax and kind uh sort of thing which is by the way a marxist concept the marxist londoners concept in and of itself you know but the thing is is that the major difference that lenin points out is that uh you know the state constantly in control and the state representing the people uh truly does make this uh despite the economy not necessarily being uh entirely socialist that's where it matters you know because the effort of transitioning a capitalist society into a communist society is uh socialism and when you have the dictatorship of the proletariat when you have uh all these marxist communist concepts in play with the cpc on top along with the fact that they are enthusiastically still trying to go towards the pathway on communism it's really important that we say that overall it is it is a socialist country it is ideologically pursuing uh socialism and communism and it should be upheld for any marxist-leninist socialist communist leftist out there in the world so yeah i think that's a great answer and one of the things i get frustrated with is you know when you look at the history of socialist experiments and the number of of experiments who have either been completely destroyed by the united states in western imperialism or have you know are in a situation like cuba and vietnam or the dprk where they're trapped under embargo facing constant aggression from the us then you have china who's found this way to using state control of certain sectors of the economy using these five-year plans using uh the strength and the size of the the chinese communist party to kind of find a way to continue developing through the the rules of global capitalism and with the sustained um regime change efforts from the us you know and then when you have people within the u.s uh leftists or socialists within the us um pooh-poohing china and what they've done as they brought all their people out of poverty and managed to you know it combat u.s imperialism um the way that no other socialist experiment ever really has yeah i i take the same position as you there yeah one of the one of the things people don't notice is that when the soviet union falls not only are the previous countries that made up the union up for grabs but the whole third world is basically up for grabs at the hands of imperialism and china presents a a blockage of that uh imperialist force um and also i think that like you mentioned eddie uh this binary between is it socialist or is it not and in terms of economics uh like you mentioned big um it's idealistic it's an undialectical way of thinking right uh and it's the the sort of imposition of the the logic of capital that it's either one thing or it's another um and so i'd like to think of their economic development as a process of building socialism um you can't especially when you're within the context of global capital you can expect the ideals of what the lower stage of socialism looks like in critique of the gotham program to materialize itself completely in a country that has to function within global markets and and do all sorts of things so um what they've done with the alleviation of the elimination of poverty which they did ahead of their own plans it's completely impressive and something that every person that considers himself a socialist should uh should praise um great agree 100 and that was you know that was the main drive on why we needed to explore deng xiaoping and china 2050. you know uh deng xiaoping obviously the modern architect of china uh what is a lot of both on the left uh with uh you know dogmatists and ultra leftist and on the right trying to claim that uh deng xiaoping was a capitalist is absolutely a misconception uh deng xiaoping was a enthusiastic supporter of mao uh in the early years and was a dedicated communist during the revolution and uh he detested uh liberalism he detested uh you know in like western infiltrations of uh china as he was uh pushing his opening up in reform and you know his famous quote that we're not gonna be scared of opening up uh and letting even foreign investment in because we can combat their influences and it has worked you know a lot of people you know obviously negatively point towards uh time indian square as well uh and you know the that's a big misconception of what necessarily happened as well uh with the protests and everything there were i think there was a i forget what it's called operation yellowbird or things like that but they were sneaking in cia operatives from the protest through hong kong uh to either flee china or enter china through those protests and um that but to say that you know denzel ping was a capitalist but you know come hard on the liberalism that was starting to perk up after the fall of the soviet union it's a tale of two you know sort of different pictures that people are trying to portray here you know uh along with china 2050 uh saying that oh we're not going to reach socialism until 2050 or blah blah blah it's more of an understanding of where the you know where all these five-year plans and what the the economic elegance and complexity of these plans and it's just so uh interesting to see the trajectory the ongoing growth and progress of the chinese economy uh building up their material needs and conditions while building up their productive forces for 1.4 billion people to the point where they are eliminating poverty and they are providing high uh high standards of education health care and things like that which people need and at the same time continuing on this pathway towards socialism communism and that's what we wanted to confirm as well and people getting confused with oh two thousand seventy seventy seven or two thousand uh twenty one a hundred uh they're just pushing off socialism so they can appease their you know uh their own capitalistic uh sort of aggressions and things like that that's a misconception as well and we really tried to defeat that in showing that there's a plan with all this all the success that we're seeing and achievements that we're seeing is planned by the cpc and it should be more understood as this is the pathway at least under chinese characteristics that socialism is going to grow and how we on the outside you know outside of china has to really uh learn from and hopefully adapt to our own you know societies for sure it's i was telling carlos the other day you know there's a book by david harvey called neoliberalism and and xiaoping is on the cover and i was watching david harvey talk about capital you know not to throw too much shade at david harvey you know he's probably more of a force for good than he has a force for bad but he he uses china as an example in capital a bunch is you know this is how foreign this is how capitalism works once china allowed these markets in the whole country just went to neoliberalism went to garbage and and he says you know i just want to ask don't ask him you know did you actually read marx did you actually take the time to understand marx i'm like david harvey you can read what deng xiaoping wrote about marx you can see him as you said calling liberalism terrible and you know saying he's about communists or you can read xi jinping and talk about you know how recently there's been this giant anti-corruption campaign and a move towards you know even more um nationalization and control by the party so that they can you know continue moving to socialism you've seen them crack down on jack ma recently um that was you know another attempt to avoid too much finance capital into their country and whatnot but um right and as you said it's extremely complex and when i was digging into the details of it more this morning um when you look at exactly what the party is doing and how they're um combating what the us is doing where the u.s is essentially this finance capital dominated hegemonic power whereas china has heavily invested in industry and manufacturing and rail and and also the essential industries that people need like healthcare um so people aren't paying insane exorbitant costs up on their rent in china because their their housing is publicly controlled whereas in the us you know part of the reason 78 of our population lives paycheck to paycheck is because we have this frontier economy um where um where people have to pay tons of their their paycheck at the end of every month to a landlord um so you see what china is doing is in direct opposition to the us and that's you know the nature of dialectical materialism that china doesn't exist in a vacuum everything they do is in opposition to a global capitalist system dominated by western finance capital um so there's all like you said these intricate plans by some of the smartest people in the world to think up ways to combat that and to build socialism and and a lot of people on the west rather than rather than read about it it seems like they'd rather just say oh state capitalism you know i hate it right right and that's another thing the word state capitalism itself it's developed by lenin as a stage that comes right after uh their attempt at wartime communism and he's like well we're gonna have to make some concessions not on principle never on principle uh it's going to be risky but when is it not risky to be a revolutionary um so uh yeah i think it comes from an area of western chauvinism uh that people who participated uh who did not participate at all in the struggle towards building socialism in china who are not in the class of people uh that are in the 850 million that have been brought out of poverty into dignified lives looking at china and because it doesn't cross off every single one of their little ideal checklist they reject it they'll call it state capitalist and not in the sense that lenin used it but in the sense uh in a normative derogatory sense and it's honestly disgusting it's undialectical and it's done by marx's academics in the us and in the west uh in in general that would write books about dialectics and hegel and marx and when it comes to interpreting things in a practical manner uh they're the least dialectical of all exactly and that you know it's not only uh david harvey or uh you know somewhat richard wolf as well two respected academics uh it's really more of this uh western chauvinism i think that really creeps into uh these mines and the thing is is that look they i can't criticize experts because i'm not an expert i don't i don't have their uh economics uh degree or anything like that but i can't say that to to the extent that they are talking about you know richard wolf always likes you know co-ops and things like that and trying to promote this sort of model of of uh socialism as an employer employee versus uh you know worker owned sort of mecha mechanisms within uh companies and businesses and whatnot whereas china and you know looking at how marx and angles justify the transitional state and how uh important it is uh along with lenin's tax and kind not just you know as you said this was a more of a wartime sort of uh measure but at the same time it was a measure that they thought it was necessary in their conditions and their circumstances uh at least in the you know russian characteristics and i think that's where a lot of people kind of get tripped up because when i was reading more about xiaoping they were going against the soviet model because it was the only model you know it was the model for communism and socialism uh but at the same time trying to forge their own pathways and things like that a lot of people were nervous and scared but now after seeing the fall of the soviet union and you know one of the reasons why i became a marxist leninist was because i looked at the historical achievements and progress of all these companies are all these corp uh countries that uh made themselves uh the socialist societies they are today and whether or not they're successful and looking at their measurements their human development indexes and things like that it's completely obvious that they are uh they are extremely successful in you know pursuing what they need to pursue and they haven't yet they have not yet relented on the socialistic pathway the way that you know for example the soviet union and gorbachev and the you know cia infiltration has uh cuba vietnam uh and laos and they're all these countries already existing socialist countries they're not letting up on the socialism they're just you know they're learning i think and that's why china is incredibly important seeing the successes that china has they are lending a lot towards these not only uh already existing socialist countries but the global south as a whole you know and we're probably going to touch a little bit on the belt of road initiative uh but for the most part this has just been an incredible pathway for the global south to really uh release their chain of the western imperialism that they've been suffering from for decades so uh i'm really uh we're actually we're still writing the script for uh debunking china's uh imperialism or you know chinese imperialism and we're reading uh lenin's uh imperialist the highest stage of capitalism along with uh i i can't pronounce his name and i don't want to butcher it but it's neocolonialism the title is neocolonialism and uh we looking how intense that book gets into the complexities of how uh imperialism works in the west while they were supposedly decolonizing africa uh but all the capital was still tied with the french with the english banks with the american banks and everything uh and there was no basically hope for decolonization when the capitalists found out that hey we don't need colonization maybe we just can't control their uh governments through their economies and that and i think that's the most important thing lenin pointed out in his work it's like look this isn't a political maneuver this isn't you know some type of control this is basic capital this is economics capitalism will grow to a point and it's inevitable that it will start imperializing other backboards gonna go backwards nations and um from there trying to export their more capital from their surplus capital and things like that um and what china is doing is it's a really a breath of fresh air to break those chains so and we can get into that more a little bit but ultimately yes china is socialist um i'm still proud to say that economically maybe that's a little bit of a different story or up to debate but overall i would say china is definitely a socialist country so nice yeah yeah absolutely and i like what you mentioned there um something you hit on that i think it's quite important and that's revolutionary for uh a a world in which uh socialism is attempting to be built which is that china realized that the soviet motto at one moment was not going to cut it for them that they had to develop socialism out of their specific uh historical and contextual conditions and this gives rise to what's now termed socialism with chinese characteristics and this has been fundamental in the development of socialism in other places in latin america um and and across the world um and you can argue that has been it has been also a driving force since it proceeds uh since it comes from the the 20th century has been a driving force in what's now known as like 21st century socialism which attempts to do something similar although they try to detach themselves from the history of 20th century socialism in essence what the spirit of it is is uh taking the material conditions of the country the cultural historical conditions and trying to build socialism from from there um so i i think there were mistakes in that uh shift that that china might have done uh labeling you know soviet union culturally imperialists and and stuff like that but that development of chinese of socialism with chinese characteristics is something that's revolutionary on its own you know we we're able to observe that capitalism shares a similar structure but works differently in different places capitalism in japan is different than capitalism in the us and that's different from capitalism in western europe socialism will too socialism will adjust to the conditions of each place and take form in different ways according to those conditions absolutely yeah i think we can transition then here since we've been talking about the belt and road initiative and about the the conditions of the global market as well as you know chinese conditions prior to the revolutions let's talk about sort of the new cold war that we're seeing um so i just finished vijay prashad's washington bullets it was a great book and in it he highlights a cia dossier from like the 90s or early 2000s and they're saying china is still formulating so in the 70s obviously you have the china opens up and the us creates relations and you have western investment in in china and the cia at this point is writing china is still formulating themselves we don't know what they're going to become right we don't know if they're going to go all the way towards neoliberalism and join the global financial market dominated by western capitalists who will eventually you know control the chinese government this rather than the ccp or sorry i think i just used the wrong name it's dpc right yeah um but so you see the cia writing about them like that in the 90s and then now you look at this new cold war that's come about um where china seems to be public enemy number one of the united states and we know you know for sure a huge reason is the belt and road initiative where these countries are getting uh getting financed by by china by these state-owned banks or whatever in in rather than the imf in the world bank too which is i think the piece that a lot of people miss is like it's not like china's just going to all these countries and offering them loans so that these countries are then indebted to china it's countries who have been for years held in poverty by the the financial institutions which are completely run by the west that dominate the globe like the imf and the world bank so yeah if you just want to talk about um the new cold war i guess we can call it the sort of u.s aggression and hostility towards china their manufacturing of consent towards china or um yeah and china's robe on their role on the globe as sort of a counter hegemonic power to the us yeah definitely i mean the one of the biggest reasons why we're seeing this cold war is basically uh kind of a perfect storm of china's rise and capitalism western capitalism decay um and when we see you know fascism more rising on the west because of the economic decay that uh people are experiencing while the government continues to suppress leftist voices uh we it's it's really a desperation for the elites to uh sort of hold on to whatever wealth they have on the other hand seeing how china is rising to the point where they're eliminating uh the absolute poverty to the you know that is becoming the first country in the world to ever do that in human history with their 1.4 billion population under the cpc is extraordinary um i actually tweeted this about uh what uh when i was re-reading lennon's uh imperialism he's he literally said you know capitalism could have the ability to alleviate poverty alleviate their standards of living for their people but instead of using their surplus for that they use it to export capital to to grow their capital more and grow their surplus more capitalism he literally said capitalism will not do that but seeing china actually do actually invest to increase their standards of living and eradicate poverty that i'm not saying that's obviously the one thing that makes them not capitalists but that's a huge sign that you know lenin saw this uh would see capitalism not being able to do that yet china using their surpluses and their things to uh uh to alleviate the standards of living and uh sort of the economic situations that most people are over there and just just as a side point i really don't like it when people just point towards like the un oh they're just using the un dollar sort of measurement 190 they've only increased that 25 cents and that's technically that's why they're out of poverty but you know there's multiple things wrong with that first off poverty alleviation commission commissioners don't just use income as the sole criteria to alleviate poverty there's multiple facets on how uh you know materially uh education wise their children and you know trying to not only lift them up from poverty but keep them away from poverty you know not let that cycle continue uh unlike our cycles of poverty in the united states with our welfare system and everything that just keeps people perpetually there without helping them um and along with that i always like to compare china and india and you know the poverty situation in india is incredibly out of this world you know uh i i just don't like how you know when we see images of uh poverty in india and their uh amount of population there and while they are seemingly continuing to rise economically um but looking at china and how they are still you know they're rising faster they're helping their people better and their their cities and even the quote-unquote forest regions are have the all the amenities that they need to live a good life um but going back to you know with all that said the belt and road initiative has been a huge uh you know not only to say huge in a conceptual uh context but it's the largest infrastructure there's the largest sort of economic plan a country has had for the world in human history um and it was not due united states like to say this you know they were trying to challenge the west it's like no we're trying to provide for our people we're trying to you know we have 1.3 billion uh 1.4 billion people that we're trying to provide for you and in order to do that we need uh sustainable trading we need uh to get to the resources that we need to get and if that means helping out other countries to building their ports developing their systems uh you know we're not going to endorse and this is the biggest thing we're not endorsing the governments that we trade with that we you know affiliate ourselves with uh we just want to do deals so we can provide for our own people and if you know if y'all need a port to do that and we can get your uh we can get those supplies yes let's do that we're not gonna push you towards privatizing your markets we're not gonna you know do outrageous uh interest on your loans like the imf and everything like that we just want to make sure that we can have a sustainable trading partner that is capable of trading with us and modernizing with us and in order to you know continue our pathway towards socialism what you all do and everything like that it's up to you but you know when you talk to the global south like that which has been under the boot here of uh western imperialism i mean even i remember there was a um there was a lecture i forget who it was again my memory slips me but uh they were saying that you know initially they weren't receptive towards china's uh trade deals they were skeptical because all they knew was uh you know we're gonna get exploit we're gonna get you know torn up and you know one of the highlights that china said was like we were once like we were you know imperialized we were humiliated by the west we were uh in those shoots and you know in my um socialism chinese characteristics video uh the last quote that i said about xiao ping was uh he he was hoping that china's success would lead the pathway for not only other communist countries but the third world or the global south as a whole you know and to even say that uh the dalton road initiatives really challenges the concept of imperialism uh in a way that no other you know no one really foresaw um it's really it's something that left us to really study analyze but embrace as well and i think it's especially with the global south embracing it more and more uh it's it's really something that uh i think everybody on the left should respect such support so far but also study to make sure that they can improve the lives of other people and hopefully advance the ideology of marxism and socialism yeah i think people fail to recognize that the absolute domination of western finance capital that's that's come about especially in the last 40 years that's been the real you know imperialism is still sort of the same phenomenon that lenin observed but the the imperialist tactics of the west have changed and what we've seen the last 40 years there's a total domination of finance capital or even you know longer than the 40 years um it's like if you look at salvador allende's chile um uh chile was getting something like 200 million dollars in financing a year or whatever from the from the global financial institutions before ayande takes power and then when he does that gets cut down to i think two two million dollars from 200. so now you're trying to build socialism and you're trying to run an economy and you're trying to meet people's needs um when you're being choked off from a financial system in a global financial system that's dominated by these financial institutions um so you've had the systematic holding of these countries in poverty and then of course as soon as pinochet took power in chile all that that financing shot right back up um but you have a global financial market that's dominated by the u.s so without a policy like the belt and road initiative it's almost impossible for countries to escape poverty even once they have socialist revolution to actually begin a process of building socialism and that's why you know you look at something like what china's doing and we think of it i guess it's innovative and stuff and and i i yeah i guess i don't understand uh western socialists who who you know are super negative about it i understand they're concerned about imperialism but it just does seem like western socialists kind of being tricked by the cia propaganda as usual it's so clearly a projection i'm sorry but they're they are going to invest 300 million dollars per year to uh say how bad the belt and road initiative is they just passed the bill in the united states to do that so keep that in mind instead of helping people with 300 million dollars a year they're just going to talk a whole bunch of smack on what other countries are doing to improve themselves oh my god yeah that's insane it's yeah i i think that um a lot of it is projection um because when you when you see the critiques of the belt and road initiative which is it's the only time that i know of that anyone is genuinely in the spirit of solidarity um helping to build the african continent and its infrastructure um when you see the critiques is really a projection of what the us and the west has done uh through the world bank and the imf through structural adjustment programs and stabilization programs to the whole world so it's it's a lot of projection and i that gets us to uh to sort of our our next topic which is um what what role do you see uh the acceptance of these uh propaganda campaigns by those who uh call themselves socialists or communists in in the west um how important is it to reject this narrative which i i like to call um when we accepted a a left delegitimization campaign of socialist experiments so how important do you see the task of socialists that are living within the empire at critiquing this propaganda and at supporting albeit at times critically uh socialist experiments and experiments that are trying to be autonomous outside of the role of western capital sure i think it's uh obviously incredibly important but we also have to admit that there are going to be uh opportunist and even outright uh what you would outright rats i guess you could say outright you know people that are working for the establishment infiltrating our ranks you know that will be uh promoting this propaganda and will try to push these talking points on unsuspecting things like that i mean uh it's incredibly important to not only combat the propaganda in you know the authentic left i would say but also the uh also to combat the infiltration that we may be facing for those pretending to be leftist or to use this as an opportunity to promote themselves to talk bad about china and things like that um it it's a dangerous game because if we allow this propaganda and infiltration to win then uh this means going into a cold war as we were talking before this this is a very you know not only army's fighting but nuclear uh annihilations and things like that uh in our minds it's if we if the western left truly truly needs to shed their chauvinism and truly needs to shed their biases in order to see that there are other systems that and other places that need really don't see this as an authoritarian dystopic you know dictatorship that ruins people's lives rather uh actually looking at the science and looking at not only you know what is coming out of their own state media or their statistics and things like that but actually seeing what other people are talking about i mean uh just yesterday uh radio free asia not you know obviously a branch of the cia came out saying that we gore's a source not even describing the source a source said that uyghurs were forced to celebrate dancing around uh on the i think the you know i forget the uh ed the the the holiday i forget how it's pronounced i don't know how to pronounce it either i know you're talking about them yeah yeah but they were dancing they were celebrating and everything like that and then all of a sudden uh that somebody the chinese authorities forced them to celebrate and it's just laughably horrible how far the propaganda will go and but we have to realize that they have a platform built on so much capital so much financing um and it's going to influence some people as ridiculous as it may be and um it's not only it's not only our side i remember i was uh reading a uh maoist subreddits uh stance on you know if china and the united states goes to war who would we back we would back neither uh because we wouldn't back anybody during world war one it's an imperialist war and i'm just like whoa oh you know to compare china to austria hungary or you know italy it's so you can't just it's laughable on how they justify their stances but at the same time this is a legitimate uh they're trying to be a legitimate portion of the left but with an analysis like that i mean i know a lot of people got in trouble uh for saying uh for saying on that uh you know from this ultra stance saying that uh cuba was just a sugar colony for the soviet union you know and it's just a terrible way of seeing uh and analyzing uh socialist countries like that in order to push this very ideologically pure standard of uh socialism so we not only have to face the cia's platforming but we also have to say you know face these uh other ideologies on the left that really try to be legitimate but say very outrageous things like that and just try to convince people uh through these talking points as well so we're fighting sort of a two-front battle but we have truth and statistics and everything on our side uh to really show that both of these are just paper tigers so that's awesome um yeah i kind of forgot what i was going to say next you have anything carlos oh yeah that is sometimes easy to forget that uh there's not just money going into a direct opposition there's money going into creating a opposition that seems like it comes from our spaces and we have uh during the first cold war and i'm already talking as if there's going to be a second one like if it's guaranteed but during the first cold war we had the the congress for cultural freedom that did precisely that i got a group of socialist uh or soft social democrat academics from the west and it created a campaign to delegitimize the soviet union and and we like you said we have two fronts to fight we not only have to fight the reactionaries that are clearly our enemy but also those that seem like they're our friend but that are either funded or convinced by the funding that's created precisely for those ends to create a left de-legitimation campaign to these socialist experiments and and ml's get a bad rap too like you guys you know blame everything on the cia like you were just saying a bill just passed you know spending millions of dollars to bad mouth china's economic programs like there are millions and millions and millions of dollars being pumped into pushing um propaganda right so like people are like how could they fake an entire genocide right how could you know the u.s media fake an entire genocide in xinjiang i'm like they've done it multiple times every single time we invade a different country there's some heinous human rights abuse with very limited evidence other than blurry satellite images and then the us uses that as justification to destroy an entire country so it's like it's not that mls are hyper paranoid it's that we've been studying this stuff intently for a long time and we've watched these patterns that play out again and again and again where the state department says oh human rights abuses x y and z are going on and all of a sudden half the western left goes you know you're a tanki if you don't acknowledge these things um and then and then after the us destroys the country then these these leftists are like oh yeah you know i guess you guys were right but oh well by then it's too late right and that's the most frustrating part um when we we do face legitimate voices that buy into this propaganda but they don't realize how deep and complex this propaganda has been not only historically i what frustrates me is that these operations are now open to the public declassified documents and we know that you know from jfk trying to plot a terrorism attack in miami and blame the cubans all the way to uh trying to uh like billions of dollars were sent to gorbachev uh to win the election so they can continue to delegitimize the soviet union uh i mean i i remember there was a tweet i really want to look into this uh on how the cpc was actually kind of going through the same thing in the early 2000s and the late 90s with a lot of american infiltration in the party however the cpc was able to hack into the cia's mainframe and not only discover who was who in the uh cpc who was a cia operative but they discovered that 21.3 million people work for the cia worldwide 21 million people and it's just like they are everywhere it is more intense than we think and i think this wasn't even like a leftist source this was from the economist uh admitting this you know and this is not a conspiracy theory and they they discovered 21.3 million uh people that were at least under the guise of the cia whether they were being paid or actually coming from the cia themselves you know the the network is intense and the undermining that they do along with the amount of money that they have is not only happening on fox news but our spaces as well you know and even in the sometimes even in the heart of these uh countries as well so it is some thing that we do aware of and but to say that um i always say that oh you blame everything on the cia's like yes we do 100 of the time but at the same time when you look at the amount of funding and intensity of the their networks you just have to say i i would not be surprised if there are at least fingerprints left uh when something goes wrong in uh these countries whether it's a riot whether it's a protest of the opposition uh or some type of food shortage uh electrical shortage and etc you know the cia definitely has a hand so yeah and even when it's not direct like you said there's indirect means uh by which those funding attempts affect there's this one uh quote message thing i'm going to paraphrase this but from a cuban folk singer sylvia rodriguez where he says that cuba was not given an opportunity to fail and that's not just because of the direct influence that the empire and the cia have on the country but because of the resulting mistakes that might be made because of those pressures right um so that's what we also don't realize that even in the mistakes that uh that are their stores might be more directly in in other places um they are also influenced by the other sorts of pressures i mean just think about how one acts if we take it back to the micro level level um when one is under uh constant stress or constant pressure your actions are influenced by that right you can't just uh you can't bracket that out of your life and function fully rationally while you have all of these things going on so it's it's not just the stuff that the cia does but it's also what they influence because of what they do uh that we have to look at right true and i just want to bring up so people are aware um one of the main outlets right now pushing anti-china stuff is this epic times epoch watch out for that if you if you're not aware of it it's a it's a propaganda arm of the falun gong which is this like super far-right cult backed by also western interests and what i thought was interesting about that was they also uh epic times pushes queueing on really hard and there were members of the falun gong who showed up at the capitol riots so then you have corporate media blowing a gasket about the capital riots and talking you know about the unique evil of trump compared to other presidents and you know some of them accusing russia it's like the cia has literally bred this right you have people that the cia these extreme right-wing groups that the cia's been funding to try and destabilize countries who then you know end up showing up the capital riots um right i i don't know did people just do not realize the level of money and the concerted effort to destabilize any left-wing movement around the world exactly and you know i think that shows uh unfortunately the power of capital and financing the you know we are still uh that our society still has and uh whenever people say oh you know if communism is socialism so successful why isn't it popular why isn't it supported by people you all should have a party that you know uh get votes and things like that it's like no no no there's you know there's a reason why the you know two-party system here is heavily funded and heavily favored for these two parties there's a reason why we're not growing uh but at the same time our influence is growing among people um to even say to even imagine even 10 years ago under you know bush or obama that the that socialism would rise uh to uh conversations that we're having today political discourse that we're having today would have been like what's you know that's sort of you know irrelevant or unheard of but now it's you know in the forefront of everybody's mind uh because not only of you know discourse changing through for example the bernie sanders campaign and saying you know how socialism can help a very warped sort of you know westernize a concept of socialism that thinks norway is socialist for somehow some way but um at the same time it does open up the doors to kind of have a discourse in the west about socialism how it it has the potential of being a better system um but at the same time you know kind of putting all this in full circle i think china has been doing a great job in combat combating all this uh with their successes they're um with their anti-corruption campaign they've been really sweeping out all these uh infiltrations as well um i know maoists have been saying oh they're arresting you know maoists that are just handing out pamphlets and things like that but i actually had a meme that that said that you know quote they are just pamphlets but they are actually um you know almost pseudo conservative talking points that are anti-union uh for the destabilization of uh the cpc and you know just causing a ruckus rather than actually helping workers themselves you know uh so it's something that we gotta watch out for but ultimately um we've been we have we have the truth and we have the facts on our side to really show that people are uh being helped and be living better lives under our system so as long as we continue pushing back but in better more unique ways to combat both left and right influences we'll be good true yeah yeah i'm sorry i was just gonna add quick that i drew the ire of some some maoist recently or our website did it's um very odd the the 21st century maoist tendency um a lot of them just seem very very very ultra but yeah right right i one of the things i wanted to touch on before we hop on to another topic is that um we mentioned how china is socialism in china is not only helping chinese people in lifting 850 million of them out of poverty it's not only helping the global south but it's helping american socialists and the cause of socialism in the u.s it's what has kept the working class in the u.s dormant and relatively comfortable in comparison to the working class around the world has been our status as an empire and as china is creating a counter hegemony to the us it is creating the conditions for the u.s to no longer have those resources to expropriate from nations because now they're allying with china and that is going to create the conditions in the us whereby a revolutionary struggle uh is more um has better ground to grow than when we had hands all over the world capable of bringing the resources of the world here and paying our workers to have better lives so the situation that's going on in china is benefiting the growth of china is literally benefiting everyone and it's creating the conditions for the fall of the empire and the grabbing of power by the working class in the u.s itself um and that last point of of china helping the u.s and the cause of socialism in the us is not something that i usually see people talk about it's a thesis that marx understood towards the end of his life and that revolutionaries from the global south have understood that the empire is going to fall from outside once it's not able to exploit and expropriate the rest of the world it will itself dissolve and i i think that china is helping uh that process come about yep 100 yeah you can never predict you know um the future you know but it does look like things are trending that way um it seems like it so the owl of minerva flies at dusk so uh do you guys want to hit our last question here uh um just thought it would be fun everybody maybe share your favorite work of marxist theory why it's your favorite work um and yeah you want to go first carlos actually this is something you'd be good at uh maybe i won't be good at because i'll pick too many but uh well as a philosopher i naturally tend towards like the the early self as i i think it's really great especially reading together the the shift from the manuscripts to the german ideology is just chefs it's fantastic but um i am a fan of capital um and i i think it's beautiful because if i had to live in an island and just have one book i think it'd be capital it has a little bit of everything it has great pros it has a beautiful economic analysis and it still has what's the volume the first volume the first volume you can have the whole set on an island yeah you'll be set though if i if i can use that as a hack as a loophole so when someone asks me i'll just say capital and then i'll be like oh no i meant like all three and then like there you go yeah all right i guess i can go next my favorite was lenin's imperialism because i studied i got my degree in politics and i learned you know studied a lot of geopolitics but i didn't really start to get into marxism till the end of my senior year and when i read that book after studying the world for so long in the us's role in the world i was like ah everything clicked for me you know i'm like oh so you're telling me this guy predicted everything that was going to happen in 1917 where you know capitalists monopolize and export their capital overseas um uh so that kind of made me realize you know the the usefulness of theory and when you apply marx's theory to the real world how it's how it's really illuminating um for why things happen most definitely and if uh i'm going to jump in i think my favorite works is actually one of the main reasons why i become came a marxist leninist was uh uh stalin's foundations of leninism uh i think uh sullen has really a way with words i guess for me that's pretty direct but uh the way he described how leninism functioned especially for me back in the day that i was just sort of a ambiguous socialist not really knowing the differences uh between socialist socialistic ideology other than you know trying to help workers take over the means of productions and you know how bad capitalism is uh that the foundations of londonism really set the stage on why it is incredibly important for the state to mobilize and be used for the people uh for any sustainable revolution to just be successful overall and that's for me that's what made me uh differentiate between anarchists and their uh ideological or their idealism uh and the uh maoists uh or you know ultra leftists that were really trying to eye for this idealism that just wasn't uh you know dialectical or down to earth so uh death i i i everybody says read state and revolution but i say you know if you really want to be a communist really want to be a marxist read the foundations of leninism yeah i like that you uh recommend stalin there for me i almost feel like a shame to say it to people in the west even in left circle socialist circles uh dialectical and historical materialism by stalin was one of the first books that actually helped me start understanding dialectics and i always recommend on contradiction to people and they want to understand dialectics but that book is great like you said um not that stalin wrote a lot of super innovative stuff but he has a very direct way of explaining um these very complex concepts uh in marxism so i think he's definitely worth reading especially if you're new to marx's theory most definitely yeah it's uh you can yeah you can't bring up stalin anywhere they'll call you crazy but he does have a lot of helpful uh works uh his expansion on on our nation's right to self-determination and it's just absolutely and and the economic plans the five-year plans are great towards understanding what was the first i guess real socialist experiment right how was it working what were the attempts that they made what can we learn from it um so yeah read everyone i encountered a professor once uh who called himself a marxist but i brought up stalin uh for some reason i don't know he was like oh don't even bring that name up oh we gotta at least be able to talk about it and i was gonna say uh wd du bois uh w e d the boys did a lovely uh i think epithat or uh something really praising stalin his speech was phenomenal we shared that on our instagram page and we got no one's we've never had the audience that angry at us since we started the website of course vomit was like um your favorite leaders loved stalin people were so mad you might not like stalin but your favorite leaders do or your favorite thing exactly exactly and you know that we have a lot we have a lot of demystifying to do to be honest but uh you know hopefully we will we will continue pushing onward with you know what we need to uh you know sort of uh deconstruct these sort of animosities and antagonisms from other people but uh we will win i feel like it is as mark said it's inevitable you know so one way or another we will have to uh we will have to figure out how to engage with them appropriately but by you know pushing our own platforms it's gonna be really important that uh we show this other side so absolutely so speaking of that do you have anything you want to shout out but before we go or any last words or advice for our audience here sure just you know first off thanks again for inviting me this was a great dynamic conversation i really loved it uh you know i really want to push everybody to uh this is a really important economic time for everybody to kind of understand why our conditions are the way that they are from either understanding china all the way to our own uh why people are quitting uh minimum wage jobs and there's you know a quote-unquote labor shortage when in reality there's not um you know all the way to uh something that we probably didn't mean to skip but palestine and israel you know uh something that uh we is obviously in forefront of everybody's mind but it this isn't a war between two nations it's an apartheid you know it's it's a uh it's an incredible uh uneven uh fight between one that's backed by the united states with billions of dollars and another that is just a native people trying to survive and trying to thrive uh i think uh i don't know if your audiences know hakeem but he recently posted a great tweet uh recommending a book let me see if i can try to find it a palace basically the history of palestine um talking about the the conditions that they had to go through it's it's uh ilium pape uh p-a-p-p-e the ethnic cleansing of palestine uh uh and john uh john pilger is quoted on the book as well but uh basically he emphasized how important this book is in understanding palestinian struggles so uh we are actually going to do a video comparing western propaganda with xinjiang and palestine um that will come out next week and um trying to show everybody that not only the hypocrisy is real but it's no longer a hypocrisy that we have to uh point out it's something that uh it's a contradiction that we have to fight against um there's no debate anymore on why this thing is existing we now understand that it exists because uh capital it exists because of uh imperialist interest and we cannot debate why now we have to fight you know so um forget about xinjiang focus on palestine and really focus on the uh helping those people uh struggle for liberation so for sure that's awesome yeah we're super glad to have you on our show i think this was a great conversation um it'd be fun to do it again sometime uh so thank you for all your great work combating these myths you know some of the the most important myths being pushed by the state department and by um the u.s capitalist class right now or other one or what you're trying to debunk on your channel and that's really worthwhile so everyone check out bay area 415 on youtube bay area ml on twitter i believe yeah thank you so much thanks for having me for sure thanks for being on baby it was a pleasure talking to you definitely all right see you later everyone you
