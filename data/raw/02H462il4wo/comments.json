The US army had 11 millions soldiers, but most of them are in Europe in the \"Germany First\" plan.\n\n\nAs for the 90% white (I checked the statistics, it's not 90%+, it\"s 89.8% in 1940), yes it's totally true. But I said \"partially black\", not \"entirely black\" ^^\nPartially because a part of the US army was black. Yes it maybe was only 5 or 10%, as there was 11 million US soldiers, 5% mean more than 500 000 black soldiers, it's not nothing ^^",

He told them that he did NOT run, but instead 'walked briskly'. Hopkins asked if that meant they were depicting the enemy fire as too heavy.\n\n\"Oh no,\" replied Frost \"It was just as bad. But it wouldn't be done to run like that in front of the men\"\n\nTo be a British officer you clearly needed to be asbolutely mad.

Otherwise the most important factor in winning ww2 was industrial capacity, which was really only present in countries like germany, russia, uk, usa, japan, lol not china they shipped those stalhelms through the burma road. Both japan and china were vastly underpepared for war compared to germany, leading to needless vast amount of deaths and famine.

We can argue about WWI not actually being a world war, but just Europe fucking things up once again, but in WWII there is Japan as a big part of the axis powers that participate right from the start, or actually started earlier. Yes, from an American or European perspective the focus was on Europe and the Atlantic, but that's for Europe itself the case because that was what occupied everyone's lives and is still visible in every major city and for the US because after Pearl Harbor they had to choose what theater to concentrate their forces on and deemed Nazi Germany as the greater thread (and rightly so). That however doesn't mean the Pacific theater wasn't just as horrifying and devastating. It's just not what Western nations usually focus on when discussing WWII. Once again: Europe because they have their own shit to deal with, the US probably because there is some internalized guilt for the atomic bombings (Which, imo is bs, but that's a different topic).\nAs far as Africa, the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent were concerned. That was mainly colonialism running its due course. With maybe the exception of North Africa, as Germany just attacked them as well, so one could argue that fights there would've been inevitable. Btw, you know who also didn't really have a whole lot to do in causing the war? Our little buddy Poland. That didn't really change the fact that the war came there first, did it?\nWe can talk about decolonization and the founding of international agencies like the UN and the flaws in that, but that would be too far of a stretch.\nPoint being: Large parts of all armies participating in WWII were non-white. The people who claim WWII as a 'white man's war' usually don't want to point to who initiated it, but want to brush over the many many men and women that died fighting against (I mean, some also fought for, but again, different topic) Nazism, despite it not being their responsibility. And many of these people were volunteers. And that's a problem. Especially when you then go on to look at how these people or their descendants were being treated when they came to Europe 20 years later, when the last Colonies were finally being broken up. And how their descendants are still being treated now. Because when you look at Racism in modern day Europe, it's usually white/local people against immigrants. Though nowadays the debate is usually centered around Refugees, it's actually about those descendants. The small bit that still reminds you of colonialism. And that IS outrageous.\nThis is why I don't think WWII was a 'white man's war'. The initiators weren't exclusively white. The soldiers weren't exclusively white. And nowadays the term is being used by Racists to fence themselves off from people that are different.\nSorry for the long comment, thanks for reading and have a nice day.",

BC only at that point countries from all over the world participated.\nAs for your second point: yes, the Western world is still racist and bigoted. There's tons of evidence to prove that which I'd politely ask you to seek out yourself since I can't tell whether you are here for an honest and open discussion or just to \"own the libs\". Either way, please listen to the voices of those affected by these issues, and especially those in that groups who spend their whole life studying these issues. I would like to point out that having good healthcare and a good economy don't say shit about how little racism or bigotry there is in a country. The Eastern block had quite good Healthcare, but was filled with autocracies. Hell, by the time's standards the German Empire had quite good Healthcare while owning colonies and committing genocides in said colonies. France and England both were the world's strongest economic powers at a time when their empires were the largest. Same goes for quality of life. As long as you were \"German\" (by Nazi definition) and somewhat ready to keep your mouth shut your quality of life during the third Reich was amazing (up until the last years of the war), that doesn't mean that that it wasn't a racist, sexist and antisemitic system.\nAs for your last point: We mostly don't know that this is the best thing there has ever been we lack the insight into many historical cultures. Healthcare, a good quality of life and basic human rights are however in no way new inventions.",

I know a white guy who calls himself that and I talk to him. We don't agree on anything but he doesn't seem to have a problem with being called a nationalist. I didn't really realize what I was saying was that offensive to you but why didn't you realize that calling black and brown culture shit would be insulting? Neither of us did right in this situation, i fear. I'm sorry. I know it must be difficult to be white also and to feel blame for everything that happened long before your time. I can't imagine how difficult that is. \n\nBut you're not a victim and nor am I. We're just all scared. We, all the ethnic groups, all are products of a system none of us chose. We were all born  in a prison of racial strife. No one chose this. \n\nYou are not my enemy. And it's not a cop out to not want to be attacked. Clearly it bothers you when you feel you're being attacked from what you said in your post so why would I want to read you attacking me? \n\nI'm am sorry if you felt attacked though. It was hurtful when you said brown culture is shit. That hurt my feelings. But I didn't mean to hurt yours. (Hugs)\n\nYou have a wonderful day. Hopefully, we'll all learn how to appreciate each other. I am sorry if what I said caused you offense. (Hugs)",

It's an illusion that with a little time and effort you could see beyond. \n\nThere are not just well known reasons for crime statistics being skewed but those reasons are well-documented and are well understood. You just have to look beyond the stereotypes and look at the reasons for the arrests and disparages in sentencing and in where time and attention is allocated by police.\n\nI hope you well, brother. I am so sorry we are as a country going through this and I feel so terrible for the young people in this country. \n\nYoung white people having to feel as though they're being attacked simply for being alive and people of color who feel like their lives are worth nothing. I hope we all get pass it one day. (Hugs)",

If it wasn't to do with skin colour it was to do with cultural practices. Europe has had a 'difficult' time coming to terms with the concept of other peoples being an inherent tenet of a post colonial society. I mean in the UK at least it wasn't really until the late 1960s and up until the 1980s that people of colour were even offered the opportunity of being in am organised workforce with equal pay despite the original lands of many of these people having been under British occupation for several centuries. \nI guess the red mist of having to deal with the \"alt right\" on an almost daily basis boiled over. I should know better, I wrote a paper on activism against racism during the 1970s, but almost everyone my age is descending into the nonsensical literal whitewash of our history.\nApologies for my oc, I should have known better.",

But to also add, ironically the Holocaust wasn't even viewed in a negative light (even by Americans, who in a spectacular act of heroism sympathiszed with the Nazi's for their actions against the Jews) because up until the formation of Israel as a state that was eventually recognised by the US, white folks didn't even consider Jews to be \"white\" in any real sense. But when Israel was created and America decided that it would gain massive political and economic advantage in the Middle east region by allying with them, is right around the same time that Israel not only marketed itself as a \"European country\" but also potrayed Israeli's as \"white\" (even though they simultaneously claim they were ethnically Jewish which would make them not white but middle eastern or semitic like Arabs) to further curry favor and win approval of westerners. And it worked as evident by westerners previously not caring about the Holocaust because westerners viewed Jews as not white and in some regions besides Nazi Germany (like in America) as almost sub-human to around the 1960s depicting the Israeli's as not only \"white\" but also as \"European\", which cued the waterworks over the Holocaust even up until now. \n\nNot that the Holocaust wasn't brutal, but the Holocaust is a prime example of selective outrage/sorrow when the victims involved are seen of as \"white\" or \"European\" in some way.",

Having black noblemen as some BBC or Skandinavian shows do is a bit distracting. Yes, black actors deserve a chance, well do more modern stuff or theater, oddly in theater the race or even the sex of the characters matters less.

    "text": "There were some amazing feats by French black colonial troops called the Tirailleurs Sénégalais during WW1.  Various observers of these troops mentioned their extraordinarily high morale for the conditions they were in.  \n\nThere was also the 369th Infantry Regiment of the US army during WW1 more commonly known as the Harlem Hellfighters.  Young and old black men from the United States fought with the French army who would accept black troops because of their manpower shortages.  Here's a quote on one of their accomplishments.  \n\nOn 25 September 1918 the Fourth French Army went on the offensive in conjunction with the American drive in the Meuse–Argonne. The 369th turned in a good account in heavy fighting, though they sustained severe losses. The unit captured the important village of Séchault. At one point the 369th advanced faster than French troops on their right and left flanks, and risked being cut off. By the time the regiment pulled back for reorganization, it had advanced 14 kilometres (8.7 mi) through severe German resistance.  \n\nI'd say that's some pretty significant accomplishment for a \"inferior\" people as many beloved athletes the time.  Men are men and women are women no matter their skin tone.  Just because their different doesn't mean that they are less than others.  \n\nI went into WW1 specifically because of my interest in it but i'm sure with some research anyone could find more cases of black armies being equal to or superior to others.",

I can understand the lack of excessive blood or limbs being torn apart as a tactic to be more marketable but it doesn't take anything away from the movie's central plot. We've all seen people being blown apart in the multitude of war films that have come before anyways. Besides, what's wrong with wanting to make money from a movie you've put effort into if it just means sacrificing a little bit of gore?",

        "text": "Neanis, you do get that the \"Western\" way of life is dependent on oppressing people in the 'third world,' overworking them for cheap labor, and stealing their resources, right? Though, such methods are also applied at home and the *majority* of people are actually worse off. Most positive changes in material conditions are more due to advances in technology and the organization of complex systems than capitalism itself (which has leached off of both to advance the interests of the capitalist class). \n\nAnd no, not every person that is rich is bad. Marx and Engels, for instance, were both bourgeois and thus class traitors. They were alright. The issue is that in order to be rich one must have, at some point have oppressed their fellows and robbed them or to have inherited such stolen goods down the line (eg, colonialism, slavery, neo-colonialism, genocide, etc). These 'thefts' are often times made 'legal' because the rich have had greater access to political lines of power. And in order for us to make life more equitable, democratic, plain livable, etc the means of production will need to be owned by the workers/community and capital redistributed. A majority of the wealthy, along with their lapdogs, will attempt everything in their power to squash such attempts. \n\nAnd I wouldn't say 'never' in regards to 'socialist' states either. Cuba is a stunning success. I say stunning, because despite *constant* attempts at sabotage, sanctions, etc the country has a 99% literacy rating, medical care for all, etc. Many of its issues are due to its context as a country under siege and *not* due to it being a 'socialist' state. It has managed to stay standing while many similar projects have fallen so obviously it has done a lot of things right in that context.\n\nThough, honestly, the whole intent of socialism and communism is to destroy the state, so to go, \"Point to a socialist state that has been successful\" is a bit ludicrous and missing the point. If such a project were to be achieved we wouldn't be talking about states to begin with. As it is the states who have pursued socialism have had more just systems *despite* constant attempts (and successes) at sabotage by external forces, like the US, IMF, or certain European states. And to just hit this point home, why don't you compare and contrast the material conditions (for the majority) in Eastern Europe during the time it was under the USSR vs the time it has been subservient to Western Europe. I'm not talking about GDP here, but things like access to healthcare, food, employment, etc and what continued access to these resources means for the people living there.\n\nAnd if that weren't enough socialism appears to be the go to system for societies that have minimal hierarchies. EG, your hunter-gatherers, your horticulturists and pastoralists, etc. And archaeological evidence points to there being some early city-states that went with some early forms of anarchy/socialism.\n\nAnd to hammer it all home: About 20 million a year die due to preventable causes under capitalism. That's just the *preventable* stuff and not all the wars waged, infrastructure destroyed, etc in order to maintain the global status quo.",

You hate (call 'crazy' etc.) \"communists\" - a term rarely used among actual leftists, especially these days. Certainly not in terms of self-description - apart from a tiny tanky rump. If used it is usually in the very particular sense of describing pre-/post- capitalist forms of social organization.  Yet it is a staple in the blunt-instrument attack-vocabulary of the Right and so-called center (heard of Fishhook theory?)  which is of itself something of a giveaway; at the very least it makes it clear to anyone with a degree of political maturity and historical awareness that you are not 'of the left'. \n  Using the word 'communist' as a slur, or as a given 'bad thing'  is the mark either of a politically apathetic person who has never felt the need to question the mainstream neo-liberal narrative and consequently has never troubled themselves to read about the history of the Left/Labor movement (what I'd call a centrist) or of a far-righter with a reactionary anti-left agenda (what I call a fascist). You claim to have 'always voted left'; I'd be curious to know what you consider 'left' in this case. I suspect  what you mean is you voted for one of the mainstream 'Social Democratic' parties - well known throughout Europe to have abandoned any genuinely left-wing roots decades ago (disastrously for their electoral fortunes due to the ongoing crisis in capitalism and growing public rejection of 'austerity/privatization' policies) - and wholeheartedly embraced Neo-liberal Capitalism. I count myself fortunate to live in the UK where the Labour Party has been largely reclaimed by a resurgent Left and are currently the government-in-waiting (if the 'center' and right don't resort to abandoning even the paying of lip service to democratic principles in their united fear of the left as they have historically - time and time again...) but the UK is the exception in this respect in Northern Europe at least.  The very fact you say you 'voted left'  screams out to anyone with half a clue about political realities that you are a Centrist, at best.  At worst, just another alt-right troll desperately trying to sabotage any popular stirrings favorable to progressive social economic and political change and misdirect it toward the toxic myths of fascist ideology.",

Also worthy of mention are the several resistance movements that basically took what they could get, in terms of everything from equipment to members (aka they were composed of fighters of both sexes).\n\nnon-white people: apart from obvious theaters of war such as Africa or the whole conflict between japan and china (which WERE obviously part of WW2, allowing for the label WORLD war) there were a lot of people of color fighting in Europe, most prominently parts of the British Indian Army (sidenote: The Nazis btw recruited indian POW's for their own little indian army) and, of course, the Senegalese Tirailleurs, featured in one of the stories based on true events from the very game we theoretically discuss here, who fought with the french until the french liberation (before being replaced).\n\nOh, and to really quick hit on the second \"controversial\" singleplayer-mission of the game that theoretically was in discussion here: the norwegian resistance obviously included women and the Norwegian sabotage of German attempts to acquire heavy water also occurred. Based on truth, although not displaying or claiming to display exact moments in history accurately.

East Africa was taken because the waters are easier for ships than to try and cross by land or desert. ships carry far more things than man on horses or motorized vehicles in mad terrain, a ship is a moving fortress basically, trucks don't even come close to the efficiency of ships, conquest for naval empires like the British need rivers and oceans, the British conquered by winning people over and pacifying them becuase fighting them is endless and exhausting, even the weakened late Ottoman empire gave the European powers a hard time and even managed to beat them, because of home court advantage..",

I clearly did not insinuate that you said all of history is white, but you did imply that American (a western country and I'm guessing you're American, but if not, my point still stands) history is white, which I specified in my mockery of you (which is different from misquoting, that's what you just did to me), and you reaffirmed it just now. And no, sorry but a big chunk of American history has always been about racial relations and the biggest highlights of them are the colonization of Native Americans, slavery, the civil war, how immigrants were used in the building of American structures such as the Panama canal or railroads, WW2 Japanese internment camps, Harlem, Segregation and Jim crow laws, civil rights movement, etc. It's a fucking country of immigrants and to say all of these things aren't important or are just white in the grand scheme of things just because it's western is asinine and intellectually dishonest to boot. \n\n \"there’s Asian history, black history, middle eastern history but if someone says there white history it’s “look at them trying to rewrite minorities out of history and taking away their accomplishments” or “whitewashing history”. I’ve heard many people say this, even teachers but I have never once heard a person say “history is only white”'\n\nAgain, it seems that the person who is misread is you. What the OP is referring to, is the fact that people often act like the majority of the worlds' accomplishments are due to white people and that is far from the truth. We know there is white history, nobody denies that (though there does seem to be an issue of what is considered white from whites themselves). I seriously doubt someone actually goes, \"white history exists\" and people go ballistic over that statement. What you probably misinterpreted is that people usually bring it up to diminish or deny the accomplishments of other races. Just like how you misinterpreted that the op thinks people actually say, \"history is only white.\" Huh, would you look at that, another misquote. The irony is back again. And if you're going to say, nobody ever says or does that, then look at your friend Hitc equal scarface comment in this very thread. Or yourself, since you know, you did just imply that American history is white. By the way, western history includes south and central America, so you can't even claim that as white only either.",

Are you going to deny that fact ? Do you realize the difference between history of the Americans and history of the United States ? Pretty sure I said western country, not whole continent. Majority of wars fought by white men, most technological advancements until recent history by white men, country founded by white men, most significant figures in American history are white men. Explain how it isn’t white history ? Of course there are history of native Americans but in the grand scheme of American history majority of it is white. I can tell you don’t know American history very well if you think the those are the “highlights” And btw Funny the hypocrisy of how you say you know that I’m not saying it’s only white history then your last sentence says “you can’t even claim that as only white history either” so which one is it ? Do you realize that most of the people in north and South America have white blood ? Whether is central or South American most people have Spanish or Portuguese blood in them. So again argument doesn’t work. All countries in the americas are successor states of white nations, that’s a fact. And no the problem isn’t people who say a majority of worlds accomplishments are white because most sane people who know history know that isn’t true, the problem is that in 2018 people are trying to take all the accomplishments away from white people claiming it was just stolen from someone else or rewritten to help white supremacy. The problem is that we used to look at people who said history was only white as idiots but now instead people push the other way and say it isn’t really white history and call everyone who doesn’t agree with that fact a white supremacist",

That’s not “fairly recent”, white people have been alongside brown people for \nthe entirety of American history (you know, Native Americans were here first, plus slaves, also there were interactions with Mexicans as well) and yet you still say it's mostly white?

        "text": "\"The first slave owner in the America’s was a black man does that change that a majority of slaver owners were white ?\"\n\nFirst off, the first slave owner in America was never confirmed to be a black man. Anthony Johnson was the first slave owner to hold a legal court case to keep John Casor. Also, he wasn't the only black slave owner. It may not change that the majority of slave owners were white, but it does prove my point that pointing out other races' accomplishments won't take away from the white ones. It's like your hamster wheels are almost spinning but stop just short of getting the point. \n\n\"So finding specific cases of immigration doesn’t change the fact that not until recent history were almost all immigrants of European origin. That’s a fact. Slavery is not immigration, neither is the Chinese building the railroads. White people for almost all of the American history have been in the overwhelming majority\"\n\nThat's not finding specific instances of immigration. These groups of people started immigrating to the U.S pre-1830s and never stopped. They are still immigrating here to this day.  While slaves aren't immigrants, that wasn't really my point. My point was that brown people have been beside white people this entire time, and that was one example of that. Also, just FYI, African immigrants (and may I remind you Africa has about 54 countries, not to mention some of the countries were also from South America and the Caribbeans to name a few) started to come to the U.S for work since the 1920s. Sorry, but you don't get to decide if the Chinese coming to build the railroads \"doesn't count\" because it works against your argument. Are you fucking five?  That's still immigrating for work, which is what most other groups did as well. I'm starting to get the feeling you don't know what facts are.\n\n \"do you not realize that with all those people you named that you are proving my point? I’d say 85% of the people you named did things in the 1900s, that’s called recent history. I literally just said his in my previous comment “until recent history”. \"\n\nNot 85 percent, about 64 percent if you count the other ones I pointed out in the first paragraph of my second comment, and 68 percent if you don't. Like I said before, those were just black inventors, imagine the other races as well. Also, you do realize America was created in 1776? That's about three centuries not counting this one. Even if you count the colonies, it's not an old country in the slightest. Our whole history is recent by your logic. That's still a good bulk of American history whether you acknowledge it or not. Minorities became prominent in your eyes from the 1830s (A whopping 54 years, even then there were still slaves and Native Americans so..) onwards. More so, than just generalizing \"white.\"\n\n\"You use Mexicans as an example when the real history that’s with them is the Spanish discovering them, killing them and then subjugating the rest. Pretty much all in the 1600-1700s.\" \n\nOkay? The indigenous people were still there though? I'm starting to get confused by your definition of history. People who were oppressed and were used as slaves are a part of history as well, you know that right? They don't magically get a pass over because they weren't inventing something every second of the day. That's not how history works, it's a history of a country and all that happens within it, nothing gets cast out like that. \n\n\"Obviously blacks and Native Americans fought in wars but that doesn’t change the fact that they were a very small minority is everyone involved. Majority are white soldiers, led by white leaders. Blacks weren’t even officially allowed to fight until the civil war basically.\"\n\nYou're acting as if there were a thousands wars before that when it was only the revolutionary war. Which by the way, you're wrong again, there were about 9,000 black soldiers in that war. How are you able to confidently get things wrong all the time? \n\n\"Again you keep using specific cases to paint a broad bush over all of history, that’s not how it works.\" \n\nOh my god, again. Are you sure you're not just a troll and I'm wasting my time? Holy fuck, get some self-awareness.These \"specific cases\" are major events that defined and shaped our county's history. Which I'm using to counter your claim that American history is white history, and it just isn't. You're just trying to belittle and make it seems like it's not important because you know you're wrong. Sorry honey, but you can't bullshit your way out of this.\n\n \"And again you are only proving that you don’t understand any of what I’m saying and keep trying to make it out that I’m saying they weren’t involved in history, I know you are just going to deny this in your next comment but it’s literally what you keep doing over and over again. I’m not saying it is only white history and only the accomplishments of whites matter like you keep trying to put in my mouth, what I’m saying is that until recent history that United States was a majority white country, coming out of the biggest white nation the world has seen in the British empire.\"\n\nYour claim is that most of American history is white (read your past comments), and I'm saying it's not. Hence the examples and argument. Now you're changing it to the population? Can you even keep your stance straight? The country that has the biggest country of whites is Northern Ireland. You seem to forget that the colonies started out small, no way were they the biggest in the British empire, plus they weren't even a part of the empire when the United States was formed, hence the Revolutionary War. So, again, what are you talking about? Even now, you're still forgetting Austrailia and Canada. \n\n\"So it’s fair to say that most of our history is as a white nation. The British empire consisted of native Americans, Africans, Indians and Asians but that doesn’t change that it was a white nation, do you get what I’m saying ?\"\n \nSo, to clarify, you think American history is white history due to population size? You're giving me shit for brushing over history, but look at what you're doing. What of black Americans? Their history was erased due to slave owners trading their children off and separating from their parents, losing their African heritage. Africans don't even consider black Americans as the same as them, and even resent them. So is their history, the one they made with nothing left not count as American history? It takes more than mere population size to count it all as white history, the events that I highlighted plus many more contribute to that. American history is not just white, and having the biggest population does not make it a white nation. American is a nationality, not a race.",

You are the last person among us to talk about denying facts. Again, it seems like a pot calling the kettle black situation. I know that you know not everything in history is white.

What's your point here?\n\n \"Again you don’t seem to understand the concept of recent history and continue using events in the 1900s.\"\n\nYou don't seem to understand anything like reading/writing comprehension or grammar for instance. American history in and of itself is recent history. I said so in my last comment, did you even read it? Also, I didn't know you counted the revolutionary war as being from the 1900s. But if you want something earlier here, the pilgrims arrived in 1620, the slaves arrived in 1619 to build beforehand. That's a big part of American history. Native Americans were also there, too.

First off, you do realize immigrants no matter, where they were from, didn't start coming until the 1820s and up, you know that time period you keep brushing off as \"recent history?\" The first wave was mainly Europeans and Asians (and it did go into the 1900s), and in the 1920s it was African, Caribbean immigrants. They didn't all come at once, they came in waves. You must not be aware of the millions of African immigrants that are here all over the country due to early immigration. \n\n\"I’m not determining if they count or not because it makes no difference to my argument, the Chinese did not come to the United States as immigrants but as cheap labour, that’s a fact not something I’m making up. Being forced to come over and work for cheap is not immigrating for work you twat, do you really not understand that ?\"\n\nThey weren't \"forced\" to work for cheap, they came willingly to strike rich and find opportunities like the rest of the immigrants, what are you even on about? Hell, the first wave came because of the California Gold Rush and because of the rush it resulted in the transcontinental railroad being built. How have you gone on this long not knowing something as basic as this? \n\n\"You just continue proving my point that most of the shift from white history hasn’t been until recent history and you’re too blind to see that because you think your google searches are doing you well but only proving my points.\"\n\n???

Well, it's not only because of just not being 100 percent white, it's the interactions and influences that minorities had in shaping history.\n\n\"Native Americans have their own history that goes beyond United States/white history.\" \n\nAnd it still bleeds into United States history as well, and well after too.\n\n\"To deny that it wasn’t a white country is pure idiocy.

What pisses me and a lot of other people off is when we are told what to think and what is deemed acceptable. An example if comedy. Political correctness which is heavily promoted by leftists has nearly strangled it to death. Most comedy  is either pushing an agenda or political nowadays, both of which i hate no matter which side it is.",

Colonialism had its problems, big problems such as slavery and brutality but empires such as the British provide a lot of technological advancements at the time and infrastructure that is still used today. In life, when something is settled, you have to let it go, if you keep going round in circles and keep digging stuff back up, you suffer and the issue is never resolved.",

You shits just made it a phantom enemy, cause you cant respect people when told to. \nWho started that slave trade to begin with? No one gets credit for getting rid of something that was their problem in the first place. Plus, it wasn't white people who got the idea to abolish it, black people definitely wanted that thing gone before it was cool, they just convinced white people to listen. In non-white cultures, queer people were sometimes already respected and already had rights. White people just colonized that and introduced homophobia. Look at Japan's history. Technological advancement is not an excuse for slavery, especially when the effects of that slavery still exists.  You are willfully blind to the effects of history on today, picking and choosing which ones to celebrate and which ones to ignore. Your actions have a ripple effect even if you cant see it. By ignoring problems, you are contributing to them. You can't see \"let's dance in forgiveness\" when justice hasn't been achieved yet.",

Thanks to Kevin Logan and Peter Coffin for mirroring!  \n     My 11 year old son could probably teach No BS a great deal about history, he often points out that media fails to represent the actually diverse participants in warfare. I’m personally clueless regarding history, and I suspect I’m probably in the majority here in the US on that topic, sadly. So these left leaning “talk back” videos are not only satisfying to my sense that these alt-right presenters are disingenuous, but really instructive as well. \n     BRAVO!",

Also, i'll just leave this here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Dunkirk , and while i'm at it, ask you, how much of the actual participants of Dunkirk are represented as opposed to 'people of color' and women. Perhaps Poland? Belgium\r? Canada? Netherlands? Nah, who cares about those~... And again, in the first place, NO ONE CARES about color, this is about the developer's attitude and historical inaccuracy.. I swear, you people have the memory and attention span of a gold fish, where there problems in the PREVIOUS game? Well no, despite it having a TON of people of color. Why? It was historically accurate, and not forced, like here (there wheren't THAT many, plus, again, most nationalities that actually DID fight in Dunkirk aren't even present). As for women, well, again, women on the front lines where never really present, the numbers are so minuscule and make such a tiny percentage, that showing them THIS much is utterly ridiculous. On the other hand, there where a TON of women in support roles, and denying THAT and their contribution would also be quite stupid.",

They only have the territories in West Africa and North Africa. If they were to reconquer France, they need manpower from somewhere, since manpower didn't grow in trees.\nLife would not be great for the common conscripts, but for many native officers, colonial military service is but a path to power. African dictators like Idi Amin used to be a part of the colonial units.\nThere are, however, instances where due to racial prejudices, men of certain skin colors weren't allowed to serve. For example, the American Civil War. The Confederates at first didn't want to conscript their slaves even though the Union Army is larger due to racial and political reasons. It was only after the war is drawing to a close that they allowed black conscriptions. By that time, however, Emancipation had been declared and the South is already losing really bad. Had they allowed black conscriptions, they would be able to replenish their ranks more. It was a military blunder that cost them the war.",

They fought in WW2 for 8 years- before the invasion of Poland and after the defeat of Nazi Germany. I do not believe Imperial Japan could have been defeated without their contribution, at least not in 1945. As much as 39% of the casualties suffered by Imperial Japanese Soldiers is attributed not to the USMC or the British in Burma but to the Chinese. American marines approached Iwo Jima fighting a nation that had allocated 80% of its manpower to the mainland. Just imagine how much worse it could have been for them there....\n\nI visited two former WAC (Women's Army Corps) pilots in Hawaii at around 2010, both of whom have since passed away, both of whom flew cargo in the Pacific and did encounter the enemy. I attended the funeral of the latter one in Arlington cemetery where she was given a 21 gun salute and full honors. Now, she was never public with her personal life- but the two women lived together and alone since WW2. Whatever implications you want to make from that, feel free. I'd wager those ladies were braver than any ignorant youtuber talking bullshit about wars he knows nothing about.\n\nYou already mentioned the African troops in the Free French which, if I recall, I do believe there was one French soldier in the film who had dark skin and I noted it at the time with a bit of a nod. Not to mention that Ethiopia resisted Italy since 1935- it was the first country to be attacked by any of the Axis powers in Europe and they gave up 100,000 souls for the cause.",

It has become more and more common for right-leaning channels to be lazy about the content that they produce and in cases like this, they can be clearly seen to mess up. However, although he was wrong about the specifics of the Dunkirk situation, I believe the point he was trying to make in his video was that there shouldn't be forced diversity. Diversity should be something that happens naturally instead of an agenda. I think this relates to the idea you shouldn't give preferential treatment to someone based off of their race; agendas that require a specific race of actor solely to fill a diversity quota are acting in a racist manner.  Anyways I thought your video was great, just wanted to point out I think thats the larger point he was adressing.",
