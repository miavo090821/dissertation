Hello everyone It's Oscar season again Which doesn't have anything to do with today's topic But it gives me an excuse to talk about a movie Which will probably receive a couple of awards The movie I want to talk about is Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk Specifically About a take on it by a certain YouTube person The video we'll be looking at is made by a guy called Brooks Who does news, comedy, commentary, freedom And also hosts the YouTube channel No Bullshit His video on Dunkirk is titled Dunkirk is problematic Which I encourage you to look up To make sure I'm not misrepresenting him If you can make it through the video that is Now I personally don't have any big problems with the movie Dunkirk and very much enjoyed it so the focus of this video doesn't lie on the movie itself so much But more about the outrage by Brooks as you will see shortly let's have a look at what he has to say about the movie Brooks: Dunkirk tells the story of the 1940 Battle of Dunkirk where French and British soldiers Struggled to evacuate the city in the beginnings of World War two 3Arrows:Sorry to interrupt here But this will be important later on the movie Dunkirk doesn't tell the story of the Battle of Dunkirk It tells the story of the British evacuation during the battle. It's more about Operation Dynamo than anything else It's a minor point, but keep that in mind for later Brooks: And while the movie was masterfully done with wonderful acting, directions, score, and pacing there's still a few problems for starters There's no black people in it. How dare Christopher Nolan make his movie historically accurate what an asshole? That's not gonna fly in this day and age not in 2017 we need to black or brown wash at least one of the sympathetic main characters in order to be politically correct in current year I Suggest they replace the commander Bolton character. Sure he was played beautifully like Kenneth Brown off But we don't want this Shakespearean trained Oscar-nominated actor in there. EW. Let's put a random minority celebrity in there, someone like 50 Cent or Shaquille O'Neal would be much better Sure, they can't act but at least their skins not white 3 Arrows: Now besides the point that there are black people in the movie although only very Briefly Brooks doesn't seem to know that they are like real black actors other than 50 cent and Shaquille O'Neal whatever, maybe it's a joke. At this point you might be asking yourself what someone might have said to make Brooks get this unhinged Well let him explain Brooks: But back to Dunkirk Here's what one reporter from the USA Today had to say about the movie the trio of time lines can be jarring as you figure Out how they all fit and the fact that there are only a couple of women and no lead actors of color May rub some the wrong way *sarcastic laugh* But in all seriousness for real now clearly this guy at USA Today isn't concerned with being historically accurate in nonfiction stories 3 Arrows: Unfortunately, this is the only thing Brooks cites from this review and USA Today Which is titled Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk examines World War two heroism up close And I know exactly why because the sentence right after the one he cites in this obnoxious voice is Still Nolan's feat is undeniable He's made an immersive war movie that celebrates the good of mankind while also making it clear that no victory is without sacrifice In fact the part that Brooks features in his video is the only one in the entire review Which could be seen as negative and the part about not enough minority representation Is phrased in a way that it's not even a critique of the movie really The fact that there are only a couple of women and no lead actors of color May rub some the wrong way this isn't criticism of the movie But only a suggestion for moviegoers who might expect something different How outrages of USA Today to even suggest? That people who care for this stuff might not enjoy the movie as much If you read the full review it becomes very clear that the writer Loves the movie as is showcased in the original title which you can see in the link review Christopher Nolan excellent Dan Kirk explores heroism innovative fashion But Brooks doesn't seem to care about that if he needs something to be outraged about You can be sure he will find it but besides on that his suggestion about the Navy officer being played by a rapper Sounded kind of familiar when I heard it the first time and then I remembered where I read something like this It was in the Breitbart article about the exact same thing which reads Also, it would definitely have added a new dimension had James Earl Jones been cast The salty old royal naval officer called out of retirement for one last trip across the English Channel, or if Ice T and Snoop Dogg Had been given the role of two ageing rappers who parachute from the Dakota to administer weed to the desperate troops Or if Oprah appeared in a cameo as Queen Mary welcoming the returning troops after their desperate voyage but it wouldn't have been historically authentic Now I'm not saying that Brooks stumbled over this article in his favorite fake news outlet and just copied What's in it with a couple of slight changes? It's just a weird coincidence, probably although the article was released four days before Brooks videos uploaded Make of that what you want The Breitbart article finishes with the sentence The guy from USA Today. He does know its history, right? Well, I know its history, so let's listen to Brooks for a bit more and look at some of the claims he makes Brooks: because I can't think of anything that would bring me out of a world war two movies immersion more than seeing a woman in the French or British military Because guess what guys those armies were almost Completely made up of white men 3 Arrows: Now Brooke starts off by saying he can't think of anything that would take him out of the movie more than seeing a woman in the British or French military which is really weird because there were women in uniform at Dunkirk as part of the ATS which was the woman's branch of the British military not only that they were Dunkirk a part of them was even evacuate alongside the men on our most women of the ATS were evacuated later an operation area It's weird that he picks This as a deal-breaker for him and not things like you know These guys not wearing helmets in an active battle zone or that this are supposed to be 300,000 people or that the pamphlets and the movie looked nothing like the real ones Almost like he's the one being obsessed with gender and race Anyway, he then goes on to say that the British and French army were almost completely made up of white men Which I can only assume stems from an assumption that a lot of people have about these armies It weren't really only France and Britain who were at war with the axis it was the French and British Empire in 1939 the population of the British Empire was about 25% of the entire worlds population and Naturally they drew a lot of their forces from there Just like the French did even when talking specifically about Dunkirk, which was fairly early in the war so Britain Hadn't fully mobilized its Dominion forces yet there were still about four contingents from British India You know the part of the British Empire which provided the largest volunteer army in history making up about 2.5 million men of the British forces by the end of the war one of, them named Jim Adam maole that can even earned an Indian Distinguished Service Medal for gallantry at Dunkirk for quote "showing magnificent courage Coolness and decision when his troops was shelled from the ground and bombed from the air by an enemy He promptly reorganized his men and animals, got them off the road and under cover under extremely difficult conditions It was due to this initiative and the confidence he inspired that it was possible to extricate his troops without loss and men or animals" Now the Indians only made up a fraction of the troops at the beaches of Dunkirk But this doesn't extrapolate to the fact that the armies of World War 2 were almost Completely made up of white men and because he hasn't embarrassed himself enough yet Brooks doubles down and in saying Brooks: 1940 soldiers in these battles were almost all white men. I'm sorry, but it's true 3 Arrows: Well, I'm not sorry, and it's not true, and I really have no idea which battles He is talking about here. Is he talking about the Battle of Dunkirk like he claimed the movie was about? If he had taken the time to not even open a history book But just take a quick look at the Wikipedia page for the Battle of Dunkirk he would have seen that a significant part of the French forces who were the ones holding of the Nazis to make the evacuation even possible came from French Africa and these troops later went on to form two-thirds of the Free French army under Charles de Gaulle and would continue to fight for the liberation of France from Nazi rule and even if I would grant Brooks the Battle of Dunkirk In 1940 there were still the East and West African campaign, the Mediterranean Middle Eastern theater, and the Chinese front World War two was not a white man's war. It was a world war, in every meaning of the term Let's listen to Brooks for a bit more Brooks: so with that said I really don't see how having only a couple women in the Dunkirk Movie was even a problem, but I knew if we looked hard enough someone would complain about it 3 Arrows: if he looked hard enough Someone would complain about it. Brooks himself just gave away the purpose of his video there He desperately needs something to be outraged about that He can sell to his audience as another sign that the sjw's are taking over Even if it's just a suggestion in an otherwise extremely positive review Brooks: The real problem is SJW's have gotten away with this complaining so much that they're finally jumping the shark you give them an inch and they take a mile Just like the Nazis did in 1940. 3 Arrows:Oh wow. I thought the people on the left were the ones falsely accusing people of being Nazis and besides that what is this give a thing take a mile comparison to the Nazis he was supposed to mean the only thing I can think of where this would fit is the annexation of Czechoslovakia by the Nazis following the Munich Agreement, but that happened two years before 1940 in the Battle of Dunkirk Anyway. let's listen to one last clip from the video Brooks: ( I) Personally think fiction and nonfiction Movie should both be free to cast whoever the fuck they want it can be all white or all black or diverse or whatever whatever they like Sjw's and film critics who focus on the skin colors of actors this much are just sad sad people Desperate losers who have nothing better to talk about 3 Arrows: Yeah, It's totally the writer of the review and USA Today whose Overly focused on race and gender and who is a sad sad person with nothing to talk about not the person who makes a six and a half minute video about how outrageous it is to even suggest Such a thing and don't ask me about the sudden change of backdrop This doesn't look like a beach in northern France But maybe he has a hard time keeping his audience attention and that's pretty much it folks Because besides the wrong Unsourced claims about world war II his video is more or less just a rehash of the Breitbart article mixing with the trailer for Dunkirk It's really a great example of lazy pandering to an audience who has no idea about Dunkirk But gets outraged at the mere suggestion that someone might not enjoy because of reasons they don't acknowledge as legitimate Now as I already said? I liked the movie Dunkirk despite its historical inaccuracies the focus of the movie lies on the British perspective so the ethnic Representation in the movie is fairly accurate It is this blatant misinformation that I dislike Especially by people like Brooks who clearly have no idea what they are talking about and on top of that being this ignorant about that movie about Dunkirk could very well star a ton of black or Indian people depending on what the part of the event is focused on. To make matters worse this framing of World War II as a war of white men was even partially done during World War II when the Allies seek to liberate Paris in August 1944 The commander of the Free French Army Charles de Gaulle  requested that French forces would lead the charge the response to this by the American leadership and form of Major General Walter Bedell Smith was it is more desirable that the division mentioned above Consists of white personnel which (Charles) de Gaulle than yielded to even going as far as to staff the French division leading the liberation of Paris with Spaniards Because they didn't have enough white Frenchmen available in the area now Brooks is just another reactionary on YouTube who sells outrage so his opinion doesn't really matter it just leaves a bad taste in my mouth when people downplay the sacrifices by certain groups of the Armed Forces who fought to liberate Europe from Nazi tyranny And that's it for today folks. I hope you enjoyed this one, and if you grown to like Brooks You can rest assured that this probably isn't the last time you will see him on this channel If you haven't seen Dunkirk definitely check it out.
