hi everyone and welcome back to the probably cancell podcast in Coalition with the midwestern marks Institute my name is Bridget I'm your host and today I'm here with Alexander McKay from the Marx angles lenon Institute and I'm super happy to have you here Alex how are you doing today doing very well thank you comrade it's uh good to be here with you and um speak to an American audience which is um in a country which is finally turning AC corner with regard to um organization of its own Communist party so happy to be here at an interesting time for I think both centers of um imperialism finally facing um huge challenges in the world and with uh both both of sides of the Atlantic we need to respond to that and I think things are finally moving in the right direction to a certain degree with regard to that we a lot to discuss today with regard to that and like also like I think how we got to this point and errors that have been made that uh date back quite a long way yeah yeah we're going to be talking quite a bit about the Western left the state of it its failures how we got here and probably what we can do to fix things up a little bit and I've had many requests from my listeners to have you on the podcast so it's a long overdue I'm super happy to have you here tuning in all the way from England and just to start off could you tell our audience more about the work that you do well I uh started um doing um online work on uh YouTube it's nearly five years ago now I initially started it and it was feels like um a millennial ago really because I was just out of um the Corbin era com um experiment known as the labor party during that time uh the Corin uh Le leadership which I know quite a lot of Americans uh followed with some interest and I I fell out of that because well if I started speaking about that i' I'd take an hour but in very brief terms it crystallized all the failures of the the British left for me uh inside one um concentrated period of years and so I I dropped out of that then um it was the of course the coin was destroyed by an electoral wipe out but perversely got more votes than Ki starma did winning the election this time around so there you go that's the British system for you um but I dropped out of that I started doing YouTube work then I kind of dropped off it for a while and I started a podcast called red star radio which I co-presented um for a while with a Canadian comade called Laya all the way through the um 2021 2022 um when we were we started off trying to do a Marxist analysis of um the uh the response to covid in the um in principally in Canada where she was based in Britain and the us and that actually helped develop my fors quite a lot because what I found was that so many people who called themselves marxists had a completely uncritical attitude towards uh the actions of the capitalist State uh and they'd really fallen to pieces in regards to being with regards to being able to Anze things from in terms of a in terms of class so for instance like the investigating um covid and its handling we found that like many marxists or supposed marxists just were prepared to completely go along with the idea of science being detached from the process of production so going all the way back to uh engel's work on dialectics of Nature and things that Marx wrote they were clear that science has its place within the bourgeois system of production like everything else meaning that it's there is a specific uh purpose for which the scientific process is being um this process of innovation and all the things related to it are being turned to in order to boost the profits of capital and that gives science and all of its spheres um a certain class bias and a certain um way in which it organized way in which the work is organized which promotes otes profitability over everything else and Bourgeois relations of production and Bourgeois Ideology Now that to me is quite a simple Marxist concept but so many people had forgotten it completely they just saw um they they took what I would call a sort of very hysterical liberal attitude towards all of these things they couldn't understand that um that this that science is not something with it is a purely like objective process divorce from the laws of production again like couldn't see it wouldn't see it and so that that was a big moment for me in terms of developing my understanding is like oh right we really are [ __ ] because if you can't understand something that's there in black and white from Engles himself and if you're starting to think that like something which is so crucial for capitalist production which is science and Science and Innovation be it medical science or engineering or anything else then you can't understand anything and then we got to just the understanding that so many people had with regard to the role of the state like people were getting excited about oh the state's enforcing Public Health measures it's like yeah against workers you know they kept like um they were protecting if any if anybody um the the ruling class you know people who worked in warehouses people who worked in um retail people who worked in delivery or dealing or or in the health sector itself or still going to work every day right but these people who called themselves marxists had completely lost the plot it's like oh wow the state's um enforcing Health measures again it's like well are you not looking at the set of class relations this is based on and what became obvious was that there so many people who call themselves marxists in Britain and in Canada and the United States aren't marxists at all they're so social Democrats uh in the sense that they understand politics as being um simply being State Market dichotomy meaning that they see they completely swallow like the arguments made by bouro politicians regarding oh well we have the state over here and the market over here and here's the debates about the fact that the two apparently never meet despite the fact that that's not true and was never true it's only true in like the propaganda of like a you know a Ted Cruz or a Bernie Sanders um but that's the understanding you have of all these people had it's like well if the state does something it must be good never mind that the uh the set of class relations the state is built on is inherently hostile to the working class or the but and again like the more we dug into it and the more I read into the Marxist tradition the more I realize that my own knowledge PRI prior to this had been shockingly poor uh my own theoretical uh understanding and my own practical understanding was lacking in the extreme and that was and i' and i' prior to that I'd held positions in trade unions and in um another political party in this country that can remain nameless unless it's funny to name it um but it was trotskyite party and I realized that oh my god I've been going around confidently speaking on platforms for years for about six or seven years and turns out I didn't know anything um and I'm only just starting to realize that how little I actually knew about the tradition I considered myself to be a part of for years and it was all during 2021 that I made this realization and that opened up a whole it was what I would call a deeply humbling experience but a necessary one because you realize like only when you realize like how little do you know how little did I know I'm like oh my God I I was typical of this problem which is like you read some few excerpts of Marx in my case filtered through trosky and then you speak about it confidently enough and suddenly you're a leading Marxist where it's an actual fact you know you know you know you're a Social Democrat with you know pretentious aspirations um and what I discovered what by the time 2022 rolled around I come to the conclusion that in the United States the entire left was B Bas were basically just New Deal Democrats that's all they were um in Canada they're all just um you know adjuncts of Justin Trudeau's liberals in Britain they all float around the or they're in the orbit of the labor party and in the case of you know same in France same in Germany same well not Italy a little bit different but same basic problem which is that they have never moved beyond the desire to to go back to the period of Reform that existed from about where in America 33 to mid-60s uh new deal period in Britain 45 to mid-70s um welfare capitalist period so this is my rather long way of saying during this sort of extended period of realizing this is this is a huge problem it forced me into a long period of like reading and reflection uh where I thought well this our big problem is that the things that describe themselves as left are either hysterical screeching ultral lefts who spend all their Time online denouncing everybody and they're in a really a sort of unspoken partnership with a much more cynical collection of people who call themselves marxists but are in actual fact social Democrats who just push people back towards the labor party or push people back towards the Democrats because you know you got to stop fascism right in the form of what Donald Trump or in our case the Tories or Nigel farage and just the the that realization was a huge leap forward for me because then I realized that well okay I've spent now two years doing all this reading I feel I've reached a certain level of understanding so with regard to the projects like my former podcast F and I moved on to do other things and I decided to keep going but almost by accident I ended up doing it doing this on YouTube because I thought well it's got to reach a a bigger audience somehow and what I want to encourage people to do is to go through the same process that I went through which is go back to go back to the fundamentals redis reread all the stuff that you took a glimpse that when you were 18 and thought you understood it oras in actual fact realize how little you know learn the humility of failure and embrace that and then go back and examine all these things seriously this time and once you do you realize that we've been going wrong for 70 years AFC in reality at both sides of the Atlantic and in Western Europe we mistook uh I say we the collective we we mistook one period of reform in exceptional circumstances for a fundamental change when it wasn't and then when the capitalists inevitably as they were always going to do turned around and started to take things back again because you know periods of Reform always end that way no one knew what to do and they didn't know what to do because the the Communists in Britain and the United States and other places had essentially abandoned Marxism really by the mid-50s and had basically just attached themselves in your case to the left of the Democrats in our case to the left of the labor party and spare and they went from tactical alignments with the social Democrats in the like 30s to making it into an absolute hard and fast rule that you had to attach yourself to the social democracy in the the 50s and the 60s onwards and never trying to develop like a real Vanguard operation ever since then and just basically saying that their their runs for office were tokenistic they stopped trying to actually develop worker militants they just Rec started recruiting students every every year and then firing them up and going through burning them out recruiting another bunch and then they their whole thing ends up like imploding in the 90s until what we have now is just basically a pale shadow of what existed before excuse me and it it starts really before most of us um either watching this or um watching my own programs were even born but you realize that the the the Arc of history is very very long and goes beyond Beyond many human lifetimes sometimes and to realize that our task now is to correct mistakes that were made decades decades ago is a bit of a big realization but again this is what I hope to encourage people to do which is to examine this and to embrace the idea that we can be part of a rectification process here uh and there's never been a more important time to do it because you can see the the system which has the the imperialist system now is running the sand running out of the egg timer here it really is and there's never been a more important time to actually Rectify these mistakes so that's my rather long- winded and slightly digressing way of answering your question I hope hope I've addressed you that I have so much to say back to everything you just said so I'm going to just Whittle it down to spare everybody but uh I'm glad you I'm glad you said all of that because that was going to be my next question was kind of like your your personal ideological Journey I'm always curious in people's backgrounds and um Co was a super enlightening time for me as well because I also saw how people were just falling for everything Hook Line and Sinker and I was quite vocal about the whole thing and got a lot of backlash from the I mean it's crazy still the belief science people are the least scientific of them all and I still see this when I go to Liberal are near where I live and there are people wearing surgical masks while they're walking outside in fresh air and it's like I mean even like to to this day I recently saw that and uh I'm like don't you I mean the data is out on these types of masks I thought we all were aware that these cloth masks and surgical M don't do anything and I thought you believe science but anyway um your right that it all is about getting back to the fundamentals and I find that Western Communists people who call themselves marxists or Communists will always repeat Mouse combat liberalism that's like a very popular phrase but nobody's really ready to shed the layers of liberalism that we have been brought up under because it is a proc it's like a process of shedding uh and when I went through that process of shedding it felt amazing but also it was really amazing and I I mean I'm still uncovering new layers to this day but it takes a certain type of person to be able to admit that to uh and it is it can be a process with a lot of cognitive dissonance that a lot of people do not want to face and you can come to positions that in the eyes of your peers will throw a lot of scrutiny at you or even like straight up excommunicate you in this day and age in the political climate within the left but I commend you for uh going through that process and also standing strong in your convictions and speaking about it on your show I'm going to link your YouTube channel in the show notes so everyone can go and watch it because every single every single episode you put out is so incredibly informative and such a great resource to have uh I'm so glad that somebody like you is taking the initiative to do this educational work because you really hit the nail on the head every time so let's go into my next question I suppose um how would you outline the failures of Western Marxism and especially in comparison to the Marxism of the East which US in the west typically do not get to see we don't really have I mean a lot of it is in other languages um the way people are thinking that Communists are thinking in the East like how would you how would you view that I think the the root of the failure um certainly in in British and I think in American terms as well is a failure to actually reckon properly with the the full implications of being Imperial core country countries and I don't mean in the sense of you know the um what's his name Sakai the Settler's book I don't mean in that sense I mean in the sense that what it does in terms of the um the distortions it introduces within the domestic working class movement that Engles started to outline and that Lenin outlined further in imperialism the highest stage of capitalism like we've never reckoned with truly like the divisions in the working class itself starting with as Len as Lenin pointed out the fact that the reason why the second International failed all the way back in 1914 violated all of its um its promises and its commitments to call a general strike in the event of of an imperialist war was because its uh its leadership um had become corroded by be obtaining a privileged relatively privileged position within the Imperial core countries uh that in terms of the the Parliamentary fractions who were quite cushioned from um reality and also the leading elements in the trade unions and amongst the skilled workers who had gained more from imperialism than the unskilled workers so there was a division there in the working class all the way back in 1914 which Lenin pointed out and which caused the second International to collapse and which caused a section of the the working class to be led into the war in Britain and in France and in Germany and I think there was an attempt to deal with that in the early days of the communist movement in Europe and there was some success made there in terms of the need to unify the working class and to have a consistently Anti-Imperialist position and to explain properly that when a nation dominates another one um the working class at home cannot be truly free either and also the understanding of imperialism as a as a system in terms of its um it is ultimately spelling death for the domestic working class anyway regardless of temporary gains because of its um there the inevitable decline of profitability and inevitable move towards de-industrialization and asset stripping of both uh the domestic economy the exporting of production the um the the the deskilling and uh demoralization and atomization of the working pass domestically um which is all outlined by Lenin as early as 1916 but apparently people stopped reading this and then as we were covering in the previous section of the program the the the big failure comes in the mistakes made after World War II in Europe where the biggest communist parties who had played this heroic role in the resistance of against the Nazis and the fascists in Italy and France who had the they were massive organizations with millions of PE millions of workers following them by the end of the' 40s these had already taken a Social Democratic turn as had the British version which was smaller I know in the American case there was much more State repression of the cpusa and they were repressed and driven out of the unions and the American ruling class made a very serious and sustained attempt to literally break Marxism away from the working class through a combination of um repression and reform um in the in the USA there was less of that here but there was the Social Democratic collapse again in the Communist parties in uh France and Italy so that by the 50s the French Communist party is tacitly supporting the war against Algeria in the on the grounds they wanted to get a coalition again with the French social Democrats who were pro-imperialist the Italian Communists started supporting coalitions with like Christian democrats and social Democrats that never really came to fruition because the US imperialism called the shots in Italy and was opposed to that but they wanted to do it anyway and were prepared to make all kinds of concessions the upshot of all of this is that even when revolutionary events potentially emerged such as in France in ' 68 or Italy from 68 to what the mid 1970s the Communist parties or even in Britain from about 67 to arguably about 85 when the working class comes under attack when the the reforms start to be clawed back again the Communist parties who should have been in a position to lead a revolutionary struggle as the class struggle changed its Tempo again and moved into a much more aggressive class war being waged by the the ruling class they were so committed to reformism by that stage that they were unable and unwilling to move into a revolutionary um situation or to make the most of a revolutionary situation leading uh to series of problems whereby positively anti-marxist Trends got embraced by those workers and students who had become frustrated with the old communist parties this is part of the reason why um Herbert maruse catches on it's part of the reason why like what I would call bastardization of maoism catch on that sounded really revolutionary and denounced the Soviet Union as Bure bureaucratic or social imperialist or the very incorrectly but you get all of these things which sound Ultra Ultra left but in in a dialectical way only leads to an ultra right and opportunist position so that catches on precisely because of the fa the real failures of the Communist part's post 60s and of course with that comes a load of what I will just Technic I think it's technically referred to as crap um that um is now constitutes the the bulk of what the left is concerned with so um the the turn towards um the uncritical Embrace of what is referred to as um the sexual Revolution which contains certain Elements which are positive and a lot of elements which are not because again you do something like that that's some that process carry is carried out under a decaying form of capitalism imperialism then it's going to produce along with a certain element of positive change an awful lot of negativity because you're already in a decaying system and a rotting culture and so when you get that um degree of uh should we say reform coming out or the certain elements of relaxation of um in in this case cultural and moral Norms capitalism moves in and exploits that and the problem is that because the again like the the Communists had stopped actually presenting Marxism leninism as a worldview and uh this is something I discussed with u um mut Mutual comrade Carlos when he brought a book out on the on on this very thing and it's important to realize how much of a devastating impact like the Communist part is failing to present Marxism leninism as a as a world view had on things because suddenly they the proletar was left without guidance when all of these different sort of social explosions took place if you have Marxism lism as a worldview and you're able to analyze the total set of relations you can understand why capitalism Embraces certain aspects of What's called the sexual Revolution because you can use it to sell things because you can use it to manipulate people because you can use it to U mislead the working class into dead ends it's you can use it to justify all kinds of hideous stuff um which I've only just of research myself and and then you get the left instinctively then defending it because the left from the late 60s has again just adopted a sort of marxist tinged libertinism and uh as its guiding principle uh because like the the idea of the left in U British and American terms just became basically like a a sad sort of um bad a bad photocopy of 1960s radicalism over and over and over again till he get to the point in the '90s when what's the left and about in America and Britain it's about what um free the weed that was the big thing when I was uh when I was a teenager um um basically uh headism of various different varieties and defending whatever it is that the um the latest trend on um in in Academia is I.E whatever Verso books are publishing about this week and that's basically and you do find people and I you do find people in the left who are older who don't agree with that but because they're all in opportunist organizations who are dependent upon getting a new tranch of students in every year and never developing them never training them never actually educating them but just pandering to them they end up with all their organizations held hostage by basically screaming incoherent idiots because again it's their own fault they never trained them they recruited opportunistically they never engaged critically with any of these people's pre-existing beliefs and just allowed them to take over all their organizations so no wonder it's a mess but again to go back and reemphasize the point about how we got here we got here because the Communist parties abdicated responsibility after the after the end of World War II and again this was even being criticized by people like Andre janov by the late 40s he was already commenting upon the fact that the Italian and the French parties said have basically been compromising and capitulating and that was formalized in the British case in 1951 what I was saying about the the erors go about years because they became essentially Social Democratic and more and more bureaucratic and aifi organizations like what they should have been doing which is training um caders to be ready for the moment when the reform process did end they just pretended that if they just kept pushing the Dem the social Democrats to the left then the reform process could continue you know vote labor you know vote um vote vote for the uh the French socialists to get a coalition with the French Communists you know or in the case of 68 the French Communists even though there was a massive workers Rebellion basically backed up deal and didn't um didn't take a didn't move into um the Revolutionary situation that emerged there and you do all that you you end up with a a generation of disillusioned and angry people who are looking for answers and find them in all kinds of stupid places like um you know what used to be referred to as individual terrorism you B mhof Urban gorilla Concepts stuff like that um so-called um you know liberatory trends that involved you know going into the middle of America and opening opening up a commune um uh anarchism of various different varieties all the stuff that floats around now all comes from these errors in that period the abandonment of Marxism lism the abandonment of serious education processes and also the then consequently when the class struggle in Britain and elsewhere was severely damaged by the defeats inflicted in the 80s then the abandonment of the working class itself and the Perpetual seeking of easy answers be it in our case like Scottish or Welsh nationalism or um uh you know know pursuing pursuing an easy answer in the form of like uh opportunistic anti-war work which doesn't mention imperialism or um environmentalism but with with zero class content and just embracing borar environmentalism and again the route is all there over 50 years ago but the full consequences are only I think really visible to us now yeah here in the United States the default of the left is I mean if you're not of democrat people people also like to distinguish between leftists and Democrats and at this point I don't even bother because they both believe the same thing essentially it's just you know it's repackaged differently but uh the leftist like the radical left form by default here in the United States is anarchism and you still get a lot of [ __ ] for being a communist here and we we're definitely the minority here among the left um because most leftists think that Communists are fascists so I mean when I lived in Portland if you were to call yourself a communist in Portland when I lived there Portland Oregon you would probably be banned from certain bars and establishments just for being a communist like that's really how it is and I it makes sense especially in the United States where one of the other mainstream uh ideological Trends is libertarianism were all raised very individualistically and during the McCarthy era and the state repression the government really U the anti on the left libertarianism among the left to to crush the Communists organizing here and turn everybody into anarchistic free loving drugged out burnout hippies uh so it's interesting you bring up the free love stuff because one thing that really bothers me is is the people who cite Alexander colen as a polyamorous like a free love liberal person but they I mean if you read her she literally says that you know relations between men and women cannot be essentially polymer she doesn't use that word but she's like no we cannot divert from monogamy under capitalism because it's just going to [ __ ] [ __ ] up way more but of course nobody nobody's reading that I they just repeat it blindly I guess well they read like the title red love and then decide that well that that that will we try and reenact that in my in my commune or squat you know or they read um the a line or a pass or paragraph from engel's origin of the family private property in the state where he talks about uh the end of the Bourgeois family or the the similar passages from The Communist Manifesto never contextualizing it never reading the whole whole explanation for which is which is in brief um the the family takes various different forms of dependent upon the mod of production and when the mod of production changes new forms of uh the family will emerge as socialism grows into communism as the you know the hunter gatherer extended Clan family moved into different things when we moved beyond the hunter gatherer stage and into the settled stage these things are relatively easy to explain when you take the trouble to actually read it but unfortunately a lot of people don't and you end up with stupid um to use the britishism [ __ ] uh declaring that you know communism means the end the the liquefying of all social bonds basically which he never does and but that that and of course those people have promoted and given book deals because that's what the ruling class wants the average worker to think communism stands for which is some weirdo who probably has a very questionable history uh basically trying to set himself up as some sort of strange cult leader calling himself a Marxist and you know that's what's that's what's promoted by the ruling class for very good reasons and just to go back to the uh 60s hippie stuff like the the more you read into that uh without wanting to come across as like too conspiratorial at this stage more you see that each stage the American and British states were involved in this and we're promoting it now the the cliche of the 60s is oh it's the squares versus the the free loving people whereas in actual fact the various different intelligence Services were engaged in pushing asset in the United States for a long time Timothy ly was an intelligence asset various others big-time hippie AP names were either from very Bourgeois families or had some s of shady connection with American intelligence and the idea that the Revolution was going to come through a bunch of middle class guys sitting in San Francisco off their Chumps while you know Charles Manson roves around in the background being you know programmed by a CIA doctor or something um that is hilarious to think that that was ever taken seriously but it was well Bob we of the Grateful Dead goes to Bohemian Grove and sits and chats with the director of the CIA there like it's I mean it's crazy how people don't know this and a lot of people here in the US at least will spend their entire lives following that banned around from venue to venue show to show for years just taking acid and I I completely believe sorry this is tangent I completely believe that uh these shows these Grateful Dead shows were like everyone is on hallucinogens was some was and is some sort of acid test like government experiment on what happens when you give these drugs to a mass of people all the time same time I'm like I'm pretty convinced of that I think you're right I mean I've only come to that conclusion recently I have you dig more into it there's so much government involvement at each stage of the development of various different street drugs like not just um acid and all the experiments that they were doing certainly in the United States we know less about the British end I would bet that there similar kind of thing was going on because you know the the British and American states work alongside each other um same with uh I mean it's very well established the cia's involvement with the cocaine trade and the crack wve hits America in the 80s um the you know what what role was opium production in Afghanistan playing seems pretty obvious now um get the U the the way in which the uh the Taliban of all people cut it down and when it you know it goes through the roof under American and British control then it falls down again and like the American and British ruling classes have been involved in the drug trade in the British case for a hell of a long time so what are we saying that suddenly in the 60s that they became hostile to it what because Nixon said some bad things and wanted a War on Drugs no oh that's the other thing is the common the commonly held position of uh leftists and anti anti-establishment people here is that they really think that the government like doesn't want us to do these hallucinations they don't want want us like they Don't Legalize It because they don't want us to know the truth and that I mean once once you know the true history you're like H I think we definitely do want you to turn on tune in and drop out like more than you realize oh yeah and like the I think it's it's a strange thing that people can't see beyond surf the surface you know people who consider themselves to be Marxist can't see be on the surface so like okay well laws are always written by the Bourgeois in their interest so why wouldn't the law in with with regard to drugs and the drug war be written in the same way which is if you're um somebody who uh uh wants wants to get off their face and on a regular basis the state is perfectly happy for you to do that and they're also perfectly happy for people to deal in drugs and periodically the state will lock people up who deal in drugs or who take it if it's a political priority for them to go after certain people War on Drugs in Britain and the United States was much more about going after certain political groups than it was about actually preventing drug consumption if you're just sat on your and Saving Face yeah if you just s on your couch high as hell um not not engaging in any political activity then that's fine you know um but the the the depth of involvement of the of the various governments and the drug trade is so obvious by now but people are still insisting that oh they don't want you to take it it's like well why why in that case why are they so heavily involved in it and that and the ca that and the fact that you're insisting that the the politicians who might believe in the things that they say about anti-drug stuff are the ones that making the decisions they're not you know politicians are here today gone tomorrow and get a reward if they're good from the ruling class the state's permanent you know and that's why I don't refer to it as the Deep State it's just as the state you know and its operations are massive and they cover a huge variety of like uh both the both criminal and legal Endeavors in terms of their operations to maintain the rule of the ruling class who are smaller now than in number than they ever have been and so they need to use more tricks than ever to keep people divided and demoralized and Confused to me it's just it once you know that then the the true role of like drugs and narcotics and everything associated with it becomes much more clear and the fact that so many people in the United States and Britain um whove been involved heavily in like various forms of drug dealing have also been open assets of the various different intelligence Services over the years like the two run alongside each other going and in our case to repeat the point it goes back to the Opium Wars like again do do we really think that the British state has suddenly changed its policy on these things no they've found the drug trade useful to themselves for nearly two centuries same with other aspects of of what they refer to as criminality same with um the arms trade obviously very big in that same with the sex trade um they've always used that there's a reason why British and American protectorates are some of the worst places for drug running weapon smuggling and people smuggling and everything else that goes with it uh worst places in the world for like the sex trade are apparently um like Kosovo um in terms of Europe Israel um like uh one of even the Israeli press admits how bad a place that is and yet it's not a coincidence that Ukraine the horror stories that come out of there not a coincidence that these are all Imperial protectorates so do we do we take seriously the claims of the politicians that they're against all these things no not for a moment we shouldn't anyway and then the leftists are like just Legalize It All yeah Legalize It you know Bob Marley said it I think in a song so it must be good what can go wrong I mean I I used to work in the weed industry uh what seems like a lifetime ago but I worked in the first ever uh medical marijuana farmers market in Washington state in 20 this is 2011 and at that time when I was working at this farmers market the uh local elections had come up and Washington was going to decide of whether or not they should legalize marijuana and of course everyone in Washington was going to vote Yes legalize it but everyone who was working in the industry was trying to press like we should not legalize this like we should not be legalized because once that happens then it's going to become monopolized and all of the small farmers are going to lose their Farms that they've had for like 50 years you know multiple decade long farms and like it's just going to turn into Walmart weed with the like crazy strong crazy uh toxic from pesticides and I mean every it was just funny to see like the internal workings of uh the politics of drug legalization and now I'm very I'm very against weed like in general today but um The General public just assumes that like nothing will go wrong when you legalize weed and now a decade in thousands of people are being admitted to the ER for psychotic breaks and schizophrenia induced by this like Monster marijuana that's produced in these Mega Farms so look where it's leading us well it's it's also very uh useful um again for the ruling class to to antiz people um um or to render them incapable of um of critical thought which is why I think in terms of in organizational terms um you got to insist U to people if you want to be an active communist then you've got to be essentially get get your mind together and get off this stuff uh really because you you can't be engaging with uh or trying to build a party organization amongst the amongst the wider working class if you're off your head because you're just not capable um and the the drug will render you incapable of doing anything productive I I understand why people get stuck on it I understand why people like take it because like if you're looking for some kind of way to like literally numb yourself to like the frustrations of this the this society that we live in and it is an appealing Prospect but now the state is quite literally pushing it at you um you should be very wary of that take a step back because the the things they push on you whether it's bad food bad booze or bad drugs these none of these things are good for you um and you have to wake up to the point that like this the the ruling class do literally do not care if they poison the working class because you know there's plenty more where they came from uh we are all utterly disposable to them always have been and like no matter what they say now about you know oh we we've learned from the the horrors of our past no the system dictates that the ruling class will always see the proletariat essentially as a disposable tool and therefore it doesn't matter like what [ __ ] they feed you what they tell what they push on you what garbage culture they immerse you in because there's plenty more where you came from and that's their attitude and Until you realize that then it get it get over this idea that they that they have there is any value on human life to them whatsoever and get over this this the what I would call the sort of the human rights propaganda model that's pushed on us with the the idea that these nations that we live in are ruled by people who care about individual rights whatsoever they want you to believe that you do because that's the that's the propaganda but in reality just as always it's a Bourgeois dictatorship and the only right that matters is Bourgeois right not ours we're cattle we're cattle to them they view us like cattle and my God you I don't know if you saw on Twitter [ __ ] [ __ ] Twitter uh when the student protest for Palestine were happening on the University campuses there was a huge discourse on Twitter for like a week about whether or not people should be doing drugs and having sex with people in tents at the protest like that was like a huge discourse for for like one or two weeks I I do remember that I I think just I mean if that's what you're going there to do a that's pretty [ __ ] sad and and B well how do we think that the FBI or in our case MI5 operates in terms of getting stuff on people drugs sex booze gambling in the past as well like if you if you're out there doing that you've already compromised yourself likely in a hundred different ways it just goes to show people who think that it's all about that they are tourists they are unserious people and you have to be absolutely clear about that like if you you have to conduct yourself in a disciplined fashion if you're going to go around and apparently try and act as a communist in these movements you got to be that you got to be much more serious than the left has been over the last 50 to 60 years because what you just said let's go to this place get high and like you know engage in some kind of sex capade well that's been their attitude now for decades and all it's led to is a everybody having a a giant FBI or MI5 file filled with your weaknesses and your vices that can be you know deployed strategically later so it's a very unserious mindset and people have again this is all the stuff that's got to be left behind that you know claiming that you know going out and going to the gym and exercising is somehow fascist you oh my God I can't believe that people think that that's insane holy sh well I literally had this argument a while ago um it was like is like it all comes back to the fact that like fascists are all obsessed with like you know the whole Aesthetics of like muscular men and all that kind of stuff but as a comrade pointed out like they act that's the the fascist athetic um and the fascist like um you know promotion of like the the square Jord individual that kind of thing was a bastardization of ideals that were ripped off from communism like communism promoted the new Soviet man promoted new Soviet woman together as equal Partners in actually building socialism course fascism being a essentially a a Bourgeois ripoff Act of certain a aesthetic aspects of the communist movement of the time in order to tap into the Mass Appeal those Aesthetics did have and then bastardizing them like polluted all of that but you remember that the reason the reason why the Bourgeois ripped off those Aesthetics is because those are strong and positive or they were Point towards you know a better healthier future for proletarians which is what we we were meant to Aspire to to allow that to be polluted by like the obsessions of Hitler and musolini who were deliberately ripping it off um is foolish and to elevate the idea that the idea what the ideal Marxist is some um fat um porn obsessed drug adult shuttin who never goes outside and spends all his time posting like that be when that became the ideal like that should have been the moment when people started asking questions well I've also been thinking a lot lately about uh at least 21st century war on beauty and this an intentional promotion it seems it to be an intentional promotion of just ugliness is happening I don't know what's going on especially in the Fashion World fashion today is so ugly in like a demoralizing in a demoralizing and demeaning and devaluing way and I see I I feel like leftists really promote this idea that I mean classical Beauty like the Soviets were really promoting that they were really promoting that in their artwork in the Soviet realism it was all really beautiful like classical style paintings but with a new like a new twist and to combat that you know we had the Congress for cultural Freedom promoting the modernist art and postmodernist art that really just scrambles everything up I'm really seeing that today in in the Fashion World in particular which is really interesting um and also in cartoons like Cartoon like even kids cartoons have gotten super hideous I don't know if anybody else has noticed this but I grew up watching like Disney's Fantasia the original one that is super just absolutely amazing the Soviets had an amazing an uh handrawn animation cartoons used to be really beautiful and today kids cartoons are like hideous I don't know have you noticed this um I haven't because I I I don't watch a lot of that but I I've seen some um explanations of this which might relate also partly to like um the the a general degeneration in sort of Standards uh coming from monopolization so like the I know that they Outsource a lot of the animation to the cheapest place Studio they can possibly find get it done as quickly and as cheaply as possible but the other side of it which you were talking about the Embrace of ugliness is to my mind the root of that comes from the fact that imperialism in us and British terms is a decaying culture in the fact that it it can't produce anything positive anymore it can only extract vampire like from around the world it can't produce anything uh decent in terms of culture anymore it can only and it can't produce a vision of the future that is positive for anybody so what it prod wants to produce in culture I think is demoralization and an acceptance that things are only going to get worse and uglier and so therefore a promotion of like the worst sort of degenerate aspects in culture makes sense because what the two things you want to encourage people to do is a accept the fact that you are an atomized and lonely individual or collection of individuals who are not part of anything wider for whom there is no future there is no hope so the what they want to do is to push people from the earliest possible age into embracing hopelessness and um embracing of like um vices as the only Freedom you can have the as like uh and also it sort of embracing crudity and embracing like um violence and savagery and self-centeredness and uh all of those things that um all of those aspects of like the culture in the Western European and American states um of these imperialist states is symptomatic they want you to get used to it and they want you to embrace it as good and I think that lies at the root of a lot of things and the fact that there's no that all the Aesthetics are so terrible um partly comes through like cheap production but also because at root the people who design a lot of this stuff don't believe in anything positive because there's nothing positive for them to actually see so it's all just based on hey everything's like falling apart and looks ugly and disgusting disgusting so let's Embrace that and call it good which is like why a lot of the like the middle class left just embrace all the hideousness and call it good because there's no positive vision of the future and there's no positive vision of the future because for the left there's no concept anymore uh that we have a future to build where the working class becomes the ruling class that's gone in the left that went many decades ago but if you do believe that the the America and British proletariat can free us from the legacies of imperialism and actually build something a new then you start to develop um in my view aesthetic choices based on that positive future you start to see um possibilities open up again and therefore that leads to wanting to have um stronger Aesthetics and more um shall we say um inspirational Aesthetics to actually convey that message to people in the people fashion if your point of view is let's sit here rot away in Decay and get high then you don't need strong Aesthetics to do that you just need to embrace all the ugliness and filth around you yeah it's like it's a total Embrace and I think an intentional push of laziness and in the fashion world you're your right is probably like they're just [ __ ] lazy I think a lot of these designs are also being uh created by AI at this point too like some sometimes I see stuff I'm like this this outfit is literally just this whole collection from this uh brand has to be done by AI That's the only way that they're able to pump up uh pump out this much garbage but people are totally embracing it and it's really interesting to see I mean I I am really fascinated by jenz and their Embrace of this like it looking like you got dressed in the dark and that's like that's in Vogue that's the cool way to cool way to be anyway enough of that um the last thing that I wanted to talk to you about before I let you go is uh identity politics and this is something we talk about on my podcast all the time and I feel like we can never talk about it enough because it is such a huge issue within communist organizing and uh the party that you're a member of the Communist Party Great Britain ml a few years ago put out amazing pamphlet specifically about identity politics and the reactionary forces behind it I kind of just wanted to get your analysis of identity politics uh in its current form and how that's going so far well um I think it stems from it's its Origins go back to what we were discussing earlier which is the it's an Embrace of the idea that um there is no Collective Liberation anymore because the again the left gives up on the working class as the Revolutionary agent um Herbert maruse and the new Left became increasingly open about that uh from in the mid-60s onwards so if you've displaced the working class as the as the future ruling class and that you've declared that the working class is hopelessly corrupted and can't lead the revolution anymore then well who is your revolutionary agent and in the case of like the certain aspects of the American and British left it's either racial minorities uh to a degree um or uh those who are excluded from society um be that by sexuality or so-call gender identity or U whatever other category you want to put in there once you've decided that it's the excluded who are the Revolutionary subject and yet capitalism keeps changing so that the the people who had been previously excluded on mass then are then somewhat embraced by the system in that a Bourgeois of that group can join um The Wider ruling class which is what happened in a lot of those struggles in the 1960s once that's happened then you're you're looking for narrower and narrower groups who you can claim are still excluded to become the Revolutionary subject and that's why they end up on gender ideology because all the way through the 90s and 2000s in America and Britain we got to the point where the the the the changes in Bourgeois law reached the point where you could now be openly uh gay and lesbian and be a member of the ruling class and actually be celebrated for it if you were a member of the ruling class the only thing that really matters is your Capital after all um so you know that that struggles out uh because there's you know if you're a left middle- class leftist looking for grant money in the NGO world no money in that anymore so we got to find another uh another cause so there's gender ideology or there's um sex positivity so-called or there's you know prostitution legalization um all of which by the way has come up at various Union conferences I've been at over the last decade and has been endorsed uh by all of them uh because again like this is this is the constant quest for a new revolutionary subject which isn't the proletariat as a whole and that's incentivized by loads of many structures in um in in Western societies NOS principally amongst them ruling class encourages all of this stuff and so when you end up with gender ideology as the big core celebrs because they've decided they've all lighted upon this because the um you know uh men who and is mostly men involved in this who suddenly decide that they are they're women now they're like the apparently the most excluded subject of all that's what the claim is among from these people and if you've decided that then you're going to hysterically defend it because um that that's the your entire understanding of the world is that these are the most oppressed people over here they this is this is where the revolution is being fought I've actually had people scream this at me um and but it all comes down to the fact that they they abandoned the idea of the working class as as as the new ruling class as the the the class that he's going to over come class divisions and just Embrace this ever shifting identitarian stew that every time that they found they fed an ideal subject of Oppression the ruling class then elevated some of them and then the ruling class duly elevated some of the the gender idealogues and the the trans Warriors so to speak so even that's like now running to a dead end but the the identity politics is promoted Rel relentlessly by the ruling class because it's also a fundamentally individualistic view uh world view it's a fundamentally individualistic worldview because it basically boils down struggles to matters of like individual rights and individual claims upon rights and they need to construct new legal regimes within the existing state and within the existing bouris state so another group can get another set of Rights attached to it it's fragmentary it's atomizing and again the ruling class is really happy with this really happy with this and also the idea that um you know that this group is like the the trans group is now the most excluded and the most oppressed when the you know the certain of their representatives are being given like TV shows on like by the BBC uh um is like it's ridiculous like it's a fundamentally irrational uh mode of analysis because not doing any analysis um and the obsession with it again goes back to the fact that first of all this is an acceptable mode of struggle that is allowed to you by the ruling class and for many people on the left because they're involved in the NGO world they're involved in Academia or the bureaucracy of the Trade union movement that kind of struggle is great because you never take on the power of the employers you never take on the power of the state in fact bits of the state are backing you up and you can have a nice career for yourself battling oppression purely online calling yourself like I don't know a gender Warrior maist from the 25th Century or something um and you can be and again you can keep the grant money coming in you can keep your job as an academic you can never feel like the Dead Hand of the state on your shoulder as people do who actually do engage in real struggles such as um bitter labor disputes or the struggle against um real struggles against British and US imperialism via the struggle against against the Israeli perpetrated genocide people involved in that movement get arrested beaten up they get they lose their jobs the the middle class left doesn't really want to get involved in any of that they want to have a fight against um a phantom version of what they call fascism that doesn't really exist they can want they want to battle that online all day because that's what that their lies security whilst looking like a radical which is what like a tendency of the left has always chased after I mean Marx was criticizing these people in the 1840s armchair radicals Etc the thing is for us the problem is that after so many years of defeats and disaster the armchair radicals was all that was left and so therefore for those of us who want to recreate things we have to start by critically analyzing the so-called Marxism of the armchair radicals or the online radicals and picking it to Pieces demonstrating why it's anti-marxist why it's anti-materialist why it's anti-worker why it can't lead anywhere and why it's not supposed to lead anywhere and I think the the the documents produced by my party during the the controversy with the ID poll people a few years ago have actually it turns out to be quite valuable in guiding other comrades through this similar struggle but again we we start our rebuilding process by criticizing what is the the edifice The Wretched edifice that Western leftism in is in order that people understand and we what it is and what what we are and you know to paraphrase M we draw clear dividing lines between ourselves and the enemy everybody says combat liberalism nobody reads the essay it's attached to because what what it's actually about is investigating the Bourgeois ideology that is there within us uh it's nobody this is a matter of casting blame this is just what we grow up with we we grow up from from the earliest possible point in our lives um when you know our parents turn the radio on or turn the TV on or you have a you know an iPad Frost in front of you as a small child you're absorbing Bourgeois ideology you and like the the Consciousness is a funny thing you don't know how much of it is in there until you start pushing in later on and thinking well why do I think that why is is that my response and you find it at the root of it is the fact that the Bourgeois employs some very very sophisticated and very well-funded propaganda efforts and that Bourgeois propaganda goes all the way through the culture it's just not just the TV news it's not just the politicians it's in every single aspect of everything we live and breathe around us that's the nature of the Bourgeois dictatorship and like the things that the left is allowed to shout and scream about the loudest are all part of that it's all part of catching people who could become actual proletarian Fighters and sending them down down a dead end be it trotskyism be it identity politics be it all kinds of other things that you can get involved in that just lead you absolutely nowhere except to if you're sincere demoralization and if you're not sincere a career being a talking head on MSNBC if you're lucky yeah they really play up the the atomization of the self and the individual and individual rights and individual liberties is uh to distract from class politics class Consciousness has been super successful and I don't understand how people don't see this at this point and I have I have people telling me that trans is dialectical and that according to Marks and angles it's scientific and it's the future and I mean that to me is just I I I am so perplexed of how the belief science people looking at looking at the science that we have now are going to stand behind what they're doing and I mean that's a whole other we could do I could talk about that for probably six hours um but how did the how did the left in England deal with the whole Tavistock Institute scandal in the cast review how did that go down from because you're on the inside I I was watching it unfold from like the outside perspective how was that as an inside view that's quite easy they didn't deal with it um th those that did just said oh it's um you know Tor sponsored transphobia and those who pushed the trans thing like uh my friends and Nara media who've all blocked me now on Twitter which is funny uh or the likes of Owen Jones just either ignored it pretended it didn't happen which is the way they always don't deal with things they get caught out they pretend it didn't happen and just on the I mean you you research into the Tavo Clinic go back again go back 17 80 years you find out that they've been involved in personality deconstruction and reconstruction since before well since the 40s um hypnosis yeah changes since World War I yeah World War I was when they started out as a social engineering Institute so this has been their game for a century for over a century and so what where this is we're supposed to embrace this now as Liberation this is ridiculous this is the same stuff that they've been running for years which is um and this is the same stuff the both the American and British ruling classes have been obsessed with which is how do we how do we U destroy people's personalities basically how do we destroy psyches and rebuild them in a in a in an image that we like this is what you know this is like MK Ultra stuff um basically how do we take and this is the stuff that they were doing the American government was doing in the prison system in the 50s and 60s and 70s probably to this day which is how do we break down people and reprogram them that's like been a long-term project um going all the way back to I mean that's what the the the fiction of the mansurian candidate was really all about because in actual fact it was the American government doing the brainwashing of soldiers who' actually discovered the real crimes that were being committed in the Korean War but they've been so interested in reprogramming people and carrying out experiments on um people's uh mental health patients on people who' been locked away and can't give consent anymore to medical procedures they've been interested in manipulating vulnerable and mentally ill people for over a century and that's what this is really when it comes down to it this is the same thing but just with a different label on it which is well how doomy yeah how do we take um how I mean they did experiments in in the in the 60s and this is like confirmed by like Bourgeois writers now on like violent criminals they would experiment on them and they say oh it's about taking out the violent aspect of the personality lie it was actually about enhancing the aspect of the personality and like this was all part of like the the psychological conditioning experiments again you read the cast review this seems to me to be the same business that tavo's been in for as you said a century and like and but then again we perhaps we shouldn't be surprised that the left embraced it they used to be leftist to embraced um who embraced Eugenics who embraced so-called scientific racism I mean HG Wells George Bernard Shaw the Fabian Society people like that who were Margaret Sanger yeah the eugenicists Mal Fusian ISM all of which has been part of like various aspects of the left for a long time so if you put it in that that context perhaps this isn't a surprise what's changed is the fact that back then there was communism in a real way present in the countries um in the form of the original cpusa the original cpgb in our case and what's changed is that the Communists got destroyed and then subverted uh and be and became part of this and again this is one of the reasons why the ruling class is so invested in stopping the development of actual communist parties because once enough workers learn how to apply dialectical materialism themselves or as you know being Guided by by the party education program then they'll see through things like this really quickly and that's also why the academics have always been have been for a long time anti-marxist list and anti-communists because puts them out of a job because most of them are just paid to lie to the working class and to delude the middle class I mean Judith Butler is not a Marxist uh apparently she's going to lead the American Revolution I haven't you heard oh my God oh my God yeah well brilliant I'm uh that pamphlet that we both were talking about from cpgb ml I'm going to link that in the show notes as well so people can go ahead and read it because it is really well written uh it's very easily read as well um but other than that how else can my listeners find your work yeah just search for uh Mark angles Lon Institute on YouTube or on um on X and uh you can find me on there fairly easily or if you're on telegram search for the same thing Marx angles Lon institute there's a very active telegram Community there uh where we're you know all kinds of things are debated and uh uh those who uh come in with Bourgeois propaganda are swiftly destroyed um so um that's how the best way to find me or if you want to like email me just um it's just editor Mark angles institute.org um that's often the best way to pose a direct question um but yeah those are the principal ways you can find me awesome I'm going to link all of that below as well so people can just click on it and follow you and support your work do you have a patreon too uh yes it's just um it's in the show blub I'll send you the link okay perfect well this has been a
