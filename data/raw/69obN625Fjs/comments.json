Treating a child with radiotherapy for cancer, dexamphetamines for behavioural problems, etc. Even things like weight lifting and ballet can have lifelong impacts on a person's body if they begin too young, like stunted growth and disrupted menstral cycles.\nYou've shown you are aware that early transitioning (or at the very least suspending puberty) would be a solution to the problem you introduced about male puberty and women's sport, but any issues that a child might have to face with early transitioning (like possible sterility, higher risks of cancer, permanent bodily chages) are not comparable to voting or recreational alcohol consumption, they're comparable to conditions that require medical intervention - and even that is not exactly true, because over medicalising trans issues itself is dehumanising.\nDrinking and voting are social pivileges, granted by law at certain ages (but even then, sometimes with caveats).\n\nForgive me if this seems uncharitable, but the only inference I can read from your comments is: how little autonomy, both bodily and socially, do we tolerate trans women specifically to have.",

        "text": "@mothsforeyes I'm sorry but how are side effects including 'possible sterility, higher risks of cancer, permanent bodily changes' not comparable to recreational alcohol consumption? All three of those are side effects of excessive alcohol consumption, the key difference being that in hormone therapy the chances of both the former and latter of those possibilities are higher than with alcohol consumption.\n\nHormone Therapy is physiological treatment for a psychological condition, note that I am using that term in the literal sense rather than the derogatory sense, that can have serious long term repercussions on a childs physical well being. \n\nHere is where I will cross the line to a line of argument that some may consider offensive but is none the less factually based and necessary to the debate surrounding this issue. Children go through phases, I know this sounds like an old cliché yet it is true none the less and something I can speak to through personal experience. I myself am bisexual and when I was a teen and grappling with this I felt a lot of pressure to either come out as completely gay or to not come out at all, neither of which would have made me any happier in the long term. After initially coming out as gay and feeling no better for it my parents took me to a specialist guidance councillor to help me work through my confusion and the social pressures.\n\nIf a child was in the a similar position to me but weighing up which gender they are most happy being the current protocol would encourage them to start hormone therapy. In that case a child who is not yet completely sure of their decision could feel pressured in to making a choice that they are not yet sure is right for them. The difference is that for that child there would be long term physical consequences to this that I did not suffer from wrongly coming out as gay. Should this child, over time, come to realise they were pressured or rushed into a making the wrong decision then the long term psychological effects of this could be terrible.\n\nMy belief is that children who are feeling confused, again in the literal sense, about their gender should always be given psychological treatment first to help them ensure they make the right decision. Of course this treatment would have to be completely pressure free and designed to just help the child work through their own thoughts and feelings without being pushed one way or the other. Only once this process is complete should they be able to start physical treatment.\n\nThe issue is that this view, one rooted out of concern for the childs well being, is often dismissed and derided as transphobic by trans activists, seeking to shut it out of the discussion for reasons I can only speculate at. Currently the entire debate seems to hinge more around not offending the trans community, an impossibility when it comes to the more militant members, rather than ensuring children's well being. Something which I am, quite frankly, disgusted by.",

        "text": "@pablowall I understand the confusion on your part. Most people assume neoliberal and liberalism (as  americans tends to use liberalism to mean more broadly left-wing beliefs nowadays) are the same thing, but they aren't. The main thrust of neoliberalism began with Republican president Ronald Reagan (who definitely wasn't at all liberal as we'd use the term today) and was based around a global push for economic globalization, deregulation and privatization of almost all industries, and austerity at home with the cutting of the welfare state and other entitlement spending. Elsewhere this ideology came to be known as Neoliberalism, as it was a resurrection of the 19th century liberalism of pre-world war one Britain. We in America came to know it simply as conservatism, as the neoliberal ideology came to supplant and replace the conservatism of the period prior to Reagan's election in 1980. This is partly why the \"center right\" party in Australia is called the Liberal party while what we would consider their \"center left\" party is called the Labor party as it is in Britain and New Zealand. It think it's important to view Neoliberalism as inherently an economic theory and system of late stage capitalism, whereas what Americans have come to know as liberalism is an amalgam of the old guard labor movement built up during the first half of the twentieth century, with the reforms of the new deal as the culmination of the labor movements aims. Add to that the social integration that was the bed rock of the civil rights movement in the sixties and what you have is the modern American view of Liberalism (either as a broad stand in for leftist theory or as an alternative to it, as many centrist liberals in America would paint their ideological beliefs). Sorry for the long response, and I hope this helped clear away any confusion over the matter.",

I love the idea of progressivism, but the minimum benchmark is that it is grounded in empiricism, evidence and reason. woke people make a mockery of the entire progressive movement as something anti-intellectual, driven by appeals to emotion fallacies, motivations for vengeance as opposed to rehabilitation and any attempt to correct a woke narrative ends in public accusations of your bigotry etc. a progressive might be inspired to have a heart to heart with a racist to deradicalize him, a woke person will want to cancel even an average conservative and paint him as belonging to a hateful ideology etc. Wokeness is incredibly toxic, dogmatic and is overly a malicious force, despite their good motivations.. i mean, the alt right pipeline on youtube is pretty much reactionaries STEELMANNING woke perspectives, their activism drives people to the fucking alt right lol. i genuinely see wokeness as almost a big threat to modern society as the reactionary and alt right movements.",

I mean think about it, BLM formed 6 years ago after michael browns death and they have achieved nothing in terms of jailtime for police officers, they've achieved little political or legal change, I'm talking LAWS put in place to prevent cops from walking, they havent brought forth any demands that are feasible enough to be voted on in the Senate,  they're just a shitty organization all around. They have alot of passion and drive, but no vision at all. My last issue w them is because they have no central figurehead, how peaceful or  violent they are completely depends on which part of the country they're in which results in mixed publicity in the eyes of white america.\n\nSince they have no goal aside from screaming that racism exists and to be GIVEN justice it's no wonder black ppl keep dying and cops (including retired cops) keep walking. Racism is not a construct you can yell exists and then all of a sudden it goes away magically. This is why the 13th amendment and civil rights acts were created, racism needs to be tackled legally and enforced publically.\n\nYou can clearly see it w the George Floyd riots going on rn. they had the entire world on their side, white conservatives and liberals and even police from other depts, yet they're still gonna take the fall for the riots.\n\nThere is a silver lining tho, everyone rioting may actually push those old white cronies in washington to do sth to prevent police brutality in the future....so the silver lining is that by destroying white shopping centers and malls, white americans will put more pressure on politicians to help black causes.",

        "text": "@andrewmandrona7891 Well unlike some who came across Anti-SJW content, you didn't have a philosophical centre. You were larping. \nWhen you define your \"centre\" as what you are against, you are not 'for' anything. \nNow you are where you are because you found your centre.  \nThere is no such thing as deradicalisation. The term is defined in its use. A Leftist who converts people to Leftism is not deradicalising, but radicalising.  Likewise a Rightist is only radicalising, not deradicalising. \nThe word deradicalise is only used by the Rightist/Leftist when converting people to their side.\n\nLast of all; No I am not a centrist.\nI started watching Anti-SJW content back when I was already aware of which \"side\" I stood. My ideological journey began at AS Level Politics surrounded by Corbyn supporters, Lib Dem supporters and Bernie Bros. I felt comfortable with One Nation conservatism (though now don't believe that it exists a form of conservatism - only exclusive to Disraeli) before flipping to mix Traditional conservatism with Libertarianism. \nThis occured while I was watching Peter Hitchens. \nAt the time I was getting stuck into Edmund Burke, Rothbard, Lord Acton - (Paleo-Libertarianism). Hoppe and Hans Adam II were my later influences during and after the A-level exams. \nBefore I made my way to Paleo-Libertarianism I had already gotten sick of Sargon and the Anti-SJWs.\nSJW Cringe compilations are comedy gold when you are bored. \nNigel Farage and Peter Hitchens bashing Leftist and EU bureaucrat compilations are endlessly funny - in my opinion. Although I didn't take an interest in Peter Hitchens through that.  I watched him take part in debates, listened to talks and started reading his books - The Aboltion of Britain - On Roy Jenkins and the social reform, Television, the war on Grammar schools, British identity and so on.\n Brief History of Crime/Abolition of Liberty - On the attack on British Liberties, the attack on Robert Peel's police force in favour of a Modern Police force (Roy Jenkins again) and so on.\n\n I watch Vee, Sargon and Louis today but I have my own stances, agreements and disagreements.\n\nThe answer to this question of falling down the Anti-SJW, Alt-Right or Breadtube rabbit hole lies here. It depends on whether you have a philosophical centre or not. \nIf you have you will be like me. I watch content from all of these communities. If not, you will be stuck in an echochamber rabbit hole. I seek to convert no one. Each to their own in their journey.",

        "text": "@comrademuds1951 it is. They knew they would grab the wtitter/tumblr audience and so icluded as much representation as they could handle. And yes,this is kinda a critique of capitalism,as it rewarded disney with a huge amount of money as they milked the franchise,not caring about telling a good story as timeless as the ogs or deep as the prequels,instead focusing on name recegnition,dramatic trailers and marketeble toys for hasbro to sell.\nIt shows capitalism at its worst,as a huge corporation gets a hold on a successfull ip try to fit it into their successfull formula(mcu). They give the first movie to mr spectacle,who makes a nostaligia driven movie that is full of conveniences,plotholes,and unnecessery action scenes to distract you from all that. It also has no contreversy,fiting into the current political climate almost too nicely. It also anwsers as litle questions as possible,guarranteing an audience for the next movie and also not locking the story into a rigid path,because they dont know where it is going. The novelty of seeing a star wars movie,a monopoly on the experience if you will,blinds some and disney being a big corporation,a lot of peaple want to keep ties with them and bombard them with praise. On the other end you have peaple who critisize the movie to be cool and some that maybe saw that something was wrong. After that,they realised that the first movie was so transparently corprete, if they made the second one just like it,peaple would see these movies as what they are:predictable cashgrabs. Some guy in the board remembered,that before star wars george lucas was an indie director known for experimental movies and thought they would use this formula to get star wars to work. They hire rian johnson,a guy who is known for twists and turns,has never handled a serees of films before and has very little understanding of the source material who would also have his ego boosted due to you know,directing an official star wars movie. Now,after this some peaple would say that rian needed some guys who handled a franchise,a guy who knows the source material ecs,to keep him in check and make sure his movie doe not conflict with the films before and cooporates with the films after,so inserting it into tha cannon would not cause any problems. Disney gave him full controll over the script and direction. They might have also told him,that they really like his twist and turns and would really love to see that. The product is a middle finger to anyone invested in the stra wars universe,as it destroed the intreage of the force awakens,conflicts with preexisting sourse materiall also ties up every loose end,leaving the film afterwards with very few options. The internet reaction was of course,very divisive:you had the \"fans\",peaple who were inveasted into the stories one way or another,trashing the film. In the other side you had avarige moviegoers,peaple who like all things starwars and the guys who want to appeal to disney alongside some critics who liked the good parts more than they disliked the bad parts defending it on twitter. The two sides both had extremists,which they used as ammunition against each other,painting the other side as bootlikers,toxic,dumb ecs. Add politics into the mix and i think making a film more devidive than this one will be a very hard. With a lot of the community angry,disney realised they needed the final chapter to unite the fanbase. They addad palpatine,made ray a palpatine,made ray train,repaired kulos helmet ecs. They also addad a lot of dight scenes,reylo and all that to pleese the general audience. The thing is,adter the last jedi,moviegoers,the actors and evryone else where more cynical,more suspocios and they saw the signs from the trailers,they saw the marketing,they saw exactly what disney was trying to do. Because of this,the film  did unite the star waes community,as noone liked it. After disney mcu-ed star wars and spammed movies,it has lost its novelty. With kids not buying new toys,the last movie in peaces and EA screwing up twise, the only parts of star wars still enjoyed are sjows like the clone wars and mandalorian,alongside EA games,when they are under preassure and kept in check by disney pr or something. The fact that they managed to lose money with solo and make movies that unite all branches of the community to hate you while ticking off every point in the things that can go wrong list just shows that being driven by profit alone produces some of the worst movies off all time.",

Also, Disney isn't just a private company, it's a big company known for \"owning\" other studios. But who knows? I never hated Disney since I actually do have a passion of animation, but I hated it as a corporation due to those cash-grabbing people who worked at the studio to the point of tarnishing the legacy of Walt Disney with those live-action remakes of iconic animated films (not all of them but at least Jungle Book is good). \n\nI used to agree with the anti-SJWs about the problems with cash-grabs and pandering, but they went downhill so fast they would rather blame on politics while bringing politics to the table and throws buzzwords on the people they don't like.",

        "text": "@poweroffriendship2.0 The issue is that ANTI-SJW’s conflate a radfems desire to put men in their place with the representation of characters like Captain Marvel and Rey. And this is because of cringe pop feminism that is aggressive in how it was to destroy the patriarchy. The thing is that optics matter on both sides (yea I’m doing the both sides things). And when you have unironic angry radfems with dyed hair acting in that manner it’s easy to connect the two together and create a narrative like this. It doesn’t help that allot of liberal types on Twitter back this by saying if you dislike the new Star Wars or dislike Rey or Holdo, you’re an Incel that can’t get a woman to love you. \n\nI think in some ways both things can be true. I think that cringe feminist ideals can lead to characters like Rey while also just being a product of corporate lazy writing as well. Because of this I can’t fully go anti reactionary because then it’d feel like I’m having a blind spot due to my bias. So instead I’d rather use this as way to tell people that yes Rey sucks ass but that doesn’t mean diversity is a zero sum game because a female character happens to be strong.",

The most obvious part is that anti-SJWs didn't know the difference between a hot-headed, obnoxious activist and a carefree and innocent LGBT person or a foreign person. However, when it comes to Star Wars, it's a complicated issue. Maybe it would've been better if Finn is the main character of the sequel and not Rey. Rey is actually a fine character when I got first introduced to the sequels but as sequels progressed, I started to get annoyed. When it comes to that, I kinda feel sorry for Daisy Ridley about her backlash of her poor performance, so does John Boyega. As what \"skeptical\" as it sounds, the anti-SJWs are either against or praise John Boyega out of spite to Disney and Lucasfilm. I am mildly confused for that.\n\nI mean, the issue is not the political ideology that snuck up into every medium of storytelling, but it's because of the poor screenwriting and execution that the company managed to come up.",

I have to say that promoting transgenderism is the antithesis to healthy society, because transgenderism is a mental illness, yet the left wants people to see it as normal, and they want to blend literal males into the female group, which is just insanity.\n\nIf \"hatred\" is necessary to achive my end, which is the de-normalization and blocking the further normalization of this kind of degenerate behaviour and philosophy, then so be it? It perhaps is perfectly useful that people in opposition to it are, in general, emotionally negative towards it. Call it hate or bigotry.\n\nYou may be surprised, but sometimes i do, other times not. Why would i share my empathy with people who are utterly, morally decadent? Who want my side silenced and at worst even imprisoned or killed? Who advance politics that will most definitely lead to the ruin of civilization and the death of my race?

Locke and Mill are pretty far removed from the time when Fascism was even a thing and, more importantly, from the time when a socialist revolution actually took power.\n\nWould you like, however, some quotes on how favorably Fascism was viewed by celebrated liberal politicians and thinkers at the time when they were really afraid of a socialist revolution, namely the only thing that was a threat to capitalism?\n\nHere's what Churchill has to say to signor Mussolini in 1927: \"If I had been an Italian I am sure that I should have been whole-heartedly with you from the start to finish in your triumphant struggle against the bestial appetite and passions of Leninism. Externally your movement has rendered a service to the whole world\".\n\nAnd here is that other famous quote by von Mises: \"It cannot be denied that Fascism and similar movements aimed at the establishment of dictatorships are full of the best intentions and that their intervention has for the moment saved European civilization. The merit that Fascism has thereby won for itself will live on eternally in history.\" Then he adds that he really views Fascism as an emergency measure, not as a permanent thing: \"But though its policy has brought salvation for the moment, it is not of the kind which could promise continued success. Fascism was an emergency makeshift. To view it as something more would be a fatal error\". \n\nWhich is to say, when the going got tough, when the workers started realizing they didn't really need a minority of parasites stealing the lion's share of the wealth they produced with their own labor, capitalists and liberals conveniently forgot all that flowery liberal talk and just unleashed their thugs. Examples of this in 20th century history are way too many to list and this is already way too long of a post. \n\nAssuming you are interested in more and not simply outraged at my impertinent statements (!), you could search for \"The Dark Side of Liberalism\" series here on Youtube. It is in my opinion a generally good introduction on the subject.",

Also, if my religion says Christians shouldn't be allowed to leave the house, should I really be allowed to enforce this on you? Everybody has different values. You shouldn't enforce your values on others by law. You don't have to let gays married in your denomination, you can't stop them from getting married period, though. You know. Religion shouldn't affect any actual laws.",

I found a way to get around it just using notification on my phone, but I already swiped out notification for your previous comment, so I can't get back to it.\n\nI had people search through any of my activity, even googling me, or trying to search for my nickname in other social media, so I assumed you just found my other comments, as your reply made little to no sense for me.\nSo you just want me to explain why I think it is just another rabbit hole on level of other two barracks? You could just ask, you know?\nFirst of all, the video is about anti-sjw being another extreme, with people falling into this rabbit hole believing that it is the reality, and teaches to think for yourself and form your own opinion, not dictated by others. And yet top comments here are people acting just like what author warned against - blindly absorbing everything they say, praising names of youtubers who criticize anti-sjws, acting like everyone who criticizes them must be \"evil\", and the worst part, that I can't even say neither about SJWs nor anti-sjws, is that so far people I discussed with feel like they ascended into some kind of higher state of mind, feeling so much above anyone else, one of them even said that yes, anti-anti-sjw simply always have moral high ground. Hence why I compared it to flat-earthers. Add up to that the fact, that these youtubers really do the same thing as anti-sjws (not saying that is necessarily bad, their message is good, I blame the people for not misreading the message), they just target next chain.\n\nOf course as I said before, if I am wrong, feel free to correct me. I don't want to \"win\" a discussion, as this is impossible, I want to learn more, and possibly not make a mistake. So your honest opinion about it would be appreciated.\n\nAs for victimizing myself, you blew it out of proportions. I still don't know how you see me victimizing myself here, I meant to say that to form a group of support sounds stupid. Anti-anti-sjws (I'll just call it like that for convinience) are not bullied, discriminated, or don't need any support from what I seen. Neither do Anti-sjws, nor Sjws, this is just part of  political side really, why the hell would there need to be a support group? If anything, that just sounds like victimizing, but I would rather call this idea just stupid, and just ensures me in my opinion that this is just another rabbit hole.\n\nNow sorry if I make some things hard to understand, english is not my native, and I always have troubles with wording my thoughts. So If I made something unclear, just ask instead of jumping out with judgement right away.",

The only thing you missed from the first comment was me explaining why a community like that would potentially interest me, but I'll just explain again in a second.\n\nTypically if you're making a good faith claim about something, you should provide your reasoning upfront. Assuming you were making the claim in good faith, I'll apologize for being blunt due to my personal experiences with people online.\n\nIn regards to the people here, it looks like the top comments are mostly people just making jokes and sometimes there's discourse in the replies. I dont know, I've definitely had issues with people being progressive and really fucking arrogant about it but it bothers me less due to my experience having grown up in the southern us. \n\nGiven english isnt your main language I'm going to assume us geopolitical politics isnt something you know by heart, so to be brief the south essentially fetishizes being conservative and a lot of them love anti-sjw stuff. Independent actors feeling good about themselves for wanting rights for other people just doesnt bother me anymore.\n\nWhen I said you played the victim, you are aware the term predates internet identity politics stuff, right? By saying that, I was basically saying that even though you thought the reaction to what you said was out of proportion, it was fair given what I had seen of you.\n\nTo explain why, let me explain my experience with being super into anti-SJW stuff in the last half of high school. I have never in my life been immersed in so much unashamed hatred towards other people. A *common* insult towards women was that they \"wouldn't even rape her.\" \n\nThen eventually I kinda realized the world wasn't just that little bubble and I started hating myself most of all, because of the things I had been participating in. I dont really hate myself anymore for it, but at first it was so tempting to just go back and immerse myself in it. A group of people who had done something similar would have been nice, just to help me understand that I wasn't a bad person. So when you come in to a thread and dismiss the idea and say that actually you're being just as bad as those people, it just hurts.\nI don't think I'm going to reply again, but hopefully it shed a bit of light on why some people can get so emotional about this",

You can't avoid it on the internet. However I don't think that even something as ridiculous as fetishizing conservatism is necessarily bad if handled properly. I'm sure it is as stupid as it sounds, but I think everyone has right to their own opinion, as long as they respect others opinions. It is the disrespect, and stupidity that should be targeted for the criticism, not political ideology.\n\nI think my definition of victimization is different from yours. Nothing much to say about that.\n\nWell I get that there are people who might have suddenly realized they were doing bad things, but that still does not protect them from getting criticism for what they do now, especially when they just jumped from one horse to another without changing behavior.

And also where violence was breaking out the most (Oregon for example) have had a very complicated history of racism. I changed my mind on the matter because I was led to believe most protests were violent and everyone in them were stealing. (I actually like the fact they robbed Nike and all those brands just not small businesses but that’s my opinion) but that wasn’t the case. Also some you tubers like the ones this guy talks about, they were quoting studies against the ideas of BLM yet they were no where near being transparent with the study at all. Leaving out ANY point that went against what they were trying to convey. \n\nA podcast called behind the bastards (which is amazing) said one quote that really tripped me out. “Why are BLM protests getting so much criticism yet white supremacy protests are protected by free speech”. In the context that it was in blew my mind! Sorry for the novel. I will agree that there are legitimate criticisms against individuals in the movement and their ideas just like every movement. :)",

I think White Supremacists etc or whatever Fascistic religion or group ppl support should be allowed as good ppl will always denounce it, but also i think any hate speech reaching very far into public and inciting violence should be curbed and come under Sedition. That said, i haven't seen too much of White SUPREMACY online bc not the entire life is Internet- i think it's still a pretty small minority. Thanks",

BLM is trying to take away fair skinned people's rights.\" It is not a authentic political movement with agendas or goals. It's only purpose is to say \"Fuck you\" to BLM. I think you can understand that any movement can be brought about as a counter action to another movement, but can you explain what exactly ALM is supposed to achieve? Every time they say it's includes black lives too, is there any action from people supporting ALM to reduce the disproportionate jailing of black people? You can ask the people supporting itself. A large portion of people outright believe rascism does not exist, then another portion believes systematic rascism doesn't exist. How can the movement be considered legitimate or even as a genuine counter action if it doesn' try to address or explain even the core of the movement they're opposing?",

The idea IS that all people matter, but that one specific group of people is getting killed needlessly so we need to understand that they matter.

I was one of the ppl to retweet \"Fuck Chauvin\" and the main grounds for that were racism. But the fact that racism wasn't even proven or later pronounced in the courts, or that Floyd, with his past criminal record, is being treated like a martyr is unbelievably dangerous. The lootings and riots, disrupting normal ppl's lives. There were two other killings, one of M'Kaya Brant(sorry donno how to spell it) that were blown out of proportion. Floyd didn't deserve to die, but neither did Chauvin deserve his sentence. Bad timing, bad place, wrong situations. Then their was a President who spoke about it. Wow. Uh, most murders happen in lesser rich areas. There are solutions, but what BLM is doing is just destroying things around and wrecking terror. Man, tell me, why are we only looking through the glass of race here? Maybe they were just criminals and were dangerous to others. But the way BLM and the left are doing to get equality is horrendous. Oh, i am a brown skinned person, if that affects your view of me in any form at all. One of the BLM leader bought a big house from donation/riot money. When these people are so much into labeling anyone non black racist, then they merely stop hearing and create echo chambers. Now, echo chambers exist on both left and right, but BLM definitely does that. The number of shootings the media reports is amplified heavily. Don't, for love of everyone, trust your media. Those fuckers, they lie to everyone and everywhere. There is no good news source on TVs really. BLM, a noble enough sentiment, is a garbage of a organization only harming others and controlling people through fear. There are numerous ways that BLM can be interpreted, one that sadly many leaders and voices seem to believe: Everything where there's no total equality must be race issue. I would continue to talk if any one of you Pro - BLMs would. Have a good day, regardless.",

Furthermore, I added examples, I could have added more examples though. For the \"black men are not racist\", you can find something like this simply by looking on Google and you'll get a ton of relevant results.\nAlso, all the really terrible cunts on the right are Sargon Of Akkad, Alex Jones, No Bullshit and that asshat of Mundane Matt. Feel free to give me more names if you can actually back it up with informations because just saying \"Richard Spencer is bad because he supports the fascists\" without proof of it, besides his Pepe pin is a strawman. If you want a rhetoric from the right that I've seen quite a lot: \"The gender wage gap doesn't exist\" there is evidence to prove otherwise, but heh.\nOh BTW I said it elsewhere and I will say it again, as long as SJWs being loud and acting like piss-babies on the internet, using rhetorics, harassing other people simply for voting for Trump (Literally look that up on Youtube, there's a black woman that was being harassed in a protest because she had signs asking people to vote for Trump) and go as far as forcing their views into other people (Like forcing them to use \"custom\" pronouns like \"xir\" or \"ze\" to please the idiots or forcing transgenderism on a child -> see: SavejamesDOTcom) there will always be anti-SJW, simply because you are forcing them to abide by what you want while they want none of it and they also find it retarded to believe that there are more than two genders while I made it clear that there's only two. \n\nIt has come to the point where SJWs are regressive rather than progressive, instead of helping causes they force their inaccurate rhetorics into others and as a consequence, people started to believe that Depression, ADHD, Gender Dysporia and Anxiety were not mental diseases, but instead they were excuses made by people to get attention on internet.\nAnd the worst in all of this is that SJWs are still too stubborn to listen to any of that while their views are flawed. Just look at how many people are anti-SJW in 2019, you can clearly see the symptoms caused by SJWism.",

No. It's not a majority that supports this claim on the left, yet you generalized the whole political spectrum just to prove your point.\r\n2-\"the alt-right is full of nahtzees\", no, there are neo-nazi, nazis, white supremacists, and of course just normal people that happened to agree with some points, but the opposition generalized, just like you're doing now with the left.\r\n3-\"women are better than men\" same thing as the first point.\r\n4-\"more than 2 genders\" welp, India have, in their laws, and native Americans too. This is a byproduct of ignorance, the whole 285825585 genders thing is due a research that categorized every \"new gender\" in different cultures, like in India they have 3 and in other place there's only two, and if they have specific differences then we do the math and 5 different genders. And in its own preposition it's right, men and women have different roles in different cultures and that categorizes it as \"new gender\". You don't need to be mad because of reality, or how someone names it to you rather.\r\n5-\"blacks can't be racist\" oh yeah they can, and some are, does that change the fact that its wrong? No. And you realized that, great!\n6-\"The KKK for instance, although the KKK was originally funded by democrats\" so.....what, now they are aligned with republicans, what does that say? Nothing, that's just some \"interesting historical fact\".

If and once I realize a group is acting in bad faith, I refuse to support them and will point out they are acting in bad faith when and where I can.\nAs for my second point, it's not \"cherry picking\" to reference source material. The foundation of P+P=R is Bidol's book from the 70's. The book clearly outlines the theory, in which ALL whites are inherently racist based on the color of their skin. It's nice that you see things differently. And I'm sure the original theory has been watered down in the university setting to make it more palettable, as was done when I was introduced to the theory at that level. But you can't just cover up the core logic of a theory indefinitely, it always has a way of bleeding through the obfuscations and niceties people plaster over them making the stark realities only less obvious, yet still present. If the foundation is rotten the building cannot stand. This particular pillar of the foundation of SOCJUS has otherwise good people running around openly advocating for racism as a social good, let alone making others believe (erroneously) they can never be racist or that others cannot help to be racist based solely on skin color.\nI apologize for the untimely reply, the app doesn't notify me of responses, or perhaps I've just boomered the thing.",

Lets not forget that many of those youtubers started as atheists with reason was their motto, only to later see them lose their fucking shit over words like \"cis\",(you know maybe they just need a safe space after all). It is easy to stop being critical of yourself, and just finding only the data that supports your view. I think critical thinking doesn´t start only with the suspicion that others may lie, but with the realization that you yourself could be full of shit and should be criticized. So not only your should evaluate the information to form your opinion, check the opinion as well, many opinions could be formed out of the same information.",

        "text": "Yammo Yammamoto I would agree with most of what you said, I do not approve of people throwing food at politicians (except in Britain, before milkshakes, they threw eggs, the French threw flour, and tbh, people have been throwing food at politicians since the 1950’s here in America and elsewhere. I have  a tweet that I bookmarked on Twitter that talks about it. So tbh, throwing food is kinda… well, normal, even though I don’t approve of it.) And in Britain, I don’t like how count Dankula was arrested for a joke, but some people make it out to be that people are arrested every day, when the only person arrested for a joke was Dankula, and I do not approve that he was arrested. The only thing I would disagree is that, where exactly are people calling for safe spaces? I hear Anti SJW’s claim this time and time again, but never provide any evidence or articles that prove it, and of exactly how big of an issue it is. Also, I do not approve of how you called this place an echochamber, while yes, it is an echochamber for some, it’s just that a lot of us have realized that Anti SJW’s are doing the same thing that the SJW’s are doing. I read a tweet that stated that fans of Sargon who left Sargon of Akkad or criticized him where called SJW’s, communists, betas, etcetera, (I believe I posted a list in this comment thread somewhere) so how exactly does that make the Anti SJW’s any better then the SJW’s they claim to fight against? Have you ever heard the saying, “either you die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain”? That’s essentially what I see when I look at these Anti SJW’s, that they think the SJW’s are some sort of Illuminati our to get them at all times, when in reality, they’ve killed them, no one listens to those idiotic SJW’s anymore, and that is why there is counter culture to the Anti SJW’s, as seen with contrapoints, three arrows, etcetera. My only concern is that I don’t want the same thing to happen to them as it did with the Anti SJW’s, and become so obsessed with their enemy until that’s the only thing they see.",

Then many of those channels suddenly started doing anti-feminism videos and I totally bought into this mentality that feminism is about men-hating and whining and having no reason to exist since \"women in the modern world face no discrimination\". Like Sargon, I only experienced this bad feminism on the internet without actually thinking about what they said or looking up sources myself. I wanted to be a cool anti-feminist woman like shoeonhead, like a little girl who wants to play with the boys.\nThis went on for about a year and I went to other sites to parrot the worldviews these youtubers had. I was directly challenged by feminists and had to acknowledge that I didn't think for myself, that it wasn't logic and skepticism that lead me to the views I held, but emotions ironically enough. But of course I couldn't just acknowledge I was an idiot, I held onto these views as if my life depended on it, tried to research why I and the youtubers I watched were right, tried to show the feminists I was debating with that they were wrong. Everything I searched for however showed me that my views were unfounded, that I was wrong.\nIt was humiliating and humbling but I think it led me to be a more sceptic person who can actually think for herself.\n\nAnd now I find channels like shaun, hbomberguy, contrapoints and Lindsay Ellis and I just wish i had watched them earlier when I was in my anti-sjw phase.",

I was especially disappointed in Thunderf00t. His series on why people laugh at creationists was incredible. How the mighty have fallen.\n\n\nI think the issue is that they won. The great beast creationism was defeated and they didn't know what to do with themselves. They liked the fame and glory they had gained from the fight and had become addicted to it. The nerd who suddenly finds himself the cool kid. They chose an enemy out of a hat and went at it. Whereas they went into the creationist fight for truth and reason they went into the next simply to retain popularity and it showed in the quality of their arguments. It was so sad.",

Instead of saying, \"Anti-SJW's say xyz\" and ragging on xyz, they _show you_ the specific argument being made _by_ a self-proclaimed anti-SJW, and attack that specific argument.

To paraphrase George Orwell from 60 years ago 'No one knows what fascism is anymore other than signifying something bad', time has only proved him more correct. Trump is most certainly not a fascist, he's an ego maniac who will do anything for attention and the easiest group for him to get attention from was the right. To brand him a fascist insinuates he actually has enough forethought to have an ideology rather than a bunch of populist policies cobbled together forming no coherent overall strategy. I'm so bored of hearing this 'Trump is Hitler!' nonsense, if you folks on the left spent as much time coming up with policies and strategies as you do bashing on Trump then the coming election would be a shoe in.\n\nAlso do you really believe that the only people who are branded negatively are the ones who deserve it? I've been called a fascist by the left almost as often as I've been called a jew or snowflake by the right. For the record I associate with neither ideology as I think that both groups policies and ideas are based on fantasy and idealism rather than pragmatic problem solving. That being said at least the left cares about people, mostly.",

Similarly the term 'liberal' refers to a wide range of ideologies some of which would actually be considered conservative by modern standards such as classical liberalism. In the modern political climate both terms have been nearly completely devalued and are more often used as an insult, either direct or implied, than they are as a description.

I didn't \"become an atheist\" but I sort of just realized I was one. \n\nI eventually stumbled across the atheist/skeptic community on the internet and realized I wasn't alone which was nice. Hearing all these people talk about why they don't believe in various religions was refreshing. I had never heard anyone openly discuss their disbelief. It was so taboo for my family. It was so nice to be out of my Christian bubble. The problem was that I continued to watch these videos after I had already become comfortable with what I believe. The videos were basically preaching to the choir. I already agreed with them so why was I still watching? To reaffirm myself of my newfound beliefs (or lack thereof). I was no longer in my Christian bubble, but I did fall into a whole new bubble and it took me a couple years to realize it. They convince you that all religious people are idiots and are incapable of using logic. They teach you to look down on people who believe in things without evidence. They convince you that religion is evil. Although these things are sometimes true, it is such a black and white way of viewing it.\n\nI still consider myself an atheist because by definition I am one, but I try not to associate with the \"new atheist\" movement. Most of the time I just tell people I am \"non-religious\" instead of \"atheist\" just so they don't associate me with those people.",

        "text": "I just hate how videos like this make mention of strawmen of one side (SJWs, inflated numbers, etc) - and then at the same point, only have one giant strawman of the other side... Slight mischaracterizations, and every now and then allowing for an outright lie (like the Thunderfoot Brexit part of this video - it said \"the comment section never brought any arguments about it, but was just reactionary dislikes\" - as someone who saw the whole thing go down and went part of a lot of debates in those sections - and yes, providing facts, gonna have to call bullshit, and either a deliberate lie, or someone who just wasn't willing to dig deeper than a couple comments to disprove his point. You can't just outright deny there wasn't any actual discourse, which is bullshit).\n\nAnyway, getting back to the mischarcerizations... The problem of the 'skeptic community', is that it is it's own echo chamber and bubble? Each area of YouTube is within it's own bubble if you don't get outside of those talking points - even this one. yes, conservatives, SJWs, Anti-SJWs should be mindful of the overwhelming power of confirmation bias in the human brain, and how EVERYONE has a tendency to it, regardless on if you want to accept that or not; and it should be people's goals to try and go outside of it, and challenge it (hence, why an Anti-SJW like myself, knew what three arrows was from the past, still went here)\n\nWhere are the strawmans you say? That we see a feminist or SJW behind every corner is one; no. The actual point of a lot is more that they are the institutional opinion, from universities censoring wrongthink, to politicians (especially in Europe/England) - even downright going after people for wrongthink, speaking bad about Islam, gays, etc - even if the opinion is mild. Sure 'well, these are small cases, the crazy redhead screaming feminist' - so what if they are, most of us do realize most of them are not that crazy. But we are seeing general trends, and where as a society we need to fight battles that people like you seem to refuse to think are happening and think it is a 'non-existent problem' - despite it showing up many times over again. At political, large corporate, and high academic levels. \n\nI could go into some of the other strawmen of this video itself, but I feel I have already been ranting for too long, but if you still want me to - just say so.",

Pretty sure that's what he meant by a lack of arguments. I doesn't mean people weren't babbling in the comment section, \"anti-sjw's\" do that all the time. But what they were saying was likely full of untruths or ad-hominem bullsh!t and cheap shots.\n\n\"Each area of YouTube is within it's own bubble if you don't get outside of those talking points - even this one.\"\nEveryone is aware of \"anti-sjw's\", they're even ruining games and movies now, always hate mongering against them with their racist and sexist \"it's sjw propaganda\" b.s. So no, we're not really in our own bubble. You can't really escape them.\n\n\"The actual point of a lot is more that they are the institutional opinion, from universities censoring wrongthink, to politicians (especially in Europe/England)\"\nHow did we magically become the institutional opinion? Maybe we raised an issue about certain things like racism openly displayed in society and other sh!tty behavior and some people saw that we're right? But people like you on the other hand want to fight for people's right to say nigg_r.\n\nAlso I don't get why 'thick skinned, tough people' can't handle the consequence of people \"going after\" you when you act like assholes. You all act frail and frightened all the sudden when there are consequences or you're given a taste of your own medicine for being dickheads.\n\"Most of us do realize most of them are not that crazy. But we are seeing general trends, and where as a society we need to fight battles that people like you seem to refuse to think are happening and think it is a 'non-existent problem''\nYeah you're fighting the racist battle. The battle to keep whyte people and men too I suppose, at the center of everything cause you can only allow so much space for other people. You think you're fighting some great fight, while others simply think they're doing the right thing, what's obvious, and what's already extended to whyte men in society. They don't see what wrong with doing more of the same that's already being done and doing it for everyone else, but you do",

        "text": "I mean that's always how it goes tbh.  It's easy to attack a strawman all day long by choosing your targets very selectively: you'll always find a nutjob or two to attack if you go looking no matter the group.  Refuting demands for evidence backed proposals (say, a demand for healthcare backed by, perhaps, evidence that it could be cheaper per American), and actually engaging with that argument to do so, is much harder.  \n\nThis is why the Ben Shapiros of the world aren't worth listening to, and it's why it's so important to listen for those verbal tactics for avoiding real engagement with a topic.  It's why it's so important to know exactly what people are criticizing and why, and if that is even a reasonable portrayal of the ideology in question.  If the question \"what is an SJW\" doesn't even have a clean predictable answer, or that definition shifts with every introduction of new evidence, then criticizing SJW's should make you pretty uncomfortable.  \n\nSee I can say: I hate terfs with some confidence because I know exactly what a terf is (a trans exclusionary \"radical feminist\": a person who identifies as feminist but does not believe trans women qualify as women).  I can make a feminist argument about why this is not consistent with feminism, or a scientific argument about how this is unfounded, or an epistemological argument about the meaning of gender, or honestly I can make a practical argument about how this belief is linked more to fear and hate than reason.  The point is, when the group/belief is well defined, the group/belief can be criticized meaningfully without resorting to verbal tactics.  It's just not possible to make a coherent argument about what is wrong with SJW's because SJW's just don't really exist: The definition of SJW is hazy at best (the borders move constantly), and any definitions typically given don't match up with any legitimately prominent ideologies",

You can be watching one of June's videos, for example, and then have a good portion of your recommended videos from people like Sargon, and, in time, fall down the rabbit hole. Speaking from personal experience, by the way, since I started by watching videos from creators on that \"side of youtube\" (entirely unrelated to politics at first- stuff like Thunderf00t debunking junk science), and eventually dabbled a bit into the more \"tier 2\" people/videos/topics. Thankfully, I've always been rather left leaning, and started noticing the cognitive dissonance from watching videos around the time Trump got eletcted (before getting sucked into said rabbit hole).",

I think IQ tests and crime statistics are poor ways of judging a race, because they're things that can be heavily affected by socioeconomic status. Refusing to take this simple fact into account means that you're married to the idea that race creates a genetic predisposition to violence and lack of intelligence without solid proof, which is racist. Sure if you take the entire country into account it would seem that black people get arrested for (not necessarily commit) more crimes. But try comparing New York with Chicago. New York has a black population almost equivalent to Chicago's entire population and yet Chicago has more crime. And now your grand argument is that by telling white people in America that they won't understand exactly what black people in America had to go through (which doesn't happen as often in colleges as you think, that's just propaganda used by the right wing to convince you to frown upon education) is what's making people racist?

He is actually debunking a charecature of feminst ( offcourse I am not saying man hating Extreme feminst Don't exist ... Heck most Feminist I met agree that Misandrist Women exist .) This charecature is what his fan base believes feminst look like . This goes to prove what this video about \"Anti SJW rabbit hole \" is all about , The entire community is based on making the other side look bad .. so they are just used to taking a charecature of what they think SJW is and then act to debunk them when they actually are not doing .... Anything . The most these YouTubers go is to debunk a stupid BuzzFeed video which is ... Come on who takes Buzzfeed seriously? No one .

It doesn't happen in Switzerland, perhaps, but it DOES happen here in the USA, and we Americans, for the most part, are pretty serious about our freedom of speech.  Look up the case of James Damore (who simply stated facts and was labeled a bigot who was \"anti-diversity\" even though he was TRYING to help google attract more women -- and look how the major news outlets reported it), or how the free speech rally in Berkeley was shut down due to violence by the left.  Watch some Karen Straughan on how men are now the oppressed class in the US, and so on (you may not agree with her -- *I* don't agree with everything she says, but she makes some great points).\n\n  Just because these things haven't happened to you in Switzerland, doesn't mean they don't happen to people in other countries.  As I've stated in other posts, being an anti-SJW in the USA has a LOT more to do with freedom of speech and opposing victimhood culture than anything else.  IMO, a country abandoning personal responsibility (that is, widespread blaming of others for your problems) is the beginning of the end of freedom in that country.",

Anyways, I liked him talking about how great PC is and other gaming-related stuff, but I eventually noticed how much of a political agenda his videos had, an agenda which I was starting to believe, influenced by not only him, but by a lot of people I followed for various reasons repeating similar ideas.\n\nAnother one was a Japanese guy who had a channel called \"Find your love in Japan\". I wasn't interested on getting a Japanese girlfriend or anything but I stumbled across his channel and found his content interesting, I liked hearing about his opinions on various topics regarding Japanese culture, but as his channel grew his content slowly transitioned from talking about Japanese culture to very American-influenced far-right topics, for example giving his opinion about black people but only talking about black Americans and his views on BLM. I stopped following him by that time, so I don't know if his channel has changed of if he went full anti-SJW / alt-right, but back then because I liked the guy and enjoyed hearing his opinions, I wasn't very critical about the far-right stuff he said, and often found myself agreeing with it just because it sounded reasonable and I was hearing them from everyone I used to watch, without really thinking too much about the kind of ideas I was starting to believe.",

They would rather win an argument and confirm their views than actually have their viewpoints challenged and possibly consider adapting them, or even attempt to persuade others with actual reason to their point of view.\"\n\n\"There doesn't really seem to be much criticism directed at this specific group of pseudo-intellectuals besides general anti-SJW talking points, which I think is a cause of concern, given their rise in popularity amongst not only SJWs, but average left-wingers and centrists as well. This proudly vitriolic and unsubstantiated group needs to be isolated from the general image of the progressive left and light needs to be shed on their unjustified arrogance.\"",

Why are your heroes the ones who continuously lie to their constituents? Why did Kavanaugh openly lie to congress when pressed about the meaning of slang he used in his high school days? Do you know that \"innocent until proven guilty\" is for criminal cases, and that this congressional hearing was technically a job interview.

But neither violate free speech laws\n\n2  It seems to be taking about abortion when there is visibility, I have literally never seem anyone arguing for 9 month abortions, that's a strawman and definetly not the mainstream view\n\n3 First of all most of the plus sized models arent obese. What society considers \"fat\"  vs what is actually medically unhealthy  isn't always the same. If you look at some classical art, a lot of the women depicted would be considered \"fat\" by today's standards. As a result of this, people are literally starving themselves to conform to these standards. Second, mocking people with heath issues isn't helpful and is generally considered \"a dick think to do\".",

California actually used to be quite the wonder of the world largely do to its socialist programs that have been defunded over the years. It used to boast amazing public schools, great roads, and plenty of opportunities. Now the corporations basically just use the place to make money and throw the people to the dogs.\n\nAs far as Portland goes, that's more of an industry problem. Oregon isn't a state with a lot of tech, it's more of a blue collar place to live. Just like in Michigan, you can't move all the jobs overseas and close all the plants and keep a place flourishing. I think it's hilarious how you're blaming leftists for that. They MADE us move industry overseas because of the TAXES!! Waaaah! Corporations used to pay close to 50% of their revenue in taxes. Most now pay 0% or even get a refund due to conservative bullshit tampering and corporate handouts.\n\nYou guys ruined the American economy with greed.

It was a term used by tumblr feminists to make fun of people that were supposedly part of their online community, but obviously didn't care about improving the world around them and just used feminism as an excuse to be angry at people. \n\nAnd then the term 'SJW' started being used to undermine the credibility of the people that founded the term...",

        "text": "Honestly, it really wasn't at first though at least how i see it (admittedly this is anecdotal but I have been on tumblr for a long time and ive seen the best and worst of this hellsite)\n\nI first started seeing \"sjw\" as a sort of uplifting term for feminists who really upheld intersectionality. However around late 2014/2015, id say, that people were catching on to this term and making cringe comps and threads making fun of the loudest, most misguided feminists. Eventually, people really tried to damage control and distance themselves with the term and i think thats when sjw started to just mean \"extreme feminist\" by force of anti-sjw's creating anti sjw content and said content completely blowing up.\n\non another note, feminists who would most likely be seen as \"sjw's\" are actually feminists thatmost likely never even used the term and should absolutely be criticized but for different reasons. For instance \"man haters\" are usually white feminists and radfems/terfs. An intersectional feminist will talk about the problems in society that hurt men amd all kinds of men: black men, men of color, gay men, trans men, men that dont fall under the upheld stereotype of manly man, men who are casted aside, mental health for men. White feminists will often not understand that you cant just seperate society's problems as a men vs women issue based on gender alone. Black men amd women still face oppression under the axis of being black. And White women do not have the same struggle as a Black woman. Intersectionism is about embracing the axies of power dynamics.\nAnd then we have terfs and radfems, unsurprisingly a lot of them are white. They hate men so much, they see trans women as men and therefor as \"invaders\". \n\nThis became longer than anticipated, but just to circle this back around, \"sjw\" actually does have more of a background so i thpught maybe elaborating on that would be helpful. Honestly, talking about this makes me want to do actual digging and research instead of recalling my experience on tumblr.",

So, with that they blame men for not helping them. But they aren't willing to hold other females accountable for false claims of sexual assault and as always just want the men to \"get over it and help them.\" . . .Like they expect us to fulfill our gender role and sacrifice and nurture at cost to ourselves, but they want to be free from their gender roles. \n\n\nSo what happens is, women be women. . .and instead of changing to be better people (like successful people. ) they twist the arms of weak men and indoctrinate everyone else into believing that women are good and saintly rather than. . .Actually BEING good. . .\n\n\nBasically, women are using feminism to be emotionally abusive towards men, and they use the idea that an extreme minority of men is actually a majority that physically and sexually abuses them to silence the men who take offense to this. \n\n\nSo now feminism is not JUST a cause for equality, but its a crutch and something that reveals a lot about women.",

        "text": "@8thMountain Jordan Peterson (for example) ostensibly knows a little bit about a lot of critical theory. Just enough rope to hang himself with. He's got some solid knowledge of Carl Jung and the theory of archetypes (which amounts to what?), but I (being more attuned to Freud, Ferenczi, Abraham & Torok's psychoanalytic principles than Jung's) would never try to out-Jung him, nor would I pretend to have the necessary background or interest to challenge his Jungian points.\n\nJordan Peterson (and with him, most of the openly anti-Marxist reactionary right) demonstrably does NOT know a lot about Marx, any of the various Marxism(s) (he has either never read him, or misreads him egregiously), poststructuralism, deconstruction, or postmodernism. Bet he's never touched Lyotard or Jameson, or any other theorists concerned primarily with \"postmodernism.\" But he certainly pretends to know something about it--and he lectures on it, and writes books on it as though his opinion is informed. Meanwhile, the average undergrad understands critical theory more thoroughly than he does (PhD, professorship, and all).\n\nStefan Molyneux is perhaps among the worst of the blatant non/mis-readers. Listening to him talk about Foucault (calling him a Marxist when he rejects Marxism outright, for example) is like listening to the kid who has a presentation on Moby Dick, but has only ever seen cartoon adaptations & references. \"OH, there's a big white whale and a guy with a peg leg, and the other guy that goes 'CALL ME ISHMAEL'. And they go and catch the white whale!\"\n\nBasically, when they start actually *reading* (like, just in general--why do almost none of these imbeciles actually read anything in its entirety??? It's lazy as hell!) the arguments that they rail against so strongly, *then* and only then will they be taken seriously.\n\nUntil then, they're just like the person who assumes that Ahab and the crew caught the whale at the end with his blasphemed, blood-ritualized harpoon, and got home to his lonely wife and kid--that the Pequod made it home, and the crew got filthy rich off of mountains of spermaceti.",

        "text": "john doe1 week ago\n@A Halo Reach guy who pooped on C4dburys_the_w0lf Have you done your own Research on the Subjects They debate on? If your really ready to discredit what anyone has to say on a subject it can ONLY be becuase you know as much or more about it than them, and have your own views and evidences\n\nBut thats just my Opinon.\n\n\n\nI normally don't respond to the dumbest piles of shit on the planet for obvious reasons... But it's kind of fun and I'm stuck at work with nothing to do at the moment so why not.\n\nLet's make a list.\n\n1... Yes... I have done my own research. The fact that you're asking anyone here on this video such a question is quite telling that you're butt hurt that your bff sargon is being laughed at. BROFLAKE ALERT!\n\nSargon got banned from twitter by breaking their rules by sending gay porn at people and inciting violence. This is a proven fact. There are paper trails of this lol.\n\nSargon says that feminism is a state of mental illness and or autism... Whatever the fuck that means. Basically he can't actually prove this to be fact but when does he ever have proof for backing up such wild claims? Pretty much never lol.\n\nSargon openly admits that if he can't get read something in less than 5 minutes than it's too complicated. Just goes to show you how short his attention span is.\n\nI could go on...\n\nSo I have done plenty of research that's provable by actual facts that shows how much of a jack ass he is. I don't even need to prove it honestly. No one days. He's already done that and admitted to it himself lol. Dude practically has a sign super glued to his forehead that says \"Yes, I am full of shit\".\n\n2... Why can't you write? You clearly don't know what a apostrophe is, problems with sentence structure and you can't even use spell check. I'm not even that good at writing the English language myself but god damn dude... Am I talking to the actual Sargon here? You sound just like him lololol.\n\n3... You have one video upload on your channel and it's some silly scene from Kung Fu panda... It's like I'm talking to a teenager. Probably so...\n\n4... This is the dumbest shit ever...\n\n\"If your really ready to discredit what anyone has to say on a subject it can ONLY be becuase you know as much or more about it than them, and have your own views and evidences\"\n\nWhen you said that broken dog shit of a sentence it became clear that you went from sounding like a idiot to a complete fuck headed fart bubble munching machine.\n\nI just joked/truth told about how I have a massive lack of faith in whatever he's opening his fat ass frog man poster child mouth about that's all.\n\nI'm sure Sargon says some smart stuff that's credible or somewhat credible from time to time. I can't think of any because the guy sucks THAT much but everyone is capable of making a reasonable and logical statement from time to time no matter how stupid, evil, and illiterate they are lol... Usually anyways.\n\nI also disagree with what you said about discrediting being permitted only if you know as much or more than them about a certain subject. Would if you understand certain things about a certain subject better but not so much about other things in that particular subject? See how complicated that can get? How the fuck do you weigh that to determine who gets the right to discredit and who doesn't? See why what you just said was fucking stupid?\n\nFor example I could just be some poorly educated farm boy who can't even read or do anything other than push a cart. Nazis come along and tell me that I should be hanged or something fucked up like that. I tell them that they are wrong even though many of them can read and know history better than me. I'm not allowed to discredit their evil racist believes because I'm not as educated as they are about racial history??? Fuck that shit. These fuckers want to selfishly kill people for greedy and insane reasons. But because I know less about Hitler than they do I should be forced to listen to them and not have a lack of respect for them? Fuck that and fuck you kid. Fuck you and the horse you never rode in on lol.\n\nAnd lastly... Discrediting Sargon is so easy it just happens without effort lol. The man child is so obviously wrong about almost everything almost all of the time that it's only natural that some one comes along to correct him which forces him to look like the jack hole that he truly is. The racist, sexist, nazi, fake outrage propagandist fuck nut that he truly is. Like I said... Discrediting him is easy. Easier than it is with you bra.\n\nFunny how I was able to get all of that out of your small minded and short comment. And yet you question me in doing my own research lololol. Cute. Now if you get this message I'm sure you will be quite pissed after reading it... If you even can read. That being said... Don't take it too hard. Instead learn from it to grow better as a person as you age. If it makes you feel better I was a dumb ass kid once too. We all go through days like that of course. I probably wasn't as dumb as you but hey... Intelligence is a funny and very complicated thing. Some folks are smart about some things but dumb about others. Some folks are just dumb about mostly everything in their lives like Sargon but at the same time are lucky enough to have a job where sitting on your ass and being wrong all of the time can pay the bills lololol. Life is unfair, weird, and a lot of the time fucking stupid. Welcome to reality : )",

        "text": "I know right? It's the most annoying thing in the world, YouTube never recommends anything relevant to what I've searched, I am sick to death of the Anti-SJW bollocks. \n\nNever expressed the slightest bit of interest in it, I frequently say \"I'm not interested, I don't like this video\" but it recommends twice as many, it's like cutting heads off the bloody Hydra! \n\n\nIt's like YouTube's algorithms are trying to take the piss or something, I feel like the computer has some sort of anti-human vendetta driving it to make us all suicidal with frustration and depression, because we come on YouTube to watch something funny and let go of tension but then a bunch of \"Rekt feminazi destroyed by Jordan Peterson\", and without even watching; the thumbnail and title alone sap my faith in humanity. \n\nWe don't have to like each other, just tolerate each other, stop bickering and bitch-fighting, pretty sure most of us 90s kids grew up watching X-Men but didn't take in the positive message hidden beneath the colour. Sorry little rant, but I hope you could get my gist.\n\nWe don't have to get all politically correct with each other but the alternative should not be \"Become an Arsehole\".\n\n\nWhat irks me even more is when I had an Uber driver who was all anti-SJW, just the lewdness of everything he was saying, the pure hatred of the world, the paranoia...\n\n...For one thing; as a gay disabled man; I wasn't really all that happy when he said gay people should be put in a death camp (to stop aids from spreading) and that disability was a myth by dole bludgers to scam the government. I would've thought my disability was obvious anyway. \n\nThen he had the gall to invite me to some Alt-Right meeting he was having in a week's time, like he didn't spend 20 minutes insulting me, that much of a narcissist he just thought that he had \"Ben Shapiro'd\" and subsequently recruited me.\n\nI also didn't like the attack on my privacy, I remember a time when we had Anonymous Voting because Political leanings were a private, personal matter,  everyone's allowed to have their own and believe what they want, but it should be private and kept to elections.\n\nI dunno, I just hate the priority that this generation assigns to social media, I feel like none of this would've happened if social media was purely used as social media, nearly every site is a bloody platform nowadays. I blame the existence of edgy, new-age politix regarding \"SJWs & Alt-Right\" entirely on the irresponsible use of social media.\n\nI think we delude ourselves into thinking we're higher along in the evolutionary timeline because we have shiny, swipy screens, we're really just the same angry, anxious apes we were when the wheel came about, but we have better wheels, even I feel like I can't control my anger and fear most of the time. I'm typing this with a broken hand in a splint because I got into an argument with my brother a week ago and put a hole in the wall. I feel like our ambition outgrows our higher reasoning and compassion, it's why we have nuclear bombs and cyberbullying. \n\nNot saying we don't have good things, I wouldn't have my lovely pet cat if one of my old friends from high school didn't put an ad up for him on Facebook, and some of the stuff is convenient, although I just think the impact of the bad intentions are definitely magnified by the abuse of modern technology. \n\nBack in the day, if you wanted people to commit suicide; you had to mob them face-to-face and bully them. Nowadays you send it all online and you don't even get the guilty feeling when you look into that person's eye. And I say all this as someone who survived their own suicide attempt, at the age of 8. \n\nI think it's disturbing enough that an 8 year old knows how to prepare for suicide, but the internet has made suicide even more streamlined than it was when I was a kid. You've got instant online mobs across the world, usually from complete strangers, you've got guided videos on how to use household objects for suicide, it's sickening really.\n\nI just think we have to appreciate the magnitude of the phones in our palms; they are like nuclear bombs really, and we have to start treating people the way we want to be treated again; just understand the grasp of basic compassion and \"if you don't like it; don't do it to them\", it shouldn't be hard but the idea seems lost on some people. \n\nI mean, maybe I'm overreacting and the world isn't going to shit, maybe YouTube just bombarded me with horrific content against my will and it's left that impression on me and it's my fault and I should cheer up, and I would be incredibly happy if that were the case. Either way; I think it'd be beneficialtfor most of us to put the phone down once in a while",

The only good aspect of the film is the special effects, how the actresses tried their best to keep their characters alive, and Slimer (too bad he's one of the enemies in the reboot despite being the ally of the Ghostbusters in the original movie as well as the animated series. He's such a memorable character.)\n\nEven James Rolf from the _Angry Video Game Nerd_ fame don't want to review the film because of how bad it is, not just because of the politics.",

People who stress the importance of sex categories often get treated this way, and I reject that.\nSex categories are relevant because males and females have different needs, which is why we have women's hospitals, shelters, sports, prisons, etc. These spaces were hard fought for, and are exclusive for a reason. Now there is pressure to include biological males in these spaces, and this raises a number of issues. We can't discuss the issues if any differing opinion is considered bigotry.\nOn another note, the notion that people have their gender assigned at birth is bizarre and wrong. Check your birth certificate if you don't believe me. Sex is recorded there, not your gender. And your sex wasn't 'assigned', it was observed. That phrase makes no sense whatsoever.",

TERFs think they don’t get it, and when you bring up their rampant transphobia to them they always say things like “Oh, you’re trying to tell me sex isn’t real??” which like I said, no one is saying it isn’t real. It’s downplaying what they actually believe. It’s like when JK Rowling said “But force women out of their jobs for stating that sex is real??”, even though the original statement she was referring to was FAR more than that. “Sex is real” is a fact; arguing with it would make you very wrong, so it made it hard to disagree with. But if you read the original paragraph that Rowling was referring to, “sex is real” is a complete understatement of what was actually said, and saying that that’s what it meant gives it a sense of credibility it wouldn’t have had otherwise, where disagreeing with it would have made you seem insane. Because sex is of course real. Sorry if I went off on a tangent there haha. But transgender people themselves know about sex categories, hormones and chromosomes etc, and aren’t acting like they’re not a thing. They understand them very well. When a TERF says “sex is real”, that’s usually not what they really mean. It’s almost self defence. They present an argument that you can’t argue with.",

        "text": "@padowo  Maya Forstater got into trouble by pointing out the fact that nobody can change their biological sex. Apparently this statement is controversial to some people. She said some other things about not believing in self-identification. I agree with Rowling here: nobody should lose their job over such a common scepticism regarding self-identification. The overreaction to their views was a truly dismal affair, and the numerous rape/death threats made the activists look like dangerous lunatics.\nI was pointing out that sex categories are important because they are the basis for women's rights in society. Women's services, sports, shelters, prisons, etc. are all defined by the sex category of female. If this basis can be altered to include biological males, then the idea of women's sex-based rights simply disappears.\nYes, very few people are denying the existence of sex categories, but many people are elevating the social phenomenon of gender to a much higher status than that of sex. This is what I disagree with. Gender is essentially irrelevant, whilst sex is important (hopefully I don't have to elaborate on this).\nI don't agree that gender-critical people are hateful towards trans-people. They just don't subscribe to the idea that a person can change their sex. Someone can be supportive of trans-people and also reject gender ideology, the two are not mutually exclusive.",

TERF started out as a specific ideology that isn't by requirement trans-phobic but is extremely appealing to transphobes, so the ideology attracted trans-phobic feminists which muddied its ideology with transphobia. Somewhere along the line, it has gotten muddied further and is now applied basically to all women who are transphobes (regardless of if they are feminists or not) as well as to man-hating feminists (regardless of if they are transphobic or not), so has been morphed into a catch-all term for \"bad women I can feel good about mocking\" and now half the time it is just as much a straw-man term as SJW is. \n\nIt's honestly at the point that when people shout insults about TERFs I have no idea who or what they are actually talking about, which defeats the purpose on language in the first place. It really is no different from the anti-SJW rabbit-hole as far as I can see : people wanting to feel good about themselves by derisively mocking their imaginary concept of [buzzword] group. And it will be no more beneficial to democratic debate and civil society as the anti-SJW crowd.\n\nBy all means criticize transphobes - whether they are feminists or not - but be clear and specific in your criticisms.

The risk for cis women doesn't increase from trans women in their spaces, they are more likely to be assaulted by another cis woman. How about that one case a while back where a trans man was forced to use the women's bathroom and was then assaulted and beaten by three men because a woman was \"concerned\" about a man being in the women's bathroom despite being forced to be there cause of his \"biological sex\".

        "text": "@icyplatinum3687 I don't wish to revisit this thread since most of the replies were made by people who ignored half of what I said, but I'll reply to you.\n\nFirst, your claim that biological sex is \"mostly hormones\" is simplistic to the point of absurdity. Males and females have distinctly different bodies (for obvious reasons relating to the evolution and reproduction of our species). If a one million year old human skeleton is found, biologists can determine the sex of the fossil. There is more to sex than simply hormones. Also, you put biological sex in quotation marks, which suggests that you don't believe it is a real thing. This type of thinking is deeply troubling for those of us in the reality-based community. There is no such thing as birth sex, or assigned gender either.\n\nSecond, I didn't mention women's bathrooms.\n\nThird, I've heard your other arguments dozens of times and I still don't think they are based in any logic or evidence. Claiming that trans people face more risk of violence (whether that is true or not, as no evidence is ever provided) does not give you the right to put females *in female-only spaces* at risk. You also completely disregard the wishes of females who seek shelter *in order to be away from males.* Forcing them to accept males into their vulnerable spaces is regressive and fundamentally sexist.\n\nYou said \"The risk for cis women doesn't increase from trans women in their spaces\" so here are some examples to dispute that (copied from a friend's comment):\n\nLook up Karen White, a rapist on the street who is housed with women and raping women in prison. Look up \"Princess Zoee Marie Andromeda Love,\" formerly known as Hobby Bingham, who raped a 12-year old girl, and later was transferred to a women’s prison, where he raped a developmentally delayed survivor of sexual abuse who was forced to share a cell with him.\n\nWhy do you (and other commenters here) choose to ignore these events, and countless others like them?\nI think the answer lies in the fact that gender ideology *demands* that they be ignored.",

And if you are wondering why didn't I read the articles I have adhd, dyslexia, depression and anxiety and my parents don't give a shit about my disorder and I got diagnosed at 18 since I am from a 3 world country where people don't give a crap about mental health and last thing I want to do is go to a witch doctor because my parents do that a lot they are extremely religious and only reason I am diagnosed is because of my older sister I guess the point I am trying to make is I don't like to read a lot.",

        "text": "Smokeshota Ok, I didn't have a time, but now I'll say it differently: you don't have to lynch black people in the streets to be a racist. Trump may never openly stated that he's racist, or biased against other races (excluding the fact that he called Mexican immigrants rapists and other countries shitholes). We don't know what's going on in his head thought, so people kind of have to guess according to his actions. If he isn't, then he's doing pretty weak job and if he is, of. fucking. course he wouldn't state it out loud.\n\nPeople aren't saying that he's racist, only because he says something controversial in the public. They're saying it, because he doesn't condemn white nationalism or some other openly racist people (like that time, he tweeted about David Duke).\n\nTrump stated that white-nationalism isn't a rising threat in the US, which isn't true. ADL reported that propaganda efforts from white supremacist groups increased by 182% in the US in 2018. Actually, it was since his election that their activities rised and USA became more racially divided.\n\nHe has a massive support between white nationalists, Alt-righters and even KKK members, which is pretty telling.\n\nI mean, people of that kind wouldn't support someone if his language didn't play on their ideological strings.\n\nAs I said, it's hard to explain this \"subtle racism\" to people who can't (or refuse) to see it. I dunno, we don't see into his head, he could be thinking whatever the hell there is, but his actions and policies attract certain types of people and you can't blame minorities that they feel threatened and think that Trump is racist. That's what I thought Contra *might* help to explain it (she was successful with many people).\n\nAnyway, I'm pretty fed up with Trump. He's openly sexist climate change denier who made many dumb decisions, which really didn't help America. I'm not from states, but even in my country fascism has gained more supporters since his election. In my opinion he's prejudiced towards people of other races (religions, ethnicities) but I probably won't change your mind, so that's all from my side.",

There's this video-game based on 1930s cartoons (also some new wolfenstein or 3d shooter game), and it caused some degree of anti-SJW scandal because one SJW-ish tweet or another that was made, but those original tweets were actually much more propagated by the anti-SJW hysteria than by actual direct retweets. More articles and blogs than retweets.",

        "text": "The Worst Catholic ill agree with you that the wage gap is a tricky subject to defend, and not everything they say about it is true (i would argue that the wage gap only starts applying itself heavily after a woman has a baby, other than that it may be based on worker performance or a corrupt manager's gender bias). and that discussions about rape culture are often brought to extremes (i'm not trying to be \"that person\" but i seriously do feel threatened when strange men are around me, just because of how i was raised to think all men are predators). honestly you're more likely to find a nickel on the ground than you are to be jumped while walking home and raped (most rapists are people the victim knows). but it can happen and it sucks and it scares us. the fact that some people will shun women for dressing skimpy and blame the victim for looking like a slut is abhorrent.\n\nand maybe women aren't exactly \"oppressed\" as some would have you believe but there are certain societal standards that women are expected to uphold at least to some degree (like dressing nice, having a decent body shape, being modest, taking care of their hygiene on a daily basis), most of these things that men don't have or are more acceptable when a man does it (and when i say those things, im refering to individuals who find it hard to do those things, like the physically disabled or mentally ill). the times are changing, though, so i believe that one day this may be old news.\n\nbut you also have the pink tax, which is the tax on feminine products and other products marketed towards women. some people deny its existence, but this is where unfairness starts, because women have to pay more for the same things that are marketed for men, for essentially the same purpose. and its not like they do different things either, except maybe they smell different. they don't have any reason to put a tax on stuff like that. and for feminine products, we already have to buy things that are necessary to care for a natural bodily function, which is unfair for women in poverty who have to choose between using their paycheck on food or tampons. its almost like being punished for existing.\n\nyikes when did this turn into an essay lmao. but im not saying the opposition has any merit but the feminists who don't scream at the top of their lungs do have a point. we just have to be loud enough to drown out the crazies",

It was definitely SJW-friendly but not dogmatic or cringey. She seemed like she could have been a really useful voice in bridging the distance between the SJWs and the rest of us.\nIt was right around that time she came out as trans, and ever since then the content has descended into a nasty, narcissistic validation of her own identity, which people gush and fawn over. There's zero worthwhile discussion in the comments under the videos and any hint of criticism is jumped upon with the usual arrogant, self-satisfied claims of bigotry etc.\nContrapoints is now the personification of an SJW hell-hole, with some of the best production values on YouTube.",

    "text": "I'd like to thank Hbomberguy and Contrapoints for helping me out of the reactionary right rabbit hole a few years ago, but what actually kickstarted my exit before that was anti-SJW incompetency itself.\n\nI was watching an Atheism Is Unstoppable video (yes, cringe), not thinking about it too hard, and was jolted back to reality when I heard him say \"black people have lower IQs.\" He was citing a study that thanks to my current statistics background I understand is wrong on other levels, but at the time it felt wrong purely because of how racist it sounded. Sometime later I was watching another video of his where he was criticizing The Young Turks, and the way he was talking about the female host got weirdly sexually degrading. By the time I'd started getting into Blaire White instead I realized how much of a \"Pick-Me- I'm-Not-Like-Other-Trans\" she could be and I'd finally had enough. Found Contrapoints through Theryn Meyer and it felt like a breath of fresh air.",

It was so weird how mean spirited they could be (meaning Blaire and Kalvin). Especially after watching other transgender people who were generally well-spoken and empathetic because they knew how was it to be on the \"other side\". But all I could find were support comments. I thought I was just being a baby, but in the end I really couldn't watch them because they simply left a bad taste in my mouth.\nYou can talk about your beliefs without being insulting to someone else, sometimes even to someone else *identity*. I honestly hate it that even in LGBT+ community, some people still find it within themselves to be so inconsiderate. :(",

I never fell down the racism rabbit hole, but I definitely started growing some anti-feminist point of view, who just made me feel extremely sad and confused since I am a woman who is trying to be an aerospace engineer. I also love playing video games but the gamer community didn't do me good too. It was a bad time overall. The thing that jolted me was hearing Shoe0nhead saying \"I think gender roles are ok\"\nLike yeah they kinda come into place if you want to raise children and stuff, but why say this as a response to someone suggesting buying more diverse toys or teaching kids they don't have to follow a stereotype? It jolted me not because of how offensive it was but bc of how stupid it was.\n\nI love Pewdiepie and I have been following him since my childhood. I have never stopped watching him. But for the last year his LWIAY videos always leave a bitter taste in my mouth. I heard about Greta Thunberg from his LWIAY videos and from the r/pewdiepiesubmissions subreddit. Same for Battlefield V's trailer including a woman, Captain Marvel etc. I just learned about them from his videos and based my opinions about them from there. I just thought the thoughts of Pewdiepie's comment section and subreddit was the general opinion. I still like him but I think he has to realize what kind of people he appeals to and which people are usually in his subreddit. I think it greatly affects his opinions too. I couldn't finish watching his Jubilee reaction video on pro vs. anti cancel culture. All he did was point at pro-cancel culture people and laugh. Cancel culture bad. That's his whole opinion about a rather complicated thing. It makes me feel sad since I developes this really deep parasocial relationship with him, he is part of my childhood.",

So the fact that something like a mass genocide happened in our country is the opposite of what we believe. We want to believe that Turks and minorities live in harmony here without any racism. But that obviously can not be the case. Armenian genocide did happen and it was a genocide. I wouldn't call it the Turkish equivalent of the holocaust, since the reasons were really different. But of course, they are irrelevant since innocent people and children were killed, all of the same ethnic group so it is a genocide. Denying it will just keep making things worse for Armenian people living in Turkey.",

    "text": "I stopped being a Anti-SJW after I watched a Big Joel video that really forced me to think differently for once. He showed a clip of Shoe0nHead using her argument about how the wage gap isn’t real because it’s just the collection of average sale ties between men and women, which used to make total sense to me. But then Big Joel pointed out that just saying that didn’t actually answer the full question. That, rather, we should be asking WHY the average salaries are like this, or WHY women aren’t as compelled to take up jobs, or why jobs that are typically seen as feminine positions don’t pay as well as more male-dominated fields. Then, after awhile, I just started to see how often anti-SJWs/anti-feminists just tended to be obnoxious about their content. Just started to become obvious that everything I thought I disliked about ‘the left’ was scarily accurate to how the detractors acted.",

When it comes to political content I can be entertained by a Ben Shapiro video without having my opinions about the evils of corporatism and ethnocentric nationalism shaken and although I love the witty and talented Contrapoints I sometimes disagree with her opinions. I like intelligence.

(reposting)\n\n5:28 You admit to naming only a few of Carl Benjamin's (Sargon of Akkad) opinions and sure enough, your selection bias is unmistakable. You have mentioned only those opinions that are relevant to your narrative, all the while neglecting to mention Carl's left-wing views such as his opposition to the freedom of association (the libertarian cake question) and his openness to government surveillance of a person's social media and private life. Carl is also self-avowedly pro-choice on the issue of abortion and has advocated on behalf of the concept of the welfare state on numerous occasions. \n\n6:38 Citation needed. You claim that \"para-social relationships\" are more potent via YouTube than regular television. Please provide sourcing.\n\n7:05 Citation needed. It is unclear to me how watching \"Anti-SJW\" videos causes a viewer to become part of a \"hive mind.\" Please provide sourcing.\n\n8:52 This is a reflection of the feminist 'male tears' trope back upon feminists and like-minded ID-pol pushers. There is also nothing intellectually dishonest about basking in the schadenfreude towards people who hold opposing viewpoints, even though it may be devoid of reasoning or discussion of policy. Shock value and trolling are common art forms.\n\n9:00 Support of Brexit does not necessarily imply \"Anti-SJW dogma.\" Not only is it possible for an SJW like Louise Mensch to support Brexit, there are arguments in support of Brexit that do not relate to SJW's.\n\n10:28 The Wall Street Journal is the same outlet that ran a story making an out-of-context connection between PewDiePie and anti-semitism. Your logical fallacy is the appeal to authority - a more established media outlet is still capable of producing fake news. It is possible for a YouTuber to offer greater perspective.\n\n10:53 The “truly worrisome” standard you invoke for political developments appears to be based on your personal opinion and is therefore subjective in nature.\n\n11:53 That DNC candidate (Sally Boynton Brown) you mentioned was cheered by the audience and applauded by the other stage-members for her diatribe. This is an example of radicalization of one’s own base in real time.\n\nYour analysis does not appear to be well-rounded. \nMy advice to you would be to lurk moar.",

Calling bias on random statements, asking for citations, pushing a counterpoint based on your interpretation and not providing anything yourself? Thats no way of having a constructive discussion in the sense of a hermeneutic circle, more like a good old schopenhauerian smackdown. Not a well rounded criticism if you dont mind me criticising you. And thats just for your methodology.",

Men's mental health must be taken seriously, not dubbed as toxic masculinity.\n4. Men should have the chance of caring for the childeren. They should go out with their kids and not be seen as a pedophile. When divorced, they should also get shared custody of their childeren, if possible. Child support costs should definately be lower than an average wage.\n5. Men cannot be turned down at a job application because of their gender.\n\nGood points by MGTOW\n1. You don't need a SO.

For instance, women are still offered lower starting salaries on average in jobs where wages are non-negotiable even when the men and women have equal educational attainment and work experience. \n\nThe other 23-30% is based on differences in choices and careers. However, the differences in choices men and women make on average is influenced or inspired by patriarchal. \n\nEx: Women are expected to do most of the childrearing and the housework. Even when women work over 40 hours per week, their husbands or boyfriends still tend to expect her to do most of the cooking and cleaning.",

STEM jobs are also thought of as \"men's work\". They've been thought of that way since the 80s with computers, and since forever with math and science. In the 1950s people generally used to literally believe that female brains would not be able to handle math and would literally, physically overheat. That was a widespread common belief until just a few decades ago. Today it's still assumed by many people that women are generally naturally uninterested in math because of biology. \n\nTo be fair, how many employers do you think would hire women en masse for factory floor jobs or mining jobs? They'd probably assume that women are not physically strong enough to handle the work.",

Yet when college kids are asked and i can go get the video if you want, they still believe that Jesse is somehow a martyr... or sacrificing himself for a cause...  this is like me personally and purposefully setting my oven  on to cause a fire and then showing up later to take care of the fire thats burnt a good portion of my house and people call me a hero...  Racism is so lacking in the USA that he had to FAKE a hate crime... think about that, he had to FAKE an event that SJWs say happens everyday of their lives, the queer hate, the racism, the sexism, and here we have a prime example that non of that exists, or at least not enough to get something to happen.\n\n\nExample 3: Even though President Trump was able to bring about economic growth considered impossible during Obama's run, and get more black americans jobs than ever before and more women into congress, some people of the left REFUSED to stand up and acknowledge any of it because ORANGE MAN BAD, just because hes Trump they're going to sit on their asses despite his great run so far as President???\n\n\nExample 4: SJWS for the past 3 years have invited themselves to Trump rallies, conservative talks on college campuses and many other would be peaceful and happy forms of free speech and peaceful assembly, yknow so you and like minded people can meet and talk, maybe have a hotdog if its a picnic... AND HAVE COME OUT IN DROVES TIME AND TIME AGAIN TO DESTROY THE PEACE, CAUSE MAYHEM, VIOLENCE, AGGRAVATE, STEAL, AND EVEN USE DEADLY WEAPONS ON INNOCENT PEOPLE WHO WENT TO A RALLY OR TALK, PEACEFUL ASSEMBLIES TURNED INTO PEOPLE TRYING TO SILENCE THE SPEAKER, AGGRAVATE AND ROB THOSE THERE, AND EVEN A FEW TIMES, *NOT JUST ONCE* ASSAULT WITH DEADLY WEAPONS, SUCH AS THE BIKELOCK INCIDENT...  IF YOU HONESTLY WANT TO SAY ANTISJWS ARE THE SAME AS THESE PEOPLE, WHY ARE THEY NOT COMMITING CRIMES?  WHY ARE THEY NOT ATTACKING RANDOM PASSERBYS FOR WEARING A HILLARY SHIRT?  OR CORTEZ BUTTON?  YOU DONT HEAR ABOUT THAT AND EVEN LOOKING ON THE WEB FIND NONE OF THAT BUT YOU'LL FIND AN UNENDING SUPPLY OF MEDIA BIAS TARGETING CONSERVATIVES,  RANDOM PEOPLE LIKE THE RECENT UNDOCUMENTED MIGRANT WHO STOLE A MAGA HAT IN A RESTAURANT AND WAS DEPORTED, OR THE OTHER RECENT ONE WHERE A GUY TOOK A MANS DRINK AND SPLASHED IT ON HIM AT AN IN N OUT, HELL EVEN GOING BACK TO THE  BEGINNING YOU'VE GOT THE VIDEO FOOTAGE OF BLACK ADULTS PULLING A MAN FROM HIS CAR TO BEAT ON HIM FOR VOTING TRUMP AS THEY SHOUT \"DONT VOTE TRUMP, DONT VOTE TRUMP\", AND EVEN ANOTHER EXAMPLE FROM THE BEGINNING WHERE A SPECIAL NEEDS ADULT WAS KIDNAPPED FROM THE STREET BY 4 BLACKS *JUST FOR HAVING A BALD HEAD AND BEING WHITE* AND TORTURED AS THEY FILMED THE ENTIRE THING AND STREAMED IT ALL ON FACEBOOOK, THEY CARVED A SWASTIKA ON HIS FOREHEAD, BEAT HIM SENSELESS, MADE HIM DRINK TOILET WATER, AND MORE UNTIL POLICE WERE ABLE TO FINALLY SHOW UP AND RESCUE THIS POOR MAN FROM THEM... \n\n\nSO TELL ME, YOU WANNABE INTELLECTUAL SHITHEAD, WHERE ARE THE GODDAMN STORIES OF MAGA AND ANTISJWS GETTING CAUGHT ATTACKING PEOPLE???  IVE HEARD OF LITERALLY ONE INCIDENT, AND THAT WAS IT, AND I DONT BLIND MYSELF WITH BIAS SUCH AS YOUR WILLFULLY IGNORANT ASS DOES!!!

Every single time in history laissez faire ideas get the upper hand we get some form of robber baron or gilded age or gross wealth imbalance.

Supply side-laffer curve neoclassical bullshit.

YET YOU THINK PEOPLE WHO ARE VIOLENT TERRORISTS AND PEOPLE WHO ARE PEACEFUL PATRIOTS ARE THE SAME AND CAPITALISM IS EVIL???\n\n\n\"whining about sharing\" no, theyre complaining about theft, its forced legal theft and they dont like that, your policies are to take their money, their opportunities away and give them up such as your mentioned before ith how you despise the free market and want the rich to jsut give you free shit... its theft, it may be legal but theft will always be theft and this is what causes the rich to take their money elsewhere.  just look at the recent $15 an hour bill, now my career job's starting wage, is what you can make at mcdonalds... now with more money available, inflation has caught up, and because of the shift, many companies have had to drop workers or cut worker hours, and in some cases the companies are just outright automating their work to avoid the human element all together like amazon.  by being greedy, your policies have hurt everyone all around and now inflation is catching back up, chips have less chips in them to keep at the same price, prices of foods have shot up, etc. once 15 is the norm, the market will catch back up and then you idiots will want to raise the minimum wage again because 15 \"wasnt enough\" and itll have the same effect.",

Could you prove that with external sources? Are you sure he tried to shut them down or does the just critisize them for their flaws?\n\nThere are definitely people who have a bias against Islam. Some of these are just bigoted people who dislike anything thats different from them. But theres also a real connection between violence and extreme Islamic beliefs. An SJW minded person would call me a bigot because i recognize that connection, even though i have nothing against Islam, as a whole. The reactionary attitude behind SJWism is not limited to the left, but the term caught on because of how trendy the leftist hysteria and vitriol become over issues such as gender, islam, patriarchy, toxic masculinity, white privilege, cultural appropriation, and of the dumbest and most laughable of all the SJW crusades, trigger warnings and safe spaces lol \n\nSJWs tend to be young people who are utterly spoiled with the privileges of living in an advanced, democratic society, but who buy into and become rabid advocates of every wild critique they encounter about how that society is evil and oppressive.

Yes they are socially constructed but that does not diminish their efficacy. For example...  Children born to single parent families are statistically far more likely to be born into poverty to have problems with behavior, school, and lawn forcement.   According to pew research and, a lot of other sources, there is a likely detriment to having children born to single parents, Most likely young women. So before birth control, having sex outside of a committed relationship was frowned upon. The likely result being a child born into a situation that would set it up for failure.  And humans have known this for thousands of years.  So like I said before not all morals and values are simply opinion.  Some choices, some decisions are objectively  better",

Third wave decentralized allowing for racist, sexist, and homophobic feminists to all cooperate without dragging down all feminists. If you look up the history of egalitarianism it has much better record and actually achieved most of the things feminism claims credit for. The reason I bring all this up is I believe that most people are reasonable (I know that's a radical claim), and that if most feminists knew actual feminist history they would be more likely to self identify as egalitarians.

Nothing as delicious as liberal tears. We can’t genocide lefties, instead we’ll put them into play-pens and then bombard them with offensive things and soak up the outrage.” \n\nAnd in another one you suggested  gun violence towards “leftists”. \n\nBut then you wanna complain that people don’t like white men. You’re part of the problem. \n\nWhite men who have started “banding together in tribal fashion for mutual defense” are doing that because they can’t handle even a modicum of criticism or self-reflection, and refuse to honestly engage with criticism of systems that have benefited them. You’re so used to never having to think critically about race or gender, and you’re taking the easy way out and dismissing it all as bullshit instead of listening, learning, and growing.",

Like this is a critique, it’s not a actual disenfranchisement of your social status (though that should happen too). if your reaction to critique is “i’ll support nazism or mysogeny” then you’re kinda playing into the whole “fragile white masculinity” trope",

What the white race is is a collection of different ethnic groups loosely tied by being “from” the same continent, even though people have moved in and out of that continent for millennia.\n\nAll of the advancements you tie to “white” people are the result of two things: Mediterranean Civilization and Euro-Christian imperialism.\n\nMediterranean civilization includes the Greeks, Italians (Romans etc.), Persians Egyptians, Phoenicians, Islamic Caliphates, Iberians(Spain + Portugal), Turks, Mesopotamians and North Africans.\n\nThe Mediterranean was the birthplace of “Western Culture”. The peoples of Southern Europe are more genetically related to other Mediterraneans than they are to other northern European groups (such as the Celts, Germanics, and Nordic peoples).\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks#Genetics\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_J-M172\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_E-V68\n\nNorthern European groups didn’t advance past Bronze Age tribal society until the Romans invaded northward, bringing Mediterranean (“western”) civilization to the far reaches of Europe.\n\nThat’s when the Euro-Christian identity spread across the land and the idea of a “white” race began to form. Then came the imperialist era which was then quickly followed by the Industrial era (started in England, spread out over the rest of Europe quickly afterwards). They literally just got lucky. That’s what allowed for the creation of the colonialism and imperialism of the rest of the world, not “superior white genetics”.\n\nYour ideology and worldview is predicated on historical ignorance, xenophobia, bigotry and sociopathy.\n\nThat’s why educated left-leaning people see you as malevolent idiots.",

I was originally addressing my opinion pretty generally, and I assumed the defensive when you replied back with a blunt reply. Which obviously you're allowed to do and in hindsight, it really wasn't that bad, I suppose I can be guilty of reacting strongly too. The point in which I disagree with being labelled an SJW is that I support your freedom of speech and expression, hence why I never said you shouldn't be able to do that, just that it's always an annoyance to me when I see people attacking each other instead of trying to have civilised discussions about the subject, you could disagree with me on every fundamental level and that's absolutely fine, but if you do so in an aggressive way or resort to personal attacks I find it negates the purpose of the debate and really- nobody ever changes somebody's mind by being aggressive.\n\nStill though you're entitled to do that, maybe I should of clarified that more before, and for the record I am biased to my side so you are right on that, but as far as I can consciously tell I'm perfectly happy to look at your perspective and your side of the argument, but I can't make other people do the same, I don't think being on my side of the fence makes me a superior person by the way, and I do believe empathy is needed as most friendships and meaningful connections that help us through the confusing mess of life are connections with empathy, but if you mean in an internet context then fair enough.\n\nAnd it is all subjective man you're right, there's nothing wrong with the things you're saying, I was just stating how annoyed I was at the way in which people always end up arguing online, I'm not claiming to be all in the right though as looking back I can already see some flaws in a couple of the things I was stating likewise with some of your comments, like we say it is all subjective.\n\nMuch love and snowflaky hugs my dude :D",

I feel like a big reason why a lot of us became atheists, to begin with, is because we didn't want to be hateful and we saw the fearmongering,  oppression, and superiority complex ideology that was being pushed (often covertly) by our religions. It makes no sense for internet atheist communities to thrive off of those very same things, just re-branded. I wanted something BETTER with atheism... not the same shit in a different pile. And then often these Athiest communities strongly discourage questioning anything that is said by their idolized creators or any of their approved set of ideas so it's like escaping one religion/cult and just landing in another one. The only difference is that instead of worshipping a god they expect you to worship this unrealistic ideal of \"Classical\" western society... andd if you know much about ancient Greece/Rome you'd realize that you'd rather stay in 2019.",

Immediately following the 2015 general election here in the UK he made a video which was an unabashed attack on the Conservative government and their policies. So that was certainly showing some 'centre left' backbone on his part. He has done nothing as critical of right wing politics ever since from what I can see. Shortly thereafter, once Cameron and his Conservative government got the Brexit referendum underway, his content began tilting further to the right. Once Carl began sourcing hard right organisations as reputable sources of evidence (like Project Veritas) that kind of killed any claim he makes to being 'centre left' these days. At the very least these days he's behaving more like a Conservative with a bit of a social conscience",

Also, most of it wasn't as political as it was social issues, however did have parts in political topics",

Honestly, my reason for leaving that community was that as time went on I began to see less examples of these \"SJW’s\" and more people complaining about them, which made me realize that that many of these things are basically non-issues that aren't worth getting upset over. The world is not nearly as PC as some people think, and a lot of these SJW’s are quite easy to avoid if you stop looking for them all the time. If you believe something, you have a right to. But choosing beliefs just to spite the general public is so tired and annoying.",

But as it is true that the \"great replacement\" and many other conspiracy theories are part of the pathology of the Right, it doesn't mean that what you discovered is false, but on the contrary. A great part is true, and deeply problematic.\n\n\nThe political chaos we live in is because it is true, the Left is rotten.\nI'm still a Liberal (I couldn't vote Conservative if I wanted) and I have hope we will return to protect the weak and abandon the virtue signaling. It is not a conspiracy, it is being used as propaganda and getting into law.\n\n\nThere are is an uneven treatment before the law according to gender in some countries, there are quotas in many fields because it is assumed discrimination (when the metric of proportion is ludicrous), there is a constant racial  language that exacerbates an artificial tribalism in the name of \"justice\", there is blame bestowed upon racial groups because a supposed \"privilege\" .A horrific language that perpetuates war, an unnecessary language that is not the true Left, that protects the weak and promotes science, and not hysterical points of view.",

        "text": "@p.h.i.lcongure9168 First of all, I have no idea who managed to give you that kind of brainwashing that you believed that everyone wanted to hurt you. SJWs are not everywhere, most people don't care about snowflaking on the internet. From what I saw anti-sjws pick rare cases of absolute idiotism and just laugh it out, while also giving their opinion. If you than believe that EVERY feminist is some kind of evil lord, dear god, that is fanatism. And now you jusy jumped horse. You watch youtuber that picks rare cases of idiotism, beliving thay every anti-sjw is the same fanatic. Look around in the comments, people treat these youtubers like angels that blessed them with infinite knowledge, jesus fuck... \n\nNow in reality nothing is just black and white, it's whole spectrum of colors. There isn't some kind of objective good and evil, and you will often disagree with people that are on your side. Just because some leftists disagree with armored sceptic, doesn't mean he isn't leftist. And if you are not skeptical about your idols, if you never disagree, and just consume their words, than you don't have your own opinion.\n\nI often try to confront ideas that I disagree to challenge my viewpoint (you can't imagine how rare it is to actually talk about disagreements instead of hearing insults thrown at you). Being born in very conservative and homophobic country, I adopted some of these from my family. What changed me was challenging my opinions, not jumping horse to different godlike figure.",

        "text": "@Furebel I'm telling you about how I fell into the anti SJW rabbit hole along with many others. How do you not see all the people in the comments of these types of channels who feel attacked by left movements like this. It's the main reason these anti SJW channels even exist, cause they're threatened by the other side and are reactionary. I'm just stating how it is. And you're right about the fact that normal people don't care about SJW and anti SJW but anti SJW'S don't just laugh stuff off. They'll get heated as much as actual SJW'S about insignificant things and label it as woke propaganda. There was a gay wedding in Arthur that was only in the background with no significance put on it whatsoever. Most people didn't give it too much thought but then you get these anti SJW'S going on about how liberals are attacking their children and brainwashing them to be gay. I remember a video by one where they called black panther woke cause the majority of the cast wasn't white. They think minorities and gays are taking over even though in terms of representation they're still minorities. All you have to do is look this shit up to see for yourself\nI'm not praising anyone. I'm saying it how it is. I know better than to get myself into rabbit holes. You're making a bunch of assumptions here about me. I'm not pro or anti SJW. This may seem like a foreign concept to you but people are allowed to change their minds on topics, doesn't mean they're jumping ship. It obviously isn't all black and White but if you identify as an anti SJW on the internet chances are you're somewhat like this.",

I'm not saying vegans dont insult or look down on non-vegans sometimes, merely that vegans typically use a different parlance when trying to be derogatory.\nBut I'm vegan, and several of my friends are, and we use meat eater and non-vegan almost interchangeably, the issue with using non-vegan to refer to meat eaters is that there are non-vegan that dont eat meat, namely vegetarians.\nI'm sorry if you find meat eater derogatory but I mean.. when used in the proper context it really is just describing what you are, a person who eats meat, and theres nothing inherently wrong with that.",

For example, building a great wall on government money is the furthest thing from classical liberalism. He is simply too incompetent to get it done. \"Liberal\" by incomeptence is not very liberal. He is against free speech, including using his office to try and discredit journalists. And anyone who wants to ban immigration and supports systemic sorruption, etc. should shut up about a \"meritocracy\".\n\n\nTrump's \"anti-intervention\" is giving even more money to the army and letting them bomb anyone at any time, as long as they do it a lot. The number of drone strikes DOUBLED under Trump. It was going up under Obama, then Trump doubled that already huge number. So that's how anti-interventionist he is:\nhttps://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2017-12-19/counterrorism-strikes-double-trump-first-year\n\n\n\nAnd as for Sargon, in a zero-sum game, if you oppose one side, that means you support the other side. Simple as that, if you strip the bullshit away. He made a bunch of anti-Hillary and 0 anti-Trump videos right before the election. Describing that as anything but pro-Trump is simply lying.\n\n\nAnd under Trump, the economy is doing exactly like it did under Obama. The GDP growth has no trends in either direction since 2010. Goes back to my first point, Trump simply couldn't pass most of his economic policies, so it's still the Obama policies in effect. \nhttps://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/gdp-growth\nPlease, tell me how that's trending upwards since 2017... It's simply not. It's a constant line with some standard fluctuations.",

You can take out the parts you like, but if you simply look at it (click the 10Y button below the graph to see the relevant timeframe), it's clearly the same constant line. Here it is again. Just look at the freaking data:\nhttps://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/gdp-growth\nThe average wage growth is also at a constant level since the crash:\nhttps://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/wage-growth\nThe youth unemplyment rate is on a linear downward trend since 2010:\nhttps://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/youth-unemployment-rate\nWhile for the entire population, it's a constant trend since 2010. Maybe you can see a very slight downward trend since 2015, but that's again, not Trump:\nhttps://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/adp-employment-change\nSimply look at the graphs. Trump haven't changed any of them. The US economy is in the same state as it was under Obama. The whole \"Trump made the economy great\" thing is made up from thin air, none of the data supports it. The other side's \"Trump is running the economy into the ground\" thing is just as made up.\n\n\nBut if you have actual supporting data for all those big claims you made, I can't wait to see it. Not an opinion piece from Breitbart or Sargon of Akkad, but the pure data. I just want the DATA you used to come to those conclusions. I can interpret it myself.\n\n\nTrump did decrease troop employment overseas, I'll give you that. But he does other military activities like drone strikes more often than Obama. So that's a restructuring, not a decreased presence. And it's not lead by Trump. If it was, he would talk about it. Like a lot. like a LOT. He doesn't keep things like these to himself.\n\n\n\"You saying he is using his office to discredit journalists is just him calling them fake news and the enemy of the people isnt it? Well, isnt that freespeech? It is also truth so what is the problem?\"\n\n\nWhat's the problem with the POTUS bullying journalists? Seriously, WTF? Free speech protects citizens from the government. It is designed to protect the media from the Trumps of the world. If you think the GOVERNMENT bullying the media is part of their free speech, you have no idea what free speech means at all.",

He's an A grade attention whore.\nI don't like him, I just don't like how every one meet either thinks he's hitler or jesus. He's an asshole, but even in hindsight, I'd argue that the right choice was made.\nHillary is just a disgusting politician and a disgusting person who stands for nothing as consistently as her own ambition.\nTrump didn't create ICE or the situation on the border. That was already there, but he's being blamed for it",

If you make it harder, than you are against immigration, if you are not changing how hard it is, then you are neutral, if you make it harder, then you are against it. \n\n\nEconomy: I don't see the growth accelerating. That's the problem. You keep claiming it does, but what is it based on? That single quarterly GDP growth when it was 4.2? Obama had higher in 2014 Q2 and Q3 with 5.1 and 4.9 respectively. And these are outliers. The other numbers are 3, 2.8, 1.8, 2.3, 2.2, very basic, even low numbers. I don't see the data supporting the claims about the GDP growth being any higher (or lower) generally, than it was under Obama. But people keep claiming both.\n\n\n\"Really? The media calls him a racist, homophobe, nazi and whatever else but he says \"you are fake new\" and suddenly he is the bully? come on\"\n\n\nYeah. Welcome to the XVII. century. The government is given special power. In exchange, they can't use their power to silence speech. Especially anti-government speech. The media can bully the government all day, the government can't bully the media ever. Of course, ever is a high bar that no one can really meet, but they should at least try.\n\n\nAnd I'm so fed up with this fucking ridiculous bullshit where right wingers cry over being called nazis. It's the dumbest thing ever. Don't call people marching under a gigantic flag with a huge swastika \"good people\", and then you won't get called a nazi. People who do the absolute minimum to not be called nazis are not called that. And people who are called that, usually don't really care. They just bring it up to score pity points from people they don't even care about. And I'm called an \"SJW\" far far far far more often, than Trump is called a nazi. I simply don't care. He doesn't care either. Again, pity points, if he cared, it would be extremely easy to avoid it. It's annoying and dishonest.",

It was way back in 2014, right as gamergate was catching steam. I think that's when anti-SJW youtube really took off. Those blogs & youtubers are what introduced me to politics, & I started doing my own research. I read a bunch of second-hand university books on political science & sociology, & the more I learned from those objective sources, the more I realized that the anti-SJW crew were all a bunch of hacks who didn't know what they were talking about. They don't understand the basics of the political ideologies they talk about, they don't know political history, they just assume that they're right. \n\nIn a weird way, it's the anti-SJW's fault that I'm getting a bachelor's in political science because they were what got me interested in the topic in the first place.",

Then i started talking to trans people. i was able to win most of my arguments with Trans people but i'll admit, i strawmanned a lot..almost every time. But they were NEVER mean and Violent like the Anti-SJWs had led me to believe, they were all really sweet. Trump's bombing of Syria and affirmation of Jerusalem as Israel's capital really triggered me and pulled me away from Trump...i found a video TYT did on the topic, and i agreed with Cenk and Ana on ALL their points. it was my first time viewing them and i was like \"Hey, these where the guys the Anti-SJWs called crazy and irrational.\" so i watched more of their videos...i really admired how they'd often apologize when they were wrong, so that really struck a cord with me, i started to do my own research to affirm that the demons Cenk and Ana were being truthful, as i watched TYT and literally about everything i thought was \"right\" was wrong. When i talked about subjects, i'd get insulted mostly funny enough by Anti SJWs, Anti Feminists, right wingers...i'd get called a Libtard, SJW etc..when i wasn't even any of that at that time. i felt like i was making perfect sense about all the claims i made because they were factual. I found Kyle Kuilinski, and glorious glorious Contrapoints (she randomly appeared in my reccomendations) and honestly i ignored the video for a month...and i finally clicked the button to watch. She talked about incels, i watched her other videos..i found Shaun, Hbomberguy, TMM, BadMouseProductions, PhilosophyTube etc ...and honestly now, i'm pretty Far Left on social issues, ethics, etc...i've listened to the criticisms of capitalism and i agree, i am now seeking to learn more about Socialism.",

Also, the right wing didn't exactly have any similar, new  punching-bag representations until around the Trump campaign. It's really hard for me to explain, but what I'm trying to say is that it was really, *really* easy to make fun of SJWs, and even lefties did it too. However, the far-right were the only people who catered to it, and used it to their advantage.\n\nIn 2014 for me, there was no better laugh as a teenager than seeing a dumb SJW get put in their place, or look like a fool. The far right served me more of that, and turned it slowly into anger by saying that the SJWs weren't just stupid, but a PROBLEM FACING THE WORLD. And then from there, even if I wasn't laughing, I was still drawn to it. And then I was in there until I saw a few contrapoints videos, and started watching Lindsay Ellis again. And I got out.",

It didn't help that the a lot of the lefties leapt to their defense when they really shouldn't have, further making themselves look bad. Not only that being alt right was seen as being 'edgy and cool' because you were going against the mainstream. \n\nThis would also be the rise of the incel and MGTOW where lonely young men were slowly radicalized as those sorts of movements were co-opted by the alt right. Again the left didn't help because, rather than actually try to help these people, they pointed fingers and laughed, \"look at those losers, no wonder women don't want to date them...\" which pushed them even further into the hands of the alt-right.\n\nPlus you see things like the Battlefield incident where people were, rightfully pissed off, that EA had obviously just invented some female characters purely to pander to the left and given them an actual historical mission that real world men died in get shouted down because they're not \"Progressive\" and that anyone who pointed out that simply pasting out the people who actually took part in said mission was a disrespect to their memory was an \"alt right bigot\". This fed into the whole SJW Bullshit that the alt-right youtubers just ate up and produced thousands of videos on.",

This is why both \"sides\" seem to be talking over the points of one another and discourse isn't working to break the \"echo-chambers\". They don't even acknowledge that the context has changed. The Right is going at full throttle because they are the ones reacting to the Establishment. \n\nTrump and the \"alt-right\" is just plain Nationalism. In the sense of \"I take care for myself\" first. The \"alt-right\" just points out how Left ideology and policies are being used against Nations ( The People ) interests to further the Greedy Capitalist alliance with Left Socialist ideology Globalism ). \n\nThis Channel is not helping. In my Opinion, from the content this \"alt-left\" makes, is that they just keep ignoring it's them who are in the positions of Power and Influence and are biased into how much the political context changed and thus blind to their follies. When they critique they do so with half truths, with biased arguments because they see Right Wing Authoritarianism looming instead of engageing their talking points because that would make them admit they are commiting mistakes.\n\nEvery dissenting voice to the establishment is getting registered in a list, banned or smeared.

Anti-sjwism is a good money or attention earner.  Sargon and the like have managed to monetize it really well.  However I think it has a major downside for the producers of it, you get sucked into the idea that your viewers are more like customers than fans, and you change your own views to suit that.  Here in Italy we don't have problems with SJWs, because if you viewed the world through American lenses, you would think they are everywhere.",

In the earliest days of Rush Limbaugh's radio show, he was playing a part, a caricature of a far right pundit, much like The Colbert Report. I don't really know what his real political beliefs were at the time, but he played the part in a very entertaining way. But he went on a speaking tour, and for the first time, he saw how seriously his fans took the show, and that changed him. From that point on, the comedy fell away and the outrage took center stage. The quality of the show dropped, and the listenership boomed. He may or may not have had right wing views before, but at that point, he embraced the crazy and ran with it, heading towards the conspiracy minded far right.  The interaction between method acting and fan feedback, can really change a person.",

And I know this is a common argument that people like to wave away but it's one that's legitimately worth exploring. There are black Americans in my generation whose parents or grandparents were not allowed to attend white schools or buy houses in white neighborhoods, and in a lot of ways some of our institutions haven't compensated adequately for the shift in attitudes around race that has happened since. It really wasn't that long ago that there was a *very* strict implicit racial caste system which had been built for centuries, and unfortunately it'll probably take more than just a generation or two to disentangle ourselves from the cultural and systemic remnants of that. It doesn't help that white nationalism has been increasing in the mainstream here- and it was a little bit popular to begin with- which only further necessitates a near-obsessive analysis of society's treatment of race by all parties. Race is just one of those things I think most of us would *like* to be able to move past but there's just too much work left to be done, and so yeah, the reputation is probably well-founded.",

Add to that that abortion was legized in 1981 (in a form born out of compromise) and the fact that almost nobody wants to abolish any of those things, and you get a more relaxed social rights issue. There is still racism, that's for sure, but Xenophobia is more prevalent, altough lessening.\nFrankly it seems like people are more worried about other issues, at the moment, and they should be, the economy struggles to recover, young people struggle to find decent-paying jobs, and some things are bad enough they reached memetic levels.",

Also there was a woman in that show (I forget her name) who also criticized bowing to the narrative as effectively running cover for the powerful, where you can paint the whole of the left by the behavior of a few sophomores in an American collage, but stay quiet as rightwing leaders blow-away the American principle of free-speech (that you have enshrined in your constitution).",

The whole concept is absurd and then she gives off a sense of unarguably being right with smirky arrogance. If it was a different person doing the videos, I'm sure it would still get some backlash, but it would never have been so popular to criticize the videos compared to Sarkeesian herself. You can make the case that policing (especially joke policing) any entertainment or artistic content, however, would result in a mountain of backlash from any group of people especially when people saw it hypocritical that Sarkeesian herself never played video games before her fundraising for her project. It's the same reason why people get angry and annoyed when politicians try to ban violent video games when they, themselves, don't even play them in addition to telling other people how to live their lives.",

Being lectured during the movies about gender roles even if it's just implicitly did not resonate well with a lot of people. Movies in the past in contrast to that just wrote more diverse roles without having a specific goal in mind. In Star Wars it's just so forced and shoehorned that it isn't funny anymore. Also I might add there are really certain roles that cannot be substituted by females. The physical aspects and associations limit what you can do with a certain role. This is why there are no Arnold Schwarzenegger type female roles. So my opinion is that it had very well to do with gender roles but even more important how it was handled.",

Giving lead roles to females and even going further. Making the main cast entirely female. In how far isn't that an agenda? Or if your don't like that word let me rephrase that. In which sense isn't that movie driven by ideology that prioritizes gender over everything else? And this is just one example. Never before did Hollywood put solely focus on such issues.

Now that I looked back on it, years later not all the girls rejected me I was doing most of the rejecting. I was very colorist and conceded. Only light skinned skinny women I only accepted. Even the light skinned girl that liked the same things I liked I rejected, we were basically doubles I rejected her because she wasn’t “cool” but a nerd and she was fat. I took it as offensive that me being skinny should never be asked out by fat women. I could have married her she was my soulmate smh.. i’ll regret it till the day I die. I was a complete asshole back than smh! I was a republican telling black students to die if they used food stamps, I was angry and lost I feel so disgusted with myself.",

Do we agree that people shown in cringe compilations are mostly silly? Sure. Does that mean that we now follow Milo and Shapiro or whoever, and we base our political thought through this anti-SJW lens? Most certainly not.\n\n\nThere is a great leap between Sam Harris and Lauren Southern, just as there is between simply considering extreme SJWs silly and thinking brown immigrants are coming to take our abortion rights away (or force abortion on us? idk).",

        "text": "I think it is ironic that while a person is free to choose their gender identity and simple binary framing of that particular characteristic has long since been rejected, responsibility for defining political identity has been wrestled away from the individual and placed in the hands of groups of 'activists' who claim they support self-determination yet have reduced the political spectrum to a binary model of 'victim' vs 'Fascist' and have no respect whatsoever for nuance or diversity...\r Even more ironic is that these 'activists' have made endlessly discussing the labelling of celebrity social commentators their sole political activity!\n\n\nPersonally I think that political identity has much greater scope for complex definition than any other identifying aspect of an individual and that if nothing else, a person should be free to self identify and to have their choice respected...  If for no other reason than with the identity issue out of the way we could all move on and discuss issues... debate policy... you know..? Politics stuff. \n\nAll you have to do is not use the N word... or the F word... unless invited to do so. Remember though... political identity is fluid and can change at any time. If someone chooses to identify as a Nazi or a Fascist then that's fine... but it doesn't follow that they are will necessarily be a Nazi or Fascist the next time you meet.   Take someones stated preference for political identity label as the one you adopt when discussing them. It's basic politeness that costs you nothing and ensures that everyone feels respected. \n\nThink of what we could achieve if we moved forwards together!\n\nPerhaps we could discuss the global economic dependence on the military industrial complex and brainstorm some possible alternative economic models that are fit for the 21st century and beyond... we could explore whether the label 'working class' has any relevance since automation and globalisation decimated the employment market... We might come up with alternatives to large scale industrial manufacturing and its associated employment opportunities... you know..? Like... important stuff. (Plus it is about time we finally ended gender inequality and that pesky pay-gap issue... by making all women CEOs of large corporations as is their basic right...)",

With as less central government as possible.  ( an idea ' barrowed & twisted ' by so-called U.S 'libertarians 'who made it into some right wing version)\n Only I know that in reality such a society can not be created within today's world. So now i support what is called the  'left' in general.  Because people are 'right winged by nature (nurture ?).  Meaning people tend to grab as much for themselves and theirs , without any need for a 'right wing party 'to support & defend this tendency .Now before i start some manifesto , i hope this answers your question.",

        "text": "@imaratspal Seizure of private property for the good of the people and massive government intervention in the economy in order to ensure mass employment.\nLook, it's a bit difficult to discuss the entire development of the Nazi party in a youtube post. Essentially, they started out with both a right and a left wing in their party. The thing is, all the Nazis wanted initially was a strong state with a strong leader who didn't need to listen to parliament but could rather quickly and decisively help his people. Now, they defined his people as Aryan Germans, so following from that would be the disenfranchisement of the Jews and many others (initially not their extinction).\n\nAn ideology like this (strong state, strong leader, no parliament of note) isn't exclusively right-wing. It can also attract left-wingers. And it did. But after Hitler's rise to power he eliminated the left-wing of his party. In 1934, there was the Knight of Knives where the Nazis loyal to Hitler killed all the Nazis loyal to Strasser, leads of the left-wing of the Nazi party. After that, the Nazis were decidedly right.wing in ideology (though in practice they kept seizing private property and interfering in the economy). This is why many people don't know about the left-wing of the Nazi party.\n\nNow, their worst crimes, the reason everyone hates them, were right-wing, yes. But what I wanted to highlight wasn't where they ended, but rather where they started, because in order to stop something like this from happening again, we have to stop it when it begins, not when it ends. And it began as a movement with followers from the right and the left. Basically, anyone who's anti-democratic can spiral down into Nazi territory. And there's anti-democratic people on the right and on the left.",

It doesn’t contribute to discourse at all. Nor are such topics truly significant in our political climate, though they can easily be used as political ploys.

It's really strange. Why? Because its Kind of like what you say the extremist left does:  partisan thinking. As long as anybody is against the SJW's, that's all that matters and In an effort to stomp out the radical lefists, many \"rightists\" use similar methods. They get called xenophobic, racist, sexists etc. and, therefore, many start to actually behave in such a way unironically. Insults, shutting others down. These actions aren't isolated to one side.

Even before I left the right, I had watched some of Philosophy Tube's videos, and later On Tom Nicholas. Them and other channels helped demonstrate a different mode of thinking, one relying on understanding studies and data, on holding every position based on deeper principles rather than holding many positions as \"inherent truths\".\n\nThis is perhaps a much more positive spin than I normally give to my political journey, but I wanted to emphasize how important intellectual honesty is, and that changing people is possible. That socialist I mentioned earlier knew I was alt-right, but she still treated me with respect like everyone else, and she wasn't arrogant when criticizing my ideas.

He smears Jeremy Corbyn (you know, British Bernie who's somewhere more leftist) as a Marxist. Because, yeah, center leftists don't know better than to abuse _that_ insult.\n\nThe guy's done livestreams with Kyle Kulinski (a left wing commentator who actually helped found a political group that runs center left politicians in the US, Justice Democrats), since the two are friends, where he [Carl] says that \"any economic system that produces billionaires is a broken system\" (paraphrased). Since then, even Kyle recognizes that Sargon is publicly more right wing than he'd been, and yet if you criticize Sargon -- no matter where, when, how, or why -- one of his defenders will come to his aid and say that he _is_ center left and anyone who says otherwise is a phony.\n\nApparently Sargon's bait & switch worked on some people.",

I’m rather young (16) but was even younger (around 14-15) when I stumbled upon these kinda of videos.\n\n As a young impressionable child/teen I immediately got a sort of feeling of trust and rationality from adults talking calmly and not screaming and screeching like the supposed “sjws”. \n\nBut the deeper I got into the anti sjw videos the more I started seeing stuff I disagreed with. There were still people rationally talking about topics (so I felt inclined to believe) but these included stuff like men being greatly superior to women, homophobia, racism and other extreme beliefs. I am a girl myself and I kinda started feeling like the idea of “women are weaker, dumber and basically subordinate to men but heyyy you still deserve some basic human rights!!” was fed to me. \n\nIt stared to kinda impact my self esteem and worth but it was what helped me to realize how extreme they were. \n\nSlowly but surely i then completely realized how I ended up in the extreme right that was just as, if not more toxic than the extreme left. \nAfter that I decided to get more onto the middle ground of politics. You shouldn’t get sucked in too much by either side. Both have good arguments and view points but both can get incredibly toxic and extreme.",

    "text": "Oh wow, this video hit really close to home.\n\nWhat you said in the beginning about people who are a bit center-left (with limited knowledge in politics mind you) seeing these skeptic videos pop up all of a sudden and being dragged into this alt-right propaganda machine is pretty much exactly what happened to me. The only difference being that I also got pulled in by youtubers with scientific backgrounds (like Thunderf00t) who suddenly started making this anti-SJW content. People like Ben Shapiro also seemed really appealing to me at the time with his rapid-fire misinterpretation of facts in all his debates which always seemed to stump his opponents. The only thing that I always disliked (even though I liked their other stances) about people like Shapiro and JBP was their weird stances on LGBTQ issues, gender equality and their faith in the so called 'judeo-christian values' and religion as a whole.  \n\nAfter falling deeper and deeper down that rabbit hole for a year and a half, I fortunately got back up and faced reality when I saw all these people defending Trump with his dog whistle politics, science denial and those weird conspiracy theories of his. I also started getting curious and watched many of Destiny's debate videos which just showed how stupid and uneducated many of my previous 'idols' (yikes) actually were. \n\nThe dangerous thing with the anti-SJW community is how simplistic and surface-level their arguments are. This means that they can reel in people who don't know anything about politics just by showing the 'other side' being irrational and then make some 'muh free speech' arguments which on the surface seem really appealing to a person who doesn't really know what to think. Most people won't question what they say, nor hear what the other side has to say or if any of the sides align with the facts at all. It's basically 'first come, first served' with the anti-SJW's being the first to come most of the time. \n\nAnyway, this was a long story/rant. I hope it was somewhat comprehensible.\n\nWe need more channels like this one, who can reel people in before the anti-SJW community does. Thank you Three Arrows! And keep up the good work!",

You have mentioned only those opinions that are relevant to your narrative, all the while neglecting to mention Carl's left-wing views such as his opposition to the freedom of association (the libertarian cake question) and his openness to government surveillance of a person's social media and private life. Carl is also self-avowedly pro-choice on the issue of abortion and has advocated on behalf of the concept of the welfare state on numerous occasions. \n\n6:38 Citation needed. You claim that \"para-social relationships\" are more potent via YouTube than regular television. Please provide sourcing.\n\n7:05 Citation needed. It is unclear to me how watching \"Anti-SJW\" videos causes a viewer to become part of a \"hive mind.\" Please provide sourcing.\n\n8:52 This is a reflection of the feminist 'male tears' trope back upon feminists and like-minded ID-pol pushers. There is also nothing intellectually dishonest about basking in the schadenfreude towards people who hold opposing viewpoints, even though it may be devoid of reasoning or discussion of policy. Shock value and trolling are common art forms.\n\n9:00 Support of Brexit does not necessarily imply \"Anti-SJW dogma.\" Not only is it possible for an SJW like Louise Mensch to support Brexit, there are arguments in support of Brexit that do not relate to SJW's.\n\n10:28 The Wall Street Journal is the same outlet that ran a story making an out-of-context connection between PewDiePie and anti-semitism. Your logical fallacy is the appeal to authority - a more established media outlet is still capable of producing fake news. It is possible for a YouTuber to offer greater perspective.\n\n10:53 The “truly worrisome” standard you invoke for political developments appears to be based on your personal opinion and is therefore subjective in nature.\n\n11:53 That DNC candidate (Sally Boynton Brown) you mentioned was cheered by the audience and applauded by the other stage-members for her diatribe.

        "text": "I just want to point out that Anita has had constructive criticism aimed at her, it is just that she blows off all forms of it. I have read it on her videos before she shut all comments down. I think the Sargoniauts just took it way too far.  Defenders of Anita though will be quick to point out that she is only looking at it from a feminist perspective BUT that is where this is wrong.  Feminism historically is looking at unfair treatment of women BUT this does not mean the unfair treatment of men for the SAME thing should be ignored.  Her refrigerator trope was her first video I saw actually but she failed to mention that male characters are often and used in no less and probably more capacity as nothing but backdrops for the protagonist.  This means women are not being unfairly treated, ie not being solely targeted just because they are a female.  It is not a valid argument to say so what because we have more male protagonists.  This does not mean women characters are unfairly treated as backdrops it means women are not getting enough protagonist roles which is a completely different argument.\n\nI saw her argument as nothing more than looking at working conditions in a factory and only focusing how women are being treated then demanding that bad treatment end.  Meanwhile all the male workers are being treated like shit.  This is where modern feminism has derailed itself because it is going beyond the removing unfair treatment of women to where men are not being treated in this same unfair capacity and working towards equality but looking for preferential treatment of one gender over another.   This is probably my initial attraction to the Sargonites but as I said they just took it way too far and became this alternative facts machine.  I began to notice the types of commentators they attracted on their channels.   As I said previously it went from skepticism to ideologues.  Brexit was a more of a fuck you.  No reason in who this was going to fuck over or any depth of rational thought.  Just a big fuck you, I want to see the other side lose their shit and know I caused it.  Then the US primaries hit and I just had to turn them off.  It is hard to look at Carl's smug face.  As well as Bearing and this whole bearded dude in a tutu going into the girls bathroom because he just wanted to be a girl that day so he could molest little girls argument they constantly wanted to throw around.  Talk about completely misrepresenting the issue.  Again, jumped the shark into ideologues.",

They are different in what they believe, but they are the same in many respects. The horseshoe theory is valid here as well.

You're the one stating your opinions as fact and getting annoyed that I'm not towing the line.\n\nI disagree that the right is more tribal than the left. The fact that they \"eat their own\" isn't because they self reflect, it's because they're TOO tribal.  Back in the old days you could hold 5/10 left wing beliefs and still be considered left wing. Today you must hold 10/10 left wing beliefs or you're rejected... hence \"eating their own\" because many of them find out they don't agree on 100% of everything, or new ideas come out that one must adhere to right away or be ejected from the tribe.\n\nRight wing \"whataboutisms\" is used often, I agree... however I disagree about the reasons for it.  The main reason in my opinion is because the left is so damn hypocritical, loaded with double standards that they apply to one group and not another. The right tends to avoid this while staying consistent, wanting the same standards for everyone. This is why they use \"But what about the left doing this\" because the standard is always different.\n\nThis is why the right is more logical and more appealing these days to many people.  Most logical people think that being fair and unbiased is the best course of action while the left advocates double standards and total bias, while masquerading as \"equality\".",

SJWs are the type of people who freak out about halloween costumes, who need “safe spaces” by which they mean no white people and no exposure to ideas they dislike, people who shut down speakers at schools (and even set the damn schools on fire for having speakers they dont like) and people who say ridiculous shit like “men rape with their eyes”. SJWs are _mostly_ (definitely not always)  <30 yr olds with little real life experience who believe in the oppression olympics: that society is a hierarchy of oppression and everyone who isnt at the top is a victim. They also think that being white and male is what puts someone at the top. \nSJWs have no real conception of people as individuals; to them we are all simply groups. Each of us is an intersection of different types of victimhood, to the SJW. A black man is not as opressed as a gay black man, is not as oppressed as a disabled gay black man, is not as oppressed as a disabled gay black woman etc etc. Theres many people out in the world working to improve society who dont adopt the SJW resentment and cultish lack of critical thought and context. \n\nAnd 2) you dont seem to understand is that everyone who disagrees with you isnt a sociopath. You labeling them that way comes from your toxicity and immaturity. Its just hostile, self righteous resentment. Which is what SJWs are all about. \nOr maybe im wrong.... are you a licenses mental health professional? Do you have the qualifications and competence to make a psychological diagnoses? I think, no. You dont have the qualifications to assess psychopathy or sociopathy or anything else, so you have no business thinking that you can identify these conditions in others.

Just as SJWs are known for calling everyone who disagrees with them nazis or fascists. Nazi and fascist are terms which do in fact mean something,  every though they get throw around obnoxiously, sometimes. Same with SJW. \n\nIts pretty rare that people confuse me for an SJW. I explain to people that they arent qualifed to diagnose mental illness when they talk about trans populations and i provide links to scienitific research on gender and sometimes on sexual orientation. I explain that racisim is systemic and i provide numerous examples of blatant discrimination - not disproportionate outcomes! Those are the issues i most commonly argue for the traditional liberal perspective and _every once  in awhile_ someone calls me SJW but its very rare. \n\nIf youd studied real history to any serious degree you wouldnt care so much about the SJW label lol its relatively trivial. \n\nTo deny your use of polemics is in fact a sophistry 😂",

Like you say, you stop falling for the anti-SJW rabbit hole when most of them are grifter, now you are falling into another rabbit hole which involve the progressive side which end up all becoming grifter. Look what happen to Kyle Rittenhouse when he acted in self defense. Or when balenciaga posted BDSM theme with children. Not a good look.",

This video was more like of a catalyst really, I was hearing opinions here and there and this video made it clear for me to use a filter if you will. I didnt change to any sort of ''extreme progressive side''. Media and people on the right present the given examples of yours as a norm when in reality they can be random. I personally do not know they exampels you have given. Taking a ''crazy'' person and presenting it as a ''side of few people'' is quite dangerous. I dont trust the media because they change the lens. Remember the ''trigger'' girl? Thats an example. Showing different than us the viewer people that are reacting for something it might look stupid and convincing us its 'all like that'.",
