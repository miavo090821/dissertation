the first thing that I have to ask you is who is an icon to [Music] you whoa that's a very like like this like the description or like another person yeah a person who do you think is Iconic I mean of course like I got to say you you know I I mean that's just how we do it but like but yeah when I think of like icon I think is someone that transcends like a particular niche of what they do and then they're no longer known for for like the specific thing that they're doing but more so for like a principle or a theme or something to that regard so like when like for instance if we could take you out of context and like make you make something totally different around that like how many times like your memes have been used for instance like people know about this but like when beh into the Al's memes they live a different life like they don't even have to make sense no more but like boom so like the same way like how I find myself in the wild and I be like Lord I didn't realize that I said this out of context and sound thisp part like one time like I was quoting I was saying something about um if you are a black man with nail polish in the Caribbean fight brimson s and gor but because you were saying that's how the be the Caribbean respond but they using that as a clipon to to support the sentiment exactly the right took the clo the quit and they just like we like him and I was just like no you you no sir please not what I was saying I did not mean it like that that's not what I meant but yeah icons transcend specifically one medium and like they're able to be used in totally different um scenarios and still have impact still have application so what's it like to be iconic what's it like to have an audience I mean it ain't supposed to be for us right cuz like I mean we could talk we could talk like because this is the only time when something like this happens for the most part like rarely do you have two bahamians that have been able to transcend one area of entertainment and we know a lot of amazing like bamian entertainers content creators like dis thingu people but like it was not made for us the infrastructure here in order to transcend our immediate Ambience there's nothing there for us yeah so when you like are able to be you and like you was the first person that I saw like to actually have somewhat of a road map you're like okay yeah you could you could do this like you could be Progressive you don't have to dress up you don't have to be a beham in Ty Perry and wear wigs and make you know jokes about women and things like that in order to gain some type of notoriety online and given that you talk about Progressive politics and I talk about Progressive politics and coming out as political scientist and I was just like you know what I Ain necessarily see nobody else doing this until I saw you and as soon as that happened I was just like ra when 100K came around when you know all of the the fact that like I was able to pay rent off of this alone I was just like Rao I actually doing this I wasn't supposed to do this at all yeah I was supposed to go to law school it's funny like you you were the same Bron with me because I got my degree in poai too like um you just you just spared yourself the psychological torture that is law school and I love that for you I I love that I was this close not to because like I took the exam for um Iowa got in and like big Iowa University and then at that same time I had released a video like I was finishing up iow State released a video um and also got into law school at the same time and it was like this metaphorical fork in the road cuz I was just like all right so you going keep on doing this not real job because you know everybody been saying like Okay so like when you going to you know get a real job yeah everybody back home was saying okay like you know you can do this law thing this thing temporary right and then when I was able to see oh wow like this could pay rent and then some and I'm not miserable right now doing this you know I think I could yeah I think I could try to do this and more and more it became reality to the point like where now it's no longer like okay this is the not real job that you're doing before you go to law school this is the job yeah this is this is it yeah and that still perplexes a lot of people over here as you as you already I could imagine I like I could imagine cuz something you know people people don't realize about the Bahamas they don't know a lot about the Bahamas everybody's heard about us as a vacation destination in their mind but they don't know nothing about like the the reality of living in the Bahamas and the Bahamas is like the sixth most expensive place to live in the world and our minimum wage is what they they just raise 625 something like that like yeah something yeah and still you can't buy egregious like that like you so it is incred it's it's hard hard to make it in The Mamas period let alone so let alone being able to do something so unconventional and something I guess people don't realize in the in the disadvantage bamian creators are always going to be be at is even if you are so big in the Bahamas that every Bahamian know you every single bamian know you that is not going to be more than that's not you there there aren't 500,000 bons in the world yeah you can't live off that you can't it won't even if yeah you could be like probably the most talented Tik Tok like I like I know them like I mean like we could even get into like names like dasque in like to who I also I think you should bring on for an iconic D oh I love to to was literally to just visit uh New York and was here like that's my girl mother sick yeah that's my girl she I remember like seeing her in school like and she was uploading Vlogs before like I knew tap as a Creator like tap and collage them you remember like wait what you stop like first and foremost all right top um [ __ ] bamian say video I remember when she was droing know was when I was in board in school and like you know being away at the stat at the time was like living for that like oh my God some you know and so I always to know top first for that and then and I always talk to top about her ability to Pivot is beautiful like like like it's really excellent cuz tap do does an entirely different kind of brand of content and stuff than she did when we first ever knew her and she's been good at all um but then collage them would stop likeing man lives in my mind rentree like you have no idea like all the time and like the thing about it is because I'd be trying to like do that as well like bringing on more beaming creators and not just like cuz you ain't going to have no you're not going to be able to meet everyone at like the same level of progressive whatnot especially like when we live in here and I'm not going to act like I'm like this part going on a progressive is something like no I I doing bigoted [ __ ] like on a regular basis and I have to check myself like on a regular basis I have to go and like unlearn the patriarch onar before and what not and that comes with like a lot of social sanctions so I get that and I get like I see bahamians I'm like damn like you know they got like a lot of potential to you know transcend and not saying that like making like content here and like that being the end goal isn't a good thing because like I mean like that's great you don't have to worry about the white gays you don't have to worry about like the American like what satisfies that audience or anything if you make stuff like that Americans can't understand or like the Ze guys can't understand I respect that because it will not get you paid and it will not sustain you but like it will sustain your soul to an extent like making like beaming content for beham to sustain your soul but like when I talk to Bing graders and I'm more like damn I try to like you know find ways to include you just to like expose them to like a different audience and I'm all like well damn I can't even like bring you on like that because like I know about two seconds in you going to say something that could literally get me on every last every last podcast where they talk about people like find going down the hole it's going to be me but like I know that that's literally mainstream yeah and we are in that world where like our association with with with with a person like a person a pay on your on your channel one time and people saying that's your best friend meanwhile you ain't never met this person in your [ __ ] life you ain't talking about like you don't you probably don't know their government name like and and that's the thing like so slowly like we and like you've been doing this as well like I like give like a lot of credit to you about in like the intentionality behind doing this which is just like kind of weaning your audience off of what they're used to engaging with and consuming so you're not going to get the same tired Jordan Peterson breakdown or Shapiro breakdown or whatnot like you're bringing in like things that of course has the same principles yeah but not the same Framing and the same materials and like that's what I've been like slowly trying to do as far as just like bringing in like the Caribbean side of things so like when I did that breakdown of like how you know terrorism is in new slavery and like introduce people into like that was a bamian video and that like the fact that that got over a very Beaman video and that got over 100k I was just like but if I could talk about like the things that like mean a lot to me instead of having to because every Caribbean person or everybody that is not from like the majority experience they have to sublimate in some type of way in order make it sustainable because otherwise people click like I have on a constant basis I was making Caribbean content for like a year that's how it came into the game yeah nobody was into that like I talk in like circling the drain like for the longest I made like breakdowns to Luke Cage and like how is Jamaican you know stuff wasn't all that but like as soon as I can bring in like American stuff it's just like okay that's great but now I at a point like where okay I could slowly you know put you on to some Caribbean stuff and people go watch because they came for the theme they just ain't familiar with the story or the subject exactly say people wasn't into that were bahamians also not into that cuz the funny thing I find is Bohemians make up a very ve and and beans love me on you know what I mean like on Twitter like bamans love me bamans go up for me that listen me and my people are locked in but B is make up like an almost non-existent percentage of my like YouTube audience you know what I granted to be fair we are a small population so if if however the massive amount of numbers in a place like United States are watching me is always going to be a negligible percentage but they're watching Sydney Patrice and and and they love that [ __ ] exactly so I'm just like that's also the thing right is like not only does the larger audience not want something but even your target audience don't necessarily want that true and that's some painful [ __ ] yeah like that's actually like a good point I mean being yet again in a socially conservative country making Progressive content where you're going to be othered by the people watching you even if you appeal to the biggest audience because of how you present yeah you know you going to get the microaggressions of oh I like what you're saying don't like your accent you going to get the overt like aggressions from other creators talking about oh your accent isn't real because like you don't know what a code switch is or you've just never been around [ __ ] before in your life that you like you know um but at the same time like the people near you like closest to you they ain't going engage in your [ __ ] because you believe and you affirm the fact the trans wom women or you affirm the fact that like hey capitalism not so great because they're just not they don't have like the framework for that right now but yet again like I go right back to you I ain't going to Big you up too much inside this but like you peppering in Progressive stuff but like you deliver it in a way where but I like how has come up on the internet and she has talk this and she say this and she cuss [ __ ] so they like that they like that part ban like slackness so if you find a way to like speak it in that language you could pepper that you could put the pills in the dog food and they'll eat it I do think bamans were fundamental to my survival and thrival on a place like Twitter because there comes a point on Twitter where I want to say it's around to me I think it's maybe around 20,000 followers like and like it go up from you know from there where people start to like like police you a little different right so like what they liked from you if you was cursing people out before I had a th000 followers 5,000 beautiful beautiful we have 20,000 50,000 followers you you a Gangster and a bully like you know what I mean so what was funny is I feel like I there was a time when I was just kind of cuz I have let me for for context who don't know so I have like as it's present day like 163,000 followers I think or something on Twitter but around um maybe around 20,000 I think 30 guys that was like coming up out out of where it seems like you've left your Niche like law Twitter where they think they know you and is is getting into bigger Twitter you starting to pay make media appearances um there I felt like there was there was a little a rumbling of the white people wanted to to be upset to like about me cursing people out like and bamans jumped on it like bamans would not allow that to become the popular consensus like anytime anybody thought they was going to go check me bans was in that comment like they they made the community comfortable with like yeah then all all the white people in the Americans just got in like okay yeah yeah yeah we like it and I I I think that saved me I can't think without beh but but the thing is like when I seen the cuz we have a name for the car crew like that's that's what it is like I mean like and and if you've come into contact with them if you've been on the receiving end of them you know God spay your soul but I mean the only problem with that is like when I get into my cruffles when I get into my little you know the way carry on is is bigoted towards your audience your primary audience for real for real yeah I know so you got to do like the Trump and you got to be all like Stand Down stand by like you know what I mean like you have to because like you start seeing like the transphobia and then you start seeing the homophobia and going say but you like man why you watching for him and you ain't like him like that you like man and going to say yeah I I feel you brother I appreciate what you're doing but like can you do it differently please please you you're making things worse ah listen to me listen to me I just okay when I see people people fighting on my behalf I just be like hey thank let me tell you nothing make me happy in this life and I don't see it OD often to be honest I feel like I'm I'm one of those people who people see like yeah she could defend herself like to lawyer but when I do see people like fighting on my beh like they said the thing like for me I i' be like thank you I I appreciate you you I love it's you who's good to me and like and that's the thing like being and and yet again I got to go and give it to you because you're going to experience like a totally different type of vory all and people will come differently at you even though you going bar and you goingon to bark harder than that I ever I don't even engage with them I've seen you shut down some things and I just be like Lord she got the energy and she got the bar I don't even run so like the type of like the type of controversies that we will end up in simply from both sides like from the right from the left everything in between like it is an experience and ainal space that you occupy as someone with our presentation and as well as our proclivities and beliefs yeah that's that's pretty isolating you know because like you will get people that's supposed to be your allies doing you dirtier than the [ __ ] that you trying to do and way dirtier way dirtier because they have a vested interest in doing you dirty because so many people whether they believe it or not consciously or unconsciously subscribe to the idea that they can only be one and they see and because they believe they can only be one when they see you doing your de thing being successful at your one land the see you've CED out for yourself they who believe that can only B be one see you as a threat and so many people make this like and this is something I've realized about the internet and in all these years and about people so many people believe that if they can there are a lot of people who think like that there are a lot of people who have that there can only be one and who have that jealousy and that kind of mindset and so you can all rally around trying to knock a one person off the seat but what no one ever seems to realize is that don't put you there you know what I mean like that's Fox it don't put you there like you don't never know many [ __ ] get a [ __ ] hate campaign waged against them every second of the day there something and you don't know who the [ __ ] who the [ __ ] responsible you know what I mean it don't me just never it don't go like that right so I think the best best people people need to make is to focus on themselves child I I always like as somebody who was so obsessed with what I got going on as you know um I'm always like the energy if I put this kind of energy onto other people or what I realized other people put like people who are supposed to be on your side of the Campell put into trying to bring you down I'm like you could have put out some [ __ ] content you could have do something valuable of your own you could have done some advocacy like I just be thinking like sometimes when I see it you'll see like people writing off ads writing like doing video essays doing you know starting these hate campaigns and I'd be like wow if you did that towards like a subject or a thing like how much long how much more longterm value would that have for you like you ever see that like sometimes I really think like I look around at like accounts that are like no like do that do these kinds of things or or personas and people and they always have such a like glass ceiling like I'm always like why are you performing and top dancing for this glass ceiling list way like it you're not you can't transcend this this isn't doing you a favor this doesn't reap the this doesn't reap enough reward actually this is limiting you'd be better off that's why it's funny that you say you know I have the energy to C people up my favorite thing but you is anytime anytime you in any drama and I come and I come tell you this you me if that don't pay me no mindit like I talking I didn't realize there's one thing that I that I had to learn early on was just like there's part of the job social media is our job right like I mean it is it is what pays us but certain things don't pay us yeah engaging in the drama don't pay us even like like being on Twitter it don't it don't pay me and like if there's any drama on it I mean like but even beyond that or like like as far as just like how these different factions evolve it's very reminiscent even though they like the people that will come at us like they're very reminiscent of the altright organizing that we know from other places yeah they move in the same way as far as just like obfuscating truths like straight up lying trying to take control of narratives and then you realize that oh if a l me respond to me that's going to generate more views y than if Alig just ignore me so like when I figure that out I just like ra I I already say what I got to say on thing you ain't see one place I ain't going is that's back and forth you ain't going see me doing that like I'll go to bah I go here I Ain going back ain't happen so like after I realize that the best comeb back is literally just coming back and dropping some dope [ __ ] and KN only that but like that's like a Redemption AR for anybody that's been cancelled that's watch it like if you e you could I don't care what you've done if you come out the next week or so and drop one solid something [ __ ] could forget the internet has like a memory of a goldf they will forget no that's facts no that's Absolut that's absolutely facts and that is that is don't be people mindset okay they don't be into that that sounds like work ethic they be like you I got to go I got to go make some heat and you know I think something you know something idub said to me in my leftist Rebrand video idub was like um or no or maybe idub said it in his apology video that I cover in in the LA Rebrand video but he was like he didn't have the the reason you know making this kind of content or whatever he was making it kind of kind of content he was making is he's like I didn't have the faith in like my own personality or my own funniness to be able to you know sustain audience and sometimes I realized that not items like just people off in the damn ether and all these different people is I think sometimes the reason why they don't find like that's our response to it and they don't find that as viable is cu they don't feel like they have the capability of truly making you know what I mean like content for real bang it's like a lot of people can only have a platform if they talking about other people you know what I mean like that's the only thing that's bringing views like I mean and we see that like a lot more especially in the current iteration of the internet that we have because a lot of people are getting tired of the internet in general right I mean like they're tired of being sold too they're tired of of um people pontificating lives and then they finding out that oh okay they're not living like that offline yeah they're tired of people getting cancelled they're very wey and cynical of people being online so like we're we're kind of oper ating like maybe I've said this like in different places that we're operating on maybe like the last Bastion of of creators the creator of tomorrow is going to be a very different Creator because it brings about a level of awareness of the current landscape of what it is to be a Creator there's been far too many big events that has colored the way the people see us that makes us different from UBS idbs would have like existed preoccupied a space where there was still you know there was still some Allure to being a Creator at this point now since being a Creator is so accessible being influent influential is not accessible but like you picking up your phone making a Tik Tok anybody could do that anybody could call themselves that and it's gotten to a point of like so [Music] little tact and and thoughtfulness when it comes to content that the bar is getting higher as far as for like success meanwhile the entry point is just anybody can pick it up and then they could get into a room with you and they could be like oh yeah like you do YouTube I do YouTube too or you do Tik Tok like I do Tik Tok too yeah that's fact what do you what do you consider I think that's absolutely right and so I don't my boss of success is incredibly wonky like like because cuz I feel like I see myself like I guess and what it is I don't know maybe maybe I'm just so aware of the internet or or you know platforms and and what huge platforms really look like or people would you know in incredible reach um so I always see myself as like very tiny like very like oh and and every I'm always like that's how I see it in my brand but I'll talk to people or I'll hear people talking about themselves who have no real platform I swear to God and they be talking like like they be talking like a famous like a famous person with famous problems and i' be like like so what's your B for Success here it always changes cuz like I got the same problem that you got like to an extent I think that you worse than me um but like when it comes to like I know me a year or two ago would not have thought that I would have gotten this far like we occupy probably one of the more like roles and careers of the new age like being a content creator is like probably one of like the most sought after careers right now every if you ask your child that's what they won be and when I started I definitely didn't think I was going to get this far and now at this point with the gold post continually changing I think that that's the only thing that is depriving me of like happiness because I'd be like depressed I'm often depressed at like my numbers or like my or like my stats my analytics every time like and I refreshed that page non-stop I had to take it off my phone because I had an addiction to my please take it off your phone and like no uhuh but like the thing is once I it it depends on like what exactly the satisfaction factor that I'm reaching I think like that's so crazy to me even I so even cat you off it's so crazy to me that hey you feel like you upset with the numbers because for first and for all right right I don't and I and and I do want to make sure you discuss this with your people cuz I what I don't think people realize is you live in the Bahamas you're not just ban like I I'm Aman but I live in the states right even though you're like but F lives in the bomas like I need you to understand what a very different world and day-to-day universe and experience that is like cuz when I go to the when I go home I feel like the states feel like it feel almost like a mirage it feels so far away but what's going you know what I mean like I don't the whole time I be home I could give a [ __ ] less like for real for real it's so hard for me to be attached to anything anybody talking to me about you know um on the internet and so you not only are home like making this content into this largely like American audience this huge American audience like a audience much bigger than anything you would be able to get home and you don't have the thing people don't recognized is like you don't have a social media like a true social media presence anywhere else like so and I say that to say you don't I feel like I I promote my videos I slang my videos like mixtapes okay like you need on the corner like I you in listen you don't know I promoting okay I tweeting I Instagraming I threatening I everywhere and I have a platform bunch of places and I promoting I promoting I promoe I promoting the way I see you for you to feel like disappointed at some numbers and when you just put out a video and I'm like this [ __ ] just put on a video and just [ __ ] disappear into the Beaman ether and and and look at the video doing [ __ ] numbers and I just be like like so that's crazy to me to hear you say that because I like I aspire to get to the level where I don't have to slang my video every time I always think about you saying that to me and be like get the [ __ ] out of here like cuz you when you was like Alim me you supposed to let the algorithm do the work for you you ain't supposed to I have to go on twit I'm like listen and the algorithm don't [ __ ] work for me like that okay I slang my videos I feel like I'll push back on that I feel like you just don't give the algorithm a chance to work for you because you so interested in like you working it like the way that you are telling you I work them video like let me tell you something every I promise you I could tell you where my videos get views from how and this is is the next thing like guys got my Eric Adams expose wouldn't the pop even to get to 50,000 or whatever like even get to like on a trajectory of doing well was because again um Eric Adams like maybe like the next day or like two days later after I put out that video um there was the flood it was the flood in New York City and every body was [ __ ] mad he was missing and everybody was talking [ __ ] on Twitter and I was like this is my opportunity to promote this [ __ ] you know what I mean like I will listen one you see Greg Abbott that other day when Greg Abbott was doing some other [ __ ] I was like beautiful we on this like like what you talking about I Pro I telling you I telling you I I feel like people could find it regardless though like I mean so you think so y me like things like that has happened like okay so I've seen that happen like in regard regards to um who I had when Diddy popped off my homosexual video with Diddy in the front I don't tweet I been on Twi and it just po off out of nowhere I was just like did he must do something I go online did he in Cassie I was just like wow I said this must be a dream 100K more views on top of the 100K that it was at and like I didn't lift a finger now I get it like cuz I was doing I was linked dropping in in Reddit that's actually how me and FD met actually like we were cuz because there's no framework for not only me especially as a Caribbean fellow with with a Caribbean accent and all of that right cuz like one the algorithm don't work for black people that much the algorithm don't know what to do with us they lump us up with fresh and fit they lump us up with goddamn um who [ __ ] is that you know um King back and [ __ ] like that you know what I mean my my [Music] cousin we we ain't doing nothing anyway but like in Reddit like I was just like okay I got to go and put this in the places where I feel like people might watch it so I was putting this in everywhere my videos was next to a goddamn cat video and that's how FD and me saw each other and you know shout out FD like we were he was he saw the vision really early on CU I was still thinking like in a really competitive nature like that's us right like I mean like we looking at each other I know how you was think on YouTube like you would be like you 50 Cent on here like you was like okay I looking at this one I need to be able to okay I beat them I but like f put me on like like to like this like collaborative mindset in regards to it and like him trying to figure out to say listen if we boost one like we kind of end up boosting all I boo everyone but like you are creating an ecosystem where the algorithm does not have any type of real precedent for that so like once I realize it's just like okay once I don't need to take down FD like there might be enough space for me FD Little Bill and it's enough space for you Cadia you know all the f f women and them presenting folks and like they there's enough space for you yeah for white people sometimes I don't be thinking like they could fully handle too much [ __ ] them like I feel like they could like maybe have like okay I could watch FD here and there but like that's as much Blackness I gota listen to I got to save something for the gays and you would think so but I feel like I would have think so and and if I didn't make o in friends like you know what I mean like cuz I think my channel is is hyper black in a way that like I think is a little bit different than even other even the other black people whose channel is still all black is it's them and whatever but I put on an incredibly amount like of black people on my channel like virtu like I think I I brought on probably like 50 different black people on on and friends at this point you know um and yeah and I think you know you'd be surprised on on their ability to take that in in in in the ecosystem because now I see like so many people being like Oh I follow all these different people and regularly all these white people listening to conscious and people who they should heard about cuz they have huge platforms but they don't make it to that side of the internet now they're like oh I love them I follow all these different people and so that's not I think I think they've never had the opportunity I think what happens is like you're always told they can like black people are told they can only be one of us there and they're told they only supposed to they only need one they and then they can and that they only need one because there only really is one like they always being pedal to this idea no that's the thing right they always try and with with the with the media both mainstream and indep independent and just how like these systems have like uh encouraged us or forced us to kind of adapt has always been that they're they're made to believe that black people are not that great that we're not that good that there's a few select couple of us that are that are amazing or whatever or that are that are good and it's only them that you could hear from and then they reinforce that by always it's only one and if they do if you notice like networks and places don't have a vested interest in there being a bunch of good black people or good talent in chemistry like I worked for networks or I have a paired on networks and stuff that'll have a Rebecca aor pair and they know that they got Rebecca from me and they they've seen our chemistry they know friend but they never put us in the same segment or anything like that because they're not invested in showing that they don't want you to see like a bunch of great Black Talent they don't want that to become like a normal of a bunch of black people presents and all these different things right so I think what happens is on on on a place like uh lurin on oay and Friends it becomes normal the same way you watch things and everybody's [ __ ] white and that doesn't strike you as anybody's making a statement or doing anything like you watch my channel of you regularly just see so many black people you see so many like you don't you don't notice no more like you don't notice no more I I really I really think it um I think you'd be surprised I do love which I think is my favorite part of the stuff we be doing on cornbread Tobe like the collaborative nature of it like I think it's fun like I like I like uh oay and Friends where oh I know you about to see some new person you like you know what I mean some other person you follow like oh you didn't know there was be there they're there like I like that it's like like the fact that this exists is just totally subversive yeah and it's allowed for a lot more people that look like us that did not think like for the same reason that you saying did not think that they would be able to do this um to any type of degree and get any type of love from the algorithm and you literally have to make you we we're making an algorithm as we speak like we're making connections that people can point towards and of course like I have to like say like the algorithm is of course the audience and like what we're really doing is we're rewiring people's taste and appetite for what they expect from us you know what I mean and so like they they no longer say okay like if I'm in the mood for sports TV or Sports commentary or or prank videos then I can look at at like a black person I could look at a I show speed I could look at a um you know kais out or something like that as far as just like cuz cuz that's what the appetite is you know when you eating Chinese food you expect Chinese food to taste a particular way but now they saying oh you could season this differently like now Blackness comes as a Harbinger for Progressive thought it comes for you know all kind of different ways and and applications of Blackness and that that's what we really ask for you know like when we talk about like the Bahamas and like represent or Caribbean representation you still got people inside your comment section thinking that I come from from Jamaica which is wild like at this time like people still saying Jamaica inside the comments just like question mark Jamaica Jamaica they don't and like after a while like it's just like I don't even blame you like the media has basically force fed you one Avatar of caribbeanness and it's always a Jamaican that is you know either smoke can read or like this mystical violent negro type you know person with an accent or they've sexualized all kind of like black Caribbean women like your ranas and whatnot like if you get like they barely even could have any reference for like a Grace Jones and thing like that so like what we're doing especially like the fact that like you have an unabashed Bahamian accent I like come on there and like sometimes I tell stories that are so specific to experience who is tell the most I listen as a bamian I'd be like this [ __ ] telling the most Bohemian story possible like I I literally be in the house like I don't know how foreigners get these Americans to keep on with him like I telling you I'm like this man is not even this is this story has not been adjusted for an American at all like this is an incredibly B the video where you tell a long story about oh my god um about the G who's getting her boyfriend's kill yes and you notice like and people think that I be like I be lying but these stories that's real [ __ ] like you could search up literally to the names that I use I got backlash for that video I get backlash videos all the time so when I made my um I get backlash here and like people don't realize that that like could endanger if I wasn't the type of [ __ ] that I am like that could endanger lives I have to think about it like twice and be like damn I can't say that because it ain't me I worry but I have a child now but like you know when I made that combatant Caribbean homophobia video and I was talking about like okay that's the first video that really popped off for me actually when I basically admitted to homophobia and people did with that what they did but also like you had like a lot of people that use that as an opportunity for themselves to begin to account for the things that they've done they say okay well I ain't homophobic but I am racist and you know it's great to see and it's wild for like a white person person to come inside your comment section and say hey I am racist um just like you homophobic let's work together and like ah kumb right but like over here when I put that out literally I had people getting dead mad at me talking about wait hold on hold on you don't you think you think that the gay shouldn't burn and sou what like literally when I did the video on um baman like tourism being slavery the ministry of Tourism themselves I don't care if they see it the ministry of Tourism themselves sent a strongly word worded letter and said that sir um with the platform that you have it has been brought to our attention that you are saying slanderous or or or things uh you know they I think they use like a little bit of legal speak and you just say you're saying things that um are not only U falsely deniable but also damaging our reputation as a country and while we cannot tell you to take it down we do think that you should actively reinforcing colonization like the government the government fighting for the impacts of colonization like explicitly I is dead on a regular basis people like the push backk that I get home like not only online but home simply for not reestablishing a white supremacist patriarchal framework that doesn't even work for us a bunch of [ __ ] in a barrel on on an island that is just like a couple skips of rock that God just through they don't want to hear it they they want like the white dream of what this is supposed to be so bad that they will not Embrace so like there's like a lot of things that like don't embrace me locally but like will embrace me abroad yeah which is actually like a particular unique pain like when they have I don't get invited to um they had like a creative Branch over here they didn't invite me I just like that's wild and it's crazy know your bigger followings that half for who they invite I don't like to be like that I don't like to talk about the following but I say it it's m say it it's m say it no it's m say it like it's m say it cuz like I hate when people play Crazy in the metric right there don't play [ __ ] crazy now you're notifying me yall yall is like ask me to do this and that and this but it's like they want like a particular um Caribbean Avatar of what continent is supposed to be over here and like no matter like it it will take the Americans to have to like give me some type of flowers in order for it to be talked about over here so like when I do something big and like the Americans talk about it then the guardian then zns then all of them go on talk to me I'm just like you know we really need to stop getting to a point where we need outside validation in order to like validate the people I care like even if you don't like want talk about me that's fine right but like you have behavi that are here that is git on because they ain't performing a particular beat for you yeah um and you will then change the tone as soon as someone else blow up outside and they' be like oh yeah yeah well you know um I was always inside your corner yeah I'm so proud of you that's how it go listen that's how it go if I could listen if I could tell you the amount of fake ass people and messages and conversations I have had since getting any kind of platform like people who I know don't [ __ ] like me like you know what I mean in my face like and listen I I don't know how you I don't know how you do it cuz for me personally it's like I carear about like the muhamad is a how beham are perceiving what I do is is more than I have thought like that's not even that's not even on my my perimeter of things I'm thinking about when I go to go do any kind of thing any content and I be on the rare occasion like my mommy or someone or my daddy mentioned to me what what's what behman are saying or what they going to go say something or blah blah blah it just feels so like to me i' be like huh feel like I just like in my mind like that inconsequential it's so crazy but how you making it like there's like and the thing is they like the wrong things so like they will like how you saying it but then like will engaged all the time with what you're really saying like you be saying some things that like I be like Bo how did this get retweeted from like you know someone that I know fully well like does not believe these things like I just like but it's really like we could be put it we could say anything as long as like you say it like in a particular Cadence and a particular like amount of curse word like you hit like the requirements like it's great and like I want like like and which is exactly which just get me criticized for like that's the thing right is like what what what you do that ingratiates you to one audience alienates the other right like so it's like behemon would like that but wow like the amount of you know what's crazy behemon would like that online and then the old the bahamians I hate the way but you know I think this is true of black people because it's not just bahamians like because the Americans do it too I hate the way black people will dislike something that reminds them of themsel like like like cuz I'm like I don't no no non cursing [ __ ] no no pit up [ __ ] especially not no bahamians you know what I mean and I and the specific people like I'm not even talking about people on the internet I'm not even talking about internet I'm talking about in real life like buy people I know who try to like um respectability politics me or like tell me of the respectability Poli I always BL people who themselves are foul mouthed or whatever have you but somehow they want me to go and put on this facade on my content that I creating on my own on my own terms in my house is be crazy and they come to try to like give you this framework for like please if you if you look right here on the map the colonizer said you could tap dance between these four corners if you could just keep to this box heading with be blessed and like like one time I show someone your wives or like no I showed you came on the screen inside one of my videos and I was just like I you know I say you know she bamian right I say she baman I say yeah he going say why all that why all that bbby out like that I just like he going say they can make us look like hoes I just like not you with 12 children like calling my friend ho because like she apress I just like dog that's wild you invented ho like I mean like I telling you like you 50 60 years old like all of the parents have different like like who you trying to fool that's what I say it all let me tell you something every time I get comments every single day I wake up I quite literally wake up up to the first thing I see it's black people telling me I always supposed to be right and every time I look it's always somebody like the thing that I find perplexing is there never it's not like I'm on the internet aspirationally telling you that I want to do something and now you invied you giving me a opinion on why tell I complaining about why I haven't been able to do something quite literally everything that I want to do I am doing or been done like you know what I mean the things that they are commenting to critique me about it's like oh it's a lawyer as it is you mean all the [ __ ] I already have like all the [ __ ] that I'm doing like there's nothing I'm on TV where you say I'm on TV I have successful platforms I write I in all the i in your magazine I I doing all the things I I I became a lawyer I had orders I had the job what what so what are we talking about I have all I have all of the things I have the man you see you think you know what I mean I have the everything you say I can't have with with titties and cursing I have it all so why are you telling me [ __ ] and there's always people themselves they never had it like I so tired of [ __ ] who a lawyers telling me how a lawyer is supposed to act or someone telling you oh why you doing that on your platform it's like let me explain something to you this myos this this myos this my camera this myos my C he can be on my house like is in the court but it's like and it's just like this it's it's a stock reality because on a regular basis like I be trying to figure out myself because I mean political like when a political party would approach me and like try to say okay we like what you're talking about on a rare occasion when that happens be like like what you talking about like you ever thought of politics no but like they've been grooming me for politics for quite some time and like anytime like when they talk about that I just be like thinking to myself I go say raw like so just so like I go for PLP or F&M and then when one of them out of power I broke and I and I get dead and then like like I got to be on the bread line waiting for like the next person and like when you think about okay every Beacon of politics is local I doing this online I preach into the choir why don't I try to like mobilize in the Bahamas like you know something against gender violence something against like like impoverish stuff some stuff like that and then like when you realize the amount of red tape in every circumstance no matter what it just like snaps you out of it for a second and like yeah I online and making somebody online feel like they've been seen for the first time in their lives because they now see a black man someone that has been like basically denigrating them whole lives now they get to see someone that's actually affirming them right I could have that and at the same time in my everyday have to deal with like the Christian Council like like pick and fencing and thing like that against queer people in the Bahamas yeah and like I could like have to like r with them stand up and get all up inside their face I'm just like God damn I just like it's really like a whole different and I feel like that's like where my content is going like in the next like in the next iteration of for man so for man 2.0 like a lot of like a lot what I've been doing is trying to figure out how more how much more I can make Bahamian stories or Caribbean stories and activate locally because I preach into Qui in the states I think you really can I think the mistake I think and I think this isn't easy I I've made this mistake right like of when we were first trying to build our channels and get our channels popping or whatever like obviously the content that we are making at that time where we don't have the audience and we don't have the this and people don't have the faith to click on what we making um it's not going to do as well and so by the time we St making the content that does catch we implicitly come to believe that that content before does not do well because it didn't do well because of the circumstances you know what I mean but that's not the case now because that's how I feel about like when I started my channel I made like Kong shells the week right like and like which is great but because they're they going to have way less views because my channel got bigger when I did big things I I have an like you know what I mean in a verion to them like they're not valuable content but when I made like um the masculinization of the uh of or you know my video how transphobia hurts black women the other day that's technically a Kong shell the week video like I have a Kong shell whatever the end whatever it's the same as short and it did well like you know what I mean it was because my audience were clicking now they have more on a faith of what I talking about and and so I I honestly think and you've had content like your video to me your um your like the anchor baby one the one with Tariq n them on the thumbnail like I love that video that video very Caribbean to me like a very particular kind of perspective like you have a lot of videos like that to me and that that do well you just get a lot of [ __ ] off I I actually think people would love that from you now I I think I think people would like it I think you'd be I'm hoping that they ready for it cuz it's it's going in that like Direction like for sure because we've we've told the stories like there're just like like so many different there's room for more stories yeah you know and like it's it's something that like we have to also commend ourselves to the fact that like we've been playing an American game from the back door like we came through the back door and like especially like you like like you had to like you still in the back door like you still in the archway in many different ways and like everybody outside at the back door like coming he us talk yeah you know what I mean and like to this point I think that we could bring him inside or we could bring him to the beach and like tell stories that they didn't even realize like imagine like doing a story about like 9 I what you was be in my head you know I swear to God I just was about to say that but I say don't cut him off L me I look at you I was just about to say do it do it take on N yes but there's like so many different there so many different things not only in the bombs but like definitely like in the diaspora the Caribbean diaspora like there's so many different unique effects and ripples of colonialism where we could apply the same principles that we've already been applying to like all of these topics that people didn't belor you know to go as in we could do that now and I think this point I think there's a way we could AC actively do it like you know what I've been recently doing because you know I think all the the anti the anti non non-american black people sentiment has been has been getting exhausting to me on the internet so I've been trying to seek out black content creators elsewhere like inica um so I've been watching more like black um on YouTube those content creators and stuff and it reminds him like you know what there is eos spares you know what I mean versus and there stuff happening everywhere you know what I mean like it's just about garnering those audiences and I think like I think we all we have enough platform of a platform and verse and stuff and faith and credibility up at audiences that you you can create something new and startop talking to them about other things I think they will care I think it'll that's the next step that's the next step for it so like I mean what even like as for man proceeds like it's a matter of like trying to divorce yourself and that's what you've been doing too like divorce yourself from the white gays like yeah like even like watching you like move from leftist Mafia and now being like on a linati and now to the point like where linard is it's like his own Force alog together like totally divorced like I'd be surprised like if they even inside like the channels that your audience watches this oh no oh no it's not no they're not they're not no I I listen and we have we love to see it like we we love to see it cuz I really really really love um hold on sorry CJ texted me he both he tried called me I had gladed like sir I am recording he's like oh I'm on my way home you want me to stop at the bodega and it's like yes you know I do boy listen but yeah no you you you're absolutely right like and I love I love a we building dog like and thank you you for bringing me into the cornbread too because you know I didn't know nothing about it but you quickly you quickly got in cornbread and then like transcended it to an different extent because like I say like your voice inside cornbread um it's it's not like it's it's like it's like Wu time type of thing you know what I mean like I know who you would be now they got tell us in the comments who who who would a different members just don't call me obb I could see [ __ ] right now trying to call me obb and I ain't got no nasty dreads place like like but like it's just like there's enough space now that you could have like a euphony of totally different block voices yeah and it's a matter of time just like even like the [ __ ] [ __ ] and whatnot like they now learning even like with that last video that we did yeah I think that like that even like began to affect culture in a particular way and you ain't even realizing it but we are affecting culture like we are Chang the way that the world the course of the world Works tell the people that you trick me in making that video you keep on saying I trick you but I know I can't trick you to do nothing that you no no no you know good well you implicitly trick me like I ref I want you know I tell forign I was I didn't have a topic for that oay in friends I was like for was like oh you know it let's let's talk to diasp I said no no [ __ ] way absolutely we have a Tre a treaty a diaspora War peace treaty in that like like you had Americans you had bahamians you and someone was Haitian in there too all Jamaican come on come on that was beautiful no it
