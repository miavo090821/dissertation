Those people are HR workers and I am pretty sure that making those viral videos about working for the company is literally their job. \n\nIt's a promotion of their company with intention to bring more people to job interviews, it's not their spare time activity. And while they are doing this, it people in those companies work on some software which could automatise three work of those HR people.\n\nSo at some point it people come to their boss saying the the automatisation is done, we can fire some people, the rest is going to do their job with no problem thanks to our new software. The boys is like good job guys, and start thinking who is going to leave.\n\nAnd they are going to fire the most useless people in this scenario, or \"activists\" who cause friction in the company and their action decrease rather than increase productivity.\n\nThis all makes sense. No matter lockdowns, recession, filming oneself etc... It has nothing to do with any of this.\n\nThose companies try to increase their productivity not decrease, this is the whole point of it IT in general. So they do what they always do - work on increasing their productivity",

He's provided enough viewers for YouTube and its advertisers that You\nTube is willing to pay him for it. He got you to watch it, didn't he? \n\nSo to answer your question yes, I would oppose him \"leeching\", if he had been, but he clearly wasn't. What I see is that Actual Justice Warrior consistently provides logical, fact-based alternatives to liberal disinformation. I know he's accurate, because I don't see anyone proving him wrong in the comments on his videos. He provides real value.\n\nAnd the \"necessity\" of the job is irrelevant. I think mimes are utterly useless, but I'm not arrogant enough to deny them a living if other people gain enough value and enjoyment to pay them for their services. \n\nAnd you still didn't answer my question.

I dont know what its like now, but we had free snacks, drinks, supplies (even batteries if you wanted - (for walkmans, and MP3 players in those days)  The cafeteria had gourmet food and A1 chefs, but it was NOT free.  It was reasonably priced (much better than fancy restaurants) but NOT school cafeteria food.  \n\nThere were no game rooms (wtf is that anyway?)\n\nThere were no nap pods.\n\nWe were there to work.  And OMG when I first started there, we thought we were in heaven!  I remember my first day, I had my two quarters in my hand and my manager said \"what are you doing?\" and I said \"Oh Im lookin for the \"on your honor\" box - every place I worked, coke was 50 cents. \"\n\"He's like \"dude, its free.  You get free drinks and snacks\"\n\nSo I dunno.  Maybe if google didnt give away billions of dollars of unlimited food, drinks, snacks, and alcohol (yes - watch the video of the girl showing you can get wine and beer there) they wouldnt have to layoff that many people.  Sure we see vids of folks doing nothing, but I bet there were also thousands who actually put in a full work day (HINT:  those would be the ones who DIDNT have time to upload their day on TikTok)",

        "text": "I work in Big Tech.\n\nThere's huge risk in telling employees that they've been laid off and/or especially when they're fired. \n\nWhen it's a layoff, what often happens is that they'll tell you, and then lock many of your internal accounts to minimize the possibility that you do damage to the company out of petty revenge (e.g. deleting or screwing with valuable documentation, data, etc). \n\nThey'll still keep you around for a couple months or so, mainly to fulfill contractual obligations or to be nice and give you time to find a new job. It's basically your 60 day notice or whatever. But you're basically paid to do nothing (because we don't trust you to do honest work anymore) with minimal access anyway. A lot of people will feel traumatized like that employee because it's very sudden for you to suddenly lose access to many accounts (even ones you use for internal communication, so you lose many contacts, suddenly).\n\nIf it's a firing (for legit reasons), it's usually more severe because they don't need to warn you at all. Suddenly you're called in, and told to hand in your equipment (laptop and company phone) with no time to prepare, because they don't want to give you time to write your goodbyes or be dramatic over group emails, destroy valuable info, etc.\n\nPeople who aren't used to that and don't understand why these are policies will often feel shocked/traumatized like her and wish they were given a warning. I don't think it's entitlement, tbh, it's just lack of preparation, and the sudden realization that they have no time to even say goodbye.",

No one hears the harder working and more conservative side because we're not just conservative in values, but lifestyle and personality. They have families and friends who depend on them. \n\nWokesters cut their families out and don't want children, so they tend to have less dependents. They can risk more.\n\nI.e. i'm not going to risk a 300k salary to argue/fight with wokesters, so they get more representation.",

Breach of contract and all that with the video postings, or were at the very least security issues. This is why their accounts were locked prior to termination, and without warning. You can fix laziness, but you can't fix data beaches when they already happen - you can, however, minimize the risk and remove high risk factors from staying in the company",

My answer is \"learn to weld\" the same way those smug fucks told us blue-collars to \"learn to code\" when complaining about, for example, a local plant closing because of BS environmental regulations. Was my first and only layoff. Since then I always have an ear on the ground with the office gang to bail in time. Found a job a month later but many, especially older, did not have such luck. 1/3rd of the workers of a nearby village lost their job, more in others like my home, in one day. Most were older and did not find new jobs. The store closed a year later due to lacking demand, as did the bar. And what did we hear from the responsible politician(s) which choose to attend a townhall event in her official car (taxpayer financed big BMW or something, very environmentally friendly of course.....). blah blah \"need to focus on retraining initiatives. Those guys were the best welders and metalworkers I know, definitly better than me both at the time and probably today. I am thankfull to have been their apprentice. And it makes me angry to see them on early retirement. Luckily most have gardens/trees to supplement their diet because retirement is low when you miss 4-5 years of employment and inflation runs rampant.",

I went back to school to get back on track then Covid hit and damn near lost everything including my home  and indirectly the schooling I was in at the time ( California) I'm still recovering but my only saving grace was that I had was my 100% disability rating that I got last year ( I went through some really nasty stuff with the military) but I'm currently finishing up my associates to move on that's why people like that who did nothing and acted how they did just pissed me off so bad because they had all these opportunities that were just handed to them and skated by and did little to nothing but thumbed there noses at everyone else. They tried to control how everyone else lived, said or did with all that alleged talent and opportunity they did nothing but act like a piss stain on the carpet of life so I find it very hard to feel bad for them.",

        "text": "You and me both, and that is on a good day. Even worse, when I worked in the oilfield, I was lucky if I got to take breaks or go home when it was quitting time. I've worked 21 and 24 hour days and go home for 24 off only to have my boss call and scream at me for not working another 10 to 12 hour shift after 21 or 24 hours straight, where I had to inform said idiot of a boss, \"absolutely I will come in, but I want you to know this conversation is being recorded so if I am injured due to exhaustion, fatigue or whatever, I'll be sending this shit to OSHA and the state department of labor as well as my attorney. You know in case I get hurt or killed because I just worked 24 hours straight and you want to add another 12 straight which is highly illegal, let alone immoral, but sure, on my way....\" The response was silence, followed by, \"enjoy your day off and get some rest. We'll see you tomorrow buddy.\" Was it shady of me to do? A little. Was it smart? Well considering that working 21 to 24 hours straight requires a minimum of 24 off for safety. I know, I was a supervisor at another oilfield company, where I had classes on the laws before I went to this other company for more pay. \n\nMeanwhile, these crybabies got to only do 2 minutes of work, got naps and made far more than I did as a journeyman pipe fitter who was working on his master's. They made more than me, and did around ten minutes of work while I was working 50-70 hours a week or more, for less money and expected to basically give up my family life, beat my body up, break my back, and work like a rented mule, only to be put out to pasture while these entitled brats worked 10 minutes a week?! And don't get me started on my current job. Sure one of my routes is 4 hours one way, but then I have to unload the product (up to 500 lbs per item), put it up and move to the next item. Oh and there are 60 to 80 of these heavy, large items each trip, that I also loaded into the trailer. The days I do that route are 14-16 hour days. I am up at 4:30 and on the road by 5:30! These brats probably didn't roll out of bed before noon.... On a work day!",

Plus tech companies want those luxuries so they can get Glassdoor awards as being the “highly rated companies” to boost their egos. Even though people are jealous of these kids with these types of jobs, the REALITY is that Americas economy is largely dependent on Healthcare, Technology, Finance, Skilled Trades, and Real Estate and that’s why these workers get paid the big bucks in this country. It’s just unfortunate some sectors like healthcare and tech are highly corrupt.",

    "text": "My mom and dad had me when they were 18 & 19. My dad dropped everything and worked for 16 years at a company, working his way up to upper level management after starting on the warehouse team. He left because he worked his ass off but wasn’t being paid enough. The new company he was working for was a software company, paying him a lot better. This was around 2008-2009. He was laid off after a year, and it took him a few months to start a new job where he’s working now and has been for like 5 years, getting paid very well. But I’ll never forget how hard he worked all those years to get to a place where he was being paid what he was worth. I’ll also never forget how he was during the time he was laid off. How ashamed and guilty he felt. How our family had to adjust. But we did adjust and we supported him through it. I don’t wish a lay off on anyone, especially those with family, but these people aren’t even working. They are pampered and show up to day care each day until they can head home. It’s insane to me that they didn’t see this coming, or that they could ever be upset about being let go or laid off. These tech layoffs are going to be a large eye-opener for those living in an area that they now aren’t able to afford.",

This is the type of life men have lived in this country and the woke crowd detest cis males and look down their nose at them. They 100% believe they’re the ones who exemplify virtues and it’s nothing but lies. We all suspected they were terrible employees and they absolutely are toxic to the workplace. They preach tolerance but have none if you dare to not agree with them wanting to tear down the American way of life that we are all privileged, I use that word intentionally and it’s an objective fact, to have. The woke message is so divisive I just can’t believe that all these companies and Hollywood decided to go all out/full retard and bought into that toxic bs. Now they’re all losing money, they took a guy with dementia who’s been a racist, bold faced liar and has done nothing worthy of mentioning besides being a man without character, morality and totally self centered and made him president. So stunning, so brave! He’s still the same piece of shit in his 80’s too but it’s uh “tempered” by his ability to forgot what he’s talking about in the middle of a sentence and we’re expected to behave like that shit is normal behavior for anybody let alone the leader of the most powerful country on Earth.

        "text": "Yes and no.\n\nI'm generally not one to forgive, nor give second chances - been there, done that, got burned. \n\nHowever, there are several points we need to consider in this case.\n\n1. Innocent until proven guilty. Unless we have a smoking gun (e.g. video, tweet, blog), we don't know if the people we see are the same ones promoting lock downs and mandates. Is it highly likely (considering they live in deep blue areas, working for deep blue companies)? Yes. But I still need the proof before I condemn. \n\n2. Do we really want to go after the pitiful mutts, while their kennel masters get away in the ensuing chaos? Personally, I want the people at the helm to be held responsible. Legally, morally and financially. I want them to be barred from ever holding positions of power again. \n\n3. We all make mistakes, and a very necessary part of a healthy society is the ability to work towards redemption. It is something the far left does not understand (or practice) and it's tearing them apart. And while I don't forgive on a personal level, I see the benefit of having mechanisms in place that allow for people to grow and change.\n\n4. From a very cynical point of view: those laid off in such a callous way are now highly susceptible to anyone showing them compassion. Why not swell our numbers, convert these former antagonists into allies? After all, we now have an enemy in common.  At worst, they ignore us, at best we find new friends.\n\n5. The future will bring more lay offs, many more. If we laugh now (no matter how much we think it's justified), you better believe they'll return that 100 fold in the future. These are people with the emotional maturity of toddlers, they will absolutely burn everything down out of spite; is this really the hill we want to die on? \n\n6. Something we need to remember: before anything else, we are all Americans. If we want to stay one nation, we have to stop the rift. The left isn't going to do that, we know that. So, it's up to us. Constant bickering will drive us every further apart, holding out our hands (to those willing to take them) will bring us together.

They obviously took the time to practice their idiotic dance moves so that would be multiple days of using their breaks to dance?! I've even seen where a doctor was dancing because they came up with the toxic vaccine. Some of those dance routines were actually done in operating areas. Many hospitals doing the same thing, some were up and down the full length of the hospital hallways which I would think is very insensitive to people who are supposed to be on the brink of death. Don't try to bullshit me, I looked into as many of these that I could find, big smiles on all their faces, families weren't permitted to visit loved ones dying but nobody had a problem with 20 to 30 nurses dancing in the hallways? You live in a fantasy world if you believe any of what you are attempting to convince me of.

If you already know you won't be holding them for a long time, they can be let go almost immediately because there's no point keeping them longer. \n\nYou can't expect to squeeze just a bit more work from them, because even if they finish by the deadlines, you need to keep them around longer in case there are bugs (found internally or often much later by customers) in their finished product. Then it's better for the original architects/engineers to help solve the problems for their products. If they're not there, their product automatically has lower value because of these potential problems. Point is, there are many reasons their work is a long term investment. So there's no point in keeping them longer than they have to stay, because anything they make past the point where you know you can't keep them for much longer has less value. Might as well give them less work or ask them to pass on documentation and train others. \n\nMost other jobs don't involve work that go the distance like that.

Programmers are coming into something that was already built, the technology and backend code is generally open source and everyone knows it, you have no rapport with the company executives and probably never will so there's no trust factor, and they bring in new bunches of programmers constantly and work them to death for a couple years til they burn out while promoting a few standouts to management positions to keep things somewhat cohesive for the next group of expendables.

I was labeled as an employee for the marketing department, but in reality I did work as data scientist for almost every department in the company.  They left the employees to be layed-off to the Director of HR who didn't have a clue and since I had less experience than other key employees (still 6 years with the company) I was let go.\n\n2 weeks afterward they begged me to come back (they ended up firing the HR manager for this and other bone headed moves).  I turned them down because I had found a new job that paid me much more.\n\nMy parents thought the company was really stupid, but I had to explain to them that while this was a blunder, I'd rather take the company that realized they made a mistake and had the brains to do a mea culpa and try to get me back versus other companies that laid me off, making the same mistake, but didn't want to admit to it and ask me to come back. \n\nIt just goes to show you that often times it has nothing to do with performance, there are just higher ups that make a lot of really dumb decisions.",

        "text": "@charlespancamo9771 I'm not too sure these were made to promote the tech giant. Tech, as far as I am aware, will only allow certain bits of information to be circled around due to data leak issues. Which means videos like these would have to be very controlled in content. It could totally be possible they were allowed, then had the creators sacked for liability issues for cost savings afterwards -- but I am going to give Google the benefit of the doubt that these were not recorded with permission, which is a HUGE no-no with that industry. Media is generally heavily controlled there that you aren't allowed to bring cameras in for many places, and I believe there are even checks media people have to go through to see certain things. So having these people who are posting to social media on their work-day, then having them immediately locked out of company accounts the day they are sacked, makes a lot of sense. They are security hazards, short and simple, and for all I know could have been in violation of certain contract agreements for working there",

I've been a software engineer for 30 years now, and I remember, even back then, the companies looking to hire IT and other members of the STEM community would have these \"technical recruiters\".  Generally speaking, the technical recruiters had almost zero technical knowledge themselves, and they were almost always relatively attractive women.  What better way to get the attention of a bunch of nerds and geeks than to get a pretty girl to talk to them?  Particularly when you consider that less than 10% of the student body in STEM disciplines are female, and even fewer of those are attractive.",

The rest of the class was all male, scruffy, worn jeans, etc.  Someone from the back of the class said in a loud voice \"She is in the WRONG classroom\".  A moment or two later, she turned to the guy sitting beside her and asked \"Is this Marketing?\".  After receiving a resounding \"No\", she stood up and left, her heels clicking down the hallway.  It reinforced the stereotype that most women are more into superficialities like appearance and in getting by on their looks than in applying their intelligence to anything more intellectually challenging than trying to figure out which pair of Manolo Blahink shoes to wear with their Louis Vuitton hand bag.  And the sad truth is, most stereotypes are well-grounded in reality.",

These people live in a fantasy world where everything is magical all the time. Except when the evil Orange Man is being racist. But they're finally getting a small taste of reality. Reality is bitter and leaves a bad taste in your mouth. It's like when you're a baby and your parent gives you a lemon for the first time. Seeing your face pucker up and your reaction is really funny. That's what makes this situation funny to me",

Almost everywhere has representation quotas these days. Getting a role based on merit is so last century. Now the more boxes you tick as an under represented type the better your chances. In some cases the job ad should literally read- Only POC, LGBT+, physically disabled, women (or men pretending to be so) need apply. Professional victim status experience also a benefit. \nThese recruitment process should be illegal, but they are unfortunately required when dealing with government institutions especially. Not sure if these representation quotas have filtered down into roles such as rubbish collection, road maintenance & oil rigging. But for some reason they aren't so much of a representation priority, I wonder why 🤔",

A college degree is little more than a certificate of scholastic achievement - a recruiter isn't going to be impressed with it no matter how great it is.  It's just a stop-gap that most companies feel \"rules out the riff raff\" (whether it actually is or isn't is a debate for another time).\n\nGo for certifications that prove your skills will actually make money for a business.\n\nIt doesn't matter how smart or skilled you are in what you know how to do.., What matters is whether or not you can provide value to a business.  Can you use those skills to make a business make product or make money...  This is why college, ultimately, doesn't matter.  Being useful to a business always supercedes how artistic, well-spoken, or smart you are.\n\nAlso - go to every school-sanctioned job fair, if you're not doing that already.  These job fairs already filter out the general public and give you a leg up over the competition by virtue of being a student there.  Increased odds.",

I'm sure having a PhD in mathematics or physics is extremely hard to get, but being proficient in academia is not the same thing as being proficient in providing value to a business.\n\nGet certified in skills they actually need and are asking for.  \"Finance\" is a big vague general term for a business field, just as \"Information Technology\" is... they encompass a lot.  I'd start thinking about using that intricate knowledge of numbers and seeing how any of that applies to what the financial sector actually needs specific to individual job titles... what are some common positions in the \"finance\" field (for IT, common fields are web developer, back-end developer, devsecops engineer, network security engineer... for finance, I'd imagine data analyst/scientist would be one such position to look for).  And what types of certs/experience would a company be looking for from a person trying to fill that position?  You might be able to participate in open-source projects or \"jam nights\" where you have at least some semblance of a product to show by the end.  \n\nCompanies want you to not only be smart, but be accomplished.  If you're not getting jobs, it's because your degree isn't enough, and they need you to show them a portfolio saying \"here's how I've APPLIED my knowledge\" (translation: here's my experience in actually providing you worth and value)",

Dentist. I could eat full course meal including some pretty good brisket and steak. If I didn't like that, I could instead go to the vegetarian corner, or the burger area, or just get gourmet ice cream.  Employees were often bringing their friends and families to work to eat free lunch with them. Lunch that would have normally cost them 40+ USD for each person, outside of their campus. Then they also buy up property so their employees can live closer to work. \n\nWith arrangements like that, it's actually hard to leave Facebook. Turnover rate lowered, employee retention raised. People would need to find new barbers, dentists, favorite restaurants, good gyms, pay for new apartment, find new monthly parking, etc if they ever decided to leave. They're also stuck through more of the day around coworkers. \n\nIt's like a mini community where people don't get insights/conversations with people outside a company. I wouldn't go to my own neighbourhood's gym, away from my company, I just go to my company's superior gym. Very easy to develop and foster social bubbles in such envs.",

Not so much in typical conservative \"values\" but a lot in terms of personality and lifestyle. \n\nI.e. they're raising families or plan to and don't want to bother themselves to argue. \n\nSo if you do have conservative engineers, don't expect them to go and argue with the perpetually single wokester in HR. The progressive wokester is less likely to have a dependent family and more likely to have progressive, revolutionary personality. The conservative is just going to nod his head and say \"ok that's nice, Karen\" because he's not going to bother putting his 300k salary at risk.",

The issue is... how many others that were let go did the same thing or similar? There are several \"day in the life of\" videos, so we can almost guarantee all of those could be for similar reasons.
