welcome welcome everybody my name is Sean I am going to be your captain for today's video and what we're going to talk about is this Kyle kolinsky video where he talks about prisons and whatnot and clearly and obviously has no clue what he's discussing by the way thank you to Stephen Michael Davis for sending me over this video go subscribe to his channel his last couple of videos have been absolute bangers he's putting in the work putting out more content definitely could use her support and this video wouldn't be possible without him sending it over to me so Matt Walsh is out there Matt Walsh in again by the way his Twitter was hacked the other day um and uh person was going in whoever hacked him was going insky but I think he got control of his account back but um this was prior to his account hacking he had done this segment I'm not saying they're linked by the way I have no idea of the person who hacked him watched this uh this video but um he has really leaned in on a couple issues one of them of course is the trans Panic uh he cannot stop talking about that and then one of the other things is crime he's a he's a big culture Warrior so the setup for this video is that Kyle Kolinski is talking about a viral video from Matt Walsh where he's discussing the need for an increase in incarceration now we will talk about that a little bit later on in this video but I do want to point out that Kyle is identifying Matt Walsh as more of a culture Warrior than an economic conservative and I largely agree except for the fact that Kyle fails to acknowledge that crime is not simply a culture War issue it is a foundational issue in the United States of America and as we've discussed time and time again I feel like I make this video every week now crime has huge impacts on the economy it drives people into poverty not the other way around but unsurprisingly Kyle Kolinski has that completely backwards so Matt Walsh said some things related to prisons I will react specifically to what Walsh said and where I agree and where I disagree and then we'll talk about Kyle kolinski's absolutely pitiful response to this question I view him as more of a culture Warrior than like you know an economic conservative I'm sure he is also economic uh or excuse me I'm sure I'm sure he's also conservative on economics but he doesn't like lead with that it's all more culture War stuff so here he is he's going to talk about crime the scourge of crime and the arc I find the argument he makes here really incredible because in order for him to believe this he has to accept a very basic premise which I'm going to lay out for you in a minute and if he does believe this it would be astonishing so let's watch it so remember that Kyle's setup is that Matt Walsh is gonna say a thing and we're gonna react to this thing but I'm gonna point out that we need to discuss what the underlying premise is behind Matt Walsh's argument because in order for Matt Walsh to make the case for mass incarceration he has to buy into something that Kyle describes as astonishing and Kyle's gonna make the case for how ridiculous and crazy whatever Matt Walsh is gonna put forward so just just wait because Kyle Kolinski is going to bring the facts in the data because remember he's the policy wonk on the left as he says time and time again even though there's absolutely no basis for that but of course much of the violence we see in places like Chicago is not racial you know the business owners being chased out of these cities are often not white the victims of violence in these cities are most often not white so this is a far-reaching problem that would still exist even if white people hadn't been selected as the assigned villain group in modern America situation would be a little bit better in these cities most likely if that hadn't happened but um uh but that alone would not solve the problem uh if you want to solve the problem there are two basic Solutions and no solution that excludes these two points can ever hope to solve anything number one you have to round up the criminals and throw them in prison and I know this is not exactly a mind-blowing Insight or at least it shouldn't be but the only way to restore order is to impose severe penalties on those causing the disorder so first of all Matt Walsh is transitioning from one part of this video it was just clipped right here where he's talking about anti-white violence which by the way is wildly disproportionate from black people as compared to white on black violence you could look at the numbers for yourself but what he's saying is that overall even if we address that issue if we kind of like stemmed the racial hatred from that Community that's only a small portion of the overall violence which of course is disproportionately high amongst the black community itself thus we would still have a giant crime problem in the United States of America again hold on to that thought because we're going to address that point specifically among other points in this video that's that's the only way through it if there isn't enough room in the prisons then build new ones okay build 50 new prisons if you have to if you don't have the money for it then raise the taxes in these cities or raise the taxes out all the time anyway this may be the first time I've ever seen a conservative commentator actively advocate for raising taxes when it comes to we gotta lock up more people we need 50 new prisons if you have to raise taxes to do it raise taxes to do it wow he would never say those words like hey man we have 45 000 people dying because they don't have health care if you got to raise taxes to get those people get raise taxed 500 000 medical bankruptcies it's the number one cause of bankruptcy we can't allow it if you gotta raise taxes raise taxes for but for more prisons he's all in so we don't have time to get into a long-winded Healthcare conversation but I do want to point out because this can be done relatively quickly that Kyle kolinski's reference to how many people die without health insurance comes from one specific study that I believe was out of Washington state that involved a very small sample size and estimates extrapolated based off of that on top of that the groups that didn't have access to Medicaid versus those who got Medicaid were not very similar in age and all of the relevant factors so this extrapolation is based solely on bad data so let's just clear that up make that a hundred percent known before we go forward because I want to talk about Matt Walsh's stance on building more prisons because Kyle does not realize that it actually fulfills one of the needs that he wants to talk about a little bit later but again the left has this weird idea that if you build new prisons then your automatic Gonna Fill them with a bunch of new people and this is incredibly misleading I also want to point out really quickly that the reason why you would be in favor of more prisons is because government has an obligation to protect threats to your Liberty threats to your life and punish people who violate the rights of others which is what criminals do when they steal from you kill you assault you or any of those things so yes that would be within the proper function of government but Matt Walsh does not believe you have the right two items like health care so obviously this is a perfectly consistent stance from Matt Walsh but Kyle doesn't understand that because you know he's Kyle Kolinski oh man this guy he's something I gotta give him that he is something Democrats love raising taxes I'll raise them again so that the community can pay for prisons to put all their violence scumbags into okay I mean I think you guys get the gist of it so his brilliant idea to fix Society bro you gotta lock up the criminals bro that's what you got to do okay Matt you do know that we are we already do mass incarceration in fact pulled this up here for you incarceration rates I don't know why this One Compares New York but you get the justific you see the US and everybody else there comparing New York and founding NATO countries we lock up 664 people for every 100 000 in the population look at the UK look at Portugal look at Canada look at France look at Belgium look at Italy Luxembourg Denmark Netherlands Norway Iceland so Carl Kolinski says we already do mass incarceration look at our prison population compared to any of these other countries and New York is weirdly on this map but that just goes to show you that America very very very prison happy very very locked people up and all that also this data in particular might be outdated and we'll talk about it in a little bit but yeah this is the setup America locks up way more people than all these other countries and yeah just just just pay attention to that because you know that's that's weird right the United States of America locks people up very disproportionately compared to these other founding NATO countries I mean just to pick a random one here Italy we lock up 664 per 100 000. they lock up 89 per 100 000. so my question for Matt Walsh's and he says lock up more lock up more my question for Matt Walsh is this do you think Americans are just more violent and more Criminal by their very nature the answer is yes the the answer is 100 yes Americans are more violent a hundred percent it's undeniable Kyle yes 100 and you know what go further than that whether you think it's nature or if you think it's nurture slash culture slash environmental or whatever are we this much more criminal uh yes Kyle 100 Americans are significantly more violent we've had higher rates of violent crime for long periods of time throughout the history of this country it is an undeniable fact I like how you absurd it and then you talk about oh in their nature or whatever but you don't actually pull up any stats which I'm going to do to show you how absurd this claim actually is then other countries so we're look are we just worse people because I know he's tough on crime he would say criminals are people so if you guys are unaware of Kyle kolinski's argument tactics one of the things that he likes to do is talk in a Cartman Voice or talk to in other various stupid voices as he's making his baseless assertions about what he's trying to push in terms of policy so a perfect example is what he's doing right here where he says is America more violent than any of these other modern Western countries I mean he's going to do the angry voice to show you how ridiculous that is until you actually look at the statistics and I'm gonna put them up on screen so you can see undoubtedly the answer is yes a yes Americans have higher rates of violent crime look at this chart the homicide chart in comparison of the United States to our European counterparts and what you'll find out is that we are minimum five times higher than your average European country on top of that we have some breakdowns that compare Americans by similar demographics to our European counterparts and what you find out is of course and you guys know this black Americans are significantly more violent than the average European but even white Americans have a homicide rate that is higher than the average European so yes 100 undoubtedly Americans are more violent Kyle you could have looked this up instead of talking in a stupid voice and also I just want to point out that he's saying that Matt Walsh wants this like mass mass incarceration right so are we just worse people the numbers don't lie right we're already doing mass incarceration you want to do even bigger mass incarceration massive mass incarceration as if two things weren't undoubtedly true first and foremost one of those things is that mass incarceration completely and totally worked it a hundred percent addressed the issue that it was intended to do which of course was to incapacitate criminals this is one of the reasons why you'll see people on the left often cite this Brennan Center report which says that mass incarceration stopped working after the year 2000 which is interesting because most of the increase in the prison population predates that and all they're demonstrating is that mass incarceration like anything Works to a certain point and then after a while even if you keep doing it you're going to get diminishing returns also not acknowledged by Kyle Kolinski because again this video has no numbers no stats nothing like that it just has him making stupid voices because that's all he got in terms of arguments is that the United States prison population is going down in fact the United States prison population is at its lowest point since 1995. now to be clear Kyle put forward that 600 per 100 000 number the number I'm presenting to you right now is about 800 but this number includes jails and prisons people often will separate them out because obviously jails and prisons serve varying functions and whatnot but yeah our incarceration rate has actually dropped dramatically in the United States of America and wouldn't you know it at the same time that we dropped two 1995 levels we saw spikes in crime why because mass incarceration actually did work and I know Kyle's going to talk about Rehabilitation a little later on but as we've addressed on this channel multiple different times the purpose of a prison is not to rehabilitate that's nice I would be in favor of it everybody would be in favor if we could send a violent person to a place and they would come out a stunning and brave member Society but in reality we acknowledge that that's incredibly difficult to do so what we do with our prisons is incapacitate criminals remove them from society so they can't reoffend you think that's some sort of a solution so you I mean it's it's just a logical deduction right it's like a tautology you're saying yeah Americans are just worse we're just worse than the rest of the world man that would seem like kind of a anti-American take kind of an unpatriotic take that would seemed like kind of an anti-American take no cow it's an acknowledgment of the facts Americans have higher rates of violent crime as compared to our European counterparts certain groups in the United States of America have higher rates of violent crime compared to other places that are notorious for high crime rates obviously because black Americans homicide rate is so disproportionately high that raises the overall American homicide rate but even in a one-to-one comparison you see that the murder rate is actually higher amongst white Americans as compared to our European counterparts this has been a feature of the United States of America for a long time and even though they're much more similar to their European counterparts it's hard to ignore the fact that yes throughout all of American History we've had higher rates of crime hey what do you want to hit my fellow American uh citizens are just that much more Criminal we're just more criminal than everybody else in the world we're just worse again Kyle is not comparing the United States of America to everybody else in the world he's using a comparison to other NATO countries which again these countries are completely different societies and he's not even comparing the criminality he's just asserting that the criminality must be similar even though it definitely isn't based on the disparity in incarceration by the way one of the most obvious things the first thing you learn when you take Corrections 101 is that the reason the United States has the large prison population is because we have higher violent crime all these myths about us throwing potheads into prison for long sentences are not true the basis of it on apples to apples of violent crime to violent crime comparison shows the United States of America consistently has a higher rate of violent crime we're just more prone to violence it's just that's just how it is yes a hundred percent true borne out by the statistics for a long time in the United States of America I know you're asserting it like it's a ridiculous notion but has been proven out throughout decades in this country ever since we started tracking crime statistics in case you were curious Kyle so it's just you know however got this one I don't know but that's just how it is do you really believe that do you really believe that yes it is an assertion that is fully supported by the evidence Kyle do I need to show you more charts that compare crime rates in the United States to our European counterparts I mean just to pick a random one here Italy we lock up 664 per 100 000. they lock up 89 per 100 000. so my question for Matt Walsh's and he says lock up more lock up more my question for Matt Walsh is this do you think Americans are just more violent and more criminal also I find it incredibly hilarious that Kyle's random country that he selected of all the countries on this board would be Italy because Italy has one of the oldest populations in the world in fact if you have larger countries in your comparison group they're the number three if you brought it out to include a lot of smaller countries then it actually is in the top five but yeah Kyle obviously a hundred percent undeniably older people are gonna commit less crime overall than younger people just in case you're curious about that mister I'll I'm gonna make assertions about the data but I'm not actually going to address or bring up any of the data because it completely refutes my point but why would I need that because I could just talk in stupid voices now again he goes a step further because he said yeah let's lock up more people but he's also been clear on the record he wants to like increase the drug war and make the penalty penalties more strict and more severe I mean I think he said he wants to put like drug dealers to death or something like that so Matt Walsh has asserted that and by the way I want to be clear I'm not on board for that but I do want to say it's actually not that outrageous in the American context if you remember the George Floyd case he had a friend that was in the vehicle with him that was actually his drug dealer and one of the reasons why he did not testify at the trial is because he didn't get an immunity deal from the prosecution and under Minnesota's law you could actually be charged with third degree murder if you gave drugs to somebody and they ultimately ended up dying from that now I'm not asserting in the affirmative 100 that George Floyd died from the drugs that this person gave him but he was concerned enough and his lawyer was concerned enough based on the likely defense that was going to be put on from Chauvin that testifying in the trial without an immunity deal would open him up to prosecution later down the line so it's actually not absurd to say that we treat these drug dealers like they are murderers because certain states in the union and not even particularly right-wing States already do so now I don't actually believe in Matt Walsh's plan there I think he's being a little bit overzealous and I could make arguments against it but I do agree with building out the prison capacity for a number of reasons that Kyle just cannot understand look what I would contend to you guys is think like stuff like drug crimes non-violent victimless drug crimes selling cocaine selling weed doing cocaine doing weed you know these are people making their own decisions now some people might be able to handle it others might not maybe they get addicted or whatever but these are not things that Merit you should be locked in a cage I would free every single non-violent drug offender in the entire country that's great Kyle uh you do that and we'll still have one of the largest prison populations in the world because the reason we have one of the largest prison populations in the world is because we're a modern Western Country that takes crime seriously and we have significantly more violent crime than our comparable country so you can do that you could pretend that we live in this Fantasyland where we have all these drug offenders you could cite data that I hear people cite consistently that says this percentage is such a high percentage that it only refers to federal prisons which is not a significant portion of the American prison population but in reality the reason we have so many people in prison is because of violent crime that's what I would do so then you tick down that you know this uh this number quite a bit no no no you actually you actually 100 would not Kyle it would not take it down quite a bit just just in case you're curious it would definitely not but yeah on for like violent actual violent crimes murder rape robbery whatever yeah you want those people uh there needs to be punishment and Rehabilitation and there's a logic to making sure you protect Society by having a basic function of a jail or a prison right so I'm in favor of that but I would contend to you that overall If We Had A system that made sense overall these numbers would be lower and by the way just so you know all of the data shows when you have a criminal justice system that's actually geared towards Rehabilitation as they do for example many of the Scandinavian countries What's called the recidivism rate which is like hey if they get out are they going to commit a crime again that number goes way down so in other words if you treat people like people and you actually try to rehabilitate them in many instances these people get their act together and get their life together they need a little bit of attention a little bit of care they need to learn things they need a Hands-On approach and all the evidence is there in other countries that when you do this people don't commit crimes anymore they get out and they get their act together again Kyle you're just ridiculous and absurd in the countries that he's going to refer to which are Scandinavian countries they have significantly lower overall rates of violent crimes so they don't have a problem with repeat offenders in the same way that we have on top of that we don't know how to rehabilitate people it's all fine and dandy to say that you're in favor of Rehabilitation but in reality what tends to happen is that the prisoners who are going to be rehabilitated are the ones that are going to be rehabilitated and the ones that are going to reoffend are the ones that are going to reoffend and we have a lot of trouble delineating from the two and one of the things that that we find time and time again whenever we examine successful Rehabilitation programs is that these often suffer from selection bias and they're not broadly applicable on top of that one of the features of Scandinavian prisons and European prisons is that their population density is typically significantly less which we can achieve by building more prisons which would actually reduce overall violence within the prison so this is actually a point to Walsh's point and one of the reasons why I'm in favor of building more prisons because I actually don't want all these inmates stacked on top of each other committing violent crimes against them I want them spread out so that we can have them in the best possible scenario that they can re-enter Society but also I'm here to punish them and remove them from society so they're not reoffended and so he would never be in favor of that he's definitely not in favor of any sort of Rehabilitation he's just in favor of punishment and he wants to lock up more people including people who do non-violent crimes and Lord only knows how far he'd go but he looks at this number and says those are rookie numbers you got to get them up more and more and more more so I just want to point out that Matt Walsh said that he was in favor of executing drug dealers because they kill significantly more people and also it is a complete and utter straw man to say that anyone is not in favor of Rehabilitation the thing is is that saying you're in favor of Rehabilitation is about as valuable as saying that you're in favor of good things because obviously if I told you option A was we send you to a place where you're a bad person and in a set period of time you come out as a productive member of society everybody would sign on for that but the thing is that is a lot easier said than done I implore Kyle who doesn't bring up any relevant data throughout the whole course of the segment to look into the data related to Rehabilitation and look into it critically and by the way the most important point is what he would never want to attack the root of the problem what's the root of the problem poverty if people are being raised in dilapidated cities with broken families with no money no hope no chance to get out a society that hasn't created the social safety nets to give these people a chance what do you expect is going to happen you want to find a way to make less criminals if you massively reduce poverty you will massively reduce the number of crimes and the number of criminals there's no doubt about it so one of the things I absolutely love that every time the left talks about crime is they'll make dramatic assertions like that and make the claim that there is no doubt that if you address the root cause I.E poverty then there's no doubt that will actually lower crime but here's the thing not only is this not true but it's actually a hundred percent wrong and it 100 led to an increase in crime in fact the largest increase in crime in American history this is called the era of penal welfarism this is what happened pre the giant crime Surge from the 60s all the way to 1995. I will read you an excerpt from this article that I often cite in my videos it's linked in the description I highly recommend you read it because what you'll find out is that we have tried all of the things that the lefties had put forward before rather than focus on incapacitation by the way this is Jay failing offenders so they can't be in society so they can't commit further crimes the criminal justice system of this era was geared toward reshaping offenders Behavior the reigning Norm was what sociologist David Garland called penal welfarism which held that penal measures ought where possible to be rehabilitative interventions rather than negative retributive punishments policy increasingly shifted responsibility from Criminal Justice professionals to experts in Rehabilitation criminal justice writes Garland became the territory of probation officers social workers psychologists psychiatrists Child Guidance experts educationalists and social reformers of all kinds these reformers saw the system not as a way to deter or control crime directly but instead to undo society's harmful influence on the criminal a therapeutic approach that often goes hand in hand with root causes thinking during the post-war era the punitive components of the Criminal Justice System withered the incarceration rate declined between 1961 and 1976 and by 1981 murderers averaged a sentence of just five years while rapists got 3.4 years the economic and penological conditions of roughly half a century ago were as close as one could get to the ideal of today's reformers everyone assumed that the combination of favorable economic conditions and a rehabilitation and rights-focused Criminal Justice System should make crime and on issues so what happened crime soared and again The Surge was specifically tied to the era of Lyndon Johnson's Great Society aka the war on poverty AKA massive welfare spending in society you want to find a way to make less criminals if you massively reduce poverty you will massively reduce the number of crimes and the number of criminals there's no doubt about it and not only did crime soar but again it Rose faster and to higher levels than any time during the Great Depression if you wanted a test case on whether or not poverty was the cause of crime this would debunk it if you wanted a test case on whether or not anti-poverty programs welfare programs were the solution to Crime this should destroy that we know where this is going where he's going to redirect to Scandinavia as if the Scandinavians and the Americans are comparable societies again just look at the homicide rates over the past 60 years there is no doubt about it at all which by the way oh would you look at that what a shocker all of those Scandinavian countries that I just referenced which have phenomenal social safety nets which look out for everybody they have very few criminals of course you knew for a fact we were gonna get to this point because this is the point that the left always gets to despite the fact that it absolutely makes no sense at all whatsoever so first and foremost Kyle says the root cause is poverty somebody go put out an APB for poverty if you know what poverty is wearing leave me a description of her clothes in the description of this video so we can go out and arrest poverty because according to Kyle the real issue is poverty ignore the fact that countries with significantly more poverty will have a lower crime rates than countries that are wealthier ignore the fact that crime has gone up in periods of time where economics have been good and the average income median income and all that have gone up it's poverty do you definitely gotta address poverty we must go out and arrest poverty have phenomenal social safety nets which look out for everybody they have very few criminals ignore that certain demographics while they're in poverty like Asians or historically Jewish people commit very little crime in the United States of America and just say it's definitely a hundred percent without any shadow of a doubt poverty wow it's almost like if you give people health care and you give people education and give people a roof over their head and to give people a decent amount of money where they can survive and thrive it's almost like if you meet people's Basics they don't end up trying to rob the corner store or murder the person two streets over turns out that doesn't happen wow so he would never want to get to the root of the problem okay I don't expect people because they are lacking money to start raping other people everybody who talks about how oh it's definitely the poverty we definitely have to arrest poverty can't ever explain to me why somebody who's in poverty also has a higher rate also I just want to point out that the same areas that have high rates of robbery High rates of murder also typically tend to have high rates of rape and it's kind of inarguable that rape is this crime of economic desperation on top of that even if poverty were the root cause of crime it does not mean it's the most efficient mechanism to which you would address crime and the example that I like to give on this channel relates to earthquakes the root cause of earthquakes is the shifting of tectonic plates now if I gave you a billion dollars to deal with the problem of earthquakes how would you spend that money would you spend all of it on the root cause trying to control tectonic plates or would you understand that that is a complicated expensive time-consuming process that doesn't address the immediate concerns of earthquakes which is death and damage to buildings logically you would put more of that money into earthquake proofing and address the consequences because sometimes that's the most efficient way to deal with the issue when it comes to Crime even if we buy in that poverty is the root cause we spent trillions of dollars on the war on poverty and that doesn't address the fact that people are getting murdered today trying to revitalize the cities and again it's a Fool's errand because as I've said it time and time again and has been proven out by the facts crime drives poverty that drives businesses out of the cities and makes them more dilapidated it ruins the opportunity going forward so you have what's going on completely backwards from Kyle kolinski's point of view so everything he's saying is 100 wrong even if you buy into it his solution that automatically just because I can save root cause that's the most efficient way to deal with the problem is also wrong it's called the root cause fallacy and in comparison incarceration which is the incapacitation of violent repeat offenders is a much more sensible and logical and cost effective solution in comparison to looking for and trying to address root causes especially when you're trying to deal with a crime spike in the moment you want to find a way to make less criminals if you massively reduce poverty you will massively reduce the number of crimes and the number of criminals there's no doubt about it uh yes there's a hundred percent doubt about it Kyle 100 undeniable just look at Americans average income look at the poverty rate in the United States of America and compare that to the crime rate and you will be a hundred percent doubted in that assertion because it's not borne out by the data it's not like crime and poverty correlate they don't even correlate crime has gone up significantly as incomes have gone up as poverty has been reduced crime has gone down during periods of time like the Great Recession where relative poverty has gone up so no Kyle you're just wrong in every possible way and it's a bit embarrassing that you don't try to pull up any data you just assert this and your audience buys into it because Matt Walsh bad yet I have the data on my side and I'm willing to go toe-to-toe on these issues with anybody because I'm all in favor of naming and shaming the crime deniers in our society oh would you look at that what a shocker all of those Scandinavian countries that I just reference which have phenomenal social safety nets which look out for everybody they have very few criminals wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow Kyle the welfare state in Scandinavia actually done reduced the crime in Scandinavia according to Kyle kolinsky now that's an interesting assertion it's an interesting claim however it's not supported by the facts because again I put up a homicide chart that goes back from 2010 60 years and you can see clearly and obviously that the United States homicide rate is five times the rate before the Scandinavian welfare system and by the way people of Scandinavian descent when they come to the United States of America on Apples to Apples comparison don't become 5x more of a criminal they also don't commit crimes here so it also has to do with the culture a culture that predates their welfare state in fact what we often find when we're researching Scandinavia and comparing it to the United States of America is the exact opposite of Kyle kolinski's assertion whatever Scandinavian country or whatever period of time where they have increased social safety net as compared to the other countries of Scandinavia they don't actually move further away from the United States in metrics like happiness and all those other things they move closer to the United States so big government and Welfare spending doesn't work in Scandinavia any better than it works in the United States of America but make no mistake that's a completely separate argument from what we're talking about now because what we're talking about now is how even before these welfare systems existed their homicide rate was significantly lower than the United States in fact all of the positive indicators from Scandinavia compared to the United States existed and to a greater extent prior to the Scandinavian welfare states being instituted it's just a fact you can look it up again unlike Kyle actually have the charts related to crime rate rather than just making wild assertions that are not based on anything because I actually have an audience that expects me to you know bring information and cite sources rather than talking in a goofy voice and thinking that's sufficient if we had a thriving social democracy where everybody had Healthcare everybody had education everybody had high wages everybody had a decent shot a community that actually is a community you're gonna have fewer criminals you just are you just are so instead of instead of addressing this from the root which is the poverty the extreme uh depravity that terrible situations that people are living in Kyle like I said earlier on you can go back and re-watch that root causes are not more important than any other type of cause if you can address something by getting after the immediate cause or the immediate effects or whatever you don't have to worry about the root cause so no cop that's not an intelligent thing to say it's a fallacy it's kind of absurd and I can use analogy after analogy to prove this point but I think my earthquake one kind of really hits the nail on the head and there really needs to not be said anything more about it instead of addressing it from the the root he goes right to man nothing we can do about it criminals or just criminals and lock up more people wow again he just closes out by saying root root cause root cause root cause as if that's an intelligent Point Kyle it isn't newsflash even if you were properly identifying root causes appropriately that still doesn't mean as I said before that that's the most efficient way or the most effective way to address a problem very intelligent there Matt guess it is actually significantly more intelligent than what you asserted which is oh is there any evidence that America is really more violent historically or by our nature or by our society than uh than than Italy one of the oldest countries in the world right now uh absolutely not to pay no attention to the fact that I'm not pulling up any crime data cow you're wrong it's embarrassing this was an absolutely shameful performance and it just goes to show you how lazy some of these creators get because they can essentially get by on this reputation that they've never actually proven that they're somehow these amazing policy wonks it is not the case he didn't even know the proper places to look he didn't even know that America's crime rate as compared to Europe is vastly different yet he
