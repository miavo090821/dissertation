Like, do they hate that you compare, or do they just know you're bad at it? I often see people retort \"that is not a valid comparison for X reason\", which seems totally reasonable, and you deserve that because you made several assertions as fact without a shred of information as to why your assertions are true. For example, how can you be sure recidivism is low in Scandinavia because the focus is more on rehabilitation (whatever THAT means)? I could just as easily say you're clearly wrong and missing something, recidivism is extremely high in Urban US liberal cities with programs that offer any kind of support a person could need. We have different root problems here that aren't as prevalent in Scandinavia that can't be solved with comparable measures. Rehabilitation means nothing to a person who rejects it on a deep, cultural level, and sees \"rehabilitation\" as the ultimate betrayal, selling out your tribe and working for the enemy.\n\nHere's a comparison: Scandinavia had a headache after a stressful day and cured it with ibuprofen. The US has a headache as well so it follows the same prescription a different country used for a comparable symptom- it took ibuprofen to cure the headache caused by a developing brain tumor.",

While you can't just copy paste 'what X country did' to Y country, there are basic principle that works in every country. Why people commit crime? Because they have motive to commit crime. What's the motive? Well you're hungry and have no money, or maybe you got a drug addiction so you steal or join gangs and sell drugs, then you got jailed. What happened next after you got out? No body is willing to hire you because of your criminal history and no skill but one's go to eat, so you go back to stealing and sell drugs.\n\nBut what if you have some sort of social programs that teach you life skill while in jail, or even better helps you with food, shelter, or with your drug addiction so you never commit those crime in the first place.\n\nThis is why studies shows that social programs is way more effective are reducing crime than just locking people up, because it address the root cause of the issue.",

        "text": "Oh snap, I mentioned this too from my comment which I pointed out how the Left and Right both have their own definitions for \"criminal,\" the Right view those committing crimes and enacting violence upon others as criminals, and Leftists claim Republicans that have \"huwite\" skin pigmentation are the \"criminals\" because if we left it to Democrats, they'd adopt Hitler's playbook and round up all the \"huwite\" Conservatives to toss into camps.  \n\nI literally have evidence of this malignant hatred of the Left being true!!  I mean, after the 2020 Presidential election, countless Leftists on social media were screaming for blood, demanding Trump supporters along with Trump be rounded up and thrown into camps, many Leftists going further with their hatred and demanding Republicans to be \"ended\" even, and the prior ownership at Twitter allowed such evil to propagate on their social media platform, same as Facebook, none of these Leftists were banned for such pure evil and quite bigoted rants of vitriol on display for the world to witness.  Leftists were screaming for blood, all because they took power and were conditioned to know how to destabilize, riot and terrorize, once they retained power once more, they demanded their competition be rounded up and it was repeated by countless Leftists on social media, proving just how bigoted and hateful the Left have become, without question.\n\nThe Left would likely attempt the same with the \"huwite\" elitists regardless of political leanings, at which point the Left would realize they've only been given the semblance of power and played right into the hands of these tyrannical authoritarian elitists who have exploited Leftist bigotry and hatred in order for them to enforce their indefinite Oligarchy upon the Western World, in which they no longer have a use for these Leftists, as history has shown what Communists do after the \"useful idiots of the Left\" destabilize a nation.  \n\nHistory proves Leftists are only good at one thing and that is to destabilize a nation from being indoctrinated into being the attack dogs of fascist dictators who set up our educational systems to exploit youths and begin conditioning them into activist foot soldiers of tyrants, history proves that it's impossible to recondition these Leftists into being productive members of society, so instead elitists would begin a \"purge\" of the \"useful idiots of the Left\" instead of trying to re-indoctrinate and basically make Leftists into Moderates or Conservatives after their Oligarchy is established to supersede the law of the land.  Throughout history this has occurred over and over again, there is no land to flee to from this as America is the last bastion of freedom, so Leftists should recognize the \"No True Scotsmen\" fallacy is propaganda and they are doing exactly what the elite desire them to do, if they succeed they will be screaming \"it wasn't done right\" immediately and then as history proves, the Leftists will \"disappear\" by government mandate.\n\nEl Salvador proves the Right has the morally appropriate and productive application on how to drastically curb crime and violence, the Left continue to prove to society that Democrats are the modern era Nazi's, as Leftists desire Hitler's agenda to push their quite malicious and bigoted ideals for their supposed \"utopia\" they'd never see manifest, only the Left would be screaming \"it wasn't done right\" if they got their way as history proves Leftists are once more being fooled by authoritarians.  \n\nI mean, so many Leftists already know their leaders are lying to them, Leftists continue to support abhorrently evil positions, genital mutilation of children, abortion to literal all pregnancies, the pure vitriol Leftists have for any political opposition as we saw after the 2020 Presidential election where Leftists demanded Conservatives be thrown into camps and far far worse commentary was made by Leftists, Leftists all but prove they have a bigoted and evil position born of malice and contempt for any different views, and no free nation may remain if only one side of the narrative or story is allowed while all other sides and narratives to said one-sided view is allowed and even made criminal, Leftists are in the wrong and they know it and refuse to admit they should likely address the growing evil in their rank and file because they believe it's the only way for them to gain power, through being exploited by evil authoritarians who'd rather see them all \"ended\" and for an Oligarchy to be formed over illegal immigrants replacing Americans outright.  It's pure evil, so many Leftist elitists in power never are held accountable or liable for their ever-growing list of crimes, and Leftists simply scream \"stunning and brave.\"  Pure evil.",

Scandinavians have very long-established societies which they live in. Far less geographical mobility. They've simply had a much higher imperative and incentive to settle down and 'find their place in society'. In the USA there has been strong incentive to do the opposite: if they engage in criminality they have massive opportunities to move around to new areas, no strong societal pressure to settle down in small close-knit communities.\nIn Scandinavia opportunity for crime is also lower: less history of organised crime, far less history of out of control criminality like in the USA. That has led to people committing crimes to be sought after with more resources, more effort, and people being less willing to let criminality become a normal phenomenon as they feel \"their village\" has been violated. They don't consider it just a small 'business expense' which can be sidestepped like is often seen in the more dynamic, upward-mobile USA.",

Single mother hoods also a great indicator of poverty. Their decisions you make that lead to crime in poverty. If you are poor in the USA, it’s most likely your decisions.

        "text": "I'm perfectly fine letting people out of prison for drugs though.  The government should not be telling people what they can and cannot put in their own bodies.  It's also extremely hypocritical when alcohol (one of the most dangerous drugs in existence) is perfectly legal and consumed by the majority of adults.  I think drug use is very bad however the answer isn't to kidnap someone who hasn't hurt anyone else and throw them in a cage at the cost of hardworking taxpayer money.  It makes no sense.\n\nMy problem is when progressives want to be more lax on crimes that actually harm OTHER people (murder, assault, burglary, theft, etc).  There should be extremely strict punishments for when people harm others, but I don't care if people want to harm themselves with drugs.  It's their own body, they can destroy it as they see fit.",

        "text": "Think of it in a slightly different perspective, not that poverty causes an individual to become a criminal, instead that poverty causes an individual to be victimized more easily. It is easier and more lucrative for criminals to steal, deal, and fight in poor communities where the average person can't afford high fences, personal space, cameras, or police attention. It also requires a certain level of wealth and affluence to commit white collar crimes in the first place, so there is a nearly bimodal divide between what types of crime are possible for an income bracket. When a wealthy person does murder someone, they do it so well they are never suspected or bribe the investigation away. Wealthy people do steal from poor people, but they do it by wage theft, not by pickpocketing or breaking in. It's harder to notice and harder to prove. Poverty causes a certain group of crimes to be way more prevalent and acted out by a rudimentary generalized group of people. Kinda like how if a chicken coop has hole in the wall it doesn't cause the chickens to cannibalize, it just lets the weasels in. Meanwhile, the farmer steals the eggs but the chickens don't notice cause they don't wake up dead.",

I have MASSIVE issues with universal healthcare and has nothing to do with what the overwhelming preponderance would think ascribe my motivation. I am opposed to it, because the ONLY way to provide such care, is to steal labor from one person and give it to another. Still another reason, is that in America, specifically, due to the mix of society and our propensity of being overweight, we would CATASTROPHICALLY abuse the system and drive costs through the roof. Due to a nearly an open border, we would get a much higher number of people wanting in and would tax the system even more. We have 330M+ people in America and a FAR more diverse society, in terms of race, ethnicity and backgrounds. Nearly all countries have MUCH better control of their border and have a mostly a single race population. This means they all share very similar values and if you compare it to America, we have raised 3 generations of those who think socialism is a good thing and huge amount feel entitled to healthcare, UBI, free rent and the like.\n.\nThis is NOT the America I signed up for and it is being destroyed from the inside.",

        "text": "@barbaraibiel That’s crazy and will lead to the deaths of a lot more people. As for why using mind altering substances is wrong. First of all, I’ll talk about why things like drunkenness, or changing your state of consciousness is wrong. Giving up your ability for free Will and rationality, what make us human, is wrong, and doesn’t take into account human dignity, and in a sense, is self harm. Furthermore, it is putting yourself into a situation where you don’t have this free Will or rationality, and so you now are in the situation where you don’t have control over if you do something immoral, or far less control. And as we know, people tend to act stupid off of things such as alcohol, me-h, etc. We need to be sober minded and vigilant at all times. The effects of say, alcohol are not bad in themselves, in fact, they can open people up and actually provide a positive to society, in the way of making people happy, and bringing them together. But drunkenness, or when you lose your sense of control, is where it is wrong. Furthermore, again, drugs, especially ones like met- or heroi— can easily lead to addiction and overdose. For example, after taking heroi- once, you can be addicted. I don’t think this guy has much experience in knowing this kind of subject. Met- provides a greater high than even an orga—, which means that it is greater than the top biological plea—-, it essentially floods your brain with more fake dopamine that it’s meant for, and so it is highly more addictive, than say, something like alcohol. Obviously, this shouldn’t be in the hands of the public. A lot of hard dr- also get you into another state of consciousness I. One hit, such as shro—-, or etc. They are also very dangerous, and can easily cause overdose, and often have stuff hidden in them, by the people who manufacture them. For example, if you even lay down the wrong way on hero-, you can die. Even a dr-g like weed shouldn’t be legal recreationally (medical and recreational use are two separate things), because it doesn’t have say, the cultural aspect first of all, where it’s been around for centuries, and where people drink smart culturally in certain places, and it doesn’t bring the societal benefits alcohol does by bringing people together, because for one, wee- is not a foodstuff, meaning you can’t drink it for the taste, and two the hi-h isn’t the same, and it instead makes you more socially awkward. Long term use or underage use of these things can greatly impede brain development. And obviously kids are way less responsible due to brain development, so they shouldn’t have access either. Overall, no they should not be legal. And yes, for trying to access a dangerous and illegal substan—, and doing something so irresponsible and harmful towards themselves even, they should be locked up. Those who sell these dangerous things more so. I don’t think you’d say someone illegally selling weapons would be a good thing.",

If you look at the video thumbnails for The Majority Report when they go after Tim Pool they use a filter on his face to make him look more pale and sickly. I notice this all the time, they also ran Tim's music through a pop filter which makes it sound like crap before playing it on their show to make fun of it. Things like this are why people don't take seder seriously. He isn't interested in honest convo, just shock content that appeals to his tribe",
