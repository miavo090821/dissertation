hey everyone I am in beautiful karakas Venezuela and I want to tell you with the election coming up everything that the American Media is telling you is an absolute lie they frame Venezuela as this authoritarian hellhole that's ran by this dictator named Nicolas Malo but I am here I've been here for many days now and I've been able to see thousands of people in karakas I've talken to hundreds of them and I can affirm that more than 90% literally almost all of the Venezuelans I've spoken to are down with the bolivarian revolution they're going to be voting for Malo I've seen hundreds of shirts with Chavez and uh mudo on them and look guys the American Media is there to lie to us to lie us into war to represent the interest of the owners of big Capital who have the same reason to lie about Venezuela than they did to lie about Iraq and weapons of mass destruction Venezuela is a country that is extremely rich in resources and After the bolivarian Revolution it became truly Sovereign it said Venezuelan resources are going to be po Venezuelan not for American or other forms of multinational uh massive Monopoly corporations and this is why the American media and the opposition has to lie because Venezuela actually represents the people it's a real government of buying for the people and not of buying for big businesses corporations uh investment firms Etc as we have in the US so with the election coming up just know that literally everything you are hearing from the American Media is likely untrue uh I have seen how the polling stations look how the electoral system functions and it's completely uh in line with what American President Jimmy Carter said uh that it's the most democratic system in the world uh and he said that years ago and it's only gotten better sense they've only applied more ways of making uh voting more efficient more secure of removing the potential for voter fraud and the only people that are really interested in voter fraud is the opposition because the opposition does not have the Venezuelan people on their side the Venezuelan government does and so this is why they have to say that there's going to be voter fraud from months ahead of time uh they have literally no proof they have never had any proof there's an abundance of proof to the contrary but because they represent the interest that the US wants in power in Venezuela uh the US of course is giving them a megaphone and spreading their lives around the world so do not be uh deceived do not be fooled recognize that the struggle for Venezuelan sovereignty the struggle for Venezuela and socialism is not disconnected from our fights as American uh and workingclass people from around the world if Venezuela wins if Venezuela's bolivarian Revolution can continue that's a that's a win for us as well they're fighting the same parasitic imperialist interests that keep us poor that keep us immiserated that keep us desperate and indebted at home so with Venezuela is where our interest lies we're going to potentially see uh violence from the Venezuelan opposition they've been going around the streets with uh sacrificed Roost roers which is the symbol of the Revolution so bloody roosters that they've been carrying and marching with the symbology is clear uh they're going after the president they're going after the Venezuelan leadership they're threatening with Terror to scare people to uh ensure that fear uh spreads and people don't go to the polls cuz that's literally all they have right now they don't have the people but they have the ability to terrorize the people and make them fear going to the polls uh so um to be frank uh Venezuela is about to join bricks the economic turn that it's made since 2019 when the the the sanctions were hitting Venezuela at the worst it still has 930 sanctions on it but uh it's been weathering the storm it's been growing the conditions of regular workingclass people have been improving but now it's about to join bricks which means that it's only going to get better from here on out and the Venezuelan opposition backed up of course by the US Empire as it's always the case they're not stupid they know what's going to come when vene Venezuela joins bricks and potentially the belt and Road initiative that means more common prosperity and that means the full entrenchment the full solidification of the bolivarian Revolution so I think the opposition sees this elections as uh Do or Die they're going to fight tooth and nail to gain power back in the hands of a small click of people who set out National their national interests to American uh multinational corporations uh that means they're in a in a very um in a position that makes them quite dangerous because they're willing to do anything to come back to Power because they know that it's very likely that they'll never be able to come back to Power again especially after Venezuela during its breaks so uh spread the word about Venezuela as far as widely as you can this is not just an issue of another country this is an issue that affects all of us if socialism Falls in Venezuela if it's overthrown which is extremely unlikely um that's that's a that's something that hits the workingclass movement in the US it hits all of us socialists around the world it hits uh workingclass people around the world because that's the interest that Venezuela upholds so spread uh the news about Venezuela far and wide that's the only way we can break the blockade of information that's promoted by the major Medias the Legacy Media we can only break it in these more quote unquote Democratic social medias and you do that by liking videos by sharing them by tweeting uh uh and and retweeting and doing all the things you know you you know how to do in order to spread this message so spread it far and wide andw well is democratic Malo is going to win the bolivarian revolution is going to continue and it's going to continue with a program of sovereignty and socialism for the people
