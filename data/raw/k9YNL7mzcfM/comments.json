        "text": "@2snowornot2know81 I like the inherent bias in saying \"normal to far right people\". Yeah, cause that isn't a skewed perspective to get a \"consensus\" from?\nHe clearly stated that he didn't know much about the topic, but gave his theory since he was asked about it. He didn't make a video about it like Sargon does when he is uninformed, it was just a comment made in passing. I know this was posted 2 years ago, but this seems like a really poor hot take on a comment that specifically mentioned it wasn't well informed.\nIt is quite the leap to equivocate an intentionally downplayed comment with the arrogance and overconfidence of youtubers like Sargon.\n\nYou mention gang crime as the perpetrators of gun violence, but that completely ignores that facet of gun crime most people are worried about, which is mass shootings. That is definitely an important facet of gun violence and it isn't perpetrated by gangs, but mostly white conservatives.\nAnother issue is police brutality that has come into extreme focus during this pandemic.\n\nEven if we assume gang crime is the \"cause\" of gun violence, it is important to note that the readily available nature of guns in the US makes it easier for said gangs to get a hold of guns to be violent with. In too many states, guns can be purchased without any background checks. While the gun show loophole might be misnamed, it still is a loophole in the system that can be very easily abused to get your hands on a bunch of weapons you wouldn't usually be able to get.\nAllowing private sellers to sell without going through the system, without checking the background of the buyer, means that any criminal can buy guns easily by just buying it through other people.\n\nWhile closing the loophole wouldn't stop criminals from getting guns through smuggling or other illegal acts, it would still make it harder for criminals to get guns, since not all criminals have the connections needed for that, and it also allows the issue of criminals getting guns to be more efficiently targeted. There is no point in stopping gun smuggling if guns can just be purchased by anyone from random individuals, but if you do stop criminals from getting guns that way, stopping smuggling could actually have an effect on criminals getting guns.\n\nPrivate sellers is a huge problem for gun crime, and gun control can stop that. Of course nobody is claiming that is gonna stop the entire problem, but we can't just ignore one facet of the problem just because there are other issues that ALSO need to be fixed. We'll never fix any problem if we allow other unrelated problems to be used as arguments against the solution.",

        "text": "The truth is that this law was designed to stir up anti-German sentiments in Poland. Current goverment is heavily criticised by EU and many German officials so as a counter the ruling party PiS passed this law, raised up the question of war reparations etc. They used German tv channel ZDF's terrible gaffe as a reason. They didn't expect Israels reaction at all.  Meanwhile Israeli PM is engulfed in corruption scandal so he welcomed this distraction. Claims on all sides are exaggerated. Germans don't try to rewrite history and blame Poles for nazi death camps. The Polish law is not penalizing people who talk about pogroms or many other crimes or acts of anisemitism. It only intends to prevent assigning blame for actual German atrocities (ie death camps) to Polish nation. There is also a huge concern in Poland about not giving a fair picture of occupied country - it was a catastrophy and humanitarian disaster. There were people who in this catastrophy behaved despicably, others risk their life to safe the Jews, and here PiS has a point. And now the law is basically dead anyway.",

One of such cases is the pogrom in Jedwabne - it was described by a Polish-American historian Jan Gross in a book \"Neighbors: The Destruction of the Jewish Community in Jedwabne, Poland\". It cause Polish right-wingers to lose their shit and deny anything like this ever happened or claim that the Poles were forced by the Germans to commit this atrocity. I know a family friend who was born there after the war and she told us the story was one of this silent secrets that everyone there knew and no one wanted to talk about. Polish nationalists are more than keen to erase things like that from history (similarly to infamous invasion of Czechoslovakia to annex a small part of the border region, arm in arm with Hitler in 1938, which was both shameful and stupid). Nationalists do what they always do - whitewash their history and paint themselves as innocent victims surrounded by evil enemies and traitors.",

And even then, we actually do recognize trucks as a potentially dangerous tool, hence why most countries require people to take a truck driver's certification, and to register their truck ownership with the government. It's not perfect, but at least it weeds out some clearly incompetent people, and can make it easier to track down potential helpers in the case of a deliberate attack.",

If we drew from the Swiss gun system by giving licenses for non-sporting-purpose firearms to reservists (2nd amendment refers to militias, and reservists are essentially more official militias) that'd be a good compromise.",

Sure it MIGHT help, but you're still not doing much to solve the problem. \n\nNow the two aren't mutually exclusive, mind you, but solving crime at its core does more to help people than just restricting their freedoms",

Sure thing, but it's a lot harder to use something you need a license for that you don't have.\n\nAlso: gun violence is the easiest violence there is. That's why it's the deadliest tool for suicides by far. People who want to commit suicide in a differen way are very likely to survive and after that not try again (cause it usually hurts and pain is a deterrent). People who want to commit suicide by gun usually succeed (if you can call it that).\nDifferent situation: a fight between two spouses gets out of hands, someone goes for a weapon. It's either a) a knife - so the other one keeps their distance, maybe grab a chair to help with that, lock in a room and be really afraid, b) a gun - you're dead.\nSomone wants to inflict a lot of pain on a lot of other people (i.e. school shootings). They take a car - people can evade. They take a knife - people can overpower them. They take a gun - people will die.\n\nThere is a reason why there is a huge correlation between gun ownership rates and gun violence. The violence when commited by guns is much more severe, much easier, much more accessible, much more effective. That's why sane cultures regulate them and require licenses, as well as background checks. No country really bans guns, but permits can vary in terms of how hard you might get them. And at the end of the day it's really simple: the easier it is to get guns, the more harm there is in a country. And if you spew the \"if guns are outlawed, only outlaws have guns\" BS at me, I refer you to the analogy of cars and licenses. Sure, you can use a car without a license, but it happens rather rarely.",

    "text": "Excellent, thank you for this. As with one of your commenters, I consider myself centrist although more recently this has started to mean soft-left. However, I do have concerns with the number of people immigrating to my country, the U.K., with Islamic beliefs. No, not terrorism,  very few are directly affected and the greatest danger is our response to it. Rather my concerns are with the issues of severe social conservatism and a disrespect for governance we have seen here. Things like the child sex-trafficking and several issues of political influence, including identitarian corruption at the local level that has started people talking for the first time about a requirement for ID when voting, amongst other more substantial changes. Although we do have plenty of Anglo-Saxon corruption it doesn’t tend to be based on religion or the country/region of origin of the corrupt or their parents, it is more about the lining of pockets. I don’t want to stop or even slow down immigration, particularly European or Indian immigration (Hindu anyway) as I believe it benefits the country and our economy will falter if it is ever tried. No, my concerns are about too many people from too conservative a culture with bad ideas I had naively thought had been or were being dealt with (particularly regarding women, homosexuals and Jews).  The recent flaring up of anti-semitism in the Labour Party here has a direct line to lefty criticism (justified) of Israel mixing with Islamic ideas and the old bigotry. This appalls me as I had hoped the Labour Party, which I vote for when not voting Green, would be a way to stop or minimise the Brexit bullshit but they are too busy playing the old trots vs Leninists vs stalinists vs social democrat game and fighting amongst themselves about whether criticism of Israel is anti-Semitic (it’s not) or whether criticism of the Zionist project is (it is, usually). However, since the surge in the right and particularly the nasty, anti-democratic right I am reluctant to raise any of my concerns due to my fear it empowers the authoritarian arseholes because of the complexity of the issue and their appealing to a large swathe of people with simple, tried and failed solutions from the far right. I also think the danger comes from them now. Still, Muslim immigration has been a great thing for this country but I have concerns about too much in too short a period of time. By the way, I agree with Frau Merkel’s refugee decision as an emergency measure but I do feel it was handled badly, for whatever reason including the number of people who took advantage of German compassion and generosity. And now it seems it will hurt other, future refugees when the next crisis turns up. Even if the immigrants themselves wish very much to integrate and most of them do, the current climate creates an ‘us and them’ dynamic which will drive increasing numbers of their children (it’s hardly ever the actual immigrants) to an extremist viewpoint. The great tragedy of Brexit is that it will mean increased immigration from the commonwealth (Pakistan, Nigeria and Bangladesh for example) to make up for the fewer Europeans coming here, which will only compound the problem. Business will get its workers from somewhere.  I suppose what I’m trying to say is that I’m not quite as sanguine about the type of immigration we have as you are. This is very difficult and I particularly want to stress that I do not hold negative views about anybody based on their religious belief, beyond a certain suspicion as to the rational behaviour of anyone who believes in supernatural beings and events, but I am concerned about too many people in too short a period of time with beliefs that are too socially conservative. This aside, I agree almost completely with what I have discerned of your viewpoint, and I consider this one disagreement secondary, if related, to the rise of the authoritarians and nativists.",

I also feel that he \"got\" the war more than his older brother did, even though he was not the level as his older brother in terms of adopting to military culture he was always aware of the consequences, even before he died. \n\nI liked all the character's stories except perhaps that of the actress girl played by Katharina Schüttler. I feel her story is a little too convenient in the sense that its all about her selling herself for one Jewish friend. Not saying that there weren't good selfless people like that, I'm sure there were a good number of such silent minority, but I just feel its less powerful and less related to the plot than the other 3 characters. I also feel that the media wants the audiences to zero in on her despite the...well, holocaust that's happening all around. Though I will admit that her rise in fame and fall does show the nasty abusive side of the Reich to its own (even well off) citizendry. \n\nPersonally I wouldn't mind a perspective from a disgruntled and disillusioned WW1 soldier or an utterly impoverished child who grow up to be a full blown Nazi ideologue if anything to see from his perspective how someone like that gets to become that way (an...Star Wars Empire's perspective from the other side so to say) how someone lonely and powerless comfortably becomes part of a marching army toward death.

Most firearms owners in the US actually strongly dislike the NRA. New groups get much more dedicated support, especially from people well versed in the subject. One of these groups is the FPC (firearms policy coalition) and they seem to be organised in a completely different way than the NRA is. I’m also not from the US but from the Netherlands where I am a very active member in the sports shooting community but also closely follow firearms related issues in the US",

Basically he pointed out that guns are tools for death but have been co-opted as a symbol of masculinity which inexplicably leads to masculinity battles using war tools instead of arm wrestling or something. So America is the problem that results in high American gun crime.",

    "text": "So I have to say, I'm really annoyed at the way people talk about free will and determinism. People often take for granted that they are incompatible with each other, but if you look at the discourse surrounding it within philosophy you find that the most popular position among philosophers is actually what is known as compatibilism, which basically just means that free will and determinism are compatible. \n\nPart of the reason why people are, in my opinion, so bad at discussing this is that this question comes from a time when we viewed the world quite differently. The question \"do we have free will?\" then meant something along the lines \"are we able to rebel against our fate?\". Today people substitute fate with determinism but it's not exactly the same thing and the question breaks down a bit as a result of this.\n\nI can recommend reading Daniel Dennett's review of Free Will if you are interested in learning more about the compatibilist position. It does not presuppose any training in philosophy so it should be fairly approachable: https://samharris.org/reflections-on-free-will/",

So far its been mind numbing lefty media and alt-media channels like Sargon of Akkad, so I've just grown to hate the left and identify hugely with the right as a liberal. While I completely support your historical corrections, you haven't convinced me on your politics, but I'll try (as always) to have an open mind.\n\nIt seems to me like you just downplay the issues that the right and I find significant and ignore the problems we see in the left, especially in the US, but you've haven't made many videos so I'll give you time. While I don't believe in an Alex Jones-like conspiracies about the Marxist at the gates, I see all extremist movements on the left and right as threatening and should be combated by moderates of all stripes.",

I see it in the widely anti-trump American media, such as CNN and all the various today/tonight/late shows. I see it in Antifa running in the streets punching \"nazis\". I see it in the SJW's who are indoctrinating students in Universities with bullshit courses like gender studies. I see it in Labour, who are steadily gaining popularity here in the UK, especially amongst the youth. I see it in brain dead journalism publishers like Buzzfeed, Vox, Vice and The Guardian, though I'd expect Three Arrows to disregard them as nothing more than clickbaiting companies which is fair enough.\n\nYour response does hint at the big problem in today's western society's, that being people refusing to step outside their echo chambers in order to really try to understand the other side's argument, instead of twisting it into something that it isn't to make it easily refutable. That's exactly why I'm on this channel, trying to understand the other perspective.",

But there's plenty of conservatives who hate him too, that's why his approval polls have always been so low.\n\nI'm not sure antifa really qualify as left-wing, I don't doubt they have leftists in their midst, but punching nazis is literally a matter of self-preservation for everybody who isn't a nazi.  I'm not exaggarating, that is 100% serious.  So really, it could be anybody who punched Richard Spencer, I don't know.  They don't really have political positions, they're not even a 'group' really.\n\nAs for SJW's in universities..that's over-exaggarated.  Students have been doing dumb, radical shit for decades and decades now.  Stunts, protests, you name it.  You can't write off everything you don't like as being left-wing though.  Some people think philosophy is bullshit indoctinration, but it's not political.  Same with gender studies, it's not really left-wing, unless you define right-wing as \"opposing any evaluation of gender-based power structures within society\".\n\nLabour...have spent the past 20 years copying Tory policy.  That's the opposite of what left-wing means.  Yes, they have Corbyn now, but that hasn't stopped them from siding with the Tories in so many bills.\n\nI honestly don't read any of those publishers, so maybe they are legitimately leftist?  We can't deny that print media is hugely biased towards the right though.",
