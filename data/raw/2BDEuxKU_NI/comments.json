She believed everyone deserved a roof over their head, that it was the basic fundamental truth of society that it was responsible for all of us.  Sure I agreed healthcare was a right and that less homelessness was better than more.  But somehow the idea that shelter should be a human right missed me.  Her unapologetic assertion and refusal to let me argue it changed me for the better.\n\nIt's too easy, even if you don't think poverty is a crime, to reframe the act of being homeless as a threat.  That it's understandable to dislike or shrug off the suffering of the homeless as inconvenient.  That you should meet people who believe that halfway rather than think of people who are homeless as being denied a human right.  That shift helped me but does leave me utterly lost when madness like this happens.  Starting from people shouldn't be murdered shouldn't be the starting point of conversations and yet clearly that's not universally acknowledged.",

Such anger is neither a sign of impending violence, nor necessarily a symptom of a \"mental health crisis\". Jordan was a human being attempting to survive in circumstances most people would agree were dehumanizing. How sad that his status in our society, his issues with mental health, all seem to exempt him from the freedom of having and expressing normal human emotions. Thank you for your commentary.

If there's someone who knew the consequences of what they were doing that someone is that killing machine. Yes, a killing machine. That's what he was trained for. He willingly decided to join Murder Inc. because that's what the US military is. An entity spreading death through the world. The irony of it is that that Blk man could've very easily been a marine just like himself because there's no shortage of former marines who are homeless (or mentally ill!) in the US. Let that sink in. But truthfully he didn't/doesn't see that man as a human just like himself. If he did he would've never joined the very place that goes around the globe killing Brown and Blk people. US Americans don't be surprised that the monsters you create to spread death and destruction bring it home, eventually.",

Hell they can get away with crimes that in theory we all agree are wrong the better looking they are.  Recognizing that fact about a society you are still succeeding in is tricky so it's nicer to think bad things happen to fundamentally bad people.  Or that if a bad thing happens society will care enough to do the right thing, not struggle over figuring out that the is.

Clearly im racist, even if it’s not in an outward way I know I don’t hate black people or any other race and yet I still have biases I didn’t even notice. \n\nI ignored the facts as stated because I saw a black man murdered by a marine and thought it must be justified. That’s what I almost fell for, and that’s not me trying to push that onto others, I simply saw someone else’s perspective on it and changed my mind. \n\nBUT NO SHIT!

Him being a black person adds several layers to this that I'll never be able to fully understand as a white person, so I'm glad you made this video, Olayemi, because you added context I was unaware of (Bernie Goetz) and experience relatively few people have (being a public defender and activist). I'm also glad that the Majority Report covered this in the way that they did. Thank you for this video. RIP Jordan Neely... your society, city, state, country, and your fellow human beings failed you over and over and over again.

The real pity is how not a goddamn soul decided to intervine with Mr.Penny and help reorient his hold into a safer position for Mr. Neelys life while still detaining him because he appeared threatening. However, all of the facts and evidence that will be used in this trial will undoubtedly support Mr. Penny because of the eyewitness accounts and Mr. Penny claiming that he was in self defense, which he was (he just didnt have the courage to spare a life). I'm just horrified that Mr. Penny or anyone else didnt even try to talk to him first (please correct me if I'm wrong). THATS the tragedy here people are too quick to turn on their fellow man when they appear hostile in fear of thier own lives rather than trying to help even if they are unstable or appear dangerous (their are too many mindless sheep nowadays grazing on feed fed to them by electronic media). I also have been looking at other videos covering this situation and so many people are bringing up his criminal past even when it has nothing to do with the case, I have no idea why they would do that. I feel sick to my stomach about this whole situation bc at the end of the day, this is just going to polarize our country even more instead of bringing us together.",

So much apathy for the lower class and struggling, and its often from rich ass people online, or in government.",

Being a black person in America is scary. Once one of us does something wrong, it hurts our future and other black people around us who did nothing. I'm so glad you brought up that is deeply rooted in our institutions, policies, and even politics. Every time there's a black victim, people will do their best to look into your background to find dirt. It's disgusting, especially if said person was a victim of a racially motivated murder where their life doesn't even matter to the police.\n\nTo all my fellow black people and other minorities, I do hope you're able to find a community where you feel loved and accepted. It's hard to live, especially with racist people in office, but hopefully one day we can all live in peace without fear of being a victim of a hate crime. Rip to Jordan Neely 💜",
