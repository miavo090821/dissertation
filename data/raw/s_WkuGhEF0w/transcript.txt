at the end of the day and I hear this often from lack Le organizing we really are all we got seriously like it's not even a joke my experience of organizing organizing is about relationships and and holding contradictions if we're going to be the type of electorate that does not question the authority of our leadership are we suddenly going to develop that skill set once they're in office if you don't think that you're responsible for resisting the conditions of your oppression that is tragic to me where are people getting their uh political analysis cuz if it's the internet then we're we're going to [Applause] lose hi beautiful people welcome to a very special episode of Olay and friends because it's going to be Delany and friends in a minute Delaney Delany called me and said Olay can you please do an oay and friends on people organizing around pushing kamla on Gaza like we be please do that I will do it we'll organize it I said if you want to organize the episode and go get people on the r schedule then by all means Delaney I will do that so I'm gonna turn it over to Delan and I think a good place to start is before we were recording Derica asked a great a great question about like if you could kind of fill me in on the background on a lot of what's been happening online and like the discourse around what's going on I think maybe like tensions or perceive tensions online at least between pal Palestinians and black people around like uh black people being very excited a lot of black people being very excited about uh around kamla a lot of people obviously she is the VP to an Administration perceive tensions between like a lot of black people being obviously very excited about kamla Harris and a lot of people feeling she's the VP to an Administration that is now participating in aiding um a genocide I don't I think I think that's a fair way to to call it at this point um of of the Palestinian people and so I wanted to turn it over to yall y all go ahead Delena you got it give that background you're so funny um yeah I'm really happy everybody's here and thanks Olay um Derica asks a bit about what's happening online um and as someone who loves to be online I be watching um and what it looks like to me is that there's random people um who are talking about what's happening in palestin um but not in a way that's nuanced and helpful at all um and regarding kamla there's people that are like so excited about her they cannot critique her in a way without using misog or and they refuse to to correct that and then there's people on the other side that are being super misogynist and low-key antiblack um who are just saying really wild things about Kamala and and black people um but I think these are two extremes but it it's just like taking over the discourse around what's happening so I want to hear what y'all have to say we want to hear what y'all have to say like let's get into it what are we seeing anybody everybody no one mean I can start I I mean I have to say that we just have to be a little bit critical like this is what we're talking about elon's platform right and so him and his algorithm and his business model and all the other all these other platforms which aren't owned by us their business model they love conflict um they love wedges they love the messiness and we have to question whether or not that discourse serves us is is nuanced actually allows us to learn anything and I think it's important to take a step back when we see ourselves getting roped into the like one side or another binary fights that get kind of like you know that build on what this algorithm is designed to do which is like not Nuance which is not Base building which is not power building which is not necessarily any anything useful except for the attention economy so that's just like one piece of it this is a very online conversation that is very much the point of the attention economy which is to find wedges and to dust up those wedges right what's actually happening in communities in organizations in places where people are building bases is different like I'm not having that conversation inside the Working Families party I'm not having that conversation when I'm knocking on doors in North Philly right and so it's important for us to like appreciate what this thing is versus what's actually happening on the ground I just want to say that I'll I'll join um first of all thank you um Olay uh and delting for having me here I actually feel really honored just to be in this space with all of you and thank you for your voices and in this very you know um I don't even have a word to describe the kind of the moment that we're living in right now what we're witnessing I do want to say that there's my mom's my mom is a you know old Palestinian lady born in Palestine and she always says there's no smoke without fire and so I do want to say that some of these conversations don't come from nowhere and I think it is important for us to kind of just look it in the eye and say it's there and why is it there and of course there are going to be extremes on both sides and there's also going to be you know Ops and coint tell Pro because people there are only some who will benefit from divisions between our communities and what I'm witnessing because I'm also like Delany i' be trying to keep up I'm trying to see what's going on what's the conversation happening and also figuring out like what's the intervention here and as someone who is Palestinian but really people don't know me for that that's not that hasn't been my work for the last 24 years I I I'm not known to be like the leader of the Palestinian solidarity movement I actually come from racial Justice movement and actually come as a Palestinian from Black Liberation that is what I believe I believe in this idea of when black people are free around the world we will all be free and that has been my life's Mission I think what we're seeing as a a group of people who are experiencing trauma um right now we are we have to sometimes put things in context we as Palestinians are literally seeing our loved ones blown to Smither we're talking about sometimes our people we love are going to look for their dead family members and they give them a plastic bag and say how much does your family member weigh 30 kilos and they give them a bag of 30 kilos of body parts that may not be theirs so I want to put this in context that people are speaking from a place of hurt and Trauma and and knowing that this country that we live in that the United States government is aiding and abetting this genocide And when they see people like KLA Harris it ain't really about kamla Harris kamla Harris represents this current Administration she is the sitting Vice President of the United States of America and so people speak from that way now mind you we may not agree with the type of lexicon language whatever it is but it also is from a place of hurt and often times in movement and on the internet there's no Grace there's no saying to oneself where is this coming from where where what what what kind of hurt makes you say these things right and and and so that's one piece and then the other piece is that I also because I've been organizing in Black Le spaces for a long time I also see the horror that Donald Trump can come and inflict on our communities including black people so I I I'm in this in between space where I understand why Palestinians and those adjacent to them you know Arab Arabs like yemenis and Lebanese and others who are also experiencing this conflict in different ways are absolutely horrified by this sudden enthusiasm for a woman who is part of an Administration that literally has aided and eded a genocide for the last 10 plus months and so there is that so it's not for me it's not just you know um and I agree with Maurice there are going to people who are going to dust up the things that are already there absolutely for sure but I think we need to do to address that and I think there's this conversation that's on two sides one side is saying if you vote for kamla Harris you're not with me you you were never in solidarity with me and then black folks who are saying we we ain't a one issued people so we don't get us on your stuff like we also got to worry about our people so there's this two groups of people and then there are us in the middle who are actually sitting in the space where we understand why this group is outraged and horrified and Tra traumatized and we also understand the history that black people know in this country and what they're trying to do which is as they always do particularly black voters trying to save us us from ourselves and from a Donald Trump Administration so I find myself caught in the middle um but I want to also just bring my people's voice to the table when I watch these videos I I I don't see I see hurt I see people who don't know what else to do where else to turn and I think sometimes we we we the internet's the place where you could just put it all on the table in every way with no filter um no conversation and the advice I've had for people in our community is this don't argue with people who ain't your people in real life I mean you don't argue strangers if you got black friends folks that you have built with and you feel hurt go talk to them have a conversation with people you really know deep in those relationship but I'm not fighting with strangers on the internet and I mean that from the perspective if you don't know somebody personally in the comments move on my friends and I think that's the that's the danger of the internet it gets you into strangers and then now everybody is everybody who speaks on the internet now apparently is the whole all black people and the Palestinian who's speaking or the three Palestines or the 10 they're all the Palestinians Al together so it's it's it's a it's a very I I wouldn't say complicated I just say I just think that that there definitely needs to be an intervention and I appreciate this one being one of them yeah uh Jeremiah here uh you know I'm a local elected official in Minneapolis and I'm also going to be a delegate uh for the uncommitted campaign uh in DNC coming up here and these issues do get complicated and there isn't really any political Purity when you sort of get into the mud right and you're trying to have a solution I think some folks are saying well if we're not voting for KLA Harris what's the solution Donald Trump's not the solution so we're stuck in this binary we got to figure some of that out but when it comes to things like anti-blackness it's like look uh uh solidarity is not a fixed identity right it's a daily practice we've have to live solidarity if I'm going to experience anti black this from so from from from people on the internet to your point Linda uh what what does that matter when it comes to fighting on behalf of people who are experiencing genocide what does that matter when it comes to fighting on behalf of people who uh are being oppressed by some of the same systems that I'm oppressed by that my constituents are oppressed by uh I represent one of the only majority black uh Wards in the City of Minneapolis and so you know I've got to think about you know what what uh you know solidarity is a daytoday practice I get that the that the answers aren't easy um but yeah some of the discourse on line has just evolved into uh like really nasty rhetoric uh I'm seeing Palestinian folks being anti-black I'm seeing black folks be xenophobic and it it just it just kind of breaks your mind a little bit and I just got to remember like to your point uh you know both Maurice and Linda you know there are people that I know in real life that I'm accountable to I'm G to remain accountable to them uh and I'm going to make sure that uh that we're sort of sorting through the mud together developing some of these complicated answers together and not just sort of reducing these things into equal binary uh choices that that feel empty and that ultimately don't get us any any closer to Liberation yeah I can jump in I am learning so much so thank you to all of you who jumped in and to o and t Delaney for setting the stage I I I feel so I don't know if the word is old because old people be online but sometimes I just be like what is going on out there what is happening what who said what like I'll be trying to catch up and I'm grateful to Delaney and to Rachel for keeping me a breast of whatever is going on the new crisis or the new funny thing paying attention to and I remember right before actually going back to St Louis my hometown for the 10 year anniversary delay and rement I were talking some of the rhetoric and then what did I do you know I drove to Ferguson with my family with people who I was on the ground with 10 years ago and I don't know maybe a fifth of the people there had on cfas and I was just like oh this is interesting because I just got off the phone with Delaney and Rachel about all this infighting that's happening and I'm like where is it happening because I'm right here where Michael Brown's Body was on the ground for four hours august 19 years ago and it's you see hijabs you see C it's it's the irony of of so much of our movements being intertwined not only in the last 10 years but if you go two years before that and you you the person who's over uscpr aim R was founder of Dream Defenders and you see cfas at those early marches around Trayvon Martin and you go 10 years before then you have not 10 years 20 years before then who was just telling me this history Reverend doy about the national black united front when they you know were trying to organize for black Independence like outside of United States that would look like for different organizations and he said the only people who were at that table who don't have Independence right now are Palestinians and us you know but we've been in this fight for 30 something years together then before that so there's just such a long history and I'm just like damn thank God the Black Panthers ain't have Twitter because all of that solidarity what would have happened thank God inbu didn't have twiter it's like just over a hundred years of struggle you know Snick essentially being oued from a quote civil rights movement because of their positions in Palestinians it's just it's like so they were able to navigate these moments the people y'all putting on pictures with KLA Harris were able to navigate these moments and here we are in 2024 some people can send out some tweets and now the movement is falling apart it's embarrassing and it makes me very angry and I almost am in disbelief I'm just like wait y'all what are we talk are dying what what are we talking about right now like people are dying and y'all online tweeting about watermelon people like this is where we are so I can't like some part of me won't let myself get so worked up about it the frustrating part is that because something then happens online like Linda was saying doesn't mean that it's not real sometimes it magnifies like what a issue may be but what makes me nervous is that other people may think like oh is this real should I be feeling this way should I think twice before grabbing my C or my black PRI t-shirt should that is what makes me nervous and I think that reality speaks to the the where our social meds are right now that people are so eager to root for and defend a quote charismatic leader and that charismatic leader is a politician that speaks to the state of our social medas right now that people are mostly getting political education through tweets and being online and learning that way and they're not being pulled into an organizational home that is our responsib so it's that disconnection is what is frustrating me and the last thing I'll say because Linda I think spoke to this earlier around you know black people can't be more than like single voter things yeah like when I hear people say that I be like damn so y'all asking her for free health care y'all asking her to reverse her position on fracking y'all asking her to not cancel so I can see if a lot of the people who were coming at people who were calling for an arms embargo by disrupting rallies were being like no why you're yelling for an arms embargo yell for all these other Progressive issues too but they're not they're actually zero issue voters they're demanding zero demands there's there's no like here's an alternative agenda that we should be fighting it's like don't talk about palestin and we're not going to talk about anything El and we're just going to roof so it's like well if we're going to be multi-issue voter we have to have multi- isues that we're coming to the demands with right and the arms ofargo is a bare minimum it's like sis y'all should be stacking on demands too right like what you know so right now it's a zero some game so that is those conversations that be making me sweat and my hair is pressed and I don't like sweating when my hair is pressed and so it puts me in uncomfortable position of trying to figure out what Freedom looks like and that's why I gotta be off but that's sort of what I'm feeling right now and I grow really skeptical when when people present binary choices and purity test right because in in my experience of organizing like like Jeremiah you talked about being in the mud my experience of organizing organizing is about relationships and and holding contradictions right because none of the solutions that we're organizing for are easy or cookie cutter or you know could happen between now and election day so whenever I'm hearing about these binary tests like I'm I'm presenting for you a tactic that if you participate in then you're on the right side of history or not so for the folks who are like you need to be quiet you need to not talk about Palestinian rights so that we could defeat Trump that is a litmus test binary choice there's no space for people who are suggesting that that you cannot be part of the united front against Trump and also be be aligned with Palestinian rights again a binary choice and I reject that like we endorse comma Harris like one day the next day we're working with the not not another bomb campaign we're attempting and showing that you could do multiple things at once and that you could hold the contradictions and that these choices being elevated by people who you're not in relationship to don't need to be the center of your politics and I think it's important that we we hold that and yeah go ahead J goad no please I I was just going to say to the to we've gamified politics to the point that like sometimes folks are just like choosing their side like you know hey I'm I'm I'm going this direction because I'm on this team right uh and so if that's your politic yeah you it won't even occur to you to make a demand right Derica because you you you it's almost just like gang gang that's it I'm here and we're going forward uh where uh what Maurice is talking about is that like we people need to develop a politic I think you know uh I think that we've gotten a little bit away from from politicizing people you know uh I think I think uh you know there was the description of social media as just sort of this rage farm and I think that that certainly contributed to it uh and and when I first was running for office one I was told by mentors hey look you got to earn every vote that you get right no but like you're not owed this seat and even after you win the seat's not really yours right uh when you have that framework and you're working with that framework then a criticism is not an attack right but if it's but if it's just team this if it's team Jeremiah or or or team not Jeremiah then yeah a criticism all of a sudden is going to seem like an attack we should have we got to have we have to have shared values if we're really going to make demands I'm somebody who's hasn't endorsed kamla Harris don't know I'm going to you know a part of the uncommitted framework is that she can be pushed if we didn't think she could be pushed we wouldn't engage in this strategy we we'd just be telling people we'd be checked out of this uh of this electoral cycle so there's a hope that she can be pushed uh but at the same time yeah it's about making that demand seeing it all the way through um and uh they're going to call your bluff and and and you've got to be able to call theirs you're an elected official it's your job to represent me uh or not but if you don't don't then you can't expect my vote you certainly can't demand it uh and and I think that we need to go back to understanding politics in that way as opposed to sort of this gamified team X team y head-to-head matchup like it's NFL Sunday or something that's right and I'll just add to that uh Jeremiah because this is this is really the thing that you know been rubbing me the wrong way also on the Internet is that first of all kamla Harris isn't the first presidential candidate in history to be interrupted or to be disrupted at a rally so this idea is that this is some new tactic that the Palestinians came up with all of a sudden I mean this is a long history undocumented folks have done this before us black folks have done it before us um folks from climate justice has have done this before us so this is not like a new tactic and so that really Disturbed me and and you know My Philosophy is that if you're already popular without even saying anything you know why would you be better on fracking or why would you be better on any issue because you already popular you already a celebrity all of a sudden and people outside rooting for you and you have even even said anything the first time we heard anything from Kamala on anything platform was today where it was something around an uh you know some roll out of some economic policies in her first hundred days some of which are going to require Congress and so the the the push here is that we got to push her that's our job that's my job and it's also my responsibility and the responsibility of our people to push and use every tactic at our disposal and I'm sure this is the same for any Community but we're not monolithic just because we're all Palestinians don't mean we're all the same they are Palestinian Americans who don't believe in this political system they don't believe in this two-party system they don't believe in the electoral process this is before a genocide there are other palestinian-american organizers who've been do doing solidarity work for the last you know two three decades there are other people that organize in different issue areas different tactics the Civil Disobedience types the folks that are really doing just deep political education that's not yet connected to the political system and then there are some of us that are trying to do both political education deep Community organizing solidarity and use the Electoral process in the meantime to at least alleviate some harm or at least use it as a tactic to advocate for our communities on a multitude of issues so even within our Palestinian American communities even the Palestinian solidarity movements you have people across the Spectrum there are folks who are Palestinian who are conservative Muslims there are people who are progressives with amongst the palestinian-american community we're all kinds of people just like I'm sure we can say about black folks Latinos asian-americans we're not all the same and the so the thing that we have to be careful about is that when someone says something or when a group of people say something that it's everybody saying it and they all on the same page and they all got this together just like when I see black folks on the internet you know engaging in conversation that to me is more like patronizing like you wait over here we gonna go over here and get kamla together she's going to be the president yall just wait just a little bit because we're going to get her straight the thing that with that conversation is like we haven't really been able to do that with other presidents in the past so you're telling people to trust you that when we got Joe Biden into office cuz we wanted to defeat Trump he said George Floyd policing act they said uh child tax credits they told us uh immigration reform they told us all kinds of things voting rights we can't even expand voting rights in this country they're they're taking voting rights I got arrested six times under the Biden Administration specifically around voting rights and still two Democrats or at least one is no longer a Democrat but at the time were the people blocking the Democratic president from getting us things like voting rights so it's also this trust us and let's see and the thing is like it it's the burdens on you to prove to the people that we are going to take that tactic that you have or that position of we're going to trust and see don't worry we're going to get commala straight in January when she takes oath so I'm saying to people we gota we got to do both and and and my thing is like you lose nothing from saying I hear you um what is it that you want a arms embargo oh you just saying that you want them to stop sending weapons today that murder policy I'm with that because I know 99.99% of black people are like don't be going around killing people that ain't got nothing to do with nothing I know that that's the sentiment that nobody wants to see the these families being blown up every day okay hold on a second I'm with C I'm with kamla you know at that the response should be I'm with kamla but I could also ask you for ask be with you and ask for an arms embargo it's like why can't we just say can't you do both instead of alienating more voters bring the people to say look I got you back I've been out here saying ceasefire you y'all told me ceasefire I'm with the ceasefire y'all want arms embargo I'm still going to vote for Kamala because I don't want Donald Trump but I'm also going to say vote for kamla and kamalo we need an arms embargo and the last thing that I'll say too is this other piece of the conversation that I've been watching this whole thing about Donald Trump the last people anybody needs to lecture about Donald Trump is the Muslims we know quite clearly who Donald Trump Is Not only was Donald Trump the one that put the first executive order his first one not the second not the sixth the first was the Muslim band and he also is the man that moved the Israeli the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in one of the most controversial moves of any Administration Republican and Democrat this is a man that supports settlement this is a man who uh you know has relationships with folks in the government whose son-in-law has relationships with the Israeli government so nobody not got to lecture the Muslims and tell us well we GNA get Donald Trump then you just say it y'all just want Donald Trump no no no we're we're not going to trust me no one in our community is voting for Donald Trump and so that's the kind of tension that's happening that God forbid and we don't want this to happen God forbid Donald Trump becomes the president the answer cannot be oh the Arab Palestinian Muslim voters in Wisconsin and in uh you know Michigan and in Georgia they're the ones that gave us Donald Trump no no the politicians that didn't do what they they supposed to do and didn't earn those votes they are to blame not our community so so Kamala got time I think that there's a way for us to to to live in those two places of y'all want to vote for kamla because you think kamla is going to be better than Donald Trump Trump I generally think Donald Trump is the worst thing that could happen to this country but at the same time for God's sakes we got to stop sending these weapons 20.5 billion dollars were just sent the other day and then we saw a little school of a hundred people at morning prayer blown to smithin and I and I and I will say that for for us and I and you know you all are friends with so many palestinian-american organizers and I stay this with all humility like sometimes I'm in awe of myself that I can wake up in the morning that Palestinian American can get up every morning and we could organize and we could go outside and we could do the things that you see us do and start campaigns and fight for our people while we are witnessing a live stream genocide like this is what we watch every day I'm traumatized by sitting at the feet of mothers who lost their children to police violence and I at the same time I'm watching that times 10,000 happening daily and all we're asking for is just a little Grace yes our people are not going to always be articulate yes they're gonna say things from a place of anger but to your point Jeremiah does that matter because I'm still gonna fight for black folks I don't care what black folks got to say about the Palestinian you know store owners in their hood or what they got to say about the Arabs and whatnot I'm still gonna fight for black people and I just want people to say I'm still gonna fight for you because it's the right thing to do not because you're nice to me or because you and I agree on everything and I think that's where the discourse the the the the Ops is going right in there they see a little crack and they're putting themselves right in right in there and actually coming up as the as the uh second anniversary have an article that came out on the front page of the New York Times the reason why I'm sensitive about this is because I watched this movie before I watched it with the women's March the Russian government ran an operation out of St Petersburg not not no regular Russians the Russian government military division of the Russian government ran an operation against women's March they found some stuff online there was some smoke as my mom would say and they took it and they exasperated it dividing white women from white women white women from women of color and they created a big riff in the women's March why because they saw the the power and the potential that the women's March had at that time just like say they see the power and potential of black Palestinian solidarity in this moment where we have cracked uh the the the the the ceiling on Palestine and Palestinian Liberation in ways we have not seen in 50 years and they're saying oh no no we're not going to let that happen we're GNA put ourselves right in here and make that divide and I'm just telling my own people don't fall for it don't fall for it don't talk to strangers on the internet if you don't know them don't do it close the close your phone and go to go into your community go to your classmates at your college campus have those real conversations even ones that may be courageous and difficult have them but don't have them with people who you are not sure have your best interest at heart and that's what's happening we don't even know who these people are I don't know who they are and this and this is the conversation that we're watching unfold on the internet yeah and I think to your point about the New York Times article there was another one that just came out about Israel that's like funding and operation um to do exactly what you're saying about breaking down the relationships between black and Palestinians on the issue of or or about Palestine and what's happening it makes me think about um I went to North Carina anent I went to an HBCU but during that time when I was SJ president APAC was taking SJ presidents to Israel on these trips and they have relationships with HBCU Across the Nation and it's like the beginning for a lot of folks for their relationship and understanding to Israel and Palestine and that propaganda that starts so early is so destructive um and it it really just makes me think about to der's point where are people getting their uh political analysis how are people coming to assess this political moment because if it's the internet then we're we're going to lose um because we we don't have control over that thing and I think black black people in particular have to just be a little bit more critical um of black politicians of kamla Harris I think Linda what you were saying about um you know like why are people are just endorsing kamla without any demands without anything and I don't know if you didn't want to say it but a lot of the reason is because she's a black woman and it's just plainly like that that's where it stops for some folks I was having some conversations with my friends um who were like you know Delan I know you have a lot of critiques of Obama but I mean he's black he's black like what are you talking about and it's the same thing about kamla um and for some people that is where it ends it doesn't really matter what she does it it really doesn't just because she's a she's a black woman and will be the first um and I think that's a conversation we have to have about representation and how it can make us smile and maybe be a little excited but I think we have to demand more and just dig a little bit deeper into what it means for a black woman to be in charge of Empire and like what that really means it's really important that we have this conversation now because I guarantee you that in a world where she does win there will be people who will say that anybody offering any critiques anybody doing any advocacy anybody attempting to challenge Administration are out of order are like our are engaging are engaged in misogyny or engag in anti-blackness or like that will absolutely happen and we need to steal ourselves for that we need to prepare ourselves for that I'm glad you brought up Obama because that's instructive right a lot of folks were caught up in the in the Vibes and in the momentum and we're in a moment of Vibes and momentum right and then on the other side of the election his administration actually did a lot of work to dismantle the Electoral movement that brought him in right and two things right this momentum that he he developed the hope and change momentum wasn't a wasn't a movement for neoliberal economics but the Obama Administration basically created the conditions for Larry Summers and Timothy gner to advance a very neoliberal corporate economic agenda right right and so there's a world where people are caught up in the history making in the energy only for at the other side of the election for corporate actors and there's specific people right like there is a multi-billionaire who's giving $15 million to Independent projects for kamla Harris who's specifically asking to uh for kamla Harris to fired uh Lena Khan right Lena Khan at the FTC why because she is actually challenging some of the corporate agenda her her appointment is one of the I think one of the best things that Biden Harris Administration did right and so if we don't hold her accountable now we're not going to be in the habit of holding her accountable if she wins and the idea that like in some ways is very disrespectful for her you're telling me that she as a political actor was able to reach the highest Heights of of electoral politics but can't be held accountable can't be able to hold critique can't be able to handle people who are protesting her these are the basic things that elected officials are supposed to be able to do especially if they're asking to to hold the keys to the to the White House and you could absolutely be an apost saying yes there's a huge contrast between her and the Democrats and Maga and also say there are tons of things that we disagree with on with the Democrats and them you could actually do both of those things and I think it's important for there to be an independent political movement outside of the democratic party that's doing that otherwise we could only expect what we've gotten which is the Democrats bring us to the polls in order for us to prevent the worst thing from happening and then the corporate wing of the democratic party being the first second and third people when it comes to the agenda and so it's it's incumbent on us not to fall for that yeah I was I was going to say you know uh when when I first ran for office you know one of the things that I was told was you you you uh you govern how you ran right uh and not only do I think that that's true for elected officials I think that's true for electorates as well right and what that basically means is if you're the type of person that make compromises on the campaign trail that you're going to be the type of person that makes compromises in office if you're the type of person that uh lies on the campaign Trail you're going to be the type of person that lies in office that's that's basically what what that means if we're going to be the type of electorate that does not question the authority of our leadership while they're running are we suddenly going to develop that skill set once they're in office I I don't think so right and uh you know when it comes to sort of this this identity politic uh you know I have a mentor who calls it identity instead of politics uh uh because there's actually not a real politic to it is um is I remember when I first got elected you know I was I was 27 turned in 28 and we had a black police chief and uh in here in Minneapolis and you know good guy uh but you know I have always had criticisms of how uh uh MPD has has functioned in Minneapolis and I remember when uh a couple of months in the into my first year in office and there was like this article ran about how uh the the the first black Chief was facing all this criticism and how racist that was right how it was a it was a feature of racism uh that uh that he is receiving this critique then they go and you look at who's critiquing him and it's me and like two other of my black colleagues and I'm like okay well who's black then like right like who's really black in this equation because because when it comes to defending the person who's upholding the status quo their Blackness gets to be maintained and prioritized and the accusation of racism is then leveled at anybody critiquing them if it's a black person who's trying to push maybe a more leftist agenda doesn't really fit the status quo their Blackness is erased you know you're not going to name them they're a little bit you know nebulous and so now all of a sudden the critique is hard to stick right I I I agree that this is this is this isn't something that we can fall for as an electorate right no matter what the the no matter what our identity is and so uh you know I I I I agree and I I just I definitely feel like it is uh we cannot give up on the idea that they can be pushed and we've seen evidence that kamla can be pushed right we've seen her go even before she was the uh presumptive nominee she had she was the first uh uh uh elected at that high of a level to even mention ceasefire right to even just say the word out loud right um I've seen people sort of scoff at the idea of an arms embargo and yeah sure an arms embargo is going to be a wild idea when it first gets mentioned but as it gets mentioned more and more as more people talk about it as the case for it gets made uh then all of a sudden it's a lot less of a ridiculous idea it's a lot less of sort of pipe dream and and so I think that's the stage that we're in and I don't think that we I if if if she's going to do something less than that let her negotiate with the people who want to vote for her we can't sit here and negotiate with ourselves and compromise with ourselves without that level of Engagement that's that's can I I know I'm not talking I just want to for the people who um don't know can y'all explain what the demands are like what an arms embargo is so the people I know are going to be listening like what like they've only heard ceasefire and like explain the uncommitted movement to the people listening can I respond to Jeremiah's point right before you do that explanation because I wanted say something that's very important that I don't care if if she can be pushed that's not the way that I approach politics in that sense I really appreciate people like Derek bell all the way to my Grandmama who say if you up against a bully you protect yourself and you resist and you fight it don't give a damn if you going to win so that is how I approach like life it's like you have the right to tell people who are sending bombs to not send bombs whether or not that they can be pushed it's in our own strategic interest and we shouldn't undermine our own strategic interest based on that particular person and so I think that's very important what I feel us getting trapped is in the alternative game and it seems like for people who have endorsed who have endorsed her already who are thinking about what do I do it's like well your options are to push her with demands or to push her without Demand right those are your options for people who already decided to push but I do think it's important that people resist anyway so much of our freedom fighting tradition teaches us that people fought and they didn't know they was G to Be Free People organized anyway people ran away from plantations anyway people have done so much stuff without knowing the particular out other other what builds our movements is asking what is required of us right what is required of each and every one of us who cares about freedom and Justice and I believe that it is our duty to resist not even to win I disagree with assada and I disagree with Marx I I I think it's important that we win but we can't if people are going to be dissuaded from fighting from winning then it's our duty to fight and it's our duty to resist and so that I want to say I think is sometimes I find people getting caught up in whether she as an end up her you need to fight like hell because people are dying and people in your hood are dying and they're dying slowly this woman early today I went to the library she said excuse me I know I don't know you very well but is it is it possible for you to be a witness on my new health care application because I have to remove Part B and this used to be free but now that part B is a part of Medicaid I have to pay $100 $35 a month and I can't afford it right that woman is dying slowly right that woman is dying slowly and so if you don't think that it's incumbent or you're responsible for resisting the the the conditions of your oppression and that is tragic to me that is absolutely tragic to me and so I I have heard that theme and that's another thing that gets me sweating and I told yall I don't like sweating when it's hot and my hair is straight so it's it's it's a you know I miss my locks because then I could just sweat and I could just argue but I have way less time to do that right now but I think it's important for everyone who believes in Freedom and Justice tough fight to resist to organized to strategize and it's it makes me so angry what Jeremiah just listen it's not up to us to negotiate like how less demanding that we are going to be against people who signed up for that kind of work right and the last thing I'll say is that there's a book I've been studying this summer Delan um called the dialectic of legal repression and this was written maybe 30 40 years ago what he says then is that our movements left movements people who are consider themselves Progressive we don't have a good theory of repression under liberalism right we have theories of repression under fascism but we have not quite worked out what repression and policing all these things look like under liberalism and again looking at 2024 I think to delany's point around and to Maurice's Point around look at what happens with people of color getting leadership we need work theories of repression and how repression only doesn't just come from the state it also comes from internal policing of movements from people online these soft cultural ways that people undermine how we agitate how we resist so in addition to like just thinking about voting we need new strategies and new ways to organize when liberals are just behaving in a way that creates a condition for fascism to rise because in four more years there's going to be another fascist candidate and what's what's going to what's going to happen then like oh don't talk about that because we got to get another Democrat in four more years another fascist candidate so if we don't have working theories and strategies around how to organize under liberalism we're going to continue to be undermined long term I I think the frustration that I I would love for all all any anybody to speak to that some people have have is that they feel that they are resisting they think they are they are a part of how they are resisting is to is to vote even if or to vote for kamla versus uh Donald Trump and I think the frustration some people feel is like a lot of what you see and I think there is a big difference between online and in real life and what's actually happening with organizers in the ground and Nuance but the problem is we live in a very virtual world where people's perception and what happens and whatever it is gets framed by online and what people see is especially in the it's always a conflation of both sides both sides are the same and it's never it feels like there isn't a respect for the work or the or the or the um I guess the intentions of people who feel like they're still participating in the system or who are holding the contradictions and they and in in the conflation that happens people feel like I guess we will want to focus on we need to resist and resisting and fighting means make we make sure we fight kamalar we make sure we fight we fight the Democrats and we make sure we fight them and we're talking about and we want to and it is important that to to draw attention to what the problems are with liberalism and how that gets us to Fascism I think the problem people have is that when they want to talk about what they know to be outright fascism or they want to talk about what is the real life threat of Donald Trump or the Republicans or anything there is so much they are dismissed like they're they're dismissed like they're just being dramatic they're just being fair Monger they're fair mongering and all of this they're dismissed in favor of play of of of harping on the problem with the Democrats and it's really hard for people who feel like you're dismissing what they know to be outright fascism but you want them to see the major evil and liberalism but you're dismissing the the fascism that they can identify so I think that is something that people are experiencing and when they experience that that frustration disenchants them and makes them pull out and say you know what it I don't even want to hear it you know what I mean um so back to y'all I swear to God it's my only contribution I'm out no please keep contributing I just want to say that I think that what you're what you're talking about that's the work of organizers and organizations like is to have conversations with people about fascism is explaining the uncommitted campaign like it's the work of organizers to do that everyday people that haven't committed their lives to organizing people are not just going to have all of this language and Analysis all the time like it's just not it's not going to happen because they didn't decide to commit their lives to organizing communities and that's okay not everybody has to do that and I think my frustration one I F I have fell victim to to being one of those people that's like yo you're going to vote for kamla like immediately like that was my first thought is being like damn the cop um but then after like sitting and thinking and talking like you like take a deep breath and you move forward and have better conversations so I've definitely like felt victim to some of the conversations online you know you can get a little hype um and just start saying stuff then L to your though really quickly and I think this speaks to old lady point is that the other people the other reason why that's happening why people think I am a part of resistance is because move electoral politics politician strategist also use movement language and so when I'm trying to watch YouTube and watch you know Dave Graver talk about thatt I'm getting you know her on camera saying what join the movement we have 100,000 Grassroots people ready so then they co-opting movement language and politics and strategy and words where now and they have more money than we do they have the New York Post they have the New York Times They have so like the infrastructure that's so we have to fight being co-opted by electoral politics who it's comfortable enough to start saying we like fascism but we'll also then say they're capitalist to the world so I think that you're right and which I think speaks to what I was trying to say earlier we need to have a broader working theory of repression under the liberal State whereas people feel like I'm a part of the resistance if I like share subscribe donate that's what people think that how they are part of a movement I like I share I subscribe I donate I watch content this is how people think they're a part of the movement and so it's like we're constantly finding that culture along time trying to build mass political vehicles for people to opt into and that shit's hard that is hard sorry Mar oh no about how people say like Kamala even and other people that are in criminal justice system using words like reimagine let's reimagine policing like let's let's use transformative justice but whole time it's just like you go home and wear an ankle monitor instead of like being locked up in prison like but that isn't transformative and it's also you aren't reimagining um so there's I agree with the language thing but I do also want to uplift Jeremiah cuz um Olay you asked a question about uncommitted and what that is so I want to make space for that yeah I I'll try to give a quick uh description but man the conversation is really important and uh yeah Derica Olay you guys have been thinking about almost like this philosophical question of like what is the state of organizing right now because I know that the the the in in Minneapolis we have all these talented people who myself included used to be on the ground used to be doing that Grassroots organizing used to be going doing like week-long trainings and coming back with all the you know the Alinsky style you know agitation all that stuff that infrastructure really doesn't exist anymore and I think that as a result you know there's not a new you know old organizers get burnt out or get jobs or get or start or any number of things happen um and uh and then that and then that that bench isn't created so um you know maybe that's oversimplifying it but that's a little bit of of what I've been seeing here in Minneapolis to uncommitted um you know uncommitted is a is a is a Democratic party strategy it's an intraparty strategy to try to move the presumptive nominee uh in this case kamla Harris uh and Tim and Governor Tim Walls uh when it comes to uh foreign policy specifically policy uh our policies in Gaza and Palestine and uh and I'm specific about that because uncommitted you know is it is it is a it is a part of the delegate process it is a part of the uh the the endorsement process and I think some folks can maybe get a little bit like like confused about that aspect of it um and so we're going to the DNC right we're delegates we this we're delegates we're signed up to be delegates the same way that somebody who's maybe a delegate for Kamala is going to be uh going to DC which means that you really quick so yeah please what for for everyone watching what's a delegate so a delegate is a person who uh is essentially like a like a like a like a petty elected official IAL I don't know how better to describe it right somebody who is selected by their neighborhood to uh to go to the Democratic National Convention and and cast a vote on behalf of their neighborhood right uh within the party not you know not in the general election within the party and so we're delegates uh who are representing folks who voted uh uncommitted in the primary um and the way that it works uh is uh is is that at the DNC uh kamla and and Tim Walls and and others you know you're doing a lot of things creating the party's rules etc etc but you're also meeting with the candidates um and the candidates goal is to try to get unanimous consent from their base right we're a part of their base and they don't have uh our consent they don't have our support yet and so a part of this strategy it is it is an inside strategy that says we're going to we're going to leverage our support right the hope is that we can come out of D the DNC excited to knock doors excited to make phone calls right the the folks who are a part of committed are the type of folks who do that kind of thing right in a general election uh we're not just here representing our own vote we're we're here representing communities we're here also uh with a lot of volunteer capacity uh that we want to put into a a presumptive candidate but that we can't we can't channel that excitement at the expense of lives being being uh uh devastated in Gaza and we can't we can't offer our support at the at the however much we might want to however much we might want to defeat Trump we can't offer our support at the expense of Life airing policy uh and so we're demanding that the that the party include us right represent us uh on uh as we get ready to uh go into November and so the dnc's this is this next week we're going to be there we're going to be meeting with other delegates we're going to be meeting with uh who who are in favor of kamla Harris uh we're gonna hopefully um be meeting with the with uh kamla and Tim themselves uh or at least their representatives of their campaign uh to explain what the demands are and the demands are uh you know you've heard some of them I I I should have had them pulled up in front of me I wasn't a little unprepared but the demands are around a ceasefire they're around an arms embargo that means that uh that that we're going to withhold sending weapons while we're seeing uh uh know International violations while we're seeing um you know human rights violations occurring there um and you're seeing uh the idea of an arms embargo catch on a little bit even as recently as I've seen uh uh uh you know a recent letter that said Nancy Pelosi is in favor of of arms embargo at least temporarily and so you know this is an idea that I don't think is far-fetched uh it's a strategy that it gets right at the the interest of the candidate which is again to have unanimous concept from the party coming out of the convention so um that's what the that's what uncommitted is that's what we're trying to do um and uh and I think that the culmination of that work is is uh coming up and hopefully gets executed in this next week yeah I want to I think that was excellent I think um for people that are watching one thing one thing that der mentioned around like what people think movement and organizing is versus like an electoral strategy or politics what y'all are doing is doing politics like we're not just allowing politics to happen to us we are doing politics which is what folks need to be doing if they feel like that's their role and how they want to change things yeah absolutely go ahead and there's a role there's you know there's going to be there's going to be a role for people who like are outside of uncommitted who are probably going to protest going to disrupt and do some of those things uncommitted is is not in position or in competition with any of those strategies but it's and and I want to you know say that there has been a uh there's been a a label of ceasefire delegate that has sort of formed and these are folks that include not only uncommitted but folks who have already committed to comma who are saying you know what I agree with your platform we will join you in solidarity in making this demand so that it's not just uncommitted standing on its own but it's also folks who have already committed uh leveraging there you know leveraging that demand as well uh and so yeah but it is it's doing politics that's exactly right you know and and you know a a ceasefire that's a majoritarian position that's a popular position right and so I feel like we would be remiss if we didn't remind everybody that it is very very popular inside of the democratic party it's very popular in general Israel has isolated itself from almost everybody in the world right and so advocating for a ceasefire is one of the most popular position outside of outside of Washington DC not just Washington DC like Capitol Hill and then the demand of an arms embargo in some ways that's just the United States honoring its its law like it's within the law for the United States not to be arming a farri authoritarian um government that is inflicting clear human rights violations like that's within us law to be like nope we can't do that so this isn't even outside of the scope of current US policy nor the outside of the realm of what they have the capacity to do so sometimes when they frame these positions as being out sometime somehow out of mainstream or impossible that's gaslighting right these are very mainstream demands and they're very possible and inside the Democratic party there is a tremendous amount of of uh almost like it's not complete it's not but it's a majoritarian position and and that goes for you know this is a conversation about the fact that there's like some tensions between some folks some black folks online and some Palestinian folks all of the polling I've seen have shown that black folks tend to be more aligned with palestinia rights than the majority of Americans in general so it's like I don't want these folks to Gaslight us into thinking that these aren't majoritarian phans that there aren't tons of black folks like my parents who had to stop watching the news because they couldn't deal with watching the devastation in Gaza and were heartbroken right like that is where a lot of our folks are at this idea that there's this Rift there you know like Linda I appreciate the fact that you said where there's smoke there's fire there's some real I think Nuance conversations that we need to have and it's true that there's anti-blackness in all communities and there true that there's xenophobia and islamophobia in all communities and we and we should not turn a blind eye to those things but we also shouldn't be gaset into assuming that that is the fulcrum of what's happening everywhere yeah and the other thing I want to say is like I mean so many things I want to respond to but like foreign actors as well as like right-wing actors in our midst they love to look at the smoke and they love to figure out what these divisions are because the rightwing globally benefit from when our people aren't in solidarity and so that whenever there's division the rightwing could benefit from that and whenever there's solidarity our movements tend to benefit from solidarity tend to benefit from people across difference choosing to see one another and so we should always be skeptical of Whenever there are um activities that are preying upon those that smoke praying upon those wedges and we should always look to the people who are bridging those wedges right not not turning a blind eye to them but choosing to bridge when it's hard absolutely and and I'll and I'll say I appreciate that um Maurice and also what you said Jeremiah and Delaney that we're doing politics we're doing to the politics versus the politics doing to us and the thing that I'll caution people and I hope people take from our conversation here because I think this is an actually incredible intervention in this moment and I think a lot of people from all of our communities are going to appreciate this conversation I hope they listen deeply and reflect on what has been said uh here is that we move from this conversation understanding that we also don't just organize in this four-year cycle that that our that our lives are not to be organized around during an election season and and the our ticket to Liberation does not come from the American electoral system I think the reason why a lot of us still organize in this framework is because it is an alleviation of harm um it is we think think about things from the perspective of can we just maintain the little that we have right can we get a little little bit more for our communities and you know we are the first generation in American history uh that has less rights than our parents did um when we look at the reversal of things like affirmative action of Reproductive Rights and others we literally are like I have my daughters have less rights than I and my mom and those before us had um and so I think those are the things that kind of keep me up at night to understanding that I'm not going to get free from the American electoral system but I also know there's a system that's currently in place right now that I'm trying to work within as I'm trying to organize an alternative and one critique I have of a lot of folks online some you know from many different communities around this idea of you know third party and I'm all about third fourth fifth I wait I can't wait till the day we have 10 parties that we have real people in our community that we could really be excited about that are aligned with our values and we have this multi-party system the question people have to challenge themselves is are you do you just wake up every four years and say I'm so outraged I'm going to vote third party but then do nothing for the third party you're voting for within the four years till the next time we get to the four years if this idea is that we want to build a multi-party system in this country you got to work for it you got to get signatures you got to go outside in the community you got to do the work and I think that's the thing I tell people all the time this is democracy and I'm not going to tell people not to vote third party or write do wrin do do you I live in New York I can vote for whoever I want to New York New York's not a state that anybody is going to be like the president the presidential seat does not go through New York it does not go through California and many other states and so I I want to be in a moment where our movements get into building real true power on the on the ground the real Grassroots not the 100,000 Grassroots supporters that Derica was talking about the people on the the content creators I'm talking about the real people in our community going back to the door knocking knowing our neighbors being able to do that I tell people all the time I remember I I was on um a college campus many years ago um where a lot of young Muslims were really scared on under Donald Trump and they said what if Donald Trump rounds us up like what if something happens to us like who's going to help us who's going to be outside for us and I you know me I'm on the stage and I'm confident I said what are you talking about we got solidarity people going and come outside you don't got to worry about that and then this one kid got up and he said look remember they did that to the Japanese they came to the homes of Japanese Americans in this country they took them when their children as young as you know former Congress Monda was four years old when he was taken to a concentration camp on this us soil and so there are people that are afraid of things that could happen we live in a country where we know that there has been and continues to be different forms of Jim Crow and segregation and and and we've done uh extermination of indigenous people we've done all kinds of things to in this to people that live in this country and also to people abroad and people that are related to us in Iraq we killed a million Iraqis like there are Horrors that we've inflicted in Vietnam common in so many places in South America and Central America so so my point is to say that we got a lot of work to do and my work doesn't start with kamla Harris and it doesn't end with kamla Harris uh these these moments these presidential elections are just it's just a it's just another path that people go on but you got to all be also organizing so so our challenge to everybody who's debating people they don't know on the internet stop for a second and ask yourself what are you doing what did you do today and I don't want to say this to to blanket uh you know describe everybody but there were some people on the internet that were talking and I said let me go look in this van situation because what a lot of people don't know is voter records are public information I know if you went to the polls before I know if you voted before I know what election you voted in when you voted last I don't know who you voted for but a lot of the people who keep telling us this system ain't it that system ain't it you don't even participate in it and you spending the most time talking about something that you don't parti in so you go on ahead and organize in the way you do I respect you and to Jeremiah's point and I love this point I think we want to say this here so for people who are listening who might be critics of us Jeremiah said we I'm part of uncommitted and I'm going on the part of an inside strategy but it is not going to be in competition to the march on DNC and the folks that will be outside who will be organizing because also it's not the first time that their people have organized rallies outside the DNC I was there in 2016 in Philly when people did the same thing over there and so so I I I I think that we just we this this Nuance is lost and it gets lost on the internet because we're we're speaking in sound bit but at the end of the day and I hear this often from black Le organizing look we really like we really are all we got seriously like it's not even a joke my friends like we really us and our friends and our neighbors we are all we got at the end of the day something goes down in this country the people that are going to protect me are going to be my friends and my neighbors and the people that I love and in the meantime how can we also respect the roles that everybody plays I get called a hero a warrior and a sellout all in the same day like I look I'm just like y'all got to make up your mind am I am I am I am I a hero am I uh you know a warrior in the movement or am I a sellout and so and then the next day the the one that called me a hero the next day was like wait a minute actually today you're a sellout and then the next day they're like n my bad I get what you're saying now you're not that so I just want us also to be courageous that we're going to be disliked we're going to sometimes say things that people in are even amongst the people that we are not going to agree with and guess what that's okay with me I'm okay with that and so also for a lot of young people on the internet I'll say this you don't got to go along with everybody not because somebody else is saying something you want to join the conversation join it if you believe it but not because it's a trend or because you're seeing this conversation on the internet all of a sudden you feel like you got to add your two cents and then TW 20 years later we find out that the conversation wasn't even that level of a real conversation for you to have contributed to it in the first place and so in the meantime if you find yourself in a conversation where you're about to not be friends with somebody on the Internet or you about to block somebody ask yourself quickly like you should be that should be red flag that something is not right that's happening on the internet right now and so I think we're gonna we're going to get through this I I I will say that for us as organizers to your point Delaney movement organizations and leaders we're good we know that that's not who we are we know that that that what's being reflected on the internet is not actual real life amongst movement leaders and organiz ations because we've been together outside we know each other we know we could pick up the phone and call each other when we need something and once people start developing those kinds of relationship we wouldn't even have to worry about with the internet um and I think this is just a a lesson this moments like these for me our a lesson and I hope people are learning from it because if we don't learn from this we're putting ourselves in serious danger and going to take us back many decades and and as a Palestinian I will say this a decade ago people used to hear me say I'm might I might not be around when palestine's free I used to say that and I say but I'm going to still do what I can and plant those seats today but for the first time and my parents my father was born in 1948 my mom was born in 1959 so my mom experienced the 1967 war my father was a baby when um he was like six months old when the 1948 Nea happened and when I hear my parents say we might see a free Palestine people who thought they wouldn't live to see that day even though our grandparents are not around but our parents believe all of a sudden during this horrific genocide imagine through all the trauma they're looking at me like yo we might there might be Freedom we these pales our people are gonna be free and I say to people take that hold that and the reason why our parents believe that we're going to be free is because of the work that's happening we're saying things about Palestine that we have never been able to say before the the critique of Zionism has never been to the point where people are mainstreaming these things in ways that we've never heard before so so our I want people to take this from here that our Palestinian parents they feel hope amidst Bloodshed the people of Gaza this is not in vain my friends I want people to know through the horror the people of Gaza they believe in Freedom and this is why they are still here this is why they say thank God whatever happens happens even if I have to die in the plight of that our we lose our children in the plight of Liberation that's okay because our children are going to see Liberation and that's the one thing that moves me and keeps me going and I hope that what moves people on the internet to leave those conversations and and and and as they say wake up in the morning that song that says I woke up this morning with my mind on freedom that's what I need people to do just keep keep your mind on the on that we are fighting for our freedom all of us not just for Palestinians but all of us that's real rap bars Linda I'm sorry that's all I had to say that was good that was really good I just wanna before I feel like we should wrap soon but I wanted to bring up um this moment at a a dear Gaza event in Harlem um it's a a cultural organizing event it's a letter writing event uh dear Gaza love note what is it love notes on black and pales Palestinian solidarity that's right right okay yeah um something that Derica and Clarissa Brooks now for myself and some other folks put together um where we bring people together to break bread have conversations get a little politicized but mostly just like be in conversation and connection with each other and in Harlem there was this group there's like three girls that had come from Philly they were just like randomly in New York they saw the flyer online they was like all right whatever like free Palestine I guess we'll pull up whatever um and we're sitting at the table with them um and there were some Palestinian Folks at the table these are three black girls from Philly just talking talking talking um they before October 7th had had no no assessment or understanding or had even been thinking about Palestine um which is sad but also it's a fact of the matter a lot of people this is the first time that they're they're even they know about what's happening over there and um we were sitting there at the table and we were having conversations about Ferguson um and about organizers and somebody drew the connection between um what was happening on on the ground in Ferguson and the um pepper spray the milk of magnesia and how Palestinian folks were the people that gave black folks the tools to clean their faces and clean their eyes and that happened you know online and then led to folks going to Palestine um and having like a really cool cultural exchange but this was from a flyer these three black girls from Philly who had never to their knowledge met Palestinians in their life and they had this beautiful conversation there were tears there was connection and then everybody wrote letters to Gaza um it these are the moments that we need to have these are the spaces that we need to curate for people to be in conversation and connection and learn from each other and learn the shared struggle and principles and histories of our connections the internet like I said isn't going to cut it but the real life conversation where you can look at somebody you can touch their hands where you can hold their hands and hug them that's what I think organizers need to be trying to build out are those moments and Mark lont Hill needs to hurry up with that documentary he's been doing for like God knows three years now because he has a whole documentary about black Palestinians I don't know if people have actually watched the videos out of Gaza even some of the horrific ones there are black people in Gaza they look like black people from North Philly they look like black people from Brown like you know Brownsville New York there are there is a significant black Palestinian Community there so this this idea also that you know with the folks trying to divide our communities that it's blacks and the Palestinians but there's also an intersection there there are there's a there's an identity that actually overlaps in that and so I hope that uh one day soon Mark Lamont Hill is going to finish that documentary um so that we could have that in our political education toolbox yeah yeah oh this was wonderful look Delany are you proud of Delany and friends no this is Delany everybody everybody in comments please give your thank you to Delaney because Delaney
