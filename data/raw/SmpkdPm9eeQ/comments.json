The Chinese spread to Korea via similar efforts. The Cubans pread to Angola. The Soviets spread it Eastern Europe and China ect. \n\nIt's not a theory, but an observation of reality. The Soviet Communist empire believed in world proletariat revolution, due to Marxist doctrine.

        "text": "@mookosh\n1. I brought up the fact that life sucked before the Soviets stepped in because from what I can see of the subject, the terrible living conditions of the people in the Soviet Union were the results of the conditions that preexisted the Soviets. Russia didn't have a massive string of colonies to subsidize their rise the same way Western Europe did and didn't have oceans separating it from geopolitical rivals like the United States did. Whilst a significant part of what the Soviet Union did to its own people was objectively awful, the material conditions of poverty and the lack of resources was a problem that the Soviets inherited and not a problem that could just be blamed on poor management. Without the resources to grow and without colonies to exploit, the options for economic growth in the Soviet union were limited.\r\n\n2. I am left wing and I do favor democracy over autocracy, but I do not think that the persecution of the minorities of western China are caused by China simply being autocratic. The cultural genocide of the Uygher people can best be compared, once we remove the unfounded fabrication about the mainland government butchering the minorities in the millions to harvest their organs, to the campaign of cultural erasure practiced in democratic nations like the United States and Canada against native Americans during the era of Native American boarding schools. The ruling Chinese party is ultimately required to achieve prosperity in the eyes of the Chinese public to guarantee their monopoly of power, and the immoral policies of cultural erasure are in service of that. China pursues these policies to guarantee stability and achieve cultural uniformity internally, and therefore a democratic China is all but guaranteed to pursue these same immoral policies against the Uyghr people without the need of an autocracy. I think that the Chinese majority are more than apathetic enough towards racial minorities that they would mostly ignore the persecution of Uyghr people for the sake of stability and prosperity, even if China turned into a liberal democracy tomorrow.\n\nI do not like hypernationalism or even nationalism either, but I am not making evaluations based upon ideology. I am looking at the track record of how the US has behaved in the past and how China has behaved in the past and evaluate that China is the less harmful of the two global powers. Honestly, there's a lot I can gripe about like how I don't think it's valid to draw equivalence between the very real cultural erasure that is going on in the Uyghur region and the Hong Kong protest over an extradition bill that the Hong Kong government itself literally proposed and how I don't think Poland, of all countries, would be better than either the US or China, but I think those points are ultimately distracting. Looking at the past and the present, I can see that the US HAS perpetuated wars aboard, caused the deaths of innocents in the countries they recklessly invade and occupy, and prop up dictatorial regimes that help them secure their geopolitical ambitions. Of these three points, China is guilty of the last and MAYBE the second with their potential invasion of Taiwan. For those people who have to survive in China, especially for a certain intersection of religious and ethnic identities, the condition is worse than those who have to survive in the US as present. From an international perspective, however, China is just a far smaller danger and destructive element than the US historically. On the international stage, I just don't see what China COULD do as a global hegemon that would make it as bad as the US.\n\nAnd honestly, a China hegemony isn't desirable for me either. My favorite option would be the conglomeration of the world's people into an overarching true democratic state where grievances can be addressed on a global scale. My second option, since my ideal seems very far off, is a multipolar world. I think China, for the Chinese people within the country, is a bad regime. That said, their rise as a geopolitical block has been a net good for the world. Many African nations have managed to grow significantly and improve the material conditions of their people because China offers them an option beyond needing to kiss up to the western block for money and investments, forcing European nations that had previously adopted blatantly exploitative neocolonial policies like France to have to offer better deals least they be forced out of the African continent by Chinese influence. It is good, for Africa, to have more than one global power to turn to. It's good that China and the west has to compete for the attention of African countries. China is, in general, a driver for renewable technologies needed to combat climate change (even though they DO still sell the excess coal from their coal downsizing to be burned in other countries). Though they did extensively, and often needlessly, subvert the rights of their people to do it, the Chinese government has also delivered massive increases to the standards of living of the people in China without needing to loot the global south for their ascent like European countries had done. The rise of China has done tangible good for the world.\n\nUltimately, I think arguing about the merits of the Chinese system and the management of their internal affairs is a pointless discussion because I think I agree with you. Their system is one that causes religious and ethnic minorities to suffer and they also perpetuate an invasion of privacy and subversion of political and social autonomy that, although not unique, is certainly worth criticizing. I do not think that China would make a less bad global hegemon than the US due to the irrational hatred of the US system. China doesn't recklessly invade countries halfway across the world. China doesn't constantly and persistently interfere with elections in other countries to the degree that the US does. If China becomes a global hegemon and starts doing these things, they will only be AS bad as the US is. Not worse. I will, obviously, be affected by my personal biases and life experiences and all that. The thing is that, with as close to a sober analysis of the past actions of both countries, it's apparent to me that China is the less disruptive, less destructive, and less murderous regime internationally. Not good, just less bad.",

I really don't want to get bogged down in soviet apologetics. The only point I'll make here is that it is a total misunderstanding of history to think the West won the cold war because of colonialism. The more accurate statement could be that the West won because it had been industralized for longer and primarily because America was almost entirely untouched by both WW1 and WW2. Colonization didn't really profit most of Europe (be it because most of Europe lacked colonies or because the cost of creating and maintaining colonies outstripped any economic utility they provided). It just seems odd for you to put so much emphasis on the importance of colonies in winning the cold war... when the cold war marked the decolonization of the western world... Also you could argue that Russia had colonized every soviet satellite state it puppeted, often to their serious detriment *cough* ukraine *cough cough*.\n\n2. This brings us to the meat and potatoes... \n\n\"The cultural genocide of the Uygher people can best be compared,... to the campaign of cultural erasure practiced in democratic nations like the United States and Canada against native Americans ...\" - We are ashamed of that and did it a century ago. China has no shame and is doing it right now. I think that's really bad. \n\n\" China pursues these policies to guarantee stability and achieve cultural uniformity internally, and therefore a democratic China is all but guaranteed to pursue these same immoral policies\" - This means China would be evil even if democratic... which just makes me sad. did you intend to say that?\n\n\" I am looking at the track record of how the US has behaved in the past and how China has behaved in the past and evaluate that China is the less harmful of the two global powers\" - China has only been a global superpower for a decade. This kind of comparison is like trying to compare the track record of a politician who has never served a single term to one who has been in politics for decades. Obviously the politician who has served more terms is going to have more dirt... \n\n\"he Hong Kong protest over an extradition bill that the Hong Kong government itself literally proposed\" - you mean the government that is hand selected by the CCP? Again, you are left wing, right? This is transparent government corruption.\n\n\"and how I don't think Poland, of all countries, would be better than either the US or China\" - I wasn't making a serious statement there, just illustrating my point about how being concerned about China isn't endorsing the US.\n\n\"On the international stage, I just don't see what China COULD do as a global hegemon that would make it as bad as the US\" - see: The Soviet Union except this time with a stronger economy and a population of 1.4 billion. Also China is damming up every river going into india, so it can puppet another country with 1.4 billion citizens. Do you really not see what a rising China threatens to do to global culture? It won't make the world more left wing, I'll tell you that...\n\n\"And honestly, a China hegemony isn't desirable for me either. My favorite option would be the conglomeration of the world's people into an overarching true democratic state where grievances can be addressed on a global scale.\" - Then you shouldn't have written several paragraphs defending the worst abuses the CCP has committed. I think that's a nice idea... but the world rarely exists without hegemons. You may have 2 or 3 hegemons, but power tends to consolidate then dissipate then consolidate in new hands.

        "text": "@mookosh ​\r\n1. I'll be brief on this point, as I think that this is not a point worth massively laboring. Whilst the colonies weren't directly of much use to many countries in the western blocks, many European countries have massively benefitted from the exploitation of the global south in the past. Russia hasn't had this. The USSR, therefore, began the race at a worse position than countries like Britain and France that have had economies, institutions, trade networks, and a working public that had been subsidized by these ill-gotten gains of colonialism. Comparing the material conditions in the two blocks, therefore, is not a fair comparison in my eyes.\n\r\n2. \"We are ashamed of [the native American cultural erasure] and did it a century ago. China has no shame and is doing it right now. I think that's really bad.\" I agree, and I think it's really bad that China continues to do it in the present. The point I am trying to make here is that a democratic system alone isn't enough to safeguard the rights of minorities within a large nation. What is needed is a political will by the population at large, and that was missing in the US and Canada half a century ago and is missing in China nowadays. What is happening to the Uyhgur people isn't happening by the arbitrary whims of the government against the will of the Chinese people. It is happening by the passive acceptance of the Chinese public.\n\r\n\"This means China would be evil even if democratic... which just makes me sad. did you intend to say that?\" I did. I do think it is a good thing for a country to be democratic and to be accountable to the people, but I also acknowledge that a country can be democratic AND still be evil. Like the US.\r\n\r\n\"China has only been a global superpower for a decade. This kind of comparison is like trying to compare the track record of a politician who has never served a single term to one who has been in politics for decades. Obviously the politician who has served more terms is going to have more dirt...\" Which, at present, means that we can only judge the Chinese track record by guesses. The US, on the other hand, already has a record of perpetuating destructive, dangerous, and immoral policies aboard. Whilst the Soviet Union is far worse for people at home than the US is, there is relatively little daylight between the conduct between the US and the USSR whether it be overthrowing and assassinating democratically elected leaders of third world countries, propping up dictators and rogue states, or just pushing for open wars with countries halfway across the world. China MAY perpetuate these policies in the future. America HAS, IS, and WILL CONTINUE TO perpetuate these policies. Unlike what was done to the Native Americans, the US's political class has shown zero regret or self-reflection on this point. As such, the worst thing that can be said about the Chinese hegemony is that the MAY become as bad as the US.\n\r\n\"Then you shouldn't have written several paragraphs defending the worst abuses the CCP has committed. I think that's a nice idea... but the world rarely exists without hegemons. You may have 2 or 3 hegemons, but power tends to consolidate then dissipate then consolidate in new hands.\" I didn't defend ANY of the Chinese government's actions. I am simply making the point that a democratic China wouldn't address problems like the oppression of racial and religious minorities by drawing comparisons to how countries like the US and Canada, democratic countries, have also allowed for the inhumane abuses of minority groups. \r\n\r\n\"I think it's wiser to want a GOOD hegemon than to wishfully dream of a world without them... at least at present.\" Perhaps it's wiser, if we were comparing Sweden to China or something. The US isn't a good hegemon. By track record, as I have noted, it is WORSE than China. Now perhaps China could become worse in the future, but I hardly think it's valid to argue with evidence that literally doesn't exist yet.\n\r\n\"In a material sense... Not much else... and the thing about sweatshop labour commodities is that your 2$ socks unravel, but the CCP still gets to own your ports for the next 99 years.\" It also means that more schools are being built in poor African countries and more people have access to clean water, electricity, and medicine. China's expanding influence is something worth worrying about, but let's not pretend building military bases and overtaking large swathes of the local government isn't something that the US and western Europe is innocent of either. The rise of multipolarity, though it may not be stable, has done some of the least fortunate nations in the world tangible good.\n\r\n\"this is an ignorant lie but this reply is already too long. Stop lying about europeans being a bunch of slaver idiots who are incapable of any productivity without being exploiters. It's ugly... and arguably racist.\" Is this a nasty lie? Most of the history I am using to make this assessment comes from my education in an EUROPEAN school. Now this might bias my perspective since it does mean that most of the history and economics I have been taught is about Europe and therefore I would have been much more exposed to the past development of European economic systems and past and present exploitations, but I hardly think it is controversial that much of western Europe is so much richer than other countries because they have profited off colonialism and the slave trade whilst sabotaging, invading, or otherwise subjugating countries in Africa, Asia, and formerly in the Americas. This isn't ancient history either: the Franc Afrique was only abolished recently. This doesn't mean that Europe hasn't produced science, media, and technology that the world presently benefits from. It is simply acknowledging that western Europe's ascent was made possible by the exploitation of other peoples outside of their borders. Just because I acknowledge the historical fact that the comparative wealth of European countries next to African or Asian countries comes from imperialism doesn't mean that I think that the people in the European continent haven't been productive with both the resources that have been produced within their borders as well as the resources that have been misappropriated from their colonies.",

Don't perpetuate them.\" Please do not lower yourself to bad faith arguments and putting words in my mouth. There was plenty that Europe has contributed to the world. Acknowledging the bad doesn't mean I am ignoring the good. It was not brought up here simply because it had no relevance to the argument. Just because I think the German National Socialist party of the 1940s was a heinous regime doesn't mean that I can't appreciate the developments made to rocket technology under that regime. Just because I am a critic of the age of colonialism doesn't mean that I don't think that the improvement and expansion of the scientific method during that era was a wonderful thing. I am more than capable of acknowledging that this wealth is acquired at the expense of African, Asian, Native American, and Mesoamerican societies whilst also thinking that the product of said evils ends up doing a great deal of good for the world.\n\r\n\"Wanna know what to expect from a Chinese global hegemony? Apply its domestic policy to a global community.\" This point just confuses me. Why would China WANT to apply its domestic policies internationally? The cultural genocide against the Uhyger people is an evil, but it's not something the Chinese state is going just for the sake of being evil. They do it because they want stability and because they want to have a country full of nationalistic citizens that would uncritically support the government's actions and the destruction of an entire way of living of a people is something they don't mind destroying for their ambitions. What would China possibly have to gain from using their resources to perpetuate this policy aboard? Is this something other countries do? Does the Canadian public healthcare policy (something that I am a very big fan off, since you seem to have this weird idea that I dislike everything Western countries do) also mean that the Canadian international policy is to give free-at-point-of-service healthcare to everyone? You can't assess a country's international policy by looking at its domestic policies.\n\r\n\"All I ask you to do is be left wing. Oppose autocracy.\" I am of the belief that democracies are an emergent property of a vibrant middle class and national prosperity. Democracies can't be imposed and be expected to work on a population that lacks the necessary material conditions to sustain democracies. As such, I think the improvement of material conditions internationally, even if driven by the presence of an autocratic state, will allow democracies to naturally emerge elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\"It feels as though you see little to no value in democracy based on how frequently you express how irrespective of autocracy vs. democracy nations will act identically.\" That is a misunderstanding, albeit an understandable one, of my position. There are autocracies, like full dictatorships, that basically do whatever the leadership wants irrespective of the will of the people. The Chinese government, from what I have seen of them in the past, still act within the general trend of trying to stabilize the country and generate prosperity regardless of the cost. In the case of China specifically, I do not think that a change from autocracy to democracy will be sufficient to address Han chauvinism and racism with the Chinese nation. Looking at the nation from my perspective, an autocratic China and a democratic China will probably pursue the same or similar policies.\n\r\n\"If there's no value in democracy, why do you think it matters?\" Because I think it is important that nations are accountable to the people. If the people want evil things or are willing to commit evil to get what they want then this means that the democracy turns evil, but I think that the results of an institution that has no accountability whatsoever will usually result in worse conditions.\n\r\n\"I urge you not to wait to negotiate with the lion until your head is in its mouth...

What would you have proposed? Launching an invasion into a part of China to try to oust Beijing influence from the Hong Kong state? Send in weapons to the protestors to oppose the government, therefore extending the protests and turning the entire situation bloodier and bloodier and therefore worsening the living conditions for the people of Hong Kong? The Honk Kong protest started over an extradition bill. Due to the protests, the extradition bill was retracted. The protests succeeded in their aims. I don't see how this is even slightly comparable to the ongoing cultural genocide being perpetuated against the Uyghur people. Is pointing out the facts of a situation a tanky thing to do?",

Coffee was so effective at changing culture that monarchies thought it was some Islamic weapon designed to weaken Europe because of how much unrest is sowed among the peasantry.\n\n3) with coffee comes the Renaissance, with the Renaissance comes the enlightenment, with the enlightenment comes the industrial revolution, with the industrial revolution comes a demand for greater franchisement, with such demands comes democracy, with democracy comes modernity.

You acknowledge that the colonies didn't provide much wealth but rather that the western bloq was walking into the cold war with infrastructure already existing that the Soviets lacked. I agree. This isn't because of colonialism, this is because of industrialization. What even made Soviets suddenly powerful? Rapid industrialization. They accomplished in decades what took Western Europe CENTURIES. Ultimately their failure came because their autocrats simply made too many errors to bear, a vulnerability I feel is less present in democracy.\n\nI'm surprised your European schools taught you that modern Europe is a product of slavery. That's... Wrong... In fact the most disgusting fact about colonialism is just how useless it was. We oppressed, genocide, and exploited all these different people's for sweeter tea... That's infinitely more harrowing than an actual economic justification like \"oh this is how you build modern societies\". In fact a conservative might use such an explanation to JUSTIFY colonialism as a good thing because it created incredible modern societies! No no, colonialism was an expensive mistake in every way. The only \"benefit\" was political and cultural perhaps insofar as when you kill everyone in some spot and replace them with your population, while it is no guarantee you'll have expanded your state (see the US, UK split) you can argue that it still projected your power abroad (see, the Anglo sphere dominating global language of commerce). But I hope you can see how a granular benefit like everyone doing business in English is a far cry from saying that Europe exists because of colonial exploitation. That's just... Wrong...

        "text": "​@mookosh \n\"the colonies primarily provided luxury goods - sugar, tobacco, cotton, and tea do not create a modern wealthy society.\" Just because these products weren't necessities didn't mean that they couldn't be sold to generate wealth. These are products that colonies were forced to produce, at the exclusion of other products. The money gained from selling these goods are then mostly pocketed by colonializes. The wealth here is what helped subsidize the wealth of Europe, and this was done at the expense of nations that would have potentially been able to grow better if the local population were able to choose their own choice of production. I also don't really agree with cotton being a luxury good, considering that it's used to produce clothes as well as ship sails and, later on, parachutes. There is also the fact that colonies also produces other necessities like rubber, needed for tires and cars, and well as food, as seen in the case of the Britain-created Bengal Famine.\n\nOn the coffee point, briefly. Coffee is introduced to Europe in Hungary in 1526. The Renaissance, on the other hand, is estimated to start in the 1350s. Whilst coffee may have later contributed to European wealth, pointing to it as a single-source explanation for the massive wealth of Europe is a conclusion I have to disagree with.\n\nThough I should probably take this time to clarify my position. I am not a fan of single-point explanations to complex historical events. Colonialism was not the only reason that western Europe became as rich as it was prior to the world wars, but it is a significant contributing factor. They were able to generate massive amount of wealth from low-income/slave populations at the expense of the livelihoods of those populations. Europe, obviously, invested plenty of time and resources into science and engineering which in turn allowed for the military that allows for them to push forwards their policies of colonial expansion and gunboat diplomacy. To remove colonialism as a large part of the reason why Europe was able to so decisively secure their global power, on the other hand, seems completely unjustifiable to me considering the historical facts at hand. Colonialism isn't the ONLY reason Europe became rich, but it's a pretty damn large part.\n\n\"You acknowledge that the colonies didn't provide much wealth but rather that the western bloq was walking into the cold war with infrastructure already existing that the Soviets lacked. I agree. This isn't because of colonialism, this is because of industrialization.\" Western European industrialization was heavily facilitated by colonialism though, either by the wealth that selling the products of the colonies, or by the ability to acquire cheap resources from colonies that are then used to support industries at home. I mean, just look at France's relationship with the Françafrique for a contemporary continuation of French colonial policies. These are exploitative relationships maintained, practically to this day, because they produce wealth for the colonizers.\n\nAs for the point on colonialism, I really am not sure why you would be horrified by an acknowledgement that the comparative wealth of Western Europe is born of exploitation. It's not a justification of the exploitation. European schools are NOT teaching that what happened during the age of colonialism was okay or good, at least to the school I went to. It cautions us students, when we look at other parts of the world and seeing great poverty, from considering facist arguments like thinking that African countries are poor because of some flaw with the people or the culture. It tells us that the wealth we enjoy was created by a historical wrong, and that we should go forwards understanding that our privileged position is born of past evils. I can both acknowledge my privilege as a product of exploitation and oppression, and still use that for the sake of those who have suffered and who continue to do so. We can't change the evils in the past, but neither can we ignore it. We should go forwards, helping the descendants of those that our precursors had wronged, and try to build a better world for everyone. To use my position as a part of one of the wealthiest block in all of human history to do what we can to help the exploited and allow them the prosperity that ALL humans deserve. THAT was what I was taught, and whilst I have a lot I disagree with some of my teachers on I find that message to be laudable and honorable.\n\nAnd honestly, something doesn't have to be needless to be evil. If some murderer went into a family's house and murdered the family with the intention of stealing their money, they don't become magically more evil when they discover that the family keeps their money in a bank. The pointlessness of an act of evil does increase how tragic the situation is, but it doesn't change how evil the act is. At least in my opinion.",

Whether it's destroying temples, ordering the destruction of certain flags, or forcefully integrating the Tibetan population into modern Chinese culture and economies, the Chinese governing body has done plenty to harm the cultural life of people in the region. It could be argued that the CCP is doing this out of an honest desire to help the people of the region as well and therefore it may be possible to argue that cultural genocide might not be the precise correct term, but the ultimate result of this policy is likely going to be the same as the policy that is deliberately designed to inflict cultural genocide. Parts of the culture will survive, but those parts will be the ones that the CCP specifically finds inoffensive. It will most likely be the superficial parts like festivals and traditional clothing, whereas monastery schools, Tibetian national identity, and the core spirituality of Tiberian life will likely disappear.",

        "text": "@captaintomato5433 Well, you've conceded that colonialism is not the sole reason for the development of modern societies in Europe which is all I really wanted from you. What I would say is that the wealth generated from cash crops did not offset the major costs involved in colonization. I reject the position that Britain intentionally caused the Bengal famine. Mismanaged it, yes, but \"caused\" is historical revisionism. Ultimately a minor point though. \n\nCoffee was the glue. Rome falls and Europe regresses to a backwater for hundreds of years. Charlemagne tries to recreate some of the old magic, but his cultural reforms simply don't stick. The Renaissance begins in 1350 and ends in the 1700's. Coffee enters the picture in 1526. That means half the renaissance occurred under the influence of coffee. \n\nWhat followed the Renaissance was the Enlightenment. You cannot deny that the enlightenment was BORN in coffeehouses. I'm not saying Coffee taught people praxis or gave people class consciousness, but it gave people energy, focus, and sobriety. \n\nIndustrialization began in the 1700's around the same time as those coffee-houses caused all those democratic revolutions. Colonization began in 1492. \n\nColonization did not support industrialization or enlightenment. People did not become more politically self-aware, more scientifically knowledgeable, more developed because they had cheaper cotton shirts. \n\nAlso colonization did not provide food to Europe until refrigeration became a thing. Refrigeration did not enter commercial practice until the 1840's, 350 years into colonization and 100 years before the end of it all...\n\nMy last point is that... many significant european countries didn't really do colonization. England benefitted the most, no doubt, maybe France, maybe Belgium for that horrific rubber... But Germany? Germany wasn't allowed to have colonies. Poland, much as you may not like her, she was once a great power of Europe and basically had no colonial presence. I forget if Hungary had much in the way of colonies... Spain had latin America, though I'm ignorant to the particulars of how exactly that relationship worked. Italy couldn't do much in terms of colonization either.\n\nI think I just would like you to really study colonization factually. There are a lot of cognitive shortcuts we have with this 500 year period of European history which are grossly inaccurate. Since you've conceded that it was wrong to claim colonization was the sole cause of Europe's modern achievements I think our disagreements are at an end... except on the less serious topic of how important coffee was to the creation of modern society... which yknow... isn't that important.",

        "text": "@mookosh \n\"Well, you've conceded that colonialism is not the sole reason for the development of modern societies in Europe which is all I really wanted from you.\" Well then I suppose this was a misunderstanding since my position was never that western Europe solely developed thanks to colonialism. I brought it up in reference to Russia, specifically, and why the USSR had significantly poorer living conditions than Western Europe. I argued that this disparity of their material conditions was due to the fact that Russia didn't have large swathes of colonies to exploit. My claim was that the excess in wealth that Europe had, in comparison to the USSR, can be succinctly explained through colonialism.\n\nAnd the discussion of industrialization here factors into this discussion, specifically, due to its relevance to the wealth of nations. The renaissance and the enlightenment was the start of Europe's growth and the development of new technology in the European continent, but it could not simply be decoupled from colonization. The near-monopoly of the power of the European powers at the start of the Twentieth century is an extension of their colonial policies. The extraction of wealth from colonies funds development of industry at home, and the wealth from this goes back to the government in taxes who then use these resources to enlarge their naval forces to safeguard their colonies from other global powers.\n\nI also really do not think that just because a European country didn't have colonies doesn't mean that it doesn't benefit from colonialism. I can speak from Switzerland's perspective, as that is a country that I am most familiar with. Despite the fact that Switzerland has never had any colonies in Africa, I can say that we are beneficiaries of the neo-colonial policies of nations like France. Our country serves as a tax haven for companies and oligarchs throughout Europe, something that brings in massive amounts of money to the country and all we need to do is turn a blind eye to the excesses of capitalists. Colonialism provided Europe with unprecedented levels of cheap resources that fed their factories during industrialization to build the massive industrial works that allowed for the rise of Europe throughout the age of colonialization. Coffee may have allowed for the development of the scientific method and class consciousness, but the decisive monopoly of power that Europe has was acquired through military might that is intrinsically tied to colonial policy for the various European empires.\n\nOf the great European powers, just about all the countries have benefitted from colonialism. I can't speak much on Poland, specifically, but I do want to discuss Germany in more detail. Firstly, Germany didn't have any colonies and managed to become a great power. That doesn't mean that countries like Britain and France didn't become great powers, in large part, due to their exploitation of their colonial acquisitions. Keep in mind that people from the British and French colonies served in or alongside their armies, meaning that these colonies directly contributed to the great power status of at least Britain an France. Secondly, Germany HAS benefitted from the wealth generated from countries practicing colonialism before. In the Franco-Prussian war, 5 billion francs was given over to the newly unified German state after the defeat of France. Whilst Germany didn't run a colony themselves, they have benefited from the wealth of colonialism.\n\nOn that note. When you have wealthy neighbors, it's easier to become wealthy yourself. Your wealthy neighbor will vacation in your country more often than they do across the world, especially in an age when travelling is difficult, and they are going to trade with you first. If Britain and France has cheap industrial goods and resources and private companies sell to nearby countries like Germany, Germany can also gain the partial benefits of colonial exploitation. China, for all the bullshit they push onto their neighbors, spends lots of tourist money and money in general, on southeast Asian countries, Japan, and South Korea. Having rich neighbors nearby helps you get rich, and so even western European countries that are not directly participate in widescale colonialism benefits from the development of new technology, weaponry, and scientific knowledge that the wealth created by colonialism helps to facilitate. Just because there were other things that contributed to industrialization in Europe didn't mean that colonialism didn't play a central part. Just because the European great powers didn't directly participate in colonialism doesn't mean that they aren't beneficiaries of the material conditions that colonialism creates. Now it may potentially be possible for the European great powers to get to where they are without colonialism, but the fact is that in our timeline and in our universe, they got where they are through colonialism.\n\nAnd honestly, this point is a tangent to the conversation that began this argument in the first place. That was, specifically, about whether or not China would make a worse hegemony than the US. Not that I think we should return to that point, seeing as how I think that there's far less ground that can possibly be gained there considering what has already been said.",

        "text": "@captaintomato5433 I take no real issue with anything you've said here. Where I think we may have common ground is that where I am skeptical of how much real value colonialism provided to Europe, I do believe that colonialism DID function to crush everyone who wasn't European and prevent them from being capable of developing. Rather than facilitating the rise of the Europe, I am much more comfortable with recognizing how colonialism stunted the rise of China, India, Africa, and... Straight up eradicated from existence the indigenous of North/south America... So while I view colonialism as a fairly small factor to growing Europe, I consider it central to the inability everyone who wasn't European experienced in their own development. Not sure if that is consistent with your feelings, but it's all I really have to contribute to your points without just repeating what you said.\n\nI feel like we've kind of reached the end of any China v. America comparison. I think you underestimate the legitimate danger of a Chinese hegemony and overestimate the danger of US hegemony. I also think perhaps you aren't concerned enough about how negative a multipolar world would be, akin to cold war era. Obviously it would be nice if Sweden were the hegemon, but we don't get to have nice things... And ultimately we both agree that a pluralistic global community of nations sharing in power and influence in a fashion which incentivizes cooperation over infighting over time...\n\nBeyond that I think it's just your opinion vs. Mine. I am deeply concerned about China's domestic policy and autocratic government. You're concerned about America's addiction to war crimes and complete failure to represent the global good it advertised on the tin, propping up autocrats, destroying nations, disregarding the environment, international law,... I'm not sure if you also critiqued the US domestic policy... Though that would be humorous if you were concerned with the US foreign policy whole I was concerned about Chinese domestic policy.\n\nI suppose the average between our views is that whoever wins, it appears we all lose... The next decade may define the next century and I don't really feel very hopeful about how we will score... Though maybe things are a little sunnier in Europe than North America right now. We're fairly miserable over here. That's why I got sensitive about what I perceived as an unfair sleight against Europeans. Europe is kinda my last hope for something good in the future since I've kinda lost hope for my... Continent... Though I suppose I've rambled long enough on this tangent. I'll leave it at that.",

Britain's legacy in India is shameful and there are more than enough truthful massacres to hold them accountable for. In fact it is because I know so many real atrocities that I find the popularity of the Bengal famine myth to be aggravating enough to whine about even if I accept that it's an ultimately minor and irrelevant point.

        "text": "@captaintomato5433 I most certainly agree that the CCP could be adhering to the constitution and erase some subcultures, but this begs the question - what exactly is essential to one's culture? If I am say, a devout Christian in the US and I find it religiously abhorrent to work on Sunday, yet my boss forces me to come in on Sunday to work or I am fired, is this erasure of my culture? And who is to say - my secularist neighbor, my atheist boss, or myself? Right now the conversation about Tibet and Xinjiang is dominated by some incredibly religious people - Zenz, the TGIE/Dalai Lama. Do you honestly think they would assert that Tibetan culture does not necessarily need a theocratic elite dictating how the masses ought to live their lives?\n\nLet me bring up another example to illustrate the point. Mongolia used to be a highly Buddhist culture that worshiped and gave tribute to the Lamas in Tibet, much as the HRE used to pay homage to the Vatican. This was largely removed in favor of a more secularist Mongolia. They also switched to using Cyrillic to write their language. Today, do we say that Mongolian culture in Mongolia has been wiped out or destroyed? Does this answer change when we note that it was the Soviets that \"encouraged\" them to make these changes? Compare and contrast with Inner Mongolia, where the Mongolian script is still in use on street signs and textbooks.\n\nThe argument against the CCP is easy to make - any element of the culture being lost is a sign that the CCP is destroying the culture. Yet, I find this to be farcical logic. Loss has to exist _somewhere_ as all cultures change over time. Should I blame the US government for destroying American culture after they wholesale destroyed all the trains and trolleys for a car culture that has sapped the vitality out of American streets? This seems farcical, yes? Because we know that the modified culture afterwards _is also American,_ even if I hate it.\n\nMethinks the hangup has to do with the fact that the CCP is changing Uighur culture, not that Uighur culture is changing. This is why no one cares that all of a sudden Uighur culture is becoming very Arabic in the Tarim - THAT is fine, but the CCP is NOT.\n\nI would hate to be a secularist Uighur listening to Western press.

The lowest scholarly estimate I've seen used for the Bengal famine is 0.8 million deaths, 800 thousand, whereas contemporary consensus estimates the deaths at 2.1 million.\n\nThe government of India were repeatedly warned that exhausting India's supply would lean to a famine, but still kept exporting grain from India to other parts of the empire. This kept going even as India's viceroy continued to beg for emergency wheat supplies. The wheat arrived, eventually, in fractions of the requested quantity that were far too small to properly alleviate the famine. That's not even mentioning how boats and rice supplies were confiscated from Bengal's coast as a part of the war effort, denying the local people their livelihoods, supplies of preexisting food, and ways of getting more food in the future. Meanwhile, imports of Australian what passed India not even to feed starving Europeans, but to be stored for future consumption in Europe. Imports dropped, prices skyrocketed, and scalpers made fortunes whilst insufficient wheat arrived in India to alleviate the famine.\n\nNow ultimately I can't travel back in time and crack open the heads of the British government people at the time to see what really drove them. Their disregard for India, however, can rather succinctly be correlated with what they have said, written, and given speeches about when discussing the Indian people. Many of Churchill's sentiments, like how the native people 'breed like rabbits', can be seen recapitulated in the talking points of racist conservatives to this day.

        "text": "@mookosh \"am I wrong to disregard state propaganda\"\n\n\n...yes? State propaganda is pretty important in making judgements about a state. And in response to the idea that your news source might be biased, you responded with \"well then what do I do- Balance my biases by seeking out sources that I don't have a reason to trust implicitly? Preposterous, I only listen to sources that allow me to switch my brain off and skip the critical examination of what they're saying, the thing that makes sources useful in the first place.\"\n\nLike, maybe that's not what you meant or what you do, and if it's not I apologise for suggesting so, but at the same time, you can't just reply \"the world says one thing and China says another, why should I hear what China says?\"\n\nThe position you'll find the most truth at is where one side did not comment. The Uighur camps were generally not acknowledged, or said to be something else, until the story broke to the international community (not news to the Uighurs, I'd imagine). It's a fair bet that China's claims are false or misleading, given that they weren't officially or widely talked about _until someone went looking,_ at which point explanations for them were given which didn't fit the gathered information by that breaking story, i.e. any nonconspiratorial explanation as to why hundreds of Uighurs would say \"they're trying to replace and brainwash us\" if that wasn't happening- it's not like secessionism in Xinjiang is particularly new, nor has the resources to make that up- by contrast, the ruling Chinese Communist Party has the resources and motivation to both do it and cover it up as best they could.\n\n\nBut when looking up an unrelated topic (hence, the chance that I would have a confirmation bias that would change the information sought out) of how much cochlear implants cost across different countries, I came across an article listing the 2016 price as 200,000 yuan, with the words \"on the positive side, the central government began paying for implants for around 6,000 underprivileged children who suffer from hearing loss each year\" by China Daily. Coupling that with a (1995) estimate of 6 million deaf people in China by the US national library of medicine, assuming 'underprivileged' refers to the bottom 10% of deaf people, and \"children\" narrows it down again from 10% to 1%, we're left with probably servicing one sixth of the underprivileged children who need cochlear implants, and that's every year compared to an overall number.\n\nSo the full idea is, \"China is providing about 10% of underprivileged deaf children with cochlear implants for free every year, and presumably has provided about half of underprivileged children with them in 2021.\"\n\nYou could reach the conclusion that it's great, or that it's terrible, but the point is you reached that with sources that didn't have incentives to lie about those specific facts. Maybe in general they prefer to be optimistic or pessimistic, but without knowing _why_ the information is relevant, it's difficult for the sources to lie directly. For example, that China Daily article is pretty critical of the coverage- unaffordability is being met by a stopgap, it says, especially in young people, but it isn't so good for seniors. It lays out a fairly large-scale problem. Why would it lie about a programme it thinks would be good, while the article is so candid about the scale of the problem- 30,000 newborns suffering hearing problems, etc.\n\n\nAnyway- this, I acknowledge, isn't so easy when it comes to more controversial topics. However, the attitude \"Chinese state media is useless because of its bias\" just simply isn't useful, and is built on unfirm footing.",

They wouldn't _unless they wanted you to think they had._ Hence, propaganda, hell outright lies and from an autocratic country at that, _are very fucking useful._\n\nTo dismiss the usefulness of studying propaganda is essentially to out one's self as an idiot- I am directly calling you an idiot now, to be clear. You are an idiot If you think because a source is biased, it is not useful. Did you fail history or just not do it?\n\n \n\nin case it's just not getting in, still, I'll outline it in all caps. To be clear, it's not yelling, it's just making the words bigger since you've already proved you don't read what I write. I'm not mad, Im just disappointed:\n\nTHE USEFULNESS OF PROPAGANDA HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH WHAT IT SAYS, AND VERY LITTLE TO DO SITH HOW ACCURATE OR TRUTHFUL IT IS OR IS TRYING TO BE.\nIT IS USEFUL TO SHOWCASE AND ANALYSE WHAT THE OFFICIAL LINE OF THE ORGANISATION, COMPANY, OR COUNTRY IS, AS WELL AS WHAT THEY BELIEVE MORE GENERALLY.\n\nTHE QUESTION OF HOW RELIABLE A PIECE OF MEDIA IS MERELY INFORMS HOW MUCH ITS STATED CONCLUSION SHOULD INFLUENCE YOUR FEELINGS ABOUT THE WORLD, NOT WHETHER THE SOURCE CAN BE USEFUL TO YOU IN SHAPING A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORLD.\n\nALSO, BEFORE YOU FUCKING GO THERE AGAIN, YES TIANENMEN SQUARE HAPPENED. AT NO POINT DID ANYBODY BRING THAT UP EXCEPT YOU, AND YOURE ON THE HOOK FOR PROVING HOW THE FUCK THATS RELEVANT.\n\nNow that that's out of the way, do you have any other accusations you want to make so you feel you don't have to listen to me, or do you want to look at what I've actually fuckin said (rather than \"you said I'm wrong when we're talking about China- you must be a communist trying to defend the CCP and pretend Tiananmen Square didn't happen.\" I mean, _you_ wanna talk about purity spirals? I have to agree with your take on media bias or else I'm defending the Chinese Government? I'd die of irony overdose if your stupidity hadn't killed me first. Oh no, I'm writing from the grave; the cell reception is awful, and people are arguing about communism here as well.",

        "text": "@LancesArmorStriking I very strongly disagree with the idea that America views itself as Britain did. A single conversation with the average Republican (which is where most of these backward policies come from) would give you an idea of some massive, impossibly powerful, and perfect nation. By no means is there a perception that America is small. Hell, phrases such as \"From Sea to Shining Sea\" come to mind when I think of America's size or influence on the continent. \n\nI admit that as an American I may have a biased view on the use of nuclear weapons, but I have yet to encounter anyone (even non Americans) say that the reason for the use of the weapons was to prevent the Soviets from entering Hokkaido. I'm not sure where you've gained that idea. The Soviets already had ports on the Pacific, such as Vladivostok and the island of Sakhalin (or half of it, at least). \n\nI don't have any knowledge on spending on corrupt politicians, except for in our own country. I'll assume we did it elsewhere too. \n\nI also disagree that the goal of the proxy war in Afghanistan against the Soviets was driven by the want to keep the Soviets out of the Indian Ocean. I think India/Pakistan can do that themselves just fine. The goal was to prevent the Soviets from expanding their influence or territory, and to just overall harm their military strength. China doesn't make a whole lot of sense, considering they have a massive coast on the Pacific. Not exactly a whole lot we can do there, and we've already pretty much conceded on them having the SE Asian Sea. Taiwan makes even less sense, as they're our ally.\n\nIf your argument is that it's more of a *subconscious* thing that drives a neo-British thought in America, then I'd still have to strongly disagree.",

It was the most extensive empire in history and the ultranationalist jingoism of a  British Imperialist’s (the empire being in their eyes massive, powerful, perfect) would put a modern Republican to shame.  \nThey were saying we the US think of Europe as if we are still that small island on the North Sea that ruled a world empire, and England’s long-standing goal regarding Europe was to keep control of the seas and prevent any one or two countries from being strong enough to challenge her. \n(In other words, they were calling the island small geographically, not at all saying the Brits thought of themselves as small. That almost the opposite of what they said\n)\nThe thing with the Soviets  and Japan, the thing they said is just true, and the comment you responded to didn’t mention the bomb \n(although they could have. the timing and decision to use it was heavily influenced by what the US wanted to happen with the Soviets. Shaun has a good vid on it if you haven’t seen it.) I digress. They didn’t say anything about using the nukes to stop the Russians entering Hokkaido.\n\nI’m not saying I agree with their comment elsewhere, for the record.  \nI just saw two bits where you responded to things they didn’t say as though they said them.

Though I wouldn't describe it as a neo-British thought.

        "text": "@gorillaguerillaDK All very true. I too live in a multiparty democracy. Australia ; Labor the democratic socialist party has the most votes by themselves and have governed both State and Commonwealth in strength of their own votes many times. The Liberal National Parties in Coalition; are the conservatives and neoliberals, tending to smaller government, privatisation, “Christian values” (whatever that is) They are in Power in Federal Government now. The states are inter changeable between Labor and Coalition. Greens are further to the Left as a party than Labor by the time the factions level off. The Greens, we’re powerful a few years ago when Labor had minority government. One Nation are populist right wing, reactionary party driven by the personality cult of Pauline Hansen a former Liberal conservative that left that party due to her views on controversial topics, dog whistle racism and anti Political correctness stance.  \nSo ultimately 2 parties of Labor and Coalition which run governments. The minor parties wield power and can be representative and sometimes very effective. There are others; Hunters, Fishers Party which are like right wing greens. One issue parties, more immigration or less immigration parties. Legalise Drugs, no airport noise, free Julian Assange party. The minor parties tend to operate more in the “Upper House”… which aren’t the policy and government Houses of Parliament but are part of the system and as I’ve said can be both useful and effective or wackos with high paid jobs on the public teet . \n\nAustralia’s system is similar to the UK, Canada and NZ, the American two party system to me is so corruptible and unrepresentative of all the people. Society isn’t made up of conservatives and Liberals, I mean our Liberals are conservatives. Nor is it just Left and right. Reading political sciences you research “big house parties” \nI don’t wish a Israeli system where governments are impossible to form. That’s the other end of the system from the US 2 party system with, with everything lumped into GOP and Dems",

        "text": "Anew Divinhell AK Prices start around 1500$ for full auto ones. That's for the chinese type 56s, KLFs or eastern Europeans or Iraqis made under license. These do mostly not have dovetails. For these you would probably have to go for an Ak-74N, AKS-74N, AKMN, AKMSN or an AKS-74UN or UB. The last two however are closer to smgs that rifles. Optics are incredibly hard to find, generally and are stupid expensive. ACOGs go for upwards of a thousand, PSO-1s for around 500. What I'm saying is that if you have your 2000$ rifle and scope and you buy your truck and you get close to the base you're attacking, you will find yourself in the predicament of suddenly dying via gunshot wound from a guard. If somehow you dont get noticed and you start shooting thr fuel tanks, another predicament arises: tanks are armored????? And all this assumes that a military base is built next to a vulnerable position, like a hilltop without a FOB, checkpoint or other security measure on that strategically valuable vulnerable position. Well, back to the drawing board. Maybe you and your friends can get an old DShk HMG. The barrel is shot out and the action is broken. You aren't gunsmiths and you dont have the tools you need to repair it. But what you do is, you go to faisal, the local Smith. He can make you a makeshift action fitting the barrel. He cuts the barrel crown off, and presents to you: a single fire anti-bacterial rifle made from a DShk barrel. That might actually work you think, hell yeah I can penetrate those fuel tanks with this now. You somehow manage to lower your body temperature to the same level as the dirt next to you, so you cant be seen on thermals. None of the guards notice you. You brought two bullets of 12.7x108mm API with you, for which you had to sell you sister into slavery. They are soviet surplus. You get close to the impossible, nonexistent military base. You set up your rifle. You take aim. You fire at the (for some reason) exposed fuel tanks. Well, fuck you you missed. The scope is garbage and the barrel is bent. But how would you have noticed, you couldnt afford the ammo needed to zero the damn thing, and even if you had, the scope would break before you got anywhere close to an accurate zero.\nAnd this is the story of how Anew Divinhell won the war because they understood it so much better than anyone. (Btw I have no clue how expensive a DShk is in syria or similar, but they are about 2500$ to produce. An M4 carbine is 200$ to produce and they go up to 2000$)",

        "text": "@publioaurelioperonciniano3403 It has nothing to do with capitalist expansion, in fact China profited just as much from the Afghan and Iraq wars as the US did. What it does have to do with is the military-industrial complex. In a not insignificant way, war is welfare in the USA, the army is mainly made up of the poor of America, sold to them as a way to get job training or a college education for free. Many US military installations within their own borders are out-dated and barely functional but will never be closed because they provide jobs to a poor, rural community. Likewise, weapon manufacturers and private security companies wield incredible power both through direct lobbying and through the NRA. It is easy to look at the dollars spent on US military and wars and say that money was just blown up in some foreign country, but that ignores the fact that the money spent on bombs goes to well paying manufacturing jobs in the USA building those bombs in the first place, as well as mining jobs to extract the raw materials that go into those bombs, hi-tech jobs in chemical and engineering to design those bombs, etc... \n\nIn a very real way, the US millitary is a vast welfare project where instead of paying people to dig holes then fill them in again, they are paying people to create weapons only to blow them up over some other country.",

Nazi rule resulted in \"fat shortage\", as they called it, and the impending hunger was one of the reasons why Hitler did Molotov-Ribbentrop - USSR exported to Germany food while buying from Germany heavy industrial stuff USSR was prevented from acquiring from the West usually. There's nothing surprising about Nazis starving, really. Also, you know that it's Nazis who were sending their green recruits in summer clothes to fight for Moscow and Stalingrad in winter and not Russians, right? Says a lot about how great German army was, lol, same thing happened to Napoleon as well.\n\nStalin was asking for a second front because it would have sped up the destruction of Nazi Germany. What I am talking about, though, is Germans attacking Allies with tanks and such, like Netherlands, which resulted in Allies begging Stalin to do some offensive to save Allied skins. Stalin's idea was strategic, it would have helped to win the war faster if Germany was fighting on two fronts; Allies' cries for help were tactical, they got destroyed in some battle, so they called USSR to save them from their tactical mistakes.

USA, though, had their bases given to China the moment US troops left. Cope, seethe, whatever. Pretty clear that USA is the loser in this comparison. \n\nOh, and USA didn't leave after itself tunnels, dams, railroads and housing blocs and factories. They only bombed hospitals Soviets have built back then during their invasion. \n\nAs for Finland, it's a cope central from Finns and anticommunists. The main focal point - is the \"secret wargoals\" USSR supposedly had. And since those secret wargoals weren't achieved it meant that USSR lost! Hilarious. \n\nI operate here off real hard evidence and real world data - which shows that USSR never wanted the whole of Finland and took only parts threatening Leningrad + punishment for Finns being fascists. \n\nAs for \"smaller country\", Finland had a mobilization potential of 600k people, USSR destroyed half of it dead and injured, which resulted in Finland not attacking USSR on it's own throughout WW2 at all, only German divisions in the North did attack - because, again, Finland's manpower was devastated by Soviet attack. \n\nSoviet losses were exaggerated tenfold by hostile propaganda. Suffice it to say that USSR's participation in the war was limited to Leningrad Military District troops which had less soldiers than Finnish military - and USSR didn't do mobilizations or drafting while at it. Mainly because a war this fast - barely three months - wouldn't allow for troops to get trained. So, USSR destroyed Finland with lesser forces, while suffering less losses.

        "text": "@KissatenYoba did you see the part where i said several of your replies got removed or did you ignore that bit? as for Afghanistan thats how i know i won the argument since you havent addressed a single argument i made so ill say it again, when it comes to Afghanistan, the Russian Soviet Union literally shared a border with Afghanistan and still lost, the US had to travel halfway across the world and at the same time the US was fighting on another front in Iraq so the US had to divert troops away from Afghanistan into Iraq and the US won in Iraq, after the US got its main objective of taking out Bin Laden in 2011 Afghanistan was simply a side show, and the other objectives the US achieved in Afghanistan was to get oil, profit the military industry, and prevent future attacks from the middle east to happen to the US the US went into the middle east to prevent them from attacking the US again and since going to the middle east they never tried to attack us again so Afghanistan isnt an actual loss for the US unlike Russia actually getting defeated in 1989, the US also never lost a single battle in Afghanistan while Russia lost many, Russia took over 6x the losses in only half the time, and couldnt even take out the Mujahedeen leader Ahmad Shah Massoud while the US still took out Bin Laden, when comparing Russias war with Afghanistan vs the US war with Afghanistan, Russias loss is FAR FAR more embarrassing, also the US didnt wipe out an entire 2 million unarmed civilians in Afghanistan unlike the Russians, \"cope from anticommunists\" lol? tell me who in the world WOULDNT be anticommunist, i cant even tell you how happy i am when i heard it collapsed in 1991 that was probably one of the most glorious years on earth, yes the Russians in fact wanted to take back the entire country of Finland after the Russian communists lost the entire territory of Finland in 1918 after Russian communists lost the Finnish civil war/Finnish war for independence, and i love how you tried to ignore the 1918 Finnish war for independence when the Finnish completely smacked the Russian communists and achieved full independence in 1918 after winning the war, Russia 100% wanted the entire country of Finland, only tankie coping mechanisms try to say \"oh we didnt want the whole of Finland we only wanted this teeny tiny amount\" thats the hilarious part, simply limiting your objectives because you knew you couldnt achieve your real objectives because once again, you were humiliated, same in Ukraine, as the war goes on and on Russia keeps limiting its objectives as they find out that Ukraine doesnt stand for Russian imperialism and Russian aggression, anyway the red army numbered at 760,000 troops, 6,541 tanks, and 3,880 aircrafts and you overexaggerated the number of the Finnish army, the Finnish only used 300,000 troops and they humiliated the Russians, merely 32 tanks and 114 aircrafts yet Russia still lost, also you think 25,000 Finnish deaths = half? who taught you math? 25,000 isnt even 10% of 300,000 meanwhile Russia took 381,000 casualties during the winter war LOL ah yes theres the \"limited objectives\" cope again even though its widely known that what the Russians truly wanted was the entire country of Finland and to take away Finnish independence as a whole for revenge when the Finnish smacked the Russian communists in 1918 during the Finnish civil war/Finnish war for independence and Russia lost the entire territory of Finland \"lesser forces and lesser losses\" BWAHAHAHA is that what they teach you over there? that is the funniest thing ive ever heard, 760,000 Russian soldiers, 6,541 tanks, 3,880 air crafts, vs 300,000 Finnish soldiers, 32 tanks, and 114 air craft, imagine having over 2.5x the amount of troops, over 204x the amount of tanks, and over 34x the amount of air crafts and still lose the war to Finnish farmers, twice by the way, you keep trying to ignore the Finnish civil war/Finnish war for independence in 1918 where the Finnish defeated the Russian communists and achieved total independence Russia lost the entire territory of Finland after losing the war in 1918 you keep trying to ignore it but it wont work nice try though :) everything you say is simply tankie cope and you also tried to ignore the fact that several of your other replies were also removed so i cant even see most of the stuff you said, stop projecting :)",

A disease caused the potatoes to rot, the price of food rose, and most people didn't have enough money to buy potatoes or any food because the only crop grown in their farms were potatoes for export.\nWe saw this in British India, where many famines happened because ever more tenant farmers were growing opium, sugar, cotton, indigo, spices, coffee, and other cash crops in exchange for rent rebates. When there was a poor harvest of staple foods, the price of food rose drastically, causing many people to not afford the food they need and more people resorted to growing cash crops to earn money. As more farmers grew cash crops instead of staple food crops, the price of food slowly rose even in times of good harvests.\nWe saw this in the 1800s-1940s China, where their economy was increasingly reliant on selling tea and buying opium.\nWe saw this recently in Venezuela, where their economy was reliant on selling crude oil. \nThe US has a diverse economy, but the US is not invulnerable to economic crisis. The US has had 48 recessions in its history, an average of about 1 recession every 4-7 years. Thats more recessions than different Presidents",

In spite of the simultaneous development and production of 3 different types of Main Battle Tanks with composite armour and 125mm smoothbore main guns (the T-64, T-72 and T-80), in spite of the \"Small Civil War\" between different factions of the Military and Missile Industry in the late 1960s that led to the simultaneous procurement of the UR-100U, UR-100N and MR-UR-100 \"light\" ICBMs (all different designs despite their similar designation, not to mention that at the same time the R-36M Heavy ICBM and RT-21 Road Mobile ICBMs were also developed at the same time) and in spite of producing as many 3 or even 4.7 times as many SLBMs as they had missile tubes on submarines that could carry them, the Brezhnev Era Soviet Union did not get into many wars (certainly not as many as the US in the 1990s to the early 2000s with a much smaller amount of defence spending). Indeed Soviet Military Procurement during this period was driven more by internal politics than any external threat, perceived or otherwise, and even when Gorbachev entered, projects were ongoing regardless as to whether they had his approval or not. The US has never  approached this level of system diversity or pointless overproduction. Whilst Soviet Industry could produce systems considerably in excess of the requirements of the Soviet Military, the US Military has considerably reduced requirement over the course of the Cold War.\n\nIf a Military Industrial Complex gains too much influence in a country, it does not need to mire that country in Counter-insurgencies to ensure that money is still spent. If a Military Industrial Complex has enough influence, it will ensure that the money spend that money regardless  if the country is at peace.",

Again, he does this because it wouldn’t fit his argument\n—the information on Japanese doubts as to continuing the war is nice, but there’s no way for the Americans to have known that at the time; this makes his argument about the unencessity of dropping the bombs utterly irrelevant",

I think that people in the Balkans do still remember thousands of civilians killed by the NATO troops.\n I believe it has more to do with the fact that these countries are not actually sovereign in their foreign policy, having to chose either America-EU or Russia as their big daddy ally, cus you have to buy products you can't produce yourself somewhere => you have to trade with the large countries, and to the most Balkan states the US-EU are much preferred trade partners. Look at Georgia and Armenia, the two are very close to each other and to them that choice is way less obvious, since the EU is far and trading costs are higher due to longer supply chains. When the choice isn't that obvious Georgia chose the West, while Armenia chose Russia.",

You have to lift these pink glasses, man, there are no good and bad agents in the global politics, countries are fighting for their interests, that's it. Look at Armenia and Azerbaijan, if you want to see an example of how economic interests of regional powers meet cultural differences - and literally everyone is in their right, but also in the wrong.\nBut NATO troops still killed the most civilians with their bombings in the Yugoslav wars, more than Serbian and Croatian troops combined.

But against an enemy with guided missiles, a quadrimotor strategic bombers can only resort to electronic or physical countermeasures : it cannot  dodge, it's big, slow, fly straight and high.\nSo from that perspective, it's clear the presence of missiles pushed heavenly towards low flying high speed fighter bombers. \nFlying low can also help accuracy for a bombardment, so I guess the nature of the objective (being often small, hidden and in the jungle) forced to rely on more precision. Also because a fighter bomber carries less, so carpet bombing is less efficient.\n\nConsidering the technologies of the time, and the willingness of the Soviet to give material and training to the Vietnamese, exposing planes to flak might have been the lesser evil.

        "text": "@prierepanda2186 The countermeasure would be to not rely so damn much on air power. The US military, and in particular the USAF is way too married to the idea that air power can solve everything. Except that no it cant. Because it often tends to ignore the fact that air power is expensive to maintain. your average combat aircraft easily costs tens of thousands of dollars to maintain per flight hour on top of the tens of millions for the aircraft itself. That by itself is fine if you know, your bombing expensive infrastructure like cities or multi million dollar pieces of military hardware, or many hundreds of millions of dollars in naval waship's, yeah that's when air power works well. But using these same aircraft to bomb what amounts to poorly trained insurgents and rebels with kalashnikovs and bamboo huts (and missing most of the time), its not exactly a good strategy if you care even the slightest about cost effectiveness. Not to mention the incredibly bad optics of constantly bombing the shit out of innocent civilians.\n\nOf course this ignores the fact that the best strategy for dealing with Vietnam was simply to never go there in the first place. While yes the Vietnamese turned to communism, after the end of the Vietnam war, they quickly showed they had no interest in becoming a Chinese or Soviet puppet either, as the Chinese then tried to invaded Vietnam in the late 70's and it predictably went poorly for them too. And before the US even got involved in Vietnam, the Vietnamese where mangling the french pretty good too. Vietnam was never going to be a real threat to China, France or the US, until all three got the pig headed idea to try and invade the place.",

    "text": "One thing I will say, as I noted specifically with you mentioning Georgia and Ukraine, and how Russia views it as encirclement. With these two countries specifically, part of the reason why we even bother trying with the whole \"spreading our values\" route is because the people there tend to be much more receptive to them. Viewing them as pawns in a great game of Chess that Russia doesn't want to lose, while true to some extent, also ignores the will of the people there, who often *want* to join NATO (specifically to protect them against Russia, same with many other countries in Eastern Europe like the Baltics), and the same goes for joining the EU. It isn't so much the case for the Middle East and Asia, as many of the people there aren't used to building and maintaining modern institutions. Think if you tried to instate liberal democracy in Saudi Arabia tomorrow. It would be a shitshow, it's why it, if anything, needs to be a slow transition, not breaking down the door and attempting regime change, especially since in many of those countries, the US has been much more keen on simply installing a compliant anti-communist autocrat (basically a fascist) instead of an actual attempt at some \"you will love liberal democracy or else\"\n\nI think the disconnection goes both ways. Many people view Ukraine and Georgia like it's a Risk game, but simply have the intellectualized morality to understand that killing people is bad, actually, even if you're not there. I'm not implying you support Russia's invasion or anything, but it's a really annoying creeping feeling I've always seen on the left. IMO, it gives me vibes of being the other side of the same coin where people on the right often make excuses for colonialism and imperialism. Same mindset, same mental tools, just used in the Opposite Polarity",

During this time, you actually had a pretty \"old guard\" sort of arrangement in the USAF who very much still had their heads in WW2-styled \"bomb them until their industry is dust\" mentality. McNamara had to reign in guys like Curtis LeMay who just wanted to drop nukes on Hanoi like it was Japan all over again. The problem - as we know now - is pretty apparent: WW2 isn't Vietnam, and Vietnam wasn't WW2. Even if by conventional measures, the US was doing pretty well against the NVA, the sheer political pressure as well as the war exhaustion of the whole conflict was only growing wider by trying to be so forceful. It didn't help that the RoV in the South had practically collapsed by '63, and what came after was pretty much just a military government which had like, next to no popular support. \n\nIt's easy to see all the parallels with Afghanistan, where the US goes in with their heads in a \"Grand Battle, Shock and Awe\" sort of mentality that - like in WW2, worked in their previous war (in Kuwait), but falls apart basically as soon as you have to shift gears.",

Gotta add another point to the whole \"the US believe that military presence can shape country's politics\", especially in Afghanistan's case, may as well be influenced by the USSR's invasion of Afghanistan, since despite being a failure which has greatly influenced the collapse of the Soviet Union, the soviet military presence had had a somewhat positive effect (mostly in cities, since rural regions were often controlled by the Taliban) on Afghanistan's economy, being shaped in image of the USSR. But what Americans may not realize is that USSR has brought engineers, scientists and teachers to build schools and hospitals while occupying the country, not just soldiers. You cannot reshape a country just by bringing in troops and having them stay there, you have to actually do something, build some infrastructure, teach the locals to maintain the system you are trying to build.

    "text": "The interesting question to me is how will US foreign policy evolve over the coming decades? Yes, the Blob is unpunished, but most of the public seems to be sick of the idea of foreign interventions. Out of the three possible paths, that is, one, to stay at home and just be isolationist, two, to intervene everywhere like the Bush administration and the middle ground which is Biden or Obama, obviously option 2 is very unlikely. So that leaves a middle ground or going isolationist. If they go isolationist, they won't defend Taiwan, and since China is the new rival that needs to be contained it would be likely that Taiwan gets defended, unless a true isolationist is in power. \n\nWithin the Donald Trump cohort of the Republican Party there seems to be a faction which does not care at all for the Blob and probably would just do the exact opposite of what they said if they were in power again. The guy himself was too sporadic and unfocused to have any real impact on foreign policy while he was in office, but the message that you *can* deny them seems to have gotten out.\n\nThe Biden/moderate camp of the Democratic Party is the exact same as always. However the progressive side of the party is ideologically non-interventionist and very sceptical of these traditional powers and also everything related to big money. So the obvious answer to the question is, which way things go depends on who gets elected, specifically if one of these two more emergent factions can actually win and implement their vision. I think that full isolationism is pretty unlikely since the US is just too big and has certain values in common with the rest of the liberal democratic West which it can't ignore. They tried that in the interwar period and ended up just having to choose sides again.",

Although the \"training\" the ANA received was inconsistent, at best. When you have villages risking imprisonment  and death to smuggle Taliban Judges back into the area to adjudicate issues, then smuggling them back out, when they could just go \"down the road\" (relatively speaking) to the Afghan puppet government, that's a sign you won't win. \n\nThe initial invasion was BS, the Taliban were initially aiding us in locating Al-Qaeda camps to target; then we invaded to install a puppet state. A punitive war against Al-Qaeda, where a good chunk of it's infrastructure and leadership are hiding out in Afghanistan is one thing (especially where the Taliban weren't especially fond of them, they just hadn't given them a reason to go after them); trying to overthrow the legitimate sovereign of a country is another. It's not that the majority of Afghan's cared whether the Taliban were in power or not, they just weren't interested in what we were trying to shove down their throat.\n\nLess than 5 years into that mess, it was already becoming noticed that Afghanistan was becoming like Vietnam, a conflict that was wrong to begin with, and was being dragged out to try and help the \"powerful\" save face, and to consolidate even more wealth into the hands of a few (warhawks, MIC, ect). A song by Tom Paxton sums it up:\n\n \"Lyndon Johnson told the nation\nHave no fear of escalation\nI am trying everyone to please\nThough it isn't really war\nWe're sending fifty thousand more\nTo help save Vietnam from the Vietnamese\"",

    "text": "For the record, I want to point out a couple things on foreign policy:\n\n1. When I lived in Massachusetts, there was town called Devens that was not too far away from where I live. It was a town where the biggest driver of economic growth was the Military Barracks. Around the time of the great recession the barracks was shut down, and ever since that period of time, the economy has never recovered. This kind of dilemma is a consistent issue in the United States. Military Spending is not just about bombs, it's about jobs and maintaining the economic foundation of many local governments. The idea of the military industry complex and that American politics is simply driven by the interest of elites with an ideological goal ignores the legacy of the New Deal and WW2 on how America's economy is fundamentally structured. There are multiple webs of interests that extend from the lower to the upper classes of America that drive the often incoherent aspects of US foreign policy, and just like our healthcare system or our welfare system in general, those webs are filled with special interests, activists, unions, lobbyists all fighting for a piece of the pie. \n\n2. This is the primary issue of Trump. A lot of people liked Trump, the same way a lot of people like a shock to the body as a cure for monotony. However, not understanding the system and how it works, and treating it based off a whim driven by outrage, is how we had the poor reaction to the pandemic, especially compared to other nations that had far less capacity or resources to fight it like we did. An ideology can be wrong and at least understood and criticized, incoherence is what American politics produces generally speaking, because the people have no idea how the system operates and what would have to be given up across the board, so the media gives them the culture war, so they can blame some other groups of people for the existence and incoherence of the system. And in the midst of the confusion the status quo operates, not because it's better, but because there's no coherent alternative and even if it did exist, it would not be propagated by the kind of person who would run for office.",

China is aging rapidly, they have few allies on the world stage, they have a largely poorly educated population, a de-industrializing economy, and slowing economic growth. I would not say these problems are insurmountable, but they do stand as an impressive barrier if China is to continue to grow into a world hegemon. \n\nIt will be interesting how the US and western countries factor into the international order if Asia and Africa come to dominate the global economy.

Read up on the 2019 RAND corporation report \"Extending Russia\", read up on how the US has opposed the Nord Stream pipelines for several decades, openly promoting its destruction/decommission all the way, read up on how involved the US was in the unconstitutional transfer of power in Kiev 2014, and how the west (taking their cue from the US) were opposed to honouring the Minsk agreement they signed (Angela, Hollande and Poroshenko has all admitted that it was a deceit from the start). This war is a huge transfer of peoples' tax money to the military industrial complex, bringing in huge profits for those who control US foreign policy. It is even more profitable than the war against Afghanistan and Iraq was at its height, and the US has been desperately trying to create a new war as popular (or more) as the Afghan/Iraq wars was (by popular I mean a war that its population will gladly and unquestioningly throw their tax money at thinking it is a just war). The US has between 2014 and 2022 openly supported the Kiev in ruthlessly attacking its own population in an attempt to oppress those who opposed how their country's constitution was violated at the start of 2014. Donbas has been Europe's west bank for long enough, we don't need a Ukraine that strives to be a big Israel in Europe.\n\nIf you meant the US has done well in forming the narrative in Ukraine in 2022, then yeah, time will show if they did better this time than they did in forming the narrative for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the WMD's and so on. The narrative will change at some point; I'm sure of that, Bonhoeffers theory of stupidity is always limited in time.",

I was surprised in 2022 by the way Russia responded militarily though, was more expecting a 40 000 \"peacekeeper\" force sent into the Donbas only to calm the situation and make Kiev perhaps more inclined to agreeing to the Minsk 2 agreement or some other diplomatic solution.

There are many eastern European countries with a large Russian minority. I think the proper model to deal with these was South Ossetia, but Putin really upended what restrainers like me thought of his strategy when he went after the Ukrainian capital. I appreciate how Russia has helped Armenia combat Azeri aggression and what they did in Syria, but this \"special military operation\" in Ukraine will only succeed in accomplishing in the EXACT OPPOSITE goals that he claims he wanted to accomplish. NATO is stronger than ever, Ukraine is finally mostly united (against Russia) and groups like Azov will have a never-ending supply of radicalized recruits. Crime has also skyrocketed and the endless weapons shipments from the West will ensure the area will be destabilized for years.",

        "text": "@warmlycalculated390 The civil war in Syria is not a conflict founded in anti-Turkish sentiment, it is not a conflict between those who want friendly relation with Turkiye and those who want to cancel Turkiye. Same can be said about the cartel issues in Mexico, it is not anti-American in nature and there is no talk about Mexico turning against the US of A in any way. In addition, Turkye has not been deceived diplomatically by encroaching and hostile great power rivals in Syria like Russia was with the Minsk agreements.\nWhen it comes to the capital of Ukraine, Russia never laid proper siege to it, they didn't commit enough men to even get close to doing so, they were also holding back on shelling the city center of Kiev even though they were well within range with artillery and had huge amounts of long range missiles they could use for that (that is if they wanted to harm Ukrainian leadership); the big convoy of 20-30 thousand Russian soldiers that approached Kiev from the north-west were firstly meant to cause disarray and make Ukraine redirect forces from the south-east so it would be easier to break through in the south which they did, it was secondarily meant to intimidate Kiev into taking the option of negotiations seriously in the hope that the conflict could be ended diplomatically before it really started (so a bluff about leveling Kiev). No one had good estimations about how many Russian soldiers were in proximity of Kiev in the convoy to the north-west and approaching from Chernihiv in the north-east, nor how many were actually involved in the Russian military intervention, the early estimation of 180 000 were proven pretty much correct, but many believed there was far more at the time when it happened and therefore a threat to the capital could not be ignored or underestimated, this caused uncertainty and disarray in Ukraine which was imo the main intention of the large convoy and its approach towards Kiev. NATO is not stronger than ever, it's infighting among themselves, it is running out of artillery shells and heavy equipment that it is willing to commit to Ukraine (US has a lot of heavy equipment (not artillery though), but it seems to be holding that back due to an expected war with China in the near future which the US is itching for.); Sweden and Finland is sure being fast-tracked membership (Turkey, Hungary, and Croatia are all skeptical about approving their membership requests, Sweden won't become a member for sure, Finland might perhaps get it in 2023, but Finland is reluctant to go into NATO without Sweden for historical and relational reasons); France is questioning their NATO reliance, and all over Europe anti-NATO protests have exploded in frequency and size. The equipment sent from the west that go missing will mostly flow towards the middle east, Africa and towards Europe, relatively small amounts will likely end up in the arms of Russian crime syndicates (i.e. the destabilization you refer to will affect the west more than Russia I think), and this will be mainly the fault of the west who decided to prolong the war and suffering by pretending Russia's intervention was unprovoked and therefore being absolutists about Ukraine not having to compromise one bit to resolve this 9 year long hot conflict, this conflict with Russia over Ukraine was easily avoidable, but the west has been dead set on it happening for decades, so Russia in the end gave the west what it obviously wanted for so long.\n\nI hope we can continue the conversation in a civil manner even though it gets heated over our disagreements on the matter. \n\nP.S. I'm not saying Russia is fantastic or something like that; I'm just frustrated by how irrational, arrogant, and ignorant the west has been acting my entire life; and that demonizing Russia while pretending the west is mostly a force of good without a lick of nuance is not the way forward towards resolutions and reconciliation that is needed for a more peaceful tomorrow.",

The reason why it hasn't happened is because the US who invaded Syria in 2014 is occupying 1/3 of Syria and has told Turkiye that any Turkish invasion into US occupied Syria is out of the question.\n\nSo, my point is that I'm not sure where you are coming from with your sniff test statement, that I'm not sure I understand what you mean with it.",

So they turned Vietnam and Cambodia into a moonscape, hardly capable of sustaining life. And what happened afterwards? None of the other countries turned to communism. The US wasn't really interested in Vietnam, they wanted to make sure that Indonesia, Thailand and every other country doesn't get any ideas. And if you look at the state of Vietnam's neighbours today, from the perspective of the Blob, it was a massive success, Indonesia is frequently described as \"Gangster Capitalism\" and in Thailand the biggest power structure is the military backed monarchy.\n\nAs far as the Blob is concerned, they STOPPED Domino theory.
