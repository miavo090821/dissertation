of the murder of um you know one of the most pivotal figures in all of human history uh in many ways the Jesus of the 20th century Ernesto chavara someone who you have uh behind you as as do I somewhere around up there uh someone who dedicated their whole life to the cause and who was not just this Brazen militant who was ready to go to the jungle and be the first one in any Guerilla struggle to um you know the first one in to fight but he was also an incredibly complete human being as a theoretician he was as brilliant as they come and one of the things that he emphasized you know to bring it back to the cultural revolution was the necessity that socialism had of creating a new man you know socialism is not just about changing the institutions of society political ideological economic Etc socialism is about creating a new human being a human being that's much more human than ever before that embodies the best qualities of what it is uh of what it means to be human at a at a level of fullness that uh that we've never seen before so uh Eddie what are some of your thoughts I know chavara is uh I think you're number one in terms of uh revolutionaries but uh someone who has of course been very influential for you um what are your thoughts on on the day of his uh murder yeah absolutely I I he some somebody who I admire theoretically um like he he was well read and he wrote a lot of really interesting things um including about the Ceno Soviet split and the Cuban perspective but the the thing I admire the most about him is his character and and his will and you know I've been thinking about this a lot lately and this is what a lot of my speech will focus on at the ACP convention like at the individual level politics comes down to character a lot of the time right it comes down to having principles being able to stand on those principles and being able to defend those principles even when you're being suppressed or losing your job or or violently attacked or doxed or having your family members threatened and Chay was someone who stood on his principles almost to a fault there was a story um that's written in chay's excellent biography by John Lee Anderson which I recommend everybody read it's incredible piece of work um him and Fidel had been captured by some reactionaries and they were basically saying tell us you're not communist and we'll let you go and Fidel was like okay I'm not a communist let me go and then Chay was like no I am a communist I'm a Marxist it's not my fault reality as Marxist he wouldn't say no that he wasn't a communist just so he could leave jail because he didn't want to lie he he wanted to stand on business he wanted to stand on principle and that's just the the kind of person he was he was also the kind of person who would um when he was running Cuba's industry uh running that section of the government he would also go out in the streets and work with the Cuban people and there's a famous picture of him doing some construction work in like shoveling um in a street somewhere in Cuba because he thought the person who was running the country's industry should be involved with actually working and and see how those Industries work at the the Grassroots level so he was someone who was so well- read and had such a deep understanding of Marxism compared to the people around him that he was the one who had to run Cuba's industry he had to be the economics guy and that was a job he did very well despite the fact that it wasn't his favorite he would rather be out doing other things um but that that's just a testament to his discipline right like while this guy while he was leading the revolution in in the escomb they were setting up schools they were building schools during the Guerilla war and teaching people Marxism in the escomb mountains and Chay and Raul Castro were leading these Marxism classes to to educate the Cuban peasants and at their level of Consciousness like every everything that you would want to be as as a Marxist Chay was the epitome of that and it's funny because you know people in the west like uh Cuban gusanos or whatever old men will be like uh you know you wear Chay gavara on your shirt but you don't understand what he stood for you kids don't actually understand like no I understand exactly what I he stood for and the more I learn about him the more I admire him and the more I want to be like him someone who was well R who was kind to those around him who had the respect of everybody who wasn't you know who was the first to to lead his troops into battle um not just sit back and and sit on his butt um just the epitome of what a communist should be and uh somebody who I I genuinely think about every day um and and question what would he do and last thing he was [ __ ] hated by Communists in Cuba the Communists in Cuba in Havana who are a bunch of academics and a bunch of losers and a bunch of people who just like talking about Marxism but not actually doing anything and they thought Chay was an adventurist they thought he was stupid for going to reach these dirty Cuban peasants who are illiterate and backwards and dumb and we just needed to wait for capitalism to come to Cuba so these peasants can be transformed into workers and then we can have socialism and Chase said no screw you I'm going to go organize the peasants I'm going to teach them Marxism and we're going to over throw this gangster dictatorship and build socialism and that's exactly what they did and of course you know the academic marxists um then after the revolution realized he was correct but it's sound familiar exactly it's it's the same it's it's the same and and that's you know people people think Chay must have been universally beloved by the Communists in Cuba no they were a bunch of do nothing dick weeds sitting in their Ivory Tower talking about Marx and doing nothing to advance the class struggle which Yes sounds very familiar extremely familiar as lennin was fond of saying they think they're the brains of the nation but they're actually the [ __ ] and uh you're absolutely uh right about uh Jay and uh you mentioned the fact that uh he did a tremendous job as as the minister of the economy uh but do you do you know how he got that job you remember the funny way how he got the job I don't remember the story behind that the biography is like 700 Pages some of the anecdotes but the you know he's in a room with a series of revolutionaries and they're trying to decide who's going to lead what position of the new state and someone asked in Spanish obviously K economista and Chay was kind of daing off in the back and he heard Kista so they ask who's an economist and he's in the back kind of dazing off and he hears who's a communist because in Spanish economista communist it Rhymes and he lifts his hand and they point at him and they say okay you're going to be the Minister of Economics it's gonna be your position he's like what the [ __ ] I don't I don't know anything about economics but he just took it and then he did an amazing job with it talk about someone who's you know whatever you put him to do he's gonna do an amazing an amazing job at it but that's that's how he came to to obtain that position absolutely I wish we could clone him um this is kind of interesting huji Lee says Eddie if you want to build socialism in a feudal country you need to delete feudalism and traditionalism and the hierarchy of feudalism so going back to our conversation earlier this is why Chay loved the cultural revolution like he was almost a bit of an ultra um in like a good way because he just like lived his life like a man from the future like the you know the epitome of what a communist should be and that's why he needed Fidel who was more of the pragmatist and more of the you know I'm going to do what's necessary um even if you know that means maybe making some concessions or making some tactical Retreats but Chay was super pro-china super pro sided with China in the Ceno Soviet split he called his child my little Mao um and he loved the cultural revolution for that reason he believed that these backwards feudal practices needed to be undone through education and other things and that's like when they were building schools and teaching people Marx M during the Guerilla struggle like that's his that was his idea is we need to elevate the consciousness of the people and and break this old feudal system and feudal culture so Chay would agree with you for sure he was uh I mean he was the the socratic gadfly for the Socialist state of Cuba that's what he was remember Socrates at the end he says you know I have been sent by God I'm your gadfly the one that's always questioning everything and and helping you on the basis of that questioning get better that's what Chay was he he would not leave one thing that could be critique uncriticizable gadfly um that I think socialist States uh need you know socialism doesn't mean everyone has a uniformity of thought and critique stops on the contrary that's how socialist States degenerate when you stop having the openness of critiquing and and being able to examine uh critically the trajectory that your Revolution is taking and what's interesting you know to hit on the theme of Education that we mentioned briefly that's Central to this construction of a new human being uh when I was in Mexico uh earlier this year I had the opportunity to speak with one of the people that runs the um chivara Center in Cuba alongside ala the two alas his daughter and his wife and one of the things she mentioned to me uh knowing that I'm a philosopher and and one of my areas of specialty is agel is that Chay towards uh in some of his last years specifically when he was in in the jungles in Africa he was reading Hegel and not just any Hegel he was reading the science of logic so the perhaps one of the most dense texts you could probably get a hold of in the history of all of humanity uh was being read by by J in the middle of uh of of of difficult combat against uh colonialism so uh just an an all overall incredible a human being of the future that as the Cuban saying goes we should all strive to be that's the the the the saying basically like the pledge of allegiance that that Cuban kids say in school it's Pioneers for communism strive to be like right before my my grandfather died he was in a sort of semi vegetative state unable to speak for many months before he passed but right before he passed uh literally the night of I I told him it was his birthday and I told him uh when the room emptied I said and with his last breath it might have been the last thing he ever said before he died he said um let strive to be like CH so that's a spirit that animates the Cuban people who've been able to fight back against more than six Decades of hybrid Warfare and a brutal illegal criminal uh blockade um and and many different other tactics that are within the the toolbox of imperialism as Eddie spond of calling it that's the spirit that animates them and that's the spirit that animates every communist every freedom fighter from around the world
