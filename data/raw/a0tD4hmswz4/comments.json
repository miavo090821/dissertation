Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as danger0us in a man as hydr0ph0bia in a d0g, there is this fearful fatalistic apathy. The effects are apparent in many c0untries. Impr0vident habits, sl0venly systems 0f agriculture, sluggish meth0ds 0f c0mmerce, and insecurity 0f pr0perty exist wherever the f0ll0wers 0f the Pr0phet rule 0r live. A degraded sensualism deprives this life 0f its grace and refinement; the next 0f its dignity and sanctity. The fact that in M0hammedan law every w0man must bel0ng t0 s0me man as his abs0lute pr0perty – either as a child, a wife, 0r a c0ncubine – must delay the final extincti0n 0f slavery until the faith 0f Islam has ceased t0 be a great p0wer am0ng men. Th0usands bec0me the brave and l0yal s0ldiers 0f the faith: all kn0w h0w t0 die but the influence 0f the religi0n paralyses the s0cial devel0pment 0f th0se wh0 f0ll0w it. N0 str0nger retr0grade f0rce exists in the w0rld. Far fr0m being m0ribund, M0hammedanism is a militant and pr0selytizing faith. It has already spread thr0ugh0ut Central Africa, raising fearless warri0rs at every step; and were it n0t that Christianity is sheltered in the str0ng arms 0f science, the science against which it had vainly struggled, the civilisati0n 0f m0dern Eur0pe might fall, as fell the civilisati0n 0f ancient R0me.”\n\n― Winst0n Churchill, The River War - 1899",

Impr0vident habits, sl0venly systems 0f agriculture, sluggish meth0ds 0f c0mmerce, and insecurity 0f pr0perty exist wherever the f0ll0wers 0f the Pr0phet rule 0r live. A degraded sensualism deprives this life 0f its grace and refinement; the next 0f its dignity and sanctity. The fact that in M0hammedan law every w0man must bel0ng t0 s0me man as his abs0lute pr0perty – either as a child, a wife, 0r a c0ncubine – must delay the final extincti0n 0f slavery until the faith 0f Islam has ceased t0 be a great p0wer am0ng men.

And it’s commanded.\n\nHijrah is not just a word for “migration.”\n\nIn Islam, it is a religious obligation to migrate to non-Muslim lands with the purpose of spreading Islam and establishing it as the dominant system.\n\nThis idea goes straight back to Muhammad himself, who fled Mecca to Medina in 622 AD, not to escape war, but to strategically build power. \n\nThat migration, known as the original Hijrah, marks the official beginning of the Islamic calendar, that’s how central and celebrated it is in Islam.\n\nFrom that moment on, Hijrah became a model for Islamic conquest:\n\n•Move into non-Muslim lands\n•Form insular Muslim communities\n•Build mosques and religious institutions\n•Gain legal and political footholds\n•Slowly implement Islamic norms and law (Sharia)\n•Ultimately, replace host culture with Islamic supremacy\n\nDon’t take my word for it. Take Muhammad’s:\n\n“I have been commanded to fight the people until they say ‘There is no god but Allah.’” — Sahih al-Bukhari 385\n\nThis isn’t just religious language. It’s a battle plan.\n\nThe Quran itself praises those who leave their homes for the cause of Allah:\n\n“Those who migrated for the cause of Allah after being wronged, We will surely settle them in this world in a good place.” - Quran 16:41\n\n“And whoever emigrates for the cause of Allah will find many locations and abundance.” — Quran 4:100\n\nMuslim Brotherhood ideologue Yusuf al-Qaradawi was blunt about it:\n\n“We will conquer Europe, we will conquer America, not through the sword, but through Da’wah (proselytizing) and Hijrah.”\n\nThis isn’t about bombs falling. It’s about a command to spread Islam. Always. Everywhere. No matter the conditions.\n\nAnd until America and Europe understands Hijrah as a weapon of conquest, we will keep losing ground - politically, legally, demographically, and culturally.",

But this is predicated upon the person's becoming in every facet an American, and nothing but an American...There can be no divided allegiance here. Any man who says he is an American, but something else also, isn't an American at all. We have room for but one flag, the American flag... We have room for but one language here, and that is the English language... and we have room for but one sole loyalty and that is a loyalty to the American people.\n\nTheodore Roosevelt",

Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as danger0us in a man as hydr0ph0bia in a d0g, there is this fearful fatalistic apathy. The effects are apparent in many c0untries. Impr0vident habits, sl0venly systems 0f agriculture, sluggish meth0ds 0f c0mmerce, and insecurity 0f pr0perty exist wherever the f0ll0wers 0f the Pr0phet rule 0r live. A degraded sensualism deprives this life 0f its grace and refinement; the next 0f its dignity and sanctity. The fact that in M0hammedan law every w0man must bel0ng t0 s0me man as his abs0lute pr0perty – either as a child, a wife, 0r a c0ncubine – must delay the final extincti0n 0f slavery until the faith 0f Islam has ceased t0 be a great p0wer am0ng men. Th0usands bec0me the brave and l0yal s0ldiers 0f the faith: all kn0w h0w t0 die but the influence 0f the religi0n paralyses the s0cial devel0pment 0f th0se wh0 f0ll0w it. N0 str0nger retr0grade f0rce exists in the w0rld. Far fr0m being m0ribund, M0hammedanism is a militant and pr0selytizing faith.

        "text": "I drove 6 and a half hours from my home, to Dearborn. What I knew about it was it was a *MARCH* for the first amendment, when I showed up I saw the people I would be marching with have a \"America doesn't want Islamazation.\" & I went \"Oh its changed? I'm okay with this.\" 😂 it started small, the Palestine protestors. Within 10 minutes of the March we had dozens of young Muslims surrounding the March, yelling Alluah akbar, a 13 year old slapped the man who led the charge, he slapped a Quran with a pack of bacon, I wish I saw that, I only saw the bacon in his hand 😂.  A muslima tried to get in my husband's face & scream at him \"No Trump, no KKK\" & I happily pushed her to get out of my husband's personal space (he's 6'3\", I just wanted the camel out of my place besides my husband 😂. She hated me after that but I didn't care, yelling in my face won't stop me from marching. Eventually made a joke to my husband about these 2 muslimas following us throughout the entire March, \"I know why her husband isn't here with us, *SHES EXPIRED* she's too old to be married now!\" 😂 My husband and the few fellow marchers around us laughed & that joke actually shut her up for about a minute before she just started throwing slurs. I started making rude, FACTUAL jokes about Islam because they just wanted to yell in my face and call me slurs, there was no debating with those moronic females. We also had 5 muslim men follow us along with the 2 muslimas. One was as tall as my husband with a tooth gap that china would happily build a bridge over, was so angry with my existence he held his fist in my face while screaming at me in Arabic (I know what they said but I didn't care to translate for my husband). We had our 2nd amendment on us the entire March. The tall muslim did intimidate me with his anger and I thought \"damn I better get my husband cuz he could knock me out with 1 punch and I wouldn't be able to retaliate\" and just having my husband in front of me made that angry muslim back out of my face. Just before 5:18p.m I told another of the male Muslims following us \"It's almost time for prayer, you already missed one prayer being here, you better be a good muslim and go pray at 5:18P.M\" oh man, he lost his shit on me in Arabic he couldn't even say his first 2 words in English right, he just lost it bc why? I knew their shit and easily use it against them. Did they go pray? No. They missed the last 3 call to prayers to be protestors against the Christian March. There were a few non-teen/non-youth Arabs, like grown men, following the March. So it's not all teenagers and young adults, but for the most part it was. They're not true Muslims. They're taking the title but not even being faithful to it. If anything, the youth WANT to be jihadists, even though they don't follow the rest of their faith truthfully. They don't even know what's going on in their own muslim countries, if anything they're more American than muslim for being so arrogant to their own beliefs outside of the violent part of it.",

Remember  Al-Jawlani an Alqaeda operative with a 10 million dollar bounty on his head by the US is now the Syrian president.

In the USA you have every right to criticize the government and your elected officials. As far as Actual Justice Warrior goes he does good on things even if I don't always agree with him on everything. He has no need to apologize and heads up I won't apologize either as I have accurately explained what was said. What was said from the mayor of dearborn is absolutely anti-american which shouldn't be tolerated anymore. I've had this stance on many conversations after recent events this year as we shouldn't give a single inch to your stance or this mayors vitriol. It is absolutely his behavior  that he needs to apologize for as he was in the wrong to a constituent of his city that he serves.

They will anchor their agnostic nominal Muslim sisters and brothers in the geography of the non-Muslim land. \n\nUnless, in the realm of debate, you can convince them of the many glaring failures of logic of their scriptures and the disgusting base nature of their greatest prophet. The most potent logic failure is the Islamic Dillemma popularised by David Wood.",

It's essential for these nations to be left alone so their people can stop feeling compelled to migrate to other countries. Everyone should educate themselves and stop believing the misleading narratives presented in school textbooks. The same can be said for Native Americans. It's frustrating to see such ignorance persist—may we all seek to understand better.",

Africans themselves do not recognise, and were not technologically advanced enough to see the minerals and various other new minerals their land had as resources.\nAfrica doesn't need any permission from foreigners to innovate, unless of course you're talking about Africans who could be working in foreign owned private and public organisations, such as the Chinese CCP and western orgs.\nAfrican gold being held in New York could easily be that the banks are in New York. Because Africa is so violently volatile that, even as an African, your gold is better kept safe outside it.\n\nThe largest hurdle time and time again that stops African countries from developing better than they currently are are the elected chiefs and government leaders who distribute resource tribally, crush dissent, hoard foreign aid, hoard foreign money, hoard foreign aid goods, seek extortional rates of tax and stop their own people from freely developing their own enterprises.",

There are  ancient societies still existing today, more populous than the first world all together, in which lying and stealing are skills not vices and hard work is only understood as something you make others do as punishment and sign of power over them. They are literally such group.  Begging is above work in that world. Why else do arabs always always rule with an iron fist and pay dearly when they don't. They practice inbreeding to literally survive, it would be foolish to trust another of their own kind if they're not blood related already.  We went the path of building civilisations.

Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as danger0us in a man as hydr0ph0bia in a d0g, there is this fearful fatalistic apathy. The effects are apparent in many c0untries. Impr0vident habits, sl0venly systems 0f agriculture, sluggish meth0ds 0f c0mmerce, and insecurity 0f pr0perty exist wherever the f0ll0wers 0f the Pr0phet rule 0r live. A degraded sensualism deprives this life 0f its grace and refinement; the next 0f its dignity and sanctity. The fact that in M0hammedan law every w0man must bel0ng t0 s0me man as his abs0lute pr0perty – either as a child, a wife, 0r a c0ncubine – must delay the final extincti0n 0f slavery until the faith 0f Islam has ceased t0 be a great p0wer am0ng men. Th0usands bec0me the brave and l0yal s0ldiers 0f the faith: all kn0w h0w t0 die but the influence 0f the religi0n paralyses the s0cial devel0pment 0f th0se wh0 f0ll0w it. N0 str0nger retr0grade f0rce exists in the w0rld. Far fr0m being m0ribund, M0hammedanism is a militant and pr0selytizing faith. It has already spread thr0ugh0ut Central Africa, raising fearless warri0rs at every step; and were it n0t that Christianity is sheltered in the str0ng arms 0f science, the science against which it had vainly struggled, the civilisati0n 0f m0dern Eur0pe might fall, as fell the civilisati0n 0f ancient R0me.”\n\n― Winst0n Churchill, The River War - 1899",
