That’s my bad, dude!***\n\n-I think maybe they didn’t actually mean it the way you took it lol (pretty sure they weren’t serious, is what I mean)-\n\nAnd if they did...that’s toxic masculinity right there\n\nWhich I’m learning I actually suffer from. Even tho I’m a woman. Which is weird to think about...a young woman who used to buy so much into “being one of the good ones” that she literally started thinking like those guys who call themselves “alphas”\n\nAnd just...I wish I could go back in time...and in the gentlest way possible....call my past self an idiot.\n\nAnd I know past me would take anything critical I said of her too hard, and she’d start crying...and then current me would feel bad, and I’d want to hug past me and tell her it’ll be okay. (Lol did any of that make any sense to anybody other than me?)\n\nAnd then I’d rip the universe apart because I’d break the spacetime continuum. Actually, I’m pretty sure Doc from Back to the Future (what I’m trying to reference for anybody that doesn’t know that) calls it the Time-Space continuum. Oh well. \n\nI just looked back to check for spelling errors, and I realized I started talking about the current me/past me thing like we’re different people. Past me was still me like...last August. But like...the way I see it, I’ve changed so much in such a short time...I’m a completely different person than I was less than a year ago. \n\nOkay, I’ve spent entirely too long writing this comment. I’m going to be done now. Peace out my dude :)",

I'm not sure which comment your really talking about, but I hope I didnt come off as offended cause I'm really not.\n\nAs for the rest I'm sorry. I dont really have any experience dealing with toxic masculinity despite being a man. My parents were actually really good about that. However I do know what it's like to feel as if you wasted a lot of time doing something you now regret. \n\nI am sorry about the whole one of the good ones thing. It's a pretty shitty standard certain parts of society have.\n\nDo try not to beat yourself up to much. We all do things we regret (in my case ten minutes after I do anything looking back on it makes me want to die.)\n\nAnd finally glad you've at least mostly got out of that mindset. I wish you the best. I have not gone back to check for spelling errors so yeah",

It convinced me, only really at the very end for my senior thesis, that in order for the world to be a better place things must change (not conserved) and systemic abuses must be addressed.",

You can always try for compromises on the small stuff: \"Ah this party wants big budget and this party a little budget, lets split the difference and get a medium budget so everyone is dissappointed.\"\n\nThis sort of thing however doesn't work for bigger issues, and the centrist take is just going with whichever binary has more support, making you as bad (or good) as they are. Think going to war for instance, there's no such thing as just doing a little bit war as a compromise. Gays can't just get half married. Criminals can't get half death penaltied. Citizens can't get just a little bit spied upon by unchecked government agencies.\n\nCentrism is not objectivism, its just bending the knee for the status quo instead of having your own opinions.",

Great logic but to be expected from this channel.",

It's very difficult to mistake anything I have written on this thread,  to come up with a position diametrically opposed to what I believe. I am addressing the bullshit of that Human Honey Wagon (Steven Crowder), who acts like he believes ALL Muslims are backward savages bent on terrorizing and annihilating \"the West\". He is a white supremacist, a bigot, a liar, and a moron.\n\nIf you genuinely can't figure out that the United States Military Industrial Complex has engaged in a decades-long campaign of aggressive provocation, to gain control of Petroleum... I don't know what to say.\n\nThe United States has committed multiple war crimes, to advance its goals. These are not mistakes. These are felonies. In the words of Noam Chomsky, \"If the Nuremberg laws were applied, then every post-war American president would have been hanged.\" Now Chomsky said that in 1990... but surely Clinton, Bush Jr., Obama, and (obviously) Trump are all equally guilty. Ilhan Omar is not Osama Bin Laden. A refugee is not a terrorist, simply because they have a tan, and a different holy book than the bible. Bin Salman is a sociopath and a criminal... and yet he gets fawning adoration from that flaming pustule currently residing in the White House. That's because his religious views are immaterial to the goal of the MIC... namely, endless war, and profiteering.... and even though he is a misogynist, and a bigot, and a murdering scumbag... the MIC tolerates him, because he supports them.",

Amusingly, only those in Right wing echo chambers think he's in the all clear, taking Trump's word of all peoplelol. \nThe heavily redacted report, that for some suspicious reason took over 2 weeks to be released, has a wealth of evidence of nefarious activities and behaviours that will likely land Trump heavy fines and maybe jail time when he leaves office. It might not get him impeached, but this definitely isn't going to go well for him. Trump is in the middle of fighting some things already going through the courts which will likely lead to his finances been further scrutinised...

Forced to dive back into obscure history and use even more elaborate reductive broken logic to justify their beliefs, or rather, what they want their audiences takeaway from their content to be... they rely on and expoilt ignorance.\n\n\nI'm surprised you came back to be honest.

At that time the Eastern Roman empire was already hiring the services of feudal knights, and when the Seljuk Turks invaded Anatolia along with a mass migration of Turks from central Asia, it severely weakened the Eastern Roman Empire. Obviously, this is a threat because the Eastern Roman Empire was basically a buffer state and eventually the Seljuk Turks were replaced by the Ottomans who conquered the Balkans, Hungary and Austria. Smaller empires are better than one big empire if you are a kingdom. But during/after the first crusade things dissolved and political tensions arose. And that basically starts with the Crusaders thinking they were betrayed by the Eastern Roman Emperor, because he was given incorrect information that some of were defeated at a battle and thus no longer went to aid them in the battle. Any conquered territory was to be given to Eastern Roman Empire, but after that incident factions arose that established their own territories. To view the expanding Seljuks Turks as a threat and viewing it necessary to strengthen the Eastern Roman Empire is justified, but anything beyond that is not.",

I find it funny how Crowder mentioned only one of those three things (the Ottomans), not Hungary or Wallachian nobility. \n\nFor an example of what I'm talking about in regards to sewing fear, after obtaining the throne of Wallachia, Vlad had a castle built for himself. This castle including a grueling prison and torture chamber specifically for the people that had his father and elder brother killed, and the torture chamber was directly underneath his bedroom. Imagine the fear that that would sew among the nobility in Wallachia.",

Blacksmithing was important and technologically wasn't really that far off from anyone else. Just that there wasn't really an unified nation, though Chieftains called themselves 'Kuningas', a word for king, which is the alternate word for similar \"Kuningaz\" word in Latin of similar meaning, keeping rather old, almost forgotten words alive. Would've been interesting to see what it would be like without the crusades. There were even legends of one notable chieftain called 'Kirmukarmu' who hunted down christians.",

In addition \"the war against terror\" constantly killing innocent people for the last 19 years is going to lead to people hating the West.

The heavy cavalry of the french were the ones needing massive resources. The hun on the otherhand didn't have that issue. The other point is the amount of armies in general that were going against the state or through some other reason unrelated to just some rich dude pointing is enough to destroy the meme outside of having the meme. Like the meme of fascists and communists being the same ideology. The truth is something most don't even want to hear. Fascism is actually the nicer form of socialism... at least in method. The communists would slash and burn and the fascists went in slow but the overall end goal was the same.",

It’s the followers who want to use it as a cover to hide their actions and misdeeds. Muhammad (pbuh) wasn’t a rapist,warmongering,pedophile. If you want to continue saying that about him. I’m pretty sure I can prove you wrong. You just can’t judge what someone did or how their past lives were by modern day standards. Three Arrows said that in the video really nicely.",

Those were roundly denounced by almost everybody. The most “supportive” thing anyone said about those riots is understanding where their anger was coming from. That’s it. Nobody fucking “supported” the riots and Biden supporters also don’t support “purging” opposition. Again, as demonstrated earlier, Biden wanted to purge literal white supremacists from the military. That’s not “purging opposition”, it’s surgically removing a cancer. It’s so fucking strange how right wingers cannot wait to defend white supremacists, WHO LITERALLY WANT TO PURGE ALL NONWHITE PEOPLE, while pretending the left wants to “purge opposition”.",

        "text": "A paper by Thomas F. Madden titled ”Rivers of Blood: An Analysis of One Aspect of the Crusader Conquest of Jerusalem in 1099” stated the following about this historical recollection:\n\n”They pointed out that Raymond’s description of the blood up to the bridle of the horses, ‘usque ad frenos equorum’ is actually drawn from Revelation 14:20: ‘and the wine press was trodden outside the city, and blood flowed from the wine press, as high as a horse’s bridle, for one thousand six hundred stadia’. In the Vulgate, the words used are ‘usque ad frenos equorum’ -the same words used by Raymond. This discovery has led most crusade historians -including myself- to view the medieval depictions of blood in the al-Aqsa Mosque or anywhere else in Jerusalem to be understood symbolically as a righteous purification of the city. This is not to deny that the massacre in 1099 was not horrible or that there was not an abundance of blood. But it is to recognize that the clerical authors of these texts were approaching their subject from other perspectives than simply a stark reporting of facts.”\n\nWhich is a view that fits the historical context of the time. The entire paper is very interesting and discusses very deeply on the topic of the blood during the massacre.",

You have to ignore hundreds of years of Muslim conquest and raiding to believe that the crusades were unprovoked aggression. In 711 AD Christian Iberia was invaded and totally subjugated by 714. France would have been conquered as well had it not been for the Frankish victory at the battle of Tours in 732 AD. In 846 AD the Muslims sacked the vicinity of Rome and only the Aurelian Wall prevented the sack of Rome itself. Muslim raiders based on the coast of north Africa raided the Mediterranean coast and took slaves from the 8th century until the 19th century!  After the Turks were conquered and assimilated into Islam they continued this Muslim aggression into the 16th century. Three Arrows refutes his own argument when he states \"Jihad was understood to be an integral part of exercising the Muslim faith\". Peaceful co-existence with this kind of aggressive expansionism is impossible. You have to be willfully ignorant of the threat Islam posed to it's neighbors to believe this nonsense.",

And the official reasoning behind the first crusade was of defensive nature and a reaction to the call for military assistant to Pope Urban II by Byzantinian Emperor Alexios I Komnenos. Crowder and his defenders seem to draw the line here and do not further question the reason why Urban did respond to this call, especially why he did react to it by calling for the crusades. For them it should all be an easy line between cause and effect. This ignores that history seldom, if ever, works like that. A big historical event, you might even want to call it a movement, like the crusdes had more than one cause.\n\n\n\nThe Seljuq Turks had already conqured most of Anatolia two decades prior to the Council of Clermont in 1095. Back then the Pope, Gregory VII, had basically called for a crusade as well but had been opposed by European leaders who refused to go. This was prior to the Investiture Controversy between the Pope and the German king. And also prior to the death of Sultan Malik-Shah I in 1092, after which the Great Seljuq Empire broke apart. And at ruthly the same time Urban II, who become Pope in 1088, and Alexios I had started talks about ending the open schism between Rome and Byzantium that had started in 1054. There were of course other factors as well, but these are three major factors that played a role in why the First Crusade ever became a reality. It was a combination of several things that had happened in the years prior not just one.",

Basically his entire video exist to fire up Islamophobia and serve as justification for the call of a culture war that exists on the right.

And I don't even see how Three Arrows was wrong in pointing out that the cause of the First Crusade was not as clear cut as \"Seljuk Turks attacked Byzantian Empire, rolled over them, were already at the gates of Byzantium itself and thusly threatened the existence of Christanity itself\". It's obvious that the church had to claim that the Crusade was defensive in nature in order to call it a just war. But if you really are an historian, you should know not to take any historical sources at face value and subject them to source criticism.

I know because I was there and served with them and against them. I saw the intel and actually took part in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.  I have trained soldiers from Egypt, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Afghanistan as well as led American and Allied troops in battle. There is a scary, as in substantial, enough MINORITY of the Islamic world that is fine with a war against the West.  I didn't see Crowder, or too many on the right, as calling for a Crusade against Islam so again 3 Arrows is creating a straw man that really does not exist in his ridiculous paranoia about the right. It is leftist hyperbole.   How many Islamic countries allow other religions to exist unhindered and free to follow their religion including no limits on proselytization?  There isn't very many.  Compare that to the West. Whenever that is mentioned people like 3 Arrows and others on the left have a conniption.   I doubt 3 Arrows, or most here, have spent any time in the Islamic world.  To be sure there are many secular Muslims with modern views, but they are not the majority.  It is way more complicated than either 3 Arrows or Crowder is admitting and for all his faults Crowder is probably closer to the mark than 3 Arrows. 3 Arrow's raison d'etre is creating straw man arguments against the right.  The problem is people do not go to Crowder for history, unfortunately, it appears that many on the left look to 3 Arrows for their history and geopolitical lessons.\n\n\nAs far as paragraph 2 that is why historians study not only the sources but something called historiography.  My point is that even if the Crusaders were not a defensive war, you can't argue that they looked at as such.  Whether it was a defensive war is determined by something called historical analysis.  The current historical consensus of the analysis is that it was a defensive war.  It was not only the Seljuk's that presented the threat but Muslims in Spain and in along the North African coast.  The anonymous Ask Historians Thread can't rant all they want, but there is plenty of evidence of multiple Islamic violence against the coastal areas of the Mediterranean world.  If they dislike the analysis why don't they submit a peer-reviewed paper on the subject?  That is usually how the professionals do it.  Unless you have something further that is actually historical I will get back to my lesson prep for tomorrow.",

The main point is, they received aggressions for 450 years from the muslims (which had just been founded... they started attacking from day 1 of their existence....), and only replied after 450 years with the first crusade (1095). Then we are taught of it as an aggression, when really they are trying to reclaim what was lost to them. This baffoon also tries to sideline with saying that they had a ''golden era'', yea ok. How does that change the fact that the crusades were a defensive act? The saddest thing is so many people fall for it.\nThe anti-white/christian narrative is too strong right now, and people just angle it against them all the time. Doesn't matter what real facts are.",

Although in 846AD the Abbasids attacked Rome, the first crusade was not until 1096, thats a whole 250 years later, for understanding of how long that is, the USA is only 244 years old, the time between the sacking of Rome and the first crusade is longer than the time between the birth of the US and now. by that point, Jerusalem hadn't been ruled by Christians for 458 years, which again to provide an idea of how long that is, that same time is from 1562 to now, aka the time the first French colonists landed in the Americas till now. By the time of the crusades were there wars between islamic and christian states? yes, but they were not religious wars, more rather for control over regions that provided wealth and prosperity and in fact in this time, the Christians were starting to pose more of a threat to muslims, with the start of the Reconquista in Spain. Was there always peace between the Islamic and Christian world? no. But it's ignorant and completely ignores things to bring up these dates and events in relation to something that happened 250 years later.",

Anybody could do anything to you with no fear of repercussions. If you convert to Christianity in any Muslim country today you forfeit your life. You don’t seem to give a fuck about Islamic belief. Christianity is the greatest sin anybody can commit. It is classified as Shirk, that is the worship or anything other than Allah (meaning Jesus) and part of it is implying that God had a son. Shirk is unforgivable in Islam. It is one of if not THE greatest sin. People die for it even today. \n\nThe west is undoubtedly Christian. Western civilization is literally built on Judeo-Christian values. You can’t deny this and pretend to have any credibility. You say the west isn’t Christian because it separates church and state. My friend, the separation of church and state IS a Christian value. It is right out of the mouth of Jesus.

Your second article has to do with an immigration method that's basically a loophole in immigration law (it's the one that has to do with people being allowed to come here if they have a child who is a legal citizen).

They were offensive (there were many, but as a whole, they were offensive more so than defensive).  As for Climate Change... Who said that a Market solution was not possible?  Crowder?  Me?  No.  I concur with Potholer54 here;  A market solution to climate change is possible.   If China can do it, so to can we, The United States of America. Furthermore, last I checked, Crowder did not think Climage change was even real (the Global increase in temperature part at least).  As for the Green new deal... that's an incomplete wish list of things that would LIKE to be done to curb climate change (the paper was removed from its original source due to being incomplete).  IF the government must intervene to overcome the collective action problem, then so be it, but if BOTH a market solution and government solution is possible, then I say \"Let's do it\".\n\n\nHave you seen Potholer54's Conservative solution to climate change video?  If not, then go watch that (there are 2 parts).\n\n\n\"And he's right on some regards like the polar bears there's study showing that the polar bear population is increasing and how ice in Antarctica is still growing at a net rate. \"\n\n\nGood guess, but actually no.  The population is growing, BUT with climate change advancing as it is, there will be no polar bears (no land to live in).  Did you not see Potholer54's response to this point in the first instance of Potholer54's response to Crowder?  Why is it that you seem to have not seen that?\n\n\nDisclaimer: Potholer54 is being sourced here due to having a history of good reading comprehension and accurate reporting of information.",

        "text": "@thecrusaderfortress2132 When you mention that the first crusade happened to retake Jerusalem, I assumed you are meaning it is purely because of that. Well, this is how it happened: Byzantines were losing against the Seljuk Turks. So they call for help from the Pope Urban II. They wanted a group of merceneries to help them defeat the Seljuk Turks, but instead a Crusade happened - Pope Urban II used this as chance to begin the first crusade. The Pope made a speech which he mention that the Muslims are persecuting Christians, despite Muslim rulers being arguably better. This spark a outrage to the audience and caused them to join the Crusade. The Crusaders, could be motivated by many factors which is wealth, religion or power. Jerusalem may not be the goal of the Crusade but just ended up getting taken, scholars are still debating about it. Plus, when the people of Jerusalem surrendered, the crusaders just simply killed everyone in the city, even the Christians, since they are Coptic Christians and not Catholic. The cursaders also did the same thing to the people of Mohar, but they eat them after slaughtering them. Yes Sassanids did attack the Romans and taken Jerusalem, however, the Romans also taken it from the Jews, so therefore it is not theirs\nEdit: The Crusaders didn't even give back the land to the Byzantines and instead keep it\nEdit 2: In 1096, a group of Crusaders committed a series of massacres on Jews in various towns in the Rhineland",

Jerusalem was not \"Christian lands\". It had been under the control of Fatimids for centuries, and before that it was Jewish-controlled.

He falsely presents it as the exclusive reason for the crusades, and applies it in reference to his own ahistorical imagination of Islam as some consolidated international coalition.",

After that it spent time being under the control of Hasmoneans, pagan Romans, Byzantines (who I admit were likely Christian for some of this occupation) and most of these forbade Jews from entry except on special holy days.\nThe point I'm trying to make is that when the Seljuks took Jerusalem, just before the Crusade, they didn't take it from any Christians; it had been Fatimid territory for almost 500 years.

I don't understand your logic.\nColonization has been practiced way before your examples and is not exclusive to \"white people\" by any means. Are you a Christian? Do you believe god made the different races and just plopped them down where they were in 1500AD? If so, don't bother to read the next paragraph.\nPeople have fought and conquered and colonized before we had writing to record the actions. That's how they got there. It was constant fighting and gamesmanship for territory and resources. Archaeologists have found evidence of villages being wiped out with weapons made before people figured out to affix stones to them to make points or blunt ends.\nWhat genocides are you talking about? You think Genghis Khan and Attila the Hun just politely asked people to cut their own heads off? If you mean the genocide of the Native Americans you are misinformed. Initial contact with the Native Americans was peaceful. Unfortunately, disease killed 90 to 95% of them after contact with the Europeans. There are more Native Americans today than there were when North America was finally colonized. That isn't much of a genocide is it? Usually populations decrease in genocides. Do you know Native Americans completely exterminated the Clovis people when they came to North America? the Clovis people were the original inhabitants and the Native Americans killed every last one of them. But \"white people\" are bad for accidentally getting them sick?\n\"White people\" did not invent slavery or the slave trade. Slavery is older than we can even date. They didn't even initiate the African slave trade. Muslims were there first. \"But where are all the black people in Muslim countries then?\" you ask. Well, the thing is that they castrated them meaning that the tribes they enslaved were completely eradicated. You do know that \"black\" Africans enslaved each other before Europeans ever set foot in Subsaharan Africa? You do know that after Britain and the US banned the slave trade (One of the first laws ever enacted in the new USA btw) they had to send warships to the African coast to prevent the African slave traders from continuing the practice? After all this, you must conclude that \"white people\" are no worse than other races. They just happened to do very well in war in the last 500 years or so due to technological advancements.\nBtw, I am inferring from your name \"Carlos\" that you are Latin. You know it was the Latins that ravaged the Americas Southwest of the English colonies(ie almost all of it). If you are Latin American, your ancestors were responsible for that. I am Germanic and my family arrived in the USA after slavery and the Indian Wars so be careful throwing stones in a glass house!",

I meant the polar opposite of that.\n\nJust because other people have done it it doesn't mean what the european powers did was ok or normal by any standards. Specially considering the scale of it, no one has ever done colonization or slavery in the scale of what happened between the XV century and the XIX century.\n\nWhat you're saying is frankly ridiculous. There are more jews nowadays than there has ever been in history. Does that mean the holocaust didn't happen?\nGenocide, by definition, is the effort to exterminate certain ethnical group, it doesn't need to be 100% fullfilled. It's the events that happened and the intention behind them that matter, not the result necessairly. And besides, the population of Natives in the US between the years of 1491 and 1691 had decreased by about 80%. In Brazil there were thousands of ethnical groups before the Portuguese arrived, nowadays there are less than 300.\n\nIn the case of native americans in the US, the US government actively seeked to kill as many natives as possible through out the country's history, a policy that ended only around the 1900's. The US government constantly violated peace treaties with the native tribes, rounded up innocent people in camps, where disease and starvation was rampant, while denying them medicine. There are several official documents that serve as proof that the US government distributed contaminated clothes to the people in these camps, that the government killed the buffaloes in order to hinder and starve the tribes that depended on them... I can go on. Give it a read, honestly. What you're saying is utterly and almost offensively ignorant, if it unfortunately wasn't such a common misconception about what happened. \nA lot of people died for disease outbreaks, but many of these outbreaks happened because of their displacement, the destruction of their lands, their forced imprisonment in camps... so again, go back to the Holocaust, one can easily claim (and deniers often do) that a lot of the people who died were by disease and starvation.\nBut that doesn't mean it wasn't genocide now, does it?\n\nI never claimed \"white people\" invented slavery, nor have I ever claimed they were the only ones doing it. Muslims were also not the first to trade slaves in Africa, this was going on way before Islam even existed. Romans traded slaves with African kingdoms, heck, before them the Egyptians were enslaving people... The scale of the Atlantic Slave Trade, however, was bigger than any in history, and slavery for the European powers and their colonies in the Americas was arguably the first time in history in which slavery was exclusively about skin colour, or \"race\". In Africa, blacks enslaved blacks, it was about ethnicity not skin colour. In Rome, you could be a brown/black skinned Roman citizen, heck, even Emperor considering Septimius Severus; and you could be a white Roman slave, enslaved because of debt, or a white German slave from a war.\n\nMy name is not \"Carlos\", what the fuck are you talking about. And I have German ancestry as well, look at my surname. You do know not everyone in Latin America has Spanish/Portuguese ancestry, right? Much like not everyone in the US has English. But even if my ancestors were Latin I would have no problem in recognizing the horrible shit they have done. Unlike you, apparently\nIt's funny tho, you have no problem recognising that the Spanish and Portuguese did horrible things to the natives(which is true), but the English and later the US were saints apparently. That's the impression you're giving me at least.\nDid you know that many apologists of the colonization of South America also claim that most natives died for diseases? Funny how that works.\nAlso, what are you talking about \"throwing stones\", I didn't accuse you nor your ancestors of anything. I'm talking about history and what happened, this has fuck all to do with guilt. You're the one who decided to turn this into a \"white people are the worst\" thing. I never even mentioned \"white people\" in my response",

My training was more readjusting my perceptions of the past to understand the past as a foreign land that I've never seen before. With this in mind I can't assure anyone that this video is exactly correct, however I can say you did an absolute outstanding job of at least explaining the crusades on a basic level. Most of your other videos deal with war related history which is not my field. My field is middle ages, late roman, and early Christian history. So to understand this history it was very important to understand what really happened with the crusades. This is all completely on point with what we went through at a college level. Please if you wish to counter someone on their beliefs on the crusades, share this video. I don't recommend using it in an academic sense, but I feel that's a given and not the goal for Three Arrows. So for what you were trying to accomplish you did an admiral job. Thank for your channel.",

What do you want to do about the 1,6 billion Muslims all over the world? They do not even have the same belief.

But you also shouldn't tell anybody that his or her beliefs are wrong.\n\nThird point: Fundamentalism is brutal in every religion. Look at the anti Muslim pogroms in India or the rohingya extermination in Burma right now. Look at the crusades in the middle ages or at the KKK. Religion is often misused for violence and the world would probably better without religion at all, but still, point Nr2: religious freedom.",

Likewise the Conquistadors and South America. They had to rely on the Brits for that innovation.\n\nThe same can be said of Dynastic Chinese periods and indeed the Egyptian Dynastic Pharisees. \nIf anything it would appear Northern colder climes is more conducive to problem solving across generations (natural selection tending to remove those who do not plan for winter over time) and the abolition of slavery only exacerbates the abstract planning abilities needed to survive and thrive in such climates.\n\nErgo the Ottoman's could have conquered all the 'Southern Global Wealth' they wanted but they never would have gone through an Industrial Revolution thanks to having a warm climate and slavery. \nOh and er, cousin fucking. \nWhich lowers IQ across generations as well as the birth defects that go with such things but now I am dangerously close to going off on a tangent about modern Pakistani culture and UK birth defect rates...\n\nKudos if you got that far lol.",

In addition, there are many reasons why feigning cannibalism is actually NOT a good way to make a city surrender, which Bohemund de Taranto, an experienced war leader himself, would be well aware of. Would you open your gates to a cannibal's army?",

When Alfred the great eventually outlasted the gran heathen army, was he valiantly defending Christianity from the heathen onslaught by Barbarian vikings? When Romans under Julian the Apostate were eventually beaten back by Sassanids it wasn't a defensive Action against Christianity, but when they fought Theodosius II, it was? Ah wait, Theodosius was Christian so he was supposed to be defensive, right? Yeah, Persians prosecuted Christians, that's why. So it was defensive on the Christian part. Right, so he was in fact defending Christianity against ever expanding Zoroastrianism. Yeah now we got it.\n\nNow as this video correctly states, Islam is not an entity, but a religion. So yep, many Arab caliphates were expansionist and aggressive, so were Seljuk or Moorish. That's why they fought each other as much as they fought Christians.

Also, (not exonerating Christians) the last crusade was centuries ago, whereas Jihad is an ongoing problem in the world. After over 1000 years and several reformations, Christianity isnt what it used to be, but Islam, the Hadith etc. are identical to their crusade-era forefathers, so who is really the problem here? The Christians who fought back against Islam, (and lost), the spanish catholics who forcibly removed Islam over 400 years of war, the Greeks, whoever, were subjugated by Islam. Furthermore, a key difference in the crusade era catholics vs muslims, is that the doctrines of Islam explicitly endorse and advocate forceful expansion and conquest (to honor Mohammed), the crusades, I find it inarguable, were defensive, at least early on.",

As it is, the taxes were probably a big reason why Islam had so many converts. And significant portions of the Mediterranean were never Muslim, so nice work on the hyperbole, there.\n\nAs for Jihad, the Jihads of today are not remotely the same as the Jihads back then. Jihad simply means \"struggle\", and if you define it loosely enough, you can say that a Muslim is on a perpetual jihad every day, whether he is praying or shopping for groceries. What you are, of course, referencing, is Islamic terrorism. Which does have clear parallels in the West as well, and WWII was an excellent example of it. The various resistance movements, for example, had pretty much the same MO. Only when directed by the Allies did they actually do constructive work. When left to their own devices, the various resistance movements would fight each other and terrorise the local population.\n\nAs for the Crusades being defensive, that is not only debatable, it is almost less controversial to say that they were not. They were sold to the people as defensive (just like every single war is sold to the people as \"defensive\" in some way), but when the target is Jerusalem, you really can't argue defence. Jerusalem had been Islamic for hundreds of years; if the crusades were defensive, they would have targetted Spain.",

    "text": "My favorite research paper I've ever written was actually on one of the Crusades, one of them that isn't talked about really. Everyone talks about the Catholic vs. Muslim struggle over the Holy Land, but my favorite, one that isn't addressed as part of the Crusades in compulsory schooling and that wasn't acknowledged by the Catholic Church until 1969, was the Albigensian (or Cathar) Crusade. It took place between 1209 and 1229 AD. And it was pointless. Basically, in a bunch of central and south-eastern regions [focused on Languedoc] of France, there was people identifying as Cathars, a group of ascetic Christians who didn't think highly of the Catholic Church. So Pope Innocent III sent armies, eventually killing somewhere between 200,000 and 1,000,000 people of the area. It was one of the events used to explain historical instances of genocide in the book that coined the term (by Raphael Lemkin) and the Crusade included such gems as the sentiment/potential statement \"Kill them all, God will know his own\" (the origin of that meme); a massacre of 20,000 men, women, and children at once; murdering priests in front of and atop their altars (Christian altars, I'll remind you); an army forcing the entirety of Carcassonne to flee either naked or in just their underwear (depending on the account); and multiple sieges decided by cutting off water supplies shortly followed by burning Cathars alive.\n\n\nThe Crusades were horrendous, and defending them from the Catholic perspective is, for lack of a better term, evil.\n\n\nEdit: Three Arrows mentions it a little bit! I know he doesn't cover it much since it wasn't carried out against Muslims, but I'm glad it's covered since it's what I call a 'lost genocide', or a genocide that's been almost completely erased from the public consciousness (because, I mean, the only reason anyone brings it up is to criticize Christianity, which no one is all that interested with in the west).",

The idea that it was genocide is debated but irrelevant to the Church’s involvement. The secular rulers started a crusade against the Albigensians due to their rebellion against the state for independence, AFTER the Church’s inquisition was over. This is often brought up against the Catholic Church but this was simply a secular crusade fighting for the unity of the nation and it lasted about 2 months. The Church had no involvement with the crusade and only later anti-Catholic writings attempt to argue this, with fabrications such as invented statements from papal legates.",

And the Muslims had literally millions of slaves.  And we're still sending raids to Europe to get more slaves.  That alone was reason enough to start a fight.  But we do know Christians and Jews were mistreated beyond just the tax.  Even many of the modern day musilm countries mistreat Jews and Christians, though there aren't many of those left in Muslim countries and there is a reason why that is.  Also the Muslims treated women horribly and with the age of chivilary that was  happening in europe that only made the Muslims look worse.  The Europeans definitely took it too far and were too violent (though again, that's just what armies did back then), but at least most of the crusades had good reasoning to fight.  Imagine if Canada was sending raids to take our citizens as slaves, oppressing women, and oppressing Christens and Jews and imagine Canada had a history of conquest, especially against fighting the US.  Fighting them would be totally justified.  Crusades obviously went too far and too violent, and there were certain people who did really bad things, but there was justification for the conflict.",

To them, one of the most disastrous Military/Religious Campaigns in History is supposed to be merely a defensive strike against a Stereotypical version of Islam, that wasn't even as regressive as they make it out to be?  The right constantly defends the Crusade as a justified war against Islam or do you think these boys and girls shouting \"Deus vult\" are just Joking? No, they are dead serious about slaughtering Muslims for the most flimsiest of reasons.\n\nThe Crusade was never about simply defending the Byzantines ( in fact, they betrayed them after the 1st Crusade), they were fought merely to gain control and access to the Holy sites of the Levant to make Pilgrimage far easier and more save, it was never some smart move on the Pope's behalf, all he wanted to was to increase the religious influence of Christendom. While Political and geographical objectives were part of the crusades, they were mostly just a by-product of a war that is Religious in nature, to conquer a region that offers zero Military or Economic values from the same branch of religion that wasn't as much of an enemy as you made it out to be. \n\nAlso the bits of you belittling Islam also shows that you do not view the conflict in it's historical context, because, during the Middle Ages, it were the Muslims who were far more progressive and advanced( even in terms of Woman rights, since Women in the Islamic world enjoyed more equal rights than the ones in the Christian world) than the European Kingdoms  that had to recover from the fall of the Roman empire that balkanized and damaged that region prior by making them all reliant on Rome( a different story altogether)\n\nEven if the Muslims would have conquered Europe and made Islam the Dominant religion in there, it wouldn't translate to there being no progress coming from this region, if anything, one might argue that it would be for the better if they had conquered it, as the more advanced and sophisticated society of the Orient back then could have made the spread of knowledge far quicker and would've even made the Renaissance unnecessary. But all of this is what-if scenarios, debating about what could have been is useless since we have not yet developed a machine that can calculate the events of alternative realities, so saying that x would have happened without having any real arguments to support it is dumb at best and very toxic propaganda at worst.\n\nYou should first do more research on Historic topics before opening your mouth and spewing bullshit about History. Here is, for instance, an article about Woman in the Islamic world during the middle ages that shed some light of this whole situation, read it: https://www.publicmedievalist.com/mary-islam/  !",

There a couple crusades that weren't even crusades really, the local king just wanted to conquer more territory and called it a crusade because it was the popular thing at the time.

I've met girls who escaped those countries and they were married off around 10 and it is considered a sin to refuse your husband sex or to disobey him.  Obviously not all Muslims are like that, but there are a lot that are, whole countries of them.  And I wouldn't use a fictional story like king arthur as evidence.  The punishment for rape back then was extremely harsh, usually a brutal death.  They really respected women back then.  Even more than many people do today.

        "text": "@dragonninja3655 *Sigh* Really? Do you still play the Misogyny card here as if that would make the Crusaders and by extension Medieval Europe better than Islam, when it's generally agreed upon that the Muslims back then were more advanced and treated woman much better, as evident with my post that should have shown you that Female Scholars did exist in their realm that time? You really need to show more integrity and Intelligence to research about the culture you condemn here, before attacking them, did you missed my entire post like that? But going back to our own time, I agree that Islam has many issues here and there, but do you know what? a lot of people already know it and no one denies that they still exist, even the Muslims are aware of this and there is progress still made regarding this issue...they aren't stagnating people living in the middle ages, they actually are Humans that make progress, even regarding slavery. Speaking about them, slavery in some way is also encouraged by the Western powers, who often get their resources and goods from these Countries that practice them like for instance the Chocolate and Silicon carbide industry that often has child labor involved with them, which the West being complacent and supportive about it, even though the UNICEF is on their way to ban it and will do it one day perhaps, so no, we aren't as super enlightened as you made it out to be DragonNinja, we still have issues here in the west, like for instance Misogyny, which isn't a Muslim-only issue here.\n\nAlso the whole Chivalry code thing is nonsense, because rarely if never did most Knights uphold it and were in the end, no different from other Military armies and raiders they fought against as evident by the many bloodshed, rape, enslavement, ( which was so bad and awful that some even believe that the crusades were used as an excuse to send away these toxic people to the ME to cause havoc there, as the Peace of God was not always effective at keeping feudal knights at bay) decapitations, Cannibalism( as mentioned in the video with the siege of Ma'arra) and even destruction of religious sites like the plundering of Mosques, temples and even some churches, after all, they slaughtered Christians as well. They were not some golden knights that treated Woman or innocent people well, in fact, Chilvary often encouraged the Nobility to look down at the peasants as lesser beings as said by the very code you glorify here and even perpetuated sexism towards woman, like for instance the idea that Woman always need some shiny guy in armor that to this day humiliated woman. Speaking about Code of Honor, Muhammed Issued to one of his Comrades named Abu- Bakr the 10 Commandments of War every Muslim warrior had to follow, one of them was meant to encourage Hermits and Priest to pass freely from the territory a.k.a Religious tolerance, which is something many Historians attributed to the Medieval Islamic world. Based on these 10 commandments, one might argue that the Muslims warriors were holy saints that know how to respect woman and trees and never harmed innocent people if we were to apply your logic here? Wrong, the Muslim armies were not consistent with these teachings and often broke them, just as the Knights and feudal lords didn't always respect the Code of Chivalry and 'weren't honest about it. \n\nCode of Honors aren't strict moral rules like the law you have to follow, they were mostly guidelines and ideals you might hold up to appear honorable, but never did they created a lasting peace of honorable bloodshed, this is just glorification and ahistorical, so using this to prove how superior the west was, when the Opposite was true as I mentioned earlier, but let me finish the CoW thing with this question: If the Muslim armies were so bad, why did they fed the Crusader armies once  while the Crusaders kept slaughtering and throwing the heads of beaten enemies at them? If the Crusaders are so much better, why were they so outnobled by the Saracean armies in this instance?\n\n\nYou claim me to be delusional and terrible, yet you did not even know that the Muslims had also a code of honor as well or that Slavery was not dead in Europe during the middle ages or that the first victims of the Crusades were Christian and Jews, with the latter being treated so terrible by them, that it literally inspired an entire Country in the 20th century to develop such a grudge and irrational hatred for them, that they literally started a war to get rid of them! I will say this again, DO YOU RESARCH and DO NOT insult someone for not being delusional enough to believe that a war that mostly was started to take a region back with no stragetic values with them and served only to increase the power of their branch of the same relgion of the people they fight against.  Oh yeah didn't you knew? Islam originated from Judeo-Christian values, they do not worship the Moon God Sin here.",

So fight you against the friends of Shaitan (Satan)\" Quran (4:89) - \"They but wish that ye should reject Faith, as they do, and thus be on the  same footing (as they): But take not friends from their ranks until they flee in the way of Allah (From what is forbidden). But if they turn renegades, seize them and slay them wherever ye find them; and (in any case) take no friends or  helpers from their ranks.\"  Quran (8\"15) - \"O ye who believe! When ye meet those who disbelieve in battle, turn not your backs to them. (16)Whoso on that day turneth his back to them, unless maneuvering for battle or intent to join a company, he truly hath incurred wrath from Allah, and his habitation will be hell, a hapless journey's end.\"   Quran 9:30 - \"And the Jews say: Ezra is the son of Allah; and the Christians say: The Messiah is the son of Allah; these are the words of their mouths; they imitate the saying of those who disbelieved before; may Allah destroy them; how they are                 turned away!\"  Quran (9:123) - \"O you who believe! fight those of the unbelievers who are near to you and let them find in you hardness.\" Quran (17:16)  - \"And when We wish to destroy a town, We send Our commandment to the people of it who lead easy lives, but they transgress therein; thus the word proves true against it, so We destroy it with utter destruction.\" Quran (21:44) - \"...See they not that We gradually reduce the land (in their control) from its outlying borders? Is it then they who will win?\"   Quran(33:60-62)   - \"If the hypocrites, and those in whose hearts is a disease (evil desire for  adultery, etc.), and those who spread false news among the people in Al-Madinah, cease not, We shall certainly let you overpower them, then they will not be able to stay in it as your neighbors but a little while Accursed, wherever found,  they shall be seized and killed with a (terrible) slaughter.\"  Quran (48:17)- \"There is no blame for the blind, nor is there blame for the lame, nor is  there blame for the sick (that they go not forth to war). And whoso obeyeth  Allah and His messenger, He will make him enter Gardens underneath which rivers  flow; and whoso turneth back, him will He punish with a painful doom.\"  (I'm going to give a little explantion for this one. Contemporary apologists sometimes claim that Jihad means 'spiritual struggle.' But if that is the case, then why are the blind, lame and sick exempted? This verse also says that those who do not fight will suffer torment in hell.)  There are a lot more quotes encouraging violence too and those are just the quotes on violence.  The stuff about the treatment and prices of women are pretty horrific at some points.",

Not to mention that these series of Wars also attacked other Christians as well, even if they were not even on the Saracean side, so how can they still be called merely a defense of Christendom, when it caused so much damage to the Christians? I mean, another Hilarious thing about the Crusader army was how low their size was in contrast to actual invasion forces, so they should have at least over 5000.000 Men if they really wanted to destroy and get rid of the Muslims \"treat\" and actually attack strategically important regions such as Egypt, Badgdad, Mekka and Mosul, but they didn't because what they feared wasn't a onimous Islamic threat destroying them, it was the fear of the end of the world, paired with a desire to unite Christendom as one and helped the Byzantines out, with the 2/3 of the list being betrayed not even long after the first Crusade.\n\n\n\nTo the Muslims: No they weren't, the Islamic Chaliphates back then were at that time more tolerant and open to other religions than Medieval Europe as evident by the fact that they allowed the jews and Christians to practice their faith and were allowed to do many jobs in high places such as crafting and even Scholarship like the many Jewish and Christian scholars in the Chaliphates, most notably Cordoba. This all happened in a time, where if you did not believe in the same god as the ruler of your kingdoms did like how the Aras drove away the Zoroastrianists from iran and imposed Islam there or how Charlemagne destroyed by force the ancient Pagan faiths. To allow similiar religions to exist in the same Kingdom while giving them a tax, that was lower than the one they got from their previous rulers( another reason why Islam rose to prominence in the Middle east). If Islam was so terrible and horrendous and outlandish to the west, why did many Christians Scholars and famous people respected and even looked upo to Islam like Thomas Jefferson and Thomas aquinas? Why weren't they hating on it for their Misogyny that was also a problem in their time? It wasn't, it was even viewed back then as a offshort of Christianity and even respected as faith by many Christians and vice versa, as many Muslims even welcomed many Christians scholars and nobles in their ranks. You want to tell me that they were and still are evil monsters in contrast to Christians with an likewise( or bigger) list of Atrocities that makes them more and less equal? No serious Historian would ever agree with you DragonNinja, not even the ones most Critical of Islam.",

        "text": "I never said it wasn't a religious war, that was definitely a large part of it, I just said religion wasn't the only reason.  Some of them went upward, not down to where the muslims were.  If some of them read the Quran that is enough to make them wary of having them as neighbors.  The Quran is basically a book demanding holy war.  The only reason the spread of Islam was stopped was because they weren't the best at sailing and some of the Europeans invented a type of flamethrower.  And they have certainly killed more people, especially innocent people, throughout history.  And again, I'm not saying all Muslims are monsters, thankfully many of them don't really follow the Quran these days and have made up their own, less violent interpretations.  Have you ever actually read the Quran.  I have.  It is not a nice book.  As for Thomas Aquinas, Thomas Aquinas “He (Mohammed) did not bring forth any signs produced in a supernatural way, which alone fittingly gives witness to divine inspiration; for a visible action that can be only divine reveals an invisibly inspired teacher of truth. On the contrary, Mohammed said that he was sent in the power of his arms – which are signs not lacking even to robbers and tyrants.” and “seduced the people by promises of carnal pleasure to which the concupiscence of the flesh goads us. His teachings also contain precepts that were in conformity with his promises, and he gave free rein to carnal pleasure. In all this, as is not unexpected, he was obeyed by carnal men.”  Where exactly was Aquinas admiring the Muslims.  It's possible he admired their math skills or maybe they had a particular teaching method he liked, but he certainly wasn't a fan.  As for Jefferson, I've never met anyone who calls him a Christian scholar.  He was a type of Christian, and an overall good guy, but he didn't even believe Jesus was God, so clearly analyzing scripture wasn't his strong suit.  He held Christian values and believed Jesus's teaching (only as in he thought Jesus was the highest of prophets), but was kinda ify on some of the beliefs.  No one's really studying Jefferson for his insight on Christianity.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsm8TFdmZ7o&list=PLWEri83jCHya27abHbhA7nDhbiPZEB3kq&index=8https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=638TIucikys&t=478shttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bUksL30PP4https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdSp8Jo6QAI&list=PLWEri83jCHya27abHbhA7nDhbiPZEB3kq&index=3https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lg4drfF265M&list=PLWEri83jCHya27abHbhA7nDhbiPZEB3kq&index=9",

Mind you, I see the 10th amendment as a gateway to cultural relativism, which I oppose when the cultural relativistic point in question allows for morally egregious actions. \n\nOf course the problem of the 10th amendment's history in the United States has nothing to do with the moral quandaries of Islamic oppression of gays, atheists and apostates, but rather the cultural relativism that the 10th amendment was used to enable moral evils such as slavery and Jim Crow in American history. And I'm not even close to being an SJW, in fact I generally oppose much of the new left sans the economic populist angle which I'm neutral towards or somewhat favor. \n\nThe abolitionist position towards slavery was essentially anti-relativistic at its core. The movement campaigned that slavery was wrong period, and that no culture could rightfully justify its existence. \n\nPerhaps I'm stretching things a bit here, because I've never heard anybody actually point out that the 10th amendment acts as an enabler of cultural relativism, except maybe Noam Chomsky in some of his arguments, and my memory is fuzzy here. The 10th amendment should have been written more carefully, and should have limited the rights of the states further - to preemptively prevent them from allowing cultural systems such as slavery to flourish. But in the end imo, the 10th amendment gave the states too much power.",

        "text": "@daringiconoclast6547  The South seceeded because of slavery. It’s in the secession documents. And 2% owned slaves yes, but the soldiers supported slavery. In the South, slavery wasn’t just some economic corporation. It was religiously, and (at the time) scientifically proven to be the state of African Americans and it is what Confederates believed, whether they were poor farmers or plantation owners.\n\nAnd yes, the Northerners weren’t anti-racists, a lot of people at the time were racists. But the point about Lincoln saying he would keep the Union without abolishing slavery, this is sort of taken out of context and it doesn’t prove your point neither because the South had seceeded regardless. The context in which he said so was in an letter, warning for extremely long citation but here it goes:\n\n”My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone, I would also do that. What I do about slavery and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save thise Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union.”\n- From Abraham Lincoln to Horace Greeley [Newspaper Clipping]1, August 22, 1862\n\nThis letter has seemed disingenuous to some. In it, however, Lincoln makes it clear to the public that though he considers his primary constitutional duty to be to save the Union, partial or even total emancipation might well be the necessary means to attain that end. Lincoln needed to make his position completely clear without tipping his hand on emancipation prematurely. He couldn’t appear as a ”radical abolisher” before he could get the emancipation proclamation through.\n\nAnd the South had not abolished slavery during the Civil War. I think you’re referring to the emancipation proclamation? The proclamation only said that the States that uphold slavery are in active rebellion against the United States and that the armies of the United States will fight and act for the freedom of said slaves. It only made the war officially about freeing slaves. And if the South had abolished slavery, why didn’t just Jefferson Davis or Robert E. Lee surrender? Why did they continue to fight? \n\nI’m very sorry for the long post",

Lindisfarne had to be fortified against Scottish raiding etc...Then we have the protestant reformation, starting with the dissolution of the monasteries (cash grab by Henry VIII and other unscrupulous nobility) and vandalism and destruction caused by all sides of churches in the Wars of the three Kingdoms in the 17th Century. \n\n\nI am sure others in Western Europe have similar histories of desecration of religious houses and buildings that occurred in wars and other movements between solely Christian powers.",

Well, the Holy Order of Teutonic Knights can give you a resounding \"Yes, anyone that messes with Christ will be Crusaded.\" So that goes for both Pagans and Muslims. People only want to defend Muslims (and not Viking pagans) is because Muslims are a darker shade of skin.\n But let me humor you, as you were bringing up the Desecration of Pagans. You are somehow saying that white people fighting other white people give Arabs a right to wipe out white culture and replace it with Islam? Again, I assume any Black tribe that fought and killed other blacks is equally as guilty to you as white Christians? If I were you I'd decide whether to defend Vikings or defend Christians, as bringing Muslims into a debate between Vikings and Christians holds no water.

Because I can't see any other reason for your fixation on the 4th Crusade. You need to realize that the 4th Crusade was completely out of context to anything mentioned in the Video- the Video Author states that Western Powers were as much of a Threat to Byzantium as the Turks. However!! The Turks were a threat to all western powers until their eventual defeat at Vienna, and then the Ottoman Empire slowly faded away until it Crumbled after WW1. The more you argue that the 4th Crusade is equivalent to every Muslim action against Christians in terms of Scale makes you seem very suspect in my eyes. The 4th Crusade was the Last Crusade called for a reason, because it was seen as an embarrassment to Christianity and filled with all sorts of mistakes, war crimes, and offenses (primarily Venice) that were worthy of Excommunication. Meanwhile if a Muslim did the same thing to Constantinople, they would have a Poem written about them instead. If you cannot see the difference then there is probably no reason for me to acknowledge you any further, and I retract my former apology.",

Can’t get any more Fascist than that, can you?\r\nWhat’s the opposite of that? Oh right, diversity and DEMOCRACY.\r\nClearer?\r\n\nGuess you're right. You DO \"Shit realbad\".",

Yet in EVERY country where religion is given that much power, Fascism comes.\nSee how that works?\r\nAt least answer this question: Do you understand what the quote is meant to warn against and why? If you can answer JUST that, we can start to unpack why you feel it’s “anti-Christian” (It’s not, btw).\r\n  The main problem with American Christians is that because you don’t fully respect or acknowledge the fact that we are a secular nation (with freedom of religion AND *from* religion) rather than a “Christian Nation” (bet you think that, don’t you?), that somehow means any and all critiques of your religion imposing itself on society via public policy like for instance, pro-life or anti-gay legislation, are by definition, “Anti-Christian”. \nCan you see how that is merely flawed reasoning on your part?

Rather than debunk everything you proclaimed, which would take forever and is something I have no desire to do right now, let’s just stick with your core point: “Why be so mean to Christians, meany?!”\r\n  Since you refuse to answer a single one of my questions, I’ll try to answer that one in this context. Of course, I can’t ignore one GLARING error you made which is mildly understandable if you don’t live here in the U.S. We are NOT “mostly protestant and atheist”, sorry, no. Atheists are a super small percentage of the population, even here in CA where I live, but “nones” are fairly large. Many of them are theists who simply don’t go to any one church. They are rising in numbers, but we are still MOSTLY Christian, and most of them are either Evangelical, Catholic, or some variation of “born again” which is how Evangelicals define themselves. The mobilized Right-wing VOTING BLOCK is what matters in this context, OBVIOUSLY. \n(IS this obvious to you?)\r\n  Having said all that, Trump’s presidency and continued con-job has PROVEN, to the entire world (not you?), that his brand of 'Christian Nationalist' (look that up!) Fascism comes with a Bible in hand. Not a Qu’ran, or a Scientology book, but a Bible. That’s because the majority of Republican voters are Christians and wanted an authoritarian dictator to “own the Libs” and “defend the unborn”, which is mostly what they got.\r\n\r\nBefore I ramble on uselessly (imagine if I took your ACTUAL \"Christian Persecution\" fake-news to task!), do you understand that the quote is meant to illustrate all that I’ve stated above? Do you agree or disagree that this is the case in America, based on what you know currently, even though you have no dog in this fight as a foreign Christian who’s clearly offended by my post and OBVIOUS statement(s)?\n\n\nIs it absolutely USELESS to ask you anything specific in order to merely help you understand where I'm coming from?",

The Evangelicals here think you’re “Not real Christians” anyway ‘cause the Pope’s too Liberal for them.\r\n   You sound like you don’t have a clue what’s happening in America and that’s fine. It’s not where you live so why would you? But the prescient quote, and Trump’s presidency, present a different set of problems for your coreligionists, not just here but worldwide.\r\nSince you refuse to answer a single question to help me show you how decidedly benign the quote is to any religion that DOESN’T  Fascistically impose itself on a secular gov’t and Liberal Democracy, let me sum it up this way:\r\n    Throughout human history, when church & state are not kept separate, authoritarian regimes *destroy democracy.* This was true in ancient times when everyone accepted your god's existence, and it’s true TODAY when a growing number are realizing how silly these ancient superstitions are (much to your personal disappointment, no doubt). Again, since you refuse to engage by answering a single question, I have no choice but to make assumptions about you and your lack of education on these matters.\r\n    “Persecuting” Christians (or Catholics, doesn’t matter) didn’t happen when the king & queen of the CHURCH OF ENGLAND were in charge. Unless they were denominations that weren’t recognized at the time….hence the Puritans who colonized “The New World” to escape THEIR actual Christian Persecution.  Today we have freedom of religion here, but we ALSO have a RW party which has convinced its voters that “God is on their side” and never on the Liberal’s side. Many believe RIDICULOUS nonsense about Liberals being \"Satanic pedophile cannibals\" and more.  This brainwashing of your coreligionists has been happening since the 80s here, via “Wedge issues” such as abortion and gay rights.\r\n   So if it’s “Anti-Christian” to point this out, does that mean our country (or yours?) should just sleepwalk into Fascism for fear of “offending” the faithful?\r\n\r\nOh right. You don’t answer my questions.\r\nAfraid to “engage with the demon”, are we? That’s EXACTLY how fundamentalism thrives….via self-imposed ignorance and a profound lack of curiosity and reason.\r\nSee how that works?\r\n(Don’t answer that….Haha I know you won’t).\r\n\r\nBtw, I was raised Catholic (I’m Latino). I was educated out of religion….and racism (funny how THAT works). If I still believed that nonsense, there's a good chance I might even agree with you on your main complaint.\nBut it would ONLY be because I never learned better and was never curious...\n\nHow sad is that?",

It was more moderate and partly blamed Western foreign policy, BUT the story was strongly about the Sunni jihad against all other factions, including the Alawite faction of Assad and his father. The Assad clan had been subject to severel persecution of Alawite, but when in power were mostly successful at maintaining multi-cultural PEACE.\n\nThe enemy of Assad and of the Army was Sunni jihad fighters AND the old man scholars preaching that Alawites are fake Muslims subverting Islam from within, worse enemies to \"true Islam\" than Jews or Christians. \n\nSo this was on BBC a few years ago. Doesn't this at least partly make BBC white nationalist Christian bigots? \n\nBBC gave a sympathetic view on refugees, but it wasn't a total whitewash of present day Islamic holy war.

Better march on London before they start impressing sailors on our merchant vessels again!\"\nThe first line of that article says \"There is little dispute that the battle helped lay the foundations of the Carolingian Empire and Frankish domination of Europe for the next century.\" That means that, by the time of the crusades, the Carolingian empire had developed from that battle, waxed to be the dominant power in Western Europe, fractured under civil war, reunited briefly, and returned to a state of warring factions, competing interests, and shifting alignments, with 200 years left STILL until the first crusade.\n\nAs for Muslim conquests, the caliphate which conquered Spain and held the most territory of any caliphate also no longer existed, nor had it for about 350 years (see: The age of the United States) at the time of the Crusades. There was still warring between Christian and Muslim kingdoms in Spain, but there was also alliances between Christian and Muslim kingdoms in Spain when their interests were in alignment or they had mutual foes. The crusades revived the idea of a holy war of expulsion of Muslims from Spain for the first time since the Umayyads were successfully repelled from France a full 400 years prior.\n\nFinally, the first crusade \"being caused by the growing power of the Seljuk Turks\" is a sensible read on history, one which recognizes specific regional interests and factions (both Christian and Muslim) competing for power, but is so far removed from \"the Muslims had to be driven back, Christendom was in danger of being overrun,\" I'm struggling to see how you think it supports your point.",

        "text": "@sammosaurusrex \nYour details do nothing to undermine my point. Muslims had a centuries long expansionist policy BEFORE the crusades. The whole turning point of this discussion revolves around who were the aggressors between the two. You admit that the Muslims were the aggressors, so you conceded my point.  They were at it yet again when Constantinople begged the Westerners for help. Maybe the Byzantines were full of crap and exaggerated how bad it was to con them into helping. That is possible and even probable, but after the other invasions the WEsterners had a reason to distrust the Muslims. As they say, \"Once bitten, twice shy.\"\nI am starting to see where we disagree though. You seem to be inferring that my position is that Christendom was in imminent danger of being annihilated. I have said nothing to that effect and I do not believe they were capable of that although they did try later. I just said that the Muslims were the aggressors. John Rambo would say they drew first blood.  \nI am not even saying that crusaders were \"good guys\" like GI JOE or something. My point and Crowder's point is basically, \"Hey, turnabout is fair play.\", \"Whats good for the goose is good for the gander.\", \"You better be prepared to finish a fight if you start it.\", \"You reap what you sow.\", etc. \nIf someone's point was \"Jihadi AND Crusader ideology is stupid and violent\" you would get no argument from me! I only scoff when people act like the crusaders just randomly decided, \"Hey, lets go kill some innocent people that look and believe differently than us.\"\nMaybe you need a little context about Crowder. He has a longstanding beef with Cenk Uyger. He was featured in this response video saying something like, \"They didn't go up there, you came down here!\" as if Jerusalem was their ancestral homeland or something. So the video he made was to rebut that lie showing that indeed the Muslims DID \"go up there.\" You are making it out to be more than it is.",

        "text": "azchris1979 Ah, ok, yes I guess we do have some common ground here then, though I still disagree.\n\nI think Cenk and Steven are both arrogant know-nothing grandstanders, and I guess my distaste for them really shines through\n\nMy full position is that the Pope is the seized on the threat to the Byzantines (whose weakening must have made him gleeful at the time) to expand his authority and military capability, invoke in the minds of European leaders their Christian identity, and try to seize power over the Eastern Orthodox Church, by calling for conquest of the Holy land.\n\nI don’t think that can be referred to as self defense in any context. The conquest was not motivated by worries about the expanding Seljuks, but rather a predation of the Catholic Church to use war to increase their status and potentially reclaim authority over their religious rivals in the Byzantine empire by capitalizing on the Empire’s weakness.\n\nThus, I totally reject Crowder’s “it was a response to the Muslim crusades” as ridiculous.\n\nStill, I do condemn the expansions of the Umayyads, the Crusades, the conquests led by Andrew Jackson, Napoleon, and Hitler, and all other expansionist leaders, factions, and nations.",

I actually pretty much agree with everything you said there. \nWould you agree though that the individual soldiers were likely not into this \"Game of Thrones\" style political maneuvering? Just like a modern soldier isn't interested in funding the MIC. They really believed and believe what they are doing is just and right and it isn't fueled by hatred for \"brown people.\" That is why the Pope used that inflammatory language to incite feelings of vengeful and righteous justice. You appeal to your audience.\nI think we are very semantic on whether \"defensive\" is the correct term.  How about \"preemptive attacks justified by retaliation\"?",

But here.\nSeemed like Ivan was saying religion is a neo-fascist scam.  I don't quite get how that's weird...  maybe the \"neo\" part?  Since religions are ancient?  But they're alive and well now, and Ivan uses the word \"is,\" as in present tense... so I'm not sure why \"neo\" would be offensive in that context.\nAs far as the concept of \"neo-fascism\" itself, as opposed to regular-ass fascism, it seems the vital distinction is that neo-fascism would be global.  As in, a type of fascism born out of neoliberal economic policy.  With neoconservative values.",

The Russian Empire and its Armenian militias that they armed occupied most East Anatolia. 1917 -1918 is when the Ottomans captured the Eastern provinces back and had to give up most of the land again during Sevr. The Union and progress committee lost its power during this era and most fled the country or helped with the indepence war. The conflict between the Armenians and Turks in these provinces is not really a genocide as both parties killed one another. The same happened during 1919 - 1922 with the Greeks, as it was conflict amongst ethnic groups. Killing ethnic Turks in Van, Bitlis, Malazgirt, Satak etc and of course the Turks didn't keep it clean either.",

        "text": "@thrawnprotocol9780 I would argue that is largely a matter of semantics. Rounding up people you don't want en masse, having them walk through a literal desert, given clearly deficient supplies for survival and sustenance, and have estimates of 700 thousand to 1.5 million people die during the trip is effectively genocide. When the fatality rate is 80 to 90 something percent by most all estimates, and it's clear that the policies were not built with any regard for maintaining human life, malicious and overwhelming incompetence is mechanically indistinguishable from explicit genocide. You can douse people with pesticide, or you can have them die of thirst walking through a hot desert for countless miles on end. If 6 or 7 digits of people a government doesn't like end up dying as a direct cause of their actions, that's categorically genocide. One can also dissect further the fact that many armenian figureheads were jailed, tortured, and then executed as a means of silencing their public voice.\n\nThe thing about genocide is that any child knows it's wrong. An adult might have political, religious, or other motives for approving of it as a \"crude necessity\", but when those views aren't shared, it is explicitly understood that any outside party will see it as genocide. There are many accounts corroborating the neglect and disregard for the Armenian's lives, from nations both involved and not involved with the conflict of WW1 at the time. \"Death marches\" have been seen many times throughout history, as a way to deport, kill, and dispose of a population's masses, in no particular order. This is especially relevant if there is no structured destination to exist at, and instead people are thrown at a random spot in the middle of nowhere, without supplies. This is the case with Armenian genocide, with its concentration camps not being an actual camp, but random, scattered locations in the middle of a broad, and inescapable desert.\n\nAs an American, we have our own problems in history. What was done the Native Americans, while seldom, if ever, referred to as genocide by our own history books, was genocide in and of itself. Sometimes it was intentional. Sometimes it was by proximity. Its burden was split across countless groups of perpetrators. The bottom line was, however, that millions of a people we had no regard for ended up dead, and we did very little, if often times, anything, to stop it. It's nothing something anyone wants on their country's record, and it's not something people alive today, who had no way of either aiding or stopping the event, should explicitly be blamed for. The past is the past. If people today can agree that the Armenian relocation was a disaster, be it intentional or otherwise, then we can agree that there's a few things we can learn from it, and hopefully how to avoid similar losses of life today.",

He just fumbled it like most people who don’t have any experience or training in history and a political agenda.",

However, he expected a few thousand mercenaries not several armies worth of crusaders trying to take the Holy Land, so in order to actually get them to return their lands, the emperor extracted oaths out of most of the main Crusader princes (except Bohemond and Raymond of Toulouse).\n\nEdit: As for the source, it's the book called the Alexiad, written by the daughter of the aforementioned emperor Alexios Komnenos and basically chronicles his interactions with the Crusaders among other things.\n\nEdit 2: Literally the first engagement of the Crusader Princes involved the help of the Byzantines during the Siege of Nicaea by sending both troops and sending ships on logs to blockade the lake the city was situated on to prevent supplies being sent via the lake.",

Characterizing the jihads as crusades is not incorrect, and claiming otherwise is going beyond pedantry.  That's not to defend Crowder's take, it's to only an attempt be accurate in this discussion.",

        "text": "​@austinsmith3011 Muslims spread and took over sometimes non-muslim territory in the same way that all empires expand for reasons of control, wealth, and all those other motivations, and then left the population relatively unmolested once they were in control. As the video stated, they didn't forcibly convert or kill all nonbelievers as a point of established tradition. \nThe pope explicitly demanded death and warfare aimed at muslims (and later other groups) for being muslims and to reclaim \"holy\" land, establishing a precendent that could never be erased in the institution that overwhelmingly relies on precedent as a guide. There's no holy land in spain or vatican, and muslims never had a goal to kill all christians for being christian so let's not pretend this is equivalent in any way. In fact some muslim territories became multicultural melting pots like in southeastern spain that had highest tolerance and prosperity in the region for hundreds of years. Not defending islam as a religion but that was a thing, and adjacent regions benefited from it.\n\nPapal crusades were both unprecedented in switching to flat out religious agitation as the core motivator for indiscriminate violence including against non combatants, and had different legal and philosophical justifications and basis, and lower limitations. \n\nFurthermore, jihad has multiple versions and interpretations, it can be nonviolent propagation of religion. So you are also conflating 'taking the cross' to  take back holy land by military might with what would be the equivalent of sending missionaries. I know this isn't the kind of jihad you have in mind, but that's it about cherrypicking definitions. Crusaders never convert, they bash your head in for not being to their liking.",

Western Europe had hardly been attacked by the Seljuk Turks, and their objective, Jerusalem, was not Christian, and had not been for centuries. Even still, if they were defensive, then certainly the Crusaders gave the land they acquired to the \"rightful\" owners, that is, the Byzantines, since before the Caliphates had conquered that land, it belonged to the Eastern Roman Empire. Oh, what? They didn't? Then they must have let the Eastern Orthodox Christians rule themselves there. No? Oh, right, silly me, they gave Judea back to the Jews, since those were the people from that land. What? Not that, either? What did they do, then? Oh, they conquered the land and made their own Kingdoms in it? Isn't that just a war of conquest?\n\n\nOh, right, Christian Good, Muslim Bad, forgot it.",

        "text": "@JuanJoséOñate-m4e First, good on you for specifying which Crusades. I hadn't mentioned that, but there were several other crusades, and it's great you are acknowledging them\n\n\nNow, onto the rest of your comment:\n\n\nThe Seljuks did invade the ERE. This is, after all, the event that was used at the time by the Pope  to start the Crusades. I did not, at any point, claim otherwise. However, a \"defensive\" war would see the combined Christian armies fighting together against the Seljuks to retake the lost lands of Anatolia. This wasn't quite what happened, was it?\r\n\r\nAs for Jerusalem being Christian, that's frankly a point against considering the Crusades defensive. Firstly, it proves there wasn't a serious persecution of Christians in Muslim-controlled territory, since if there was, Christians wouldn't be the majority in a city that was controlled for centuries by Islamic Caliphates. Secondly, what does this say about the Crusaders, Defenders of Christendom, who slaughtered the people of the city, who shared their Faith? Who were they defending, if they were slaughtering Christians?\r\n\r\nBohemond of Taranto *explicitly* never intended to give any land to the Byzantines. His intentions were to carve out an Eastern Kingdom to himself (which he did, becoming Prince of Antioch). He had, in fact, for that exact same purpose, carried out incursions against the Byzantines before, which was part of why he had to take an oath once he joined the Crusade, otherwise Emperor Alexios would have no reason to trust him or allow him passage through his lands. Also important is that there was no pact between Bohemond and Jonh Komnenus during the first crusade, given that the latter was a nine-years-old boy at the time.\r\n\r\nI don't see how the Armenians come into play, unless it's about the Eastern Orthodox Christians I mentioned. You see, I was talking about Jerusalem and the Levant, there, where the Crusaders created their own Catholic kingdoms. Armenia simply has nothing to do with my comment, but hey, you're right there: The Armenians did ally themselves to the Crusaders. You're right about something! Great Work! Now you just have to keep it up!\r\n\r\n-> The Jews\r\n\r\n*sigh*\r\n\r\nI wasn't being entirely serious when I brought them up. I brought them up because the defense most used is \"The Crusaders were fighting a defensive/reconquest war!\"\r\n\r\nI was jokingly saying they should give the land back to the Jews, since they were the ones there before the Romans conquered, pillaged and genocided them; I was not seriously saying that should have happened. \r\n\r\nHowever, it was there for a reason: To show the absurdity of laying claim to a land that hasn't belong to you, your people, or whoever you're claimed it would rightfully belong to, after it hasn't been theirs for centuries (ergo: Reconquest. You get that? When someone steals from you and you take it back? Is that concept rocket science for you?)\r\n\r\nThe issue here, beyond how long the lands had belonged to Muslim rulers, is that a war of reconquest is to take back a land for the people or countries that used to live there. Bohemond wasn't from Antioch, his family had never been from anywhere near it. Baldwin had no claim to Edessa. Godfrey wasn't from a Levantine family, nor of a line of Kings of Jerusalem. The idea that the Kingdom of Jerusalem was reconquered is baffling in itself; there had never been a Kingdom of Jerusalem before, and the closest thing to that were the Jewish kingdoms of Judea.\r\n\r\nThis isn't a reconquest; it's a war of conquest, which isn't defensive by definition. Come on, we're talking about History here, not rocket science! It isn't that complex!\r\n\r\nBut please, do \"correct\" my points. Just make sure that, when you do, you actually base your arguments on actual historical fact ;)\r\n\r\nHave a good day yourself.",

This should not come as a surprise, but rather a proof that Bohemond's intentions weren't as egotistical as many think. \nWhy would you ally yourself with the man responsible for your father's death?\nEven the greeks saw him as sincere. Don't ask me, ask Anna Comnena (I translated her into spanish, if you want a copy)\n\n\nI understand how you don't see armenians coming into play since you haven't studied the Crusades. Armenians were the vast majority of the population in the Levant and the Holy Land during the Middle Ages. I mention them because it's like saying... mexicans in california? Maybe that's a dumb example.\n\n\nWell, you'd also remember that the Egypt-Europe relations weren't as bad half a century before the Crusades. Christians were oppresed by the Jiziya and were Dhimmis (and to say that's not persecution is frankly stupid) but foreign christians were allowed to make pilgrimages into Jerusalem. \nIf you should remember, after a coupe regarding the shia/sunni problem in Egypt, the new state started to chase, murder, and enslave pilgrims.\n\n\nJerusalem is the city of Jesus, so it belong to Christianity.\n\n\n\"This isn't a reconquest; it's a war of conquest, which isn't defensive by definition. Come on, we're talking about History here, not rocket science! It isn't that complex!\"\n\nLol, so it is rocket science to you m8. Do you seriously believe defense is only to guard yourself? Have you never practizes any form of martial art? Defense is rejecting attacks and winning, not hidding at your mother's skirt.\n\n\nI made allmmy basis on historical facts bro. And I know a thing or two about warfare and the difference between defensive and agressive wars. Aggressive war would be to take what is not yours, not retake what is tightfully yours.\n\n\n\"The idea that the Kingdom of Jerusalem was reconquered is baffling in itself; there had never been a Kingdom of Jerusalem before, and the closest thing to that were the Jewish kingdoms of Judea.\"\n\nRetaking Jerusalem is one thing. They installed the Kingdom for obvious practical purposes. Also,  bloodlines don't work that way. \nAnd the Kingdom of Jerusalem was instaurated during Palm Sunday by Jesus Christ. Maybe you should get some education.",

        "text": "@JuanJoséOñate-m4e Oh, so you're justifying the Crusades with the Bible now? Well, my good sir, I hate to inform this to you, but Jesus never held temporal power. Jesus never ruled over any lands. Therefore the \"Kingdom of Jerusalem\" in the bible is almost as much of a real, provable country that justifies a war of reconquest as Narnia.\n\n\nTo say that a holy book or a significant event in a religion's history is a valid claim to a city or territory would allow anyone to create their own religion and suddenly have a claim on any land. Therefore, Jerusalem being the city of Jesus has absolutely no importance, and does not justify a war fought to conquer it. If it did, then Christian countries should probably prepare for war against Israel, they're Jews after all, and we must reclaim the holy land.\n\n\n\nDespite what you believe, I did study the Crusades to a certain extent; I can't claim expertise, but I doubt you can either, so we're back to step 0 here. The Armenians were mostly located in Asia minor and the northernmost areas of what you could conceivably call the Levant. In fact, Armenian Cilica, which you mentioned, was in practice entirely within Asia Minor. Yet, it still does not matter as far as what I had said. I was talking about the states created in the Levant by the Crusader Princes, EG Baldwin and Godfried.\n\n\nFinally, since you mentioned it, I do actually practice a martial art. I do not believe defense is to only guard something. I know that sometimes, you have to attack. I never claimed otherwise, and I sincerely do not see how you could come to the conclusion that I did, or at least that I gave this impression. \n\n\nHowever, the Crusades were not defensive. They were a war of conquest. It is not defensive or a reconquest to try to capture land that has never belonged to you, and hasn't belonged to anyone even arguably similar to you (kind-of-sharing their faith, in this case) for over three centuries. If it was, then I guess the United Kingdom would be justified in trying to reconquer the USA right now. Spain would be justified to go on a reconquest against Mexico, Central America and most of South America (including Brazil, since it has taken bits and pieces of land that belonged to Spain all the way back in colonization), Germany to do so against France and Belgium and Poland and Russia, Austria to go absolutely ham in central and eastern Europe, and it goes on like that. \n\n\nIt is not defensive nor reconquest to take lands you have no claim on, apart from a book most of the world doesn't believe to be true anyways, and make your own kingdoms and principalities on it.\n\n\nAs for preventing/being hostile to pilgrimage, it's far from enough to qualify a war asdefensive. I am not claiming they were an act of aggression without any possible offense or any provocation, a mindless and mad act of savage brutality, at all for Christians to decide to go to war, but to classify it as defensive based on that would be absolutely ludicrous.\n\n\nFinally; the Treaty of Devol, which is the \"pact\" Bohemond supposedly signed with John Komnenos (it was actually with Alexios, but to try to discredit it just because of this would be more pedantic that what even I allow myself to be).\n\n\nIt was signed in 1108, between Alexios and Bohemond, years after the First Crusade, and it had provisions that would see the Principality of Antioch to become a Vassal of the Byzantine Emperor and later be assimilated. It happened after a war between Bohemond and the Byzantine Empire, in which he failed in his attempt to attack Constantinople through the same route he had taken alongside his Father's armies in his youth. While his army laid siege to Dyrrachium, his camp got blockaded by Alexios army, and he was forced to negotiate.\n\n\nThe result was the treaty of Devol, which was slanted to favour the ERE. Bohemond was made the Emperor's vassal, forced to cede disputed landsand admit a greek patriarch in Antioch (Religious suppression against the Eastern orthodox faith? On MY Antioch? ...It's more likely than you think) and would receive a monetary compensation from the Emperor. Bohemond, however, never returned to Antioch, and with his death, the treaty was rendered null and void.\n\n\nThis is the only pact or Treaty Bohemond ever signed with any Byzantine leadership. It also happened in 1108, years after the Prince's Crusade. He never intended to give the ERE a single bit of land, and when he would finally be forced to do so, he went into a self-imposed exile, from which only his corpse returned, thus making the treaty that would give back the ERE's land null. Truly a man who intended only to recover the land lost by the Byzantines, and not someone who wanted their own kingdom.\n\n\nBut sure, all you're saying is based on historical facts. I won't even deny that, they are. I don't doubt it. It just isn't supported by the historical facts it is based on.",

        "text": "@JuanJoséOñate-m4e Since you claim expertise, would you share your studies? I mean, if they were published, it should be possible to find them online. Can you at least provide me the titles?\n\n\nYes, Jerusalem had been for centuries a hot-spot of strife, and would remain so for even more centuries. It's kind of what happens when it's a holy city for two different major religions (and a third, minor one). People want control over the holy land, since that would be very prestigious, and also allow them to control access to it (and apply taxes to visitors, etc. It's pretty profitable, really).\n\n\nReligious strife is just one facet of religious strife, and religion being involved does not change the morality of the acts. However, given your reaction, I must assume you're Spanish, so you're not the one I should converse with about Colonialism, you will be irreparably biased anyways.\n\n\nBohemond was a special man. Exceptional among the Crusader leadership for his competence, ambitious, loved by his subordinates, etc. Apparently exceptionally good-looking amongst Crusaders, too; the Emperor's daughter, Anna Komnene, in fact, expressed her admiration for him specifically, in the Alexiad.\nAll of this, however, does not change that he wanted to give no land to the Komnenoi, the ones who would have any claim on it, and none of his Crusading allies did, either. They weren't reconquering, if they were the land they took in the first crusade would have been ceded peacefully and willingly to the ERE.\n\n\nMy subjective, atheist, modern - but moral, thank you very much - views, were not used to interpret history except in matters wholly unrelated to the point of view of the medieval Christians, such as \"Were the Crusades defensive?\" The moral standards which applied at the time make no difference, the medieval point of view doesn't matter. This isn't \"Did the Crusaders consider themselves defenders of Christendom?\", because they certainly did and questioning that would be an example of - if you forgive my slip into vulgarity - idiotic headassery.\n\n\nDoes what the Crusaders though and their moral views define whether the Crusades were defensive? If yes, then we have to consider: The Nazis were doing just the right thing, because they believed so; The Japanese were right to slaughter millions of Chinese civilians, because they thought they were weak scum and deserved it. These people also believed their cause, and all they did was because of their cause. The same excuse can be used here.\n\n\nOh but what is this? Religious strife and political strife can't be compared? Well, I entirely disagree with that, but it's all the same. By your logic, ISIS is fighting a defensive war, because A: The West and Syria and whoever else attacked and held land in Iraq and the Levant; B:Their struggle is religious in nature, since they wish for their religious view to prevail; C: They see themselves as righteous defenders of the Will of Allah, as they are the ones who have the correct interpretation of the Quran and who are doing Allah's will in trying to form a new Caliphate, in lands that the Caliphs and Islam have claim to.\n\n\nI don't think you believe that, so why (apart from your personal religious bias, which shouldn't be used in History) would the Crusaders be any different?\n\n\nCould it, perhaps, be that you are letting your religious bias guide you, when you shouldn't be judging others through the lens of your subjective, modern, western, religious, questionably moral views?",

        "text": "My issues with Crowder come from how often he is wrong, to the point that he either doesn't research at all, or, more likely, is deliberately spreading misinformation. In his website, for example, he hosts many articles claiming that climate change/global warming isn't real, but said articles use absurd claims. One such article, that I'm remembering off the top of my head, said that glaciers in Greenland were growing. The data seemed, at first glance, to support that. The issue was, that data went from something like August or September of an year to February of the next. The same source, taking a few years into account, would show that glacier rapidly shrinking, but hey, it grew in Winter, so it certainly must be always growing!\n\n\nThere were several other instances I saw of him lying or at least spreading misinformation in order to further his agenda in his actual videos, and this is why I have a hard time respecting the man, but I hope you can forgive me not remembering any specific one right now. I don't exactly watch his videos often - or at all, really.\n\n\nYou seem like a reasonable sort, so if you have the time, I'd recommend always double-checking what Crowder says, or at least not blindly believing it as truth. He very often spreads misleading information on the topics of migration, climate change and Islam. While I personally don't much care about the last one, and wouldn't mind if it stopped existing, it's still worth knowing Crowder is probably at least blowing it out of proportion when he brings it up.",

The global warming/climate change example assumes that later/conflicting data was viewed and simply disregarded at the moment of research. I personally don’t buy climate change hype, and it has nothing to do with Crowder, but rather what I have been able to ascertain via my own diligence. But I digress. I honestly think that this channel does the same thing that you charge crowder for in simply trying to further an agenda. I’ve been following and it seems to merely be an anti-right/anti-conservative channel. I could lead with that, but I don’t want to go off track from your actual comment and points made. It does stand to be noted that the same tactics seem to be present on both sides. For example, I’ve watched videos from this channel where the entirety of the information used to support the premise is all left wing sources, some of which have been caught outright manipulating data and information. So it would appear that many of us are simply attempting to further our own agenda. Honestly, it bothers me both ways. I’d rather a channel that opposes bad information where it is found, and promotes good information and research where it is found. This channel is pretty much anti crowder, Shapiro, etc., as if those men have not presented good information on many occasions. There’s no balance anywhere it seems. But I appreciate you taking the time to comment. I apologize if I’ve misinterpreted your positions or created a strawman at any point. Forgive me for the delayed response.",

        "text": "A a , I appreciate the response. I don’t think that it is accurate to state that crowder and others aren’t willing to have a debate simply because a debate was canceled, considering that there’s a sufficient number of debates where the people that you named are indeed debating and/or attempting to have a dialectic with those who they oppose. I don’t think it’s fair to point to an example of a canceled debate and use that to suggest that they aren’t willing to debate, or that they don’t debate people with whom they have opposing views. Likewise, to say that they “often cancel their debates” without a sufficient body of examples of such. There are men such as Jordan Peterson who has effectively responded to many intelligent left wing proponents and has not dodged a debate. I’ve also notice many people who subscribe to this channel claim that crowder only debates college kids, which is quite frankly false. These are, in my opinion, criticisms that are leveled in an attempt to discredit the individual without fairly assessing the individual, their merits, or the reasons behind certain actions (such as why much of the “change my mind” series is held on college campuses.) a sort of “Texas sharpshooter fallacy,” if you will. I will say that If they are indeed dodging debates, then they should be called on it publicly and persistently until they measure up to their own claims of objectivity and willingness to debate. I don’t support cowardice in the least. \n\nI’m not familiar with the individual that you named, but once I post my reply I will take the time to look at their channel. I’m not really into pro left or pro right. Many of my positions don’t come from Crowders videos or Ben Shapiro. I research the issue for myself. And I find in many cases much that both parties are overlooking and/or areas where both parties refuse to be reasonable or concede. I think that’s why seeing channels like this one are so frustrating to me, once I realize that it’s merely “pro —“ and not just a central location for truth and objectivity. But I digress. \n\nAgain, I appreciate your reply. I’m interested in your thoughts/response to my comment. Past all of the videos, the pro right or pro left arguments, and the debate dodging, I think it’s moments like this (where the average individual, such as you and I can come together and discuss these things respectfully and without animus) that matters most.",

What has always annoyed me is that many conservative commentators go on and on about the \"battle of ideas\" and how they would have left wing hosts on their shows if they could, but left wing hosts are apparently unwilling to come on. Or how some popular conservatives  will only debate big left wing politicians or new media hosts such as Ocasio-Cortez or people from TYT. For example, Dave Rubin goes on and on about the \"battle of ideas\" and how he loves it. He says that yet he barely ever brings a left winger on unless they're a left winger who bashes the left or they're a really famous politician of some sort. A bunch of left wing youtubers have expressed their desire to go on his show in order to present the progressive perspective yet he seems to only be interested in people like Bernie or Ocasio-cortez. \n\nI also think that your idea of listening to people who don't have bias is great, however I think it's impossible. If your a political commentator, you will have a bias towards the left, centre, or right. It's what I like a out Kyle, he would admit that he is pro Bernie/left, but he sticks to his principals even if it goes against Bernie/left. I can't really say the same for too many right wing commentators. Also, I haven't seen too much about J. Peterson, but I heard that he doesn't like being considered a right winger, so I didn't mention him.\n\nI have more to say but I'll say it in another reply.",

We may be going off into the weeds with this, but if you don’t mind the digression, then I’d surely like to continue conversing with you. Regarding Peterson, he doesn’t like to be placed in any category because he’s one who often sees problems with both sides.

        "text": "@rouchenelvann What I'm about to say is simply my opinion and your free to disagree. The reason Kyle and I believe that Trump would have a harder time against Bernie compared to Bloomberg is pretty simple. Bloomberg is trying to buy himself into the Whitehouse and he doesn't really have any policies which would be popular for your regular people.  Bernie is the most popular Democrat and I believe he's also the most popular politician in the US if I remember correctly. \n\nOne of the reasons Kyle believes that Trump won 2016 over Hillary is that he had populist policies mixed in with his more conservative policies. Stuff like ending the wars and getting rid of NAFTA for example. Me and him see Trump as more of a fake populist as many of his populist policies which have carried him haven't really been taken to fruition (Trump has increased drone strikes by 426% over Obama as well as not pulling out the US forces from any country - he even blocked legislation to end the Saudi lead Yemeni genocide, and his new NAFTA agreement isn't that much different from the previous one, plus other examples). Whereas on the other hand Bernie's policies are widely popular and have proven to work in other countries. 70% of US citizens want medicare for all, 62% want tuition free public college and 90% want universal child care. I live in the UK and many of the things Bernie is proposing already exist here and every other country in the developed world. If Bernie's policies are socialist policies, then the UK, Canada, Denmark, France and every other developed country is a socialist country.\n\nI myself am a Muslim, I respect Christian's very much, and we believe in Jesus too. Due to my Muslim upbringing I'm not too fond of the progressive views on Abortion or LGBTQ stuff. But I agree with other social and foreign policies. In our religion, we believe that it's a good thing to look after the more disadvantaged in society, and I believe that's the same with Christianity. That's why the more social democratic policies of the Bernie attract me.\n\nAnyway, thanks for reading this way too long post.",

        "text": "A a , I don’t mind reading long replies. Lol. On face, I can appreciate the points you made. I do disagree with most of the points you presented, though, because I think they’re either mischaracterizations (such as the statement that if bernies policies are socialist, then the Uk, Canada, Denmark, etc. are as well.) This simply isn’t true. Bernie himself supports socialism and calls on places like Denmark for support, while leaders of Denmark have publicly criticized bernies assertion that they are such. They are market economies. If Bernie doesn’t understand the difference, and calls on them as support for his socialist policies, then he either doesn’t properly research his references, or he’s doing an intellectual sleight of hand. Furthermore, there is a difference between having social services and being a socialist. That’s the difference with what Bernie is perusing vs what we see in other countries which aren’t actually socialist countries, or countries who’s wealth was gained by free market practices, and are not attributed as the product of socialism. I think we should be very careful not to conflate social services with outright socialism, which is what it seems you’re saying by stating that if a policy is considered a socialist policy, then the country is by default socialist. That would be the same as me stating that because much of the developed world holds similar policies and stances to America, that they are thereby constitutional republics. My apologies if I am misconstruing what you’re stating. I don’t mean to do so. \n\nAlso, the numbers you presented are incorrect, to date. Only 50 percent of American adults support Medicare for all. 73 percent would prefer a government plan that would rival private insurance plans, but would not want private insurance plans to be abolished (which is what Bernie proposes.) I believe that stat you’re referring to was from 2018. Similarly with the other numbers you referenced. Also, such policies are economically unsustainable. It seems to be the case that where there is single payer healthcare to the degree that Bernie is advocating, then the quality of healthcare falls and access to certain treatments are rendered unattainable. I will acknowledge that I’m speaking to what I have read and heard, and not necessarily to what I have personally been able to ascertain, so I may be wrong. I believe Thomas Sowell has spoken regarding many of the policies that Bernie espouses and the detriment thereof. \n\nAs far as looking out for the disadvantaged is concerned, I’m not sure how that equates to a support of socialism. As a Christian, I do help to provide for those who are truly disadvantaged, as the scriptures require. But I’m also aware that a man that doesn’t work should also not eat, having the ability to do so but exercising slothfulness or plundering others. And I think that, from what I’ve heard from Bernie and others, they don’t propose a way of ensuring that those who wait to plunder don’t become the greater beneficiaries of these socialist policies. Furthermore, I think the greatest way to help the disadvantaged is by creating more opportunities for them to lift themselves out of their situation. Merely giving free stuff rarely ever changes a persons situation for the better. We see people who win the lottery often end up worse off than before they won. Affordable housing complexes are often the most unappreciated by the very tenants who are benefiting from the low cost. And I could go on. Giving things for free often results in a lack of appreciation and taking advantage of the thing being given. But it also isn’t free. And I don’t see Bernie discussing how he’s really going to pay for the cost. Taxing the top 1 percent sounds good, but it’s unrealistic, and still wouldn’t suffice. You’d literally have to tax the common worker substantially. It’s a system designed to eat itself, from what I’ve looked at. \n\nHonestly, I may disagree with where you stand, but I appreciate the level of thought and consideration that you’ve placed into coming to your decision. Many that I’ve come across haven’t given sufficient thought and consideration into the people and policies that they support. We share a similar fondness, or rather, a similar lack thereof, for abortion and lgbtq stuff. And our faith shows also that we share many values. So I don’t want to get too caught up in where we disagree, without taking the time to acknowledge and focus on where we do have much in agreement. I appreciate your time and patience with me. Sometimes my thoughts aren’t as coherent as I would hope.",

These things are rare these days, even more so in a youtube comment section. I would, however (or rather, because of that), like to ask you a genuine question. How do you manage to act upon tought and facts for your politcal leanings and still act, on the other hand, upon faith of your respective religions? For instance on the matter of debates around LGBT matters?\n\n\nAlso, a slight data point that may be of interest about people taking advantage of the system: In France, where safety nets are in place for people who lost a job, struggle to find one, it has been proven that only 3% of people recieving benefits are taking advantage of the system in a delibarate fashion, and lose their rights to benefits if proven to take advantage of those rights. Meaning 97% of people who get those benefits genuinely need them. There are also studies that show a lot of people do not seek these benefits by fear of reducing their image to society, or simply because they would feel like their self-worth is dimished. Most human beings have a certain pride that pushes them to accomplish something, or makes them refuse to show the slightest weakness (financial status is a big deal in society). Being without a job is a rather depressing affair for a lot of people.",

        "text": "K. V. \n\nAs it pertains to my political leanings and my faith, I honestly haven’t found an area in which the two have come at odds. As it pertains the lgbt community specifically, though my religion deems the lifestyle sinful, I don’t stand against it simply because the scriptures tell me it’s wrong. I believe that if a religion, or more precisely, if God declares something to be wrong, then there is ample evidence outside of scriptures to show the detriment of such a thing. So considering the many areas where a homosexual lifestyle is bad for the person involved, the children involved, birth rates, personal mental health, the society as a whole, etc., I stand in opposition to the lifestyle, while still being able to love and be there for the person in their time of need, and allowing them the choice to live their life as they see fit. But my stances have only been settled on which a great deal of thought and deep considerations. I take months, and in some cases years, trying to truly understand a thought, belief, teaching, etc. I honestly think that much of the debates around many hot topics comes from people who have not given honest and considerable thought to what they support or oppose. And I can understand why. It’s uncomfortable. I know the discomfort that comes with not only questioning a belief, but also changing a belief that was held so close to the heart. \n\nAs far as your comment about people not abusing the system, in order to have a proper critique, or to support the position you hold, I would need to see exactly which studies you’re referring to. I’d need to be able to examine the measuring rod. Are these subjective studies? If not, what are the objective measures? How are they determining that only 3% are purposely taking advantage? How are they ascertaining that the other 97% aren’t? Etc. These are the immediate questions that come to mind, but as of now I’ll simply have to yield to what you are stating as being true, at least in regard to the studies you’re referring to. I do, however, see a much different picture here in America. Stay in any low income housing and it is common practice that the majority of people are taking advantage of the system. Many of them need it, but only because they aren’t doing what is necessary to lift themselves out of their position. To many here it is a crutch, not a safety net. Yes, many of them fill out applications for employment, go to interviews, and other things which would seem to indicate genuine effort, but they are doing so out of necessity, not because they actually want to free themselves from the assistance. I’ve seen this done for many years. I also do not agree that people generally have such pride that they don’t want to use these systems. I think that goes against human nature, which is to take advantage. The history of the world has been conquest and taking as much as can be taken. Yes, being without a job is a very trouble affair for many, but there are also a great many who are ok with not having a job, and plundering those who do, as well as taking advantage of systems in place. \nI don’t want to state too much and not give you an opportunity to respond. Thank you again for your kind words, and for furthering the discussion in such a manner. Looking forward to your response.",

        "text": "@rouchenelvann Thank you for your answer, and you are welcome to the words, they don't cost me anything and were deserved :)\nFor the number, I can't recall the exact study, it was a couple of years ago on a ministerial report (the ministry of work). The number stuck with me because we were in the middle of a reform regarding the partaining laws and it was quite a hot topic in the country. As for the tools used to obtain such a number: When without a job, to get your benefits, you have to go to a government institution called \"Pôle Emploi\". They will manage your rights based on familly status, owned property, previous position... a special councilor is assigned to you, he will study your case and determine a plan of action for you to get a job, depending on experience: same field, conversion trough training to acquire new skills, etc,... Every month, you have to check in, give reports, he will give you some info that might have come about on specific fields, or open job positions. Another branch of the same institution will check everything you do, verify the amount of job applications, call employers to have an idea of your behavior in an interview or an trial period, that kind of thing. You can also have one of those inspectors randomly shop up at your door to see if you are looking for a job, in which case you will have to whip out the paperwork in front of him. Those things are done daily, in the entire country.\n\n\nI think there is also a difference in how we percieve work in France. It is not as much a survival necessity on the financial level as it is in the US (well, it is, but it isn't considered as such). We work less, because we value familly life and social interaction a lot, as well as personal growth and social contribution, and it is taught quite young. For instance, we don't have a military service, but a civic service. between the age of 16 and 25, you can participate in the institution of your choice to a task of social interest. It can be electrician for the city, caretaker for kids after school on school grounds, emergency services, elderly care in retirement homes.... Work here is the social network. Outside of it you enter family time. Human connection and social worth is found trough work or service.\n\n\nAs for the \"mindset\" I speak about, I will have to admit it is based on personal experience, not official studies. I have been myself homeless, jobless, homeless and jobless for some time (thank you 2008 crisis, altho it is better now, got a nice flat and a job). I have met many people in the same situation. It took me three months of having one meal three or four times a week to push the door of a charity. I was in the mindset that \"I'm not about to take a meal that could be used by a mom with three kids or an elder, I'm young, able-bodied, I'll deal with it and find another way\". Now that I'm more stable, I give some time to such a charity. I've seen poverty evolve and touch new categories of people these last years (mainly the elderly and college students). I remember a teenage girl who came to us. Her father lost his job, and had benefits, but they were too low to take care of four kids (her included) and pay for her school. So he did what he felt he had to do: he did not eat and fed his kids, sold his car to pay for the school and walked to look for a job. The girl came to ask if she could be the one on the file as recipient because her father's former coworker was one of the charity's helpers. He was too ashamed. A lot of elderly have the same reflex. I've had a lady in her 80's telling me (not knowing I was working there) that I could get the juice bottle we had just given her because \"young folk have more need for vitamins than an old useless bat\" (her words). Poverty is not often inherited here as it is in the US from what I gathered (trailer parks and such are an image we get a lot here from your country. I don't really know to what extent they are relevant). It is encountered trough a life mishap.\n\n\nI have seen a lot of violence coming from the poorer classes of society, often desperate people lead by a few less morally inclined people, but also a majority of kindness and cooperation to survive. One of the most basic things among homeless people with dogs, for instance, is that they will feed their dog before themselves, for the simple reason that the dog is often the only friend they have. I think the biggest plight of poverty is solitude, isolation. Once we manage to solve that, things tend to take a better turn. For the last three years that I have been in that charity, I think I've encountered 5 or 6 people that were truly scum with no drive for anything but themselves (we serve 1M meals a year).\n\n\nAlso, the lgbt question piqued my interest because I come from a VERY christian background, but happen to be gay and now an atheist (let's just say I'm not exactly welcome in my parent's house anymore). I find strange the areas you cite as reasons for being against the topic. Apart from the nutjobs parading in leather on pride day that make a quite vocal (might I say way too loud) minority of the people in the lgbt situation (I call it situation rather than community. The majority of people with same sex attraction or trans identity never even try to include themselves in militant groups, or even communicate with them, contrary to what said groups would pretend to be, some sort of unified monolith representing everybody) are stable and quite average and usual people. Most of the time when there is an impact related to lgbt people on society, it is due to prejudice (not running the old suffering marathon, I despise it, but hear me out). Mental health issues related to that topic often arise when a person is discriminated or pressured by other people. As for children involved, many studies show the kids perform as well as any other kids, altho the sampling size is too small to be conclusive, which is to be expected when only 5% of the population as a whole are homosexuals, let alone parents. The most honest thing to say is \"There is nothing to this day to bring definitive proof on them better or worse off\". I don't want any kids, the only reason being social impact on them for having two dads. But that is more a choice I make because of society rather than personal inabillity. As for birth rates, well, that's a non-topic. I'm not about to turn straight anytime soon, be it legal or not to be gay, since it isn't a choice. And having sex just to further the line and give a nudge to demographics, mechanically, with no feelings involved, is not something that seems an option to me... The real reason the pushed me personnaly to be for same sex marriage in my country was a matter of financial equality. Married couples pay less taxes. Why should I pay more than my neighbours because I'm not married to a woman, and stuck with the interdiction to marry my partner? That was the train of tought.\n\n\nAgain, I want to thank you for the calm you display in a conversation, it is truly refreshing. I also apologise for any errors, english is not my primary language and I'm typing this at 5 am. Feel free to answer about what anything you want and exclude any topic, I'm not trying to start a debate of any sort, just seeking some outside perspective from polite people on what I guess is the \"other side\" of the political spectrum (another thing that seems strange as somebody foreign to the US. How did you manage to not kill each other both inside and outside the only two parties you have? We have at least 30 sitting in the Assemblée currently (equivalent to congress) and still nobody inside them agrees with each other).\n\n\nLooking forward to your answer as well.",

        "text": "K. V.   \n\nMy apologies for the delay. I suffered the loss of a close friend yesterday. \n\nI’d first like to share my gratitude and appreciation for people like you (namely, those who put forth their time to help others, and who genuinely care about the passions of others.) I can understand why you hold the position that you do regarding the system and those who take advantage of it vs those who utilize it due to necessity. It is definitely different here in America. I don’t want to give off the illusion that everyone here is taking advantage of the system, because that would be a gross exaggeration, but there are many among us who have married the system for benefits and luxury. There’s only a reluctance among those of us who value work and would rather make our own way, but have fallen on hard times. \n\nRegarding the lgbt community, i do agree that there is a small sect of flamboyant individuals holding the bullhorn making their views seem like the position of the whole. I’m sorry that you’re not accepted because of your views and sexuality. I don’t think that we do anyone a service by rejecting them. It never addresses or resolves the underlying issues. It only compounds things further. But, if I may respond sincerely, I’d like to offer a few points to consider. To the point of the studies which state that kids in same sex families perform as well as other kids, I’ve read a few studies that have drawn the same conclusion, but here’s my issue with the ones I’ve seen. Firstly, they are written by homosexual activists who seem to already set out to merely prove their position, not necessarily to ascertain truth. There also seems to be many variables not taken into consideration with said studies. There is also an elephant in the room when leaning on such studies: if fatherless homes have devastating effects on children (and ultimately society at large) as well as motherless homes, then how can it be concluded that homes without such function just as well as homes with such? There’s an extensive body of research thoroughly detailing the effects of fatherless homes. There’s psychological literature, statistics, etc, which give us a clear picture of what happens when the biological father is absent from the home. And there are no sound studies (at least not in my opinion) which show that replacing one of the biological parents with someone else is just as good as having the biological mother and father in the home. There’s also an issue regarding step parents and frequency of abuse, the domestic violence aspect (especially among homosexual women. A recent study indicating that same sex relationships among women have a higher rate of domestic than both same sex make couples and heterosexual couples), mental health (which I don’t think comes as a result of pressure, but rather is exasperated by it.) Which brings me to a deeper point. \n\nI understand what you mean when you say that being gay/trans isn’t a choice. I agree. But here’s where we get into an issue that actually piggybacks off of what I just stated regarding fatherless homes. Dr Joseph Nicolosi has demonstrated with amazing efficiency that among males homosexuality is actually the result of child development and absent, passive, or overbearing fathers. This is why many feel that they were born gay. That’s a false position to hold, but it’s a result of them being that way since they could remember (going back to early stages of development.) Dr Nicolosi is the creator of reparative therapy, also known as reintergrative therapy (not to be confused with conversion therapy) and had a 100% conversion rate among males, further showing that one is not born gay, or trans, but rather that one who projected something that was missing onto the same sex in an unnatural way. Sorry for the oversimplification. I would really recommend looking him up. He has lectures on YouTube where he explains it in detail. \n\nI don’t think, considering what I’ve laid out above, that it’s appropriate to assume that the only effects on society are merely that of prejudice. But I also don’t think that rejection or quarantine is the solution. Sadly people use religion as a battering ram, demolishing everything that they disagree with, and tearing down people in the process. I’m not here to condemn you. I think we could be very good friends, actually. But I digress. Hopefully I’ve offered a point worthy of your consideration. I look forward to your response.",

        "text": "​@rouchenelvann, I have been reading some of your comments here, I wanted to thank you for your calm and pro-social disposition, definitely unusual to see on youtube comments.\n\nI want to address really quick your reference to a Doctor Joseph Nicolosi- I think you may have been misled by certain christian activists, speakers, and self-described therapists into believing the evidence supports the idea that homosexuality is unnatural or wrong. I know that isn't your exact words but based on the body of your previous comment I don't think it's inaccurate. One thing I would like to point to- you say that the pro-conversion therapy doctor \"has demonstrated with amazing efficiency that among males homosexuality is actually the result of child development and absent, passive, or overbearing fathers.\". Notice how broad that comment is. Based on that premise, my homosexuality could be the result of a father who was absent, OR it could be the result of a father who was TOO present! (overbearing). Pseudoscientists like Dr Nicolosi (sorry if this term bothers you but it is accurate in my experience) usually will refer to \"studies\" they have done, without mentioning that they lack peer review or double-blindness, which is crucial to conducting effective studies, ESPECIALLY if you are trying to answer big picture questions like \"why are people gay\".\n\nOne last thing, and I encourage your response if you feel like chatting over these sources- you also mention that Nicolosi has a \"100% conversion rate\". You should understand that this is a high-bordering-on-impossible success rate for any therapy. It sounds to me like magical thinking. Even medically sanctioned therapies for mental disorders like CBT do not sport a 100% success rate. It is unfortunate but frequently conartists will draw people in with magical thinking and unrealistic promises only to ruin their lives later down the line.\n\nOnce again I appreciate your candor and straightforwardness, and I hope you can appreciate mine. I don't mean to step on your toes but I have a lot of experience studying disinformation and cults... Just to give you a bit of background on myself. \n\nBest wishes,\n\nSleepysloth\n\nP.S. So sorry to hear about the loss of your friend. I hope that you are able to find peace in these trying times- I hope you know we are all suffering a profound disruption in our lives, and you are not alone.",

So I will definitely take a look. Again, much appreciated. And I agree with being able to find whatever supports your political bias. I thought this channel would’ve been a good medium, but the more I watched the more it appeared to me to merely be a channel of leftist apologetics. Sadly, I’m still searching for something balanced, and not something merely seeking to prove the other side wrong.",

Depending on the tribe/reason behind the scalping, it could be done for vengeance (Proof of vengeance), rituals, etc...\nA thing to note, scalping was not like it is portrayed in the movies/western pop-culture during pre-Columbian times.

I'm British so you know the saying about asses and assumptions good sir.\nAnd as an aside. America used to be in the top 5 until just a few decades ago, I wonder what went wrong...could it be massive government interference with eyes on short term electoral prizes?\nBut that really is an aside. \n\n\nOh and yes, WW2 was an easily avoided continuation of WW1. As the British Foreign Minister stated at the time of signing of the Treaty of Versailles. \nThis is not peace but a ceasefire of war for 20 years. \nHe was wrong by a few weeks lol.",

There's no need to shout by the way ;)\r\"\n\n\nSo yes, you did say they were one and the same.\n\n\n1. The U.S. model is nothing like any European model. A side note, quality and template are not the same thing. We can both have the same plans for a house but if I build mine with bricks and you build yours with hay they are not the same. The problem in the U.S. system today are way too many to list. Teachers is one of them, the other is local government pushing classes such as \"Creationism 101\".\n\n\n2. The U.S. have NEVER had a good public education system. They have NEVER had a proper public system in place in order to give quality education to the population. They have always had sub-par results for the amount of funding.  As for you being British; I was hoping a Brit would know that there is no such thing as a \"British Foreign Minister\".\n\n\n3. Saying WWII is a continuation of WWI is a terrible simplification of a complex, global, sociopolitical problematic. And no, Arthur Balfour (the Secretary of State) did not say that, Foch is the one who said it. I'm telling you, the more you comment, the more people see you have no clue what you're talking about. \nAlso, Foch said that because he was for invading Germany and dismantling it. He wanted Western Germany to be a French satellite state with French troops garrisoned. It was the British and the U.S. that didn't want that to happen. Let us not forget that Foch is part of the reason why we had WWII, it's kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy. I'd go into more details but I've already spent too much time responding to you.",

Far too many folks however - especially young men - are really becoming enamoured by such ideas, especially when presented by those posing as the 'valiant defenders of Western Civilisation' and are buying straight into their message, without a second critical thought (suspiciously like the SJWs they love to hate...oh the irony).\n\nWhile I must be grateful for the valuable lessons learned from Molyneux et al, the inevitable conclusion of their worldview - a toxic mess of racial supremacy and hyper-individualism - made it impossible to accept.

And just to head off any bullshit claims of racism, there's a reason I make the distinction between \"black Americans\" and actual \"African Americans\". I understand it's a cultural issue, I even understand where the cultural problem extends from. The enslaved Africans inherited the culture of their masters (unsurprising since they didn't have access to any other culture, and were even dissuaded from practicing their own), and the southern Americans had a rather terrible culture that they had in turn inherited from the regions of Europe that they migrated from. The funny thing about bad cultures, is that they tend to last longer where supplanted than where they originated. African immigrants to the US, tend to do okay for themselves and their children only get better, much like Asians immigrants. They do so well in fact, that on average they end up better off than white Americans.\n\n\nActions speak louder than words.\n\n\nUsing the government to force people to follow your thinking is authoritarian.",

        "text": "@frankmcgovern5445 well this will take some time.\n\n\n1st) I never called YouTube itself authoritarian. I said it was pushing people to the \"far-left\" which is authoritarian. And this is true, Tim Pool has shown many times how YouTube has a strong pull on the \"right\" and center towards the \"left\". Yes the majority of your recommendations are related to what you watch, but YouTube sprinkles the \"left\" all over. Meanwhile there is barely any pull on the \"left\" towards either the center or \"right\". This is just YouTube's bias, that doesn't make anyone a victim, especially since you still have to click on the videos yourself (unless you have autoplay on, but that's still a choice you make).\n\n\n2nd) I have also never claimed the \"right\" can't be SJWs, in fact I am of the opinion that the \"right\" was the original SJWs. There was all that bullshit about \"Dungeons & Dragons\", the censorship of entertainment (especially rap & rock music, and video games), and the bullshit with homosexuals. Now the \"left\" has taken up the mantle of SJW. If you have to add a modifier to the word \"justice\" it ceases to be justice.\n\n\n3rd) There's plenty of hate speech on YouTube that gets ignored. It's just an excuse that is applied when there's no real reason for deplatforming. Just like Patreon , kicking Sargon for saying \"nigger\" and yet there are plenty of people that make even more than him who are still on their platform, even after being brought to their attention. There's also the fact that private businesses have been treated like public spaces before (again Tim Pool covered this), heck even Twitter has that with not being allowed to kick Trump.\nThere is some leeway in libel laws that allow journalist to make accusations as if fact while claiming they are opinions later. Granted I don't think the laws need more power. Only 5 president's, including Trump, have won despite losing the popular vote.\nGerrymandering is pretty shit and used by both sides to try and eliminate the voice of their opponent. The electoral college though is necessary. Also if more people would actually get out and vote, we could get away from this pathetic two party system.\nThis claim is going to need some proof, funny how there's so much \"right\" wing murder that Jussie Smollett had to make up his hate crime, and the lies with the Covington Catholic kids. I will grant you that the \"left\" doesn't seem to have murdered anyone, but they are still assaulting people constantly.\n\n\n4th) There's a big difference between regulation and banning. Also your misconstruing the \"well-regulated\" part,\n\"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\"\nThere is nothing in that that says the firearms are to be \"well-regulated\".\n\n\n5th) Are you talking about this?\n\"The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!\"\nHe called out  5 specific outlets. That is not the same as saying all free media is bad.\nAre you honestly going to suggest that no free press could be lying? How is the media misportraying news in order to push a divisive agenda, not bad for us the people?\nAlready covered the libel stuff.\nAnd here we have the perfect example of fake news. Tell me, how do you know these children are being permanently separated from their parents? How do you know that the people they crossed with where their parents? Oh that's right, you have no idea. You would prefer to leave these children with potential strangers who have kidnapped them (and statistically speaking most likely raped them if they're girls) because you care so much about these kids. Meanwhile ignoring all the actual US children stripped from their parents over nonsense.\nThere are people actually calling for the abolishment of our borders.\n\n\nBonus: since you whined about the border issue, where were you when Obama was doing the exact same thing? Hell some of the pictures they used to damn Trump, where from Obama's time.",

        "text": "Short answer: Partially\nLong answer: There were a lot of incentives within the church, partially having the motivations to help an ally and put a stop to muslims invasions, not to forget their advances over Iberia also motivated a lot to hit them back,but under all the motivations the motivation of taking it for monetary gain was a big part to do so as well, just as the caliphate had invaded and kept the land before them\nIn summary, the intentions of the political game are to complex to try and look for right and wrong, even less in the old times where most were invading each other and they all to some extent supported practices seen as savage nowdays\nThe church was a big institution and the motivations of an individual or kings to go to war can  be many\nAnd even if somebody is an absolutist who says only greed was part of the invasion to conquer and keep the land, then also the muslims doing the same,invading and keeping rule of the land with no other religious motivation behind is also \"logical\",but no their institutions were also complex and their motivations many,including politcal gain, even worse in their case, since not even defending anyone was part of the equation,also that does not change the fact of muslim agresivness (which also does not mean neither side were or could have been equally agressive hell the crudades sacked constantinople and kept invading asia minor)\nBut the truth is, its just humans being human conquering each other and always seeking politcal gain as a result of their actions,true,but that does not mean religious intentions to take land  (in both invasions of the holy land chirstian and muslim)were not in the mind of all leaders at the time or that none of the minor players and soldiers involved in the case of the crusades wanted to  make muslims advances stop,which it did for a while\nAnd even if it was not defensive said muslim advances (just like any others)dont really allow them to have the moral authority over certain issues\nEven if their intention was not to defend the byzantines it clearly had in mind to stop their advances towards europe to avoid another Spain, which it did as I said but was not successful\nspecifically all the way to vienna\nPs: I meant caliphates in plural I know there were more than one at the same time\nAlso no,they were quite succeful at least for a while of stoping muslim agression,which did not work long term and their ottoman succesor invaded all the way to Viena\nThe byzantine emperor literally asked the pope to invade the holy land to stop the muslims advances which it did ,true the pope in particular did not care that much about the empire (he put stratigic importance before religious liking with them) but many people in the church kings and soldiers did,plus the adjacent and obvious goal that even the pope saw of stopping the muslims regardless if he cared or not about the empire to avoid another muslims invasion of europe just as it happened in spain which it did for a while, and to try to ensure that goal,also invaded asia minor just as the muslims had done before\nAnd yes a dick move that to assure their \"compensation\" they betrayed them but the invasion of asia minor was to try to put defennes on the hands of the church,because the byzantines sucked at defending from the muslims",

Only to justify it with the same (n)arrow minded conclusion every time: labeling it 'not systematic'.  \n\n- Three Arrows fails to discredit the map of Islamic expansionism (no, discrediting the author as 'problematic' is not a historical counter argument)\n- It was stated, on multiple occasions, that Islamic conquest meant only a change in government and that Islam expanded rapidly because people of the book tolerated each others (what are janissaries?) \n- (18:50)\r The horrific violence committed by Muslims is 'most likely a work of fiction' or at least was not systematic (anyone who has studied the history of Ottoman expansion will beg to differ)\n- Christian faith survived or even thrived under the watchful eye of its Islamic masters, since at the time it was a pretty good deal serving Islam (I mean...)\n- (20:15)\r In reality while it is true pilgrims were maltreated there was no systematic persecution, however episodic violence did occur (not all Muslims you guys) \n\nThe only point which makes these delusional historical perceptions tolerable is the conclusion that faith had very little to do with both Muslim and Christian aggression, and it was simply a struggle for power and influence, something from what I have seen, both Three Arrows and Crowder agree with.",

The map is discredited because it marks battles between Muslims and other Muslims, government changes and simple territorial fights, not as it is portrayed in the map where a unified Muslim group attacked the Christians as it would like you to believe. I'm pretty sure he even linked a whole reddit discussion on why that map is a load of shit. The main point of mentioning who the author is, is it removes the validity of it shows Crowder's either lack of research or malicious intent on his part to present that map as fact and to cast doubt on Crowder's other sources. The Crusades may not have actually unified European countries but I believe that you'd also agree that the Pope wanted to unifying European countries to fight Muslims so he could establish more power. I never said Islamic conquest was good, I may of stated that Islam was relatively tolerant of the Christians and Jews in their territory and lived side by side with them also, as you even stated. The fact that had to pay special taxes isn't intentionally dishonest or biased, instead it shows that the Islam territories were relatively accepting of other religions and that there are significantly worse prosecutions of religious people today. Like myself Three Arrows never denied that there were probably terrible things that happened to Christians but rather that it wasn't on a large scale nor systematic. Three Arrows didn't blame Christians, he pretty much exclusively blamed the Pope for his inflammatory retircot that were untrue and for calling the Crusade. Of course Three Arrows will be biased against Crowder but he ceartainly wasn't having an apologist approach, why would he? Unlike Crowder, Three Arrows doesn't have much reason to push a narrative. Three Arrows even states towards the end of the video \"that an argument could be made that part of the Crusades were defensive against the Turks aggression but this isn't it.\" Which I don't see how you can say he is biased or an apologist if he says that in his video so were you just not paying attention to the video.or something? I don't care who are causing the most suffering during the time period the Christians/Catholics or Muslims, I'm an atheist, I have no horse in this race. However based on the knowledge I have, I would say that the Christians/Catholics committed more unnecessary suffering on people than the Muslims did, but that's not me saying Islam is worse or better than Christianity/Catholicism.

I've attacked the way you've read something I've written and then flat out said I stated something completely different. I also attacked you for when you put the word empathy in a sentence that made no sense because I part of having a discussion is that we need to understand what each other are saying but I couldn't understand what you were saying because of your idiocy. I have attacked your arguments, your the who has refused to actually attack mine. Nothing in this entire comment chain is an actual attack on pretty much anything Three Arrows or myself claimed. You have however stated something as a fact without providing any evidence, so rightfully so I don't care about your claim. I'm open to learning about the Crusades from idk an hour long video or something, but I'm not about to go buy a bunch of books on the Crusade. I've actively asked for evidence of why I was wrong when I said \"Islam was relatively tolerant of Christians in Islamic territories, yes Christians had to pay special taxes, but comparitiblity they lived not too bad lives\" you said that's a load of bullshit but then fucking refused to give me evidence so I'm left to believe that you don't have anything to support your claims. I'm not salty if you are a \"historian\" but so far \"i'M a HiStOrIaN\" has been your only thing you've backed your claims with, so all your doing is trying to intellectually superior to everyone else and for people to take your word for it. You haven't just stated In wrong, you've been trying to prove I'm wrong but you haven't provided me with anything that disproves Three Arrows video. I don't care if I'm wrong or right so that's why I have been asking you to cite evidence of why I'm wrong, but considering that you haven't done that I'm led to believe that I am right, simply because a \"historian\" couldn't find a single bit of evidence to prove me wrong. I probably won't reply unless you actually present evidence.",

As 3 Arrows said, it was an accurate map of territorial expansion and simply listed the battles fought and made no claim as to the nature of those battles. Why are you arguing with a claim that nobody made?\nTake a look at this\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymI5Uv5cGU4&t=660s\nJerusalem became Pagan Greek because of Alexander the Great in 328 BCish. In 135 BC, It was Roman. It turned Christian on its own with no conquest. It was Persian briefly in 615AD for 15 years or so. In 636, the rashidun caliphate burst onto the scene @8:59. The Muslim conquest after that was sweeping West and North. So forget the battles and just look at the territorial expansion. Are you saying you would not be alarmed as a European? You can say, \"Well, the Greeks and the Romans did it, so turnabout is fair play.\" I would agree, but they were pagan and the turnabout is fair play applies to the crusades as well when the Celtic and Germanic people first got involved. \nWhether something is \"evil\" or not is for story-tellers, but there definitely was an \"Islamic jihad wave\" as you put it.",

Religion caused most of the genocides in history to happen because people followed them like sheep. Why keep following any religion into killing others? It's not like Islamic people condemn their own acts of terror upon the world both in the past and the present so why does anyone need to pay them any mercy, which by the way, if you did condemn them, I find you likely to be not living for much longer, much like any religion except the one who actually expanded to the point that they made the a world power based on the idea that your religion shouldn't be a crime.

That is, you made them both up.\nPull a time-code from Crowder's video where he said that and I will apologize and tuck my tail between my legs and walk away in shame.\nThis Crowder video was not meant to be a thorough historic lesson. It was merely to say, \"Hey, they started it!\" as a rebuttal to Cenk saying, \"They didn't go up there, you came down here.\"\nSo you think your moderate version of \"they expanded a 'bit' West\" is racist in some way? Can you help me understand that? You do realize that Europeans fought each other over land for millennia? You understand that the justification was usually, \"They did X to us, so we are justified in doing it back.\"? Kinda like Native American complains, reparation complaints, and colonial complaints.\nLastly, watch this \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymI5Uv5cGU4&t=660s\nat 8:59ish and tell me that this expansion could honestly be described as a \"bit?\" How many millions of square miles must expansion be in your view to exceed your \"bit\" category? I suppose Attila the Hun, Genghis Khan, and Alexander the Great expanded a \"bit\" too?",

I love Crowder and have no idea why people are taking everything he says as a personal attack and I don't know why the right is doing the same thing here.

Most Conservatives love Trump's tariffs on China when it is killing our economy and the farmers in the midwest. Most Conservatives are racist bigots who love that Trump is locking kids in cages separated from their parents etc. I could go on and on.

You and I both know exactly what obstruction I'm referring to. \n\nEnlighten yourself. The Special Counsel would not be able to convincingly convict beyond a reasonable doubt of conspiracy specifically because of the obstruction detailed meticulously in the report, but also because as you already know, the Department of Justice does not take it upon itself to indict the President. But if you're trying to claim there was no obstruction, the burden of proof falls entirely on you. The Special Counsel has already compiled its evidence of obstruction. Enough evidence of so many different and separate acts of obstruction, that any normal person would be facing almost life in prison.

So let me be perfectly clear here:\n\nVideo one: Oliver is showing clips of Juliani basicaly edmitting to collusion, but he never states it as a fact.\n\nVideo two: He talks about the Russian election.\n\nVideo three is some kind of compilation, and the closest I can get to a statment as you are claiming are Oliver saying that one of trumps tweet sounds like denial when Trump is tweeting about \"no collusion\".\n\n\nSo I think we can all agree that you are full of shit.

Meanwhile, capital punishment is more expensive than keeping them alive, can kill innocent people, and unnecessarily harms the lives of family and friends of the person who committed the crime. In addition, even some right-wingers are anti-death penalty because they like many leftists don't think we should give that kind of power to the state. Also, we call out the irony of saying you are pro-life but also support the death penalty. In addition, an atheist might oppose the death penalty because in their minds it causes no real punishment to the person being sentenced to death as they aren't going to an eternal life of hell they just die. Also lastly it's been proven by a multitude of studies that the death penalty doesn't make the victim of the crime's family or friends feel closure or any better, in fact, since there are constant legal battles over what is happening to the person who committed the crime and have to keep up with it, the death penalty can actually make people less likely to move on from what happened.",

You can go from one to another in 4 hours in a car. The third Elites and the ruling class in Mecca literally oppressed Muhammed and his followers for years and they escaped to Medina. In Medina Muhammed created a constitution to live peacefully with religious Jews in Medina which is thousand years ahead of his time. Fast forward to the future everyone converting to Islam left and right. Even the ruling class in Mecca literally did everything to kill Muhammed and his followers leaving Mecca and converting to Islam and asking forgiveness after what they did to Muhammed and his loved ones for years. Muhammed forgave them and thanks to this ruling class Muslims learned the situation of Mecca. All of them just walk into Mecca without any weapons because they thought they couldn't stop and kill them like before because they have huge numbers now. Which that was what happened. The ruling class couldn't do anything and they had no choice to let them into Mecca to their homes (which is looted by the ruling class after they escaped of course). No innocent got killed. I mean what did you expect? All of them have relatives in Mecca and some of the Muslims literally left Mecca and converted to Islam less than a week ago.",

Keep the \"13 years\" in mind because after those 13 years, the Prophet and his followers were eventually given permission to fight back and engage in wars. Those 13 years basically consisted of Muslims being mocked, boycotted, beaten, tortured, killed etc. (the conditions worsened gradually over time) by the oh so friendly Arab pagans, while the Muslims basically were living out pacifism.",

I'll explain:\n\n\n-The first Crusades were about defending Europe from the advancing muslims. You have the victory of Charles Martel, regarded as the first crusade, the Norman conquest of Sicily, the first battles for the Reconquista, the defence of Touluse, etc, centuries before the First Crusade to Outremer.\n-War needs money. At the time of the muslim conquests, Europe was a developing economy. For centuries Europe had depended on eastern trade and grain to sustain itself. Like, remember why Ptolemaic Egypt, Anatolia, and the buffer Seleucids were so important to the Roman Republic and latter to the Roman Empire.\nWhen the trade gateway to the East was broken, the european princes saw themselves almost completely empoverished and without a good food chain supply. This economic crisis is what led to what we understand as Feudalism.\n\n\nSo, to ask why european christians couldn't retaliate agaunst the muslim hordes at the start of the muslim conquests is.... pretty ignorant. It is like asking why can a mugged man ask for a cab.\n\n\n\n\n\"Also, it was done for politics.

Right, at the start, they were impoverished because of their supplies being broken, but there had been moments when Europe was relatively unified, as it was under Charlemagne, for example, or even his heirs. Heck, you didn't even need a fully unified continent with how faith was viewed at the time, one call to arms and you'd have an army in no time, but at no point in time did anybody, king or pope care that much at the time about Jerusalem falling since it didn't affect them directly. I mean, one of the reasons that Pope Urban called for a crusade was to unify the squabbling lords at the time (among other reasons) against a common enemy.\n\nRight, my point here was that they dropped out of the Crusades entirely, I mean, the County of Edessa and Principality of Antioch and their respective rulers both dropped out of the Crusade despite having been previously part of it.",

The sacking of 1204 had more to do with the centuries old inner civil wars of the Roman Empire than Crusading agression. They were offered boats ans supplies if they could reclaim the throne for Alexios IV.\n\n\nTbh the late XIIth Century and early XIIIth Century of the Roman Empire are like a soap opera. Basically: Alexios IV was exiled by Alexios III, so he offered Enrico support and money in exchange for his throne.\nWhen the Crusaders took the city, Alexios IV found the city's coffers empty, and the Crusaders looted the city. \nA year later, Isaac II revolted at Hagia Sophia and murdered Alexios IV, and Alexios V endured a second siege. \nThe one of the crusading officers, Baldwin of Flanders, set himself as Latin Emperor of Constantinople.\n\n\n\n\nAnd yeah, everyone in Europe was like WTF MAN?",

Paper, Silk and Gun powder are chinese inventions so why not studying China and Europe at the same time ?

China is very VERY old. They had so much Civil wars (An Lushan rebellion, 3 kingdoms etc.) It's normal someone will specialize in a certain period or place in China without studying China entirely.\n\n\n\nEurope's history  is aleready large so dividing east and west is pretty logical.

Of course \"East Europe\" is an oversimplifyed umbrella term to include countries in the \"east\" side: polland, Greece, Bellarus etc.\n\n\nEurope was not always interconnected as today. It always depends on what period, what situation, what context etc. By not always interconnected I mean:  Roman empire didn't contact the Scandinavians on a daily baisis. Maybe they traded but it's not your local grocery store. Maybe they once fought but it's not your annoying neighbor. That's why the term \"European history\" doesn't always work.
