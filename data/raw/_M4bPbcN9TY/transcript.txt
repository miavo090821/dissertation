with it this country has spoken H you know I tell my students Vox popular VX day uh you know and that's just it I'm sorry the masss have spoken you got to listen and we have to be like chairman ma theory and practice it's nice to have the theories you got to put it into practice then from the practice you go back to the theory and you adjust the theory you throw out the theory and you develop a new synthesis that can help explain what the practice has given you in terms of evidence unless you're doing that everybody's ah heads in the sky you remember they used to talk about Socrates in the in the clouds right that's what we we're like sophistry now I got the Democratic party are like the Contemporary sophists right they're just they're just babbling away no pra no no roots in the ground we gotta have roots on the ground and that's the importance of ACP that's what we're up to and that's what we proved last night yeah I couldn't agree more with your analysis of the the election overall I've been echoing a lot of those same points with my content and election analysis and I even noticed uh this video of Hassan [ __ ] just came out where he says you know based on the election results I feel like it's time for the ACP to rise up and he's kind of kidding but I think that's him realizing that people in this country are desperate for an anti-establishment um anything in politics you know anything anti-establishment but they view wokeism you know and and the so-called lgbtq movement uh being enforced um upon them from the top down by these think tanks and um corporations and whatever else they view that as part of the establishment so for someone like Hassan [ __ ] this is why his views have been going down because you know yeah he's leftwing economically but he's pushing these liberal cultural views and the this liberal wokeism that regular working-class American see as part of the establishment as from The Establishment and they're correct in that you know so so the the the it's really um fertile grounds as as Carlos would say um for a a a real anti-establishment party and real anti-establishment politicians who don't buy into the um weaponization of identity politics and and so-called wokeism of the Democrats and the liberal ruling class and you know what this is something that ha mentioned at the beginning of his stream yesterday and I also think think Jackson mentioned it in his uh show from today by the way for those that haven't watched Jackson's news show it's incredible he's got some of the best guests on and even the programs he does alone are also amazing but there's something very sweet about seeing the Democrats lose these are the people that have been stopping us at airports the last four years giving a thumbs up for what you know for being peaceloving patriotic Americans these are the people that have censored us in a million different ways ways these are the people that transferred control over the algorithms of various apps to entities that are designed to get us to accept their narrative to reject the truth um and to censor the truth to censor the censing voices and thereby take away our right to uh free speech um so these are the people that have made it already feel like we're living in some form of fascist uh capitalist governance so it's pretty sweet to to see them uh lose that doesn't mean we're pro Trump but the reality is that uh at a very personal level I'm kind of happy to see uh these liberals uh coping and and seething and I wanted to start off our discussion of the elections in general the presidential elections by showing you guys this video that I think you will enjoy it's a compilation of uh liberals freaking out and crying about the election results so we'll watch uh bits of it and then come back and and analyze all right guys it's time to go to bed none of us are stressed about the election right it's all we all areen going to just go have the best night the best night sleep of Our Lives aren [Music] we all [Music] do you realize how [ __ ] weird you have to be to grab a phone and just start crying on camera social media brain Rock I'm done I'm done I'm done I'm done with you I'm done with you and your mother and your sister I'm just done with all of this guys we literally you know what this actually reminds me of Carlos it and Chris it reminds me of people who like put emotional attachment into NFL football and it like you know makes or breaks their week depending on how their team does um they have no control over it you know nothing's going to change either way they're not even part of the team uh the team doesn't even really care about them but they put so much emotional attachment into watching this uh scoreboard and I like sports but it's just insane to me we'll show a little bit more and then uh we'll come back to the drawing board have to freak out right now we don't even have to [ __ ] like we don't have to freak out we don't want to freak out because it's not even real because [ __ ] recount the vote guys I just voted and I chose family end this Ray the terror now I chose family I chose women I chose America I love you we're moving on I'm moving on we're moving on I love all of this let's do it let's do this bro and these are the people that sit there and talk about like the workers that voted for Trump being a part of a [ __ ] cult you know it's insane these people have seen as everyone in the [ __ ] planet has seen over the last year plus American bombs land on babies kill according to the Lancet report around 200,000 Palestinians innocent civilians little kids all over our feeds dismembered not being able to see the age of 30 they've seen this for a year they've seen what their tax dollars have gone to do what has been supported by this genocidal fascistic Administration not just supported in the sense of giving funding and and giving the weapons but supporting it through and through in the international Arena you know providing cover for the Zionist entity and then they want to vote for them because of what a political football called abortion rights that they've had decades to Cod codify and they never did because if they codify it what the hell G are they going to run on in 2028 or 2032 I mean this is the essence of what Lenin talked about when he talked about social shavinism giving the big old thumbs up to imperialism and the plunder of foreign lands and the bomb drop and the killing of millions and hundreds of thousands just because I can get a little bit more crumbs it's ridiculous and I'm glad we should be laughing in their face because of how [ __ ] ridiculous and social chauvinist they are any your analysis I would love you listen um I've seen a lot of those videos today number one we are in a deeply sick Society we are let's be honest um number one you got to be really privileged to do that kind of stuff to just kind of hang out and cry into a camera um egotistical narcissistic that's what you know Eddie said it right this is a social social media brain rot that we have we've created a society of petty narcissists uh that go around and only care about themselves how they look how they um how they Trend and I think it's I think it's deeply disturbing you know my mom used to say if you know something happened to me and I would be angry I would you know she would say suck it up buttercup you know you gotta pick yourself up I'm sorry you gotta move on and so today this you know everybody's you know the kind of wailing and nashing of teeth that almost feels biblical you know that's happening today um you know for me I I kind of I enjoyed it because then I said now you know how we feel when the US installs dictators in our countries huh how does it feel you know how's it feel to not not have it go your way you know H just to just to kind of you know like for us you know like you know for my family that came from overseas you know the US installed dictators monarchs fascist regimes our families continued to fight nobody cried into a camera people fought people went to prison people were executed people were exiled you know I don't I don't want to hear it you know you don't like it organize I don't know what to tell you you know what are you just going to cry and lament for the next four years it doesn't make sense it's not it's not serious politics ultimately it's pure theater it's it's performance right it's not even worthy of like a cheap off Street Broadway performance right if I want to see theater I want to see [ __ ] Shakespeare you know or I want to see some socialist art you know I don't want to see I don't want to see this kind this is a cheap cheap gimmicks and cheap tricks right that's why I don't buy it I don't buy it I think it's very disingenuous I think It ultimately shows the vapid shallowness of our politics in the United States uh it shows the unseriousness and ultimately you know when I go to other countries I say my God these civilizational states have real politics right not this not this kind of politics real politics politics patriotism family the nation you know um we don't have anything like that now it's all about me me me me the me generation right and um at this late stage of of capitalism at this late stage of of Empire we really have become you know you know an Empire of babies um I really believe that and so when you when you look at that and you analyze you say how how can how can these things happen I think that the push back last night was against this tendency I think that a lot of people are just sick of it they're sick of seeing it and they wanted to hand the Democrats the Big L um and I think they'll keep handing L's uh if this if if situation doesn't change this is this is an extension of the larger culture War issues um because ultimately it's a it's a it's a war over what does American culture and American civilization look like really if you think of it that way are we going to be a civilization are we going to be a nation of you know crybabies and and you know you know people who are just self-absorbed all day every day or are we going to be a are we going to be a country of communities that are resilient that continue to fight uh for their well-being and I I don't know I think it's still up in the air where we go I know that ACP is committed to a vision that is of a nation that is Unified that is collectivized that is one that fights for one another and for the downtrodden we we are not we're not we're not there yet I mean we're in Nation still beholden to to Capital to the ruling class uh to the global Elite uh to those who continue to plunder the resources of this
