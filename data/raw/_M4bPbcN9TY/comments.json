Trump represents the lower end of the Capital order, while Kamala Harris not as rich as Trump represents the higher end of the Capital order. They are both Capitalists, and they are both Zionists. But Trump doesn't have the blood of tens of thousands of Palestinians in his hands like Kamala Harris. Trump might have done the same thing if he was in the office for the past 1 year, but he wasn't in the office for the past 1 year.",

        "text": "Celebrating Harris losing, is not the same as celebrating trump winning. Harris deserved to lose. She did nothing to earn votes. In fact, she did everything she could do to drive voters away by not being willing to compromise even a little bit on the issues important to the voters. She was told multiple times over the last year that there were policies and practices that voters were 100% against, and she continuously stated she wouldn’t change anything. Also her supporters were insufferable. They would actually go on comment threads where someone posted the loss of family members and why they couldn’t support democrats, demanding fealty to Harris. They showed themselves to be entitled, completely out of touch, narcissistic, selfish, and entirely devoid of conscience. \n\nNow the masks are coming off and some Harris voters, rank and file democrats, are publicly calling for legal, and illegal, immigrants to be deported, demonstrating their fascist tendencies. They are also calling for white women to be beaten and r-word that usually follows beaten when targeting women for criticism, (seriously, there is nothing lower than a woman calling for that act to be done to another woman), demonstrating their misogynistic tendencies. There calling for black men to be victims of police violence, (seriously a black woman calling for a black men to be victimized by the state is repugnant, and at least as low as the other thing they’re calling for), demonstrating their inherent racism AND sexism. Watching them cry now, considering how reprehensible and insensitive to others’ grief, suffering, and anger, they have been, is just satisfying.",

    "text": "Eddie made such an interesting comment about the parallels between American partisans & NFL fandom. Peter Coffin has talked about this at length too (I'm part of CPI, love what you guys are doing, & would love to bridge the gap). \n\nI'm from Pittsburgh originally, so the Steelers have always provided events for family bonding through the years. If  anyone is familiar with the NFL, the Steelers play a style that keeps the game unnecessarily close, & my mom & I will find ourselves being nervous throughout the game. On election day, my mom (a Trump supporter with a strong rational kernel for doing so initially) was acting differently than usual. When I asked her what was wrong, she responded, \"This whole day has felt like a really long Steelers game in terms of how nervous I've been all day.\"\n\nFandom, which is presented as an identity point in our society & is reinforced by capitalist market ideology, makes humans ignore countervailing evidence in front of our faces & demonize those outside the fandom (or ideological in-group in politics). I experienced this first hand, until I was locked in my house & started reading theory in 2020.",

I know that most of the people here, are communists, but communism is not what we \"want\" or \"think\" it is, its something very specific, and it has nothing to do with camala and especially trump. Being happy trump won, as a communist, is a bitter joke. Anyone wonders why? Besides the obvious, to me, as a communist, i see two \"crutch\" parties, one being a crutch party for the \"lefHAHAHAt\" camala, and the other for the right /to far right trump. It seems to me that \"patriotic socialism\" on one hand is the result for those that ACCEPTED western propaganda (that stalin was a kind of a fascist for example) and they just support it, cause SOCIALISM ( especially Marxism/Leninism) IS patriotic already, so saying \"patriotic socialism\" is like differentiating yourself from this ACTUAL WORKING theory that freed MILLIONS (see how russia was before bolsheviks and after for example, they did not support the \"revolutionary\" Kerensky NOR any other \"revolutionary\"). Also, when you have some millions in your country without work or healthcare  THIS should be the basic propaganda subject, not the \"woke\" agenda, ok, all normal people will laugh at these people, exactly as they laugh at trump supporters doing their things. I see some honest people here being mislead by partial \"analysis\" of specific cherry-picked subjects that have little to do with actual communism. I really want to read some comments from people that support ACP (or even CPUSA). Having Hinkle tweeting \"americans voted against genocide, ww3 & economic misery\" is not exactly what actual communists have in their minds (or Sanders endorsing camala ofc). I really want  to read some kind of debate/comments by my fellow american communists.thank you. (an honest critique)",
