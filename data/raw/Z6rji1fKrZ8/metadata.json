This is clearly a desperate attempt to cash in on her failing regressive youtube channel. However, in this video I explain why I think Sargon has a decent shot at winning if he decides not to settle. Essentially Sargon's video legally speaking should be seen like John Oliver's and Now this segment, which is something that is a part of his overall show but can exist as a satire separate from the whole episode. The Oliver segment like Sargon's video is a series of edited clips meant to match the title. In my opinion Sargon can & will win this case if he opts to defend himself strengthening Fair use protections for all.\n\nSources:\nAkilah's terrible explanation video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd16eGCocRE&feature=youtu.be\n\nJohn Oliver Segment Referenced: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjpJqcM3X94&t=1s\n\n\n\nFAIR USE NOTICE\nThis video may contain copyrighted material; the use of which has not been specifically authorized by the copyright owner.
