    "text": "Olay, I don't know if you will see this but I'm from Baltimore and can give you what's going on here. \n\nMayor Scott has some progressive instincts. However, the biggest donors in Baltimore are real estate developers. These folks want a heavy police presence. Secondly, there are some older Black voters who want heavier police presence. These folks vote often. That Gen X and Boomer Black voting bloc are very very active here. While overall, most residents side eye the police, the actual consistent voting demos want more police. Our turnout is low but the demos that want the police actually show up at the polls. Brandon feels compelled to respond to that.\n\nThe other thing about Baltimore is that the relationship with the city and the rest of the state is super contentious. White folks in the suburbs literally say that they gave Black folks the city and we supposedly ruined it. However that's not it actually went down. And so there is pressure from the state for Baltimore to \"do something\". Especially because white folks are starting to come back into the city and these people want to feel safe, despite the fact that it's poor black folks who are overwhelming victims of crime here. \n\nHopefully that's helpful",

Depending on what parts of Reddit, YouTube or whatever your social media choices you frequent all election season. There has been this ongoing discourse within the left about whether we should support the Democrats or not or if supporting them makes you a liberal or complicit in genocide or this or that. Meanwhile, over MAGA regardless of their individual beliefs and how they might feel about each other in the day, they will 100% act in concert to get their overall goals. Accomplished is how they got roe v Wade taken out. I'm not saying that the left should give the Democratic party pass on all the s*** that they do and the ways that they fail. But I think if we're ever going to accomplish anything at some point, we are going to have to agree to a certain amount of falling in line.

Can you give us an example, again take all the time and space you need to illustrate what you mean - of what this looks like? Because to me if I hear that someone is trying to express something and that person keeps being called out in terms that were meant to bring awareness to a type of social inequality or power structure ... especially if that person _is_ a said member of traditionally more powerful group ... then baby. \n\nA little critical thinking has to be done to ensure you're not acting similarly to a white person who may not have done anything heinous in their life, but they're feeling attacked/judged/uncomfortable because people are calling out how twisted the status quo is for the first time. \n\nThose people who were shouting \"all lives matter!\" had genuine anxiety, worry and _anger_ because their racist thinking _felt_ to them that black people wanting equality of dignity for their lives = black people want supremacy the way we've practised supremacy. They couldn't even comprehend it as a shot for equality because they assumed in order to lift black people up, you had to crush other races - and more specifically the white race. That's how they understood it and that's why they went nuts.\n\nSo I am seriously asking you ... with all that considered ... when you say you are being gaslit by shouts of toxic masculinity and the patriarchy ... is there any merit to those criticisms when you take a sec to think about it? Is there any way the anguish you're feeling is similar to what some white people are going through?\n\nBecause it does not make sense that women fighting for equality automatically means men are put down. How _exactly_ does black women uplifting each other _emasculate_ ... i.e. strip you of your masculinity?",

In this case, I think the lack of a black women agenda is the perception of black women that Kamala Harris, by virtue of her identity, will advocate for black women once in office. Black men don’t have the same confidence. Remember, Joe Biden has to promise a black woman on the Supreme Court and an ended up picking a black woman as VP. I suspect that if Harris had a black man as VP, these complaints wouldn’t be as loud. I also suspect that if Harris wasn’t the choice after Biden exited, and it was Gavin Newsome, Black women would demand more in terms of an agenda/representation.\n\nFor the record, I think representation in the place of actual policy commitments is part of why we don’t get what we need from democrats.",

        "text": "@iamzojr1  That's the thing. You purposely haven't tried to explain anything in this entire thread, not even just to me but anyone in-thread. Not even when asked to clarify even once. \n\nPeople are trying to give you the benefit of the doubt and asking you to expand. You are in a social-justice/political-consciousness aware space, we're not representative of the general public. \n\nEveryone here has had to - at some point - articulate exactly what the f**k injustice they either personally faced or witnessed happening to someone else. As a black man you should goddamn know, considering the type of pain and frustration you've probably been through in your life, there's no faking or hiding oppression. Even when people try to sugar coat it or deny it because it doesn't suit them - it comes out regardless.\n\nI'm sorry but your response really is the icing on the cake for most people here: you either have nothing of merit to bring as a genuine argument or you know full well you're gonna be on the wrong side of sexism if you say it the way you wanna say it. \n\nAnd instead of maybe doing the work and looking at your own prejudices that's making you feel this aggrieved, you're persevering - like anyone who is moving through the world with any type of prejudice - with that aggrieved anger and maybe only letting it out in spaces where you know people will be like-minded. And doing this haughty \"y'all don't understand me!\" thing to ramp up the faux victimhood. \n\nFam lemme tell you: even when women were being denied even basic shit like legal access to their own money, systematic oppression in the workplace, systematic sexual harassment and rape culture in all spheres of life: we could always fucking articulate the wrong-ness that was done to us because it existed. We didn't shake our heads and say in a moody, mysterious way \"you won't get it so I wont even bother\" the way a moody teenager gets when they think they're being all misunderstood by their parents. Fuck no! That shit was excruciating for real! All of our grievances were uncomfortable for the world to hear because they were real and they exploded out of us. And most of all our grievances were not like, Hitleresque: \"well I'm burdened with this but it's because of this OTHER group of people and their inherent evil or fickleness that they stop me from succeeding.\" \n\nI think that's why you know it's futile to bring up what you really wanna say in this space specifically. \n\nTbh dude if I'm right, I can't stress enough how much you need to dig deep and work on those prejudices. You think you're fine now but if you let it fester you'll find that hate and disdain will show up in other ways that'll leave any political-consciousness you have feeling hollow. Mark Robinson is an ultra-extreme version of this, like so ultra it's not even funny. But there are millions of POC men that'll happily be involved in the oppression of women because it makes them feel a little better even while they're being oppressed under a more powerful structure. Honestly good luck.",

Investing in subsidizing trade education, and investing in reducing the cost of higher education can give them more career pathways.\n\nInvesting in improving public school funding can ensure that more people have access to better primary and secondary education.\n\nInvesting in reducing the cost and increasing availability of healthcare for everyone will help black men find mental health care. Investing in  reducing the cost of healthcare professional education and training will make it easier for black men to become health care professionals so they can provide better care to other black men.\n\nMost of this isn't even specific to black people or black men, policies that help working class people of all walks will definitely help black men.

We live in a society where blk women are denigrated to no end,where we all have family memebers who are extremely and openly homophobic and we wonder why they dont support a blk woman. Our need to navigate this world has dulled our ability to acuratley judge the hate we constantly see as  actual hate,we have been normalizing mosogyny and homophobia for so long to simply not be ostracized from the greater blk community, we have trouble acknowledging the simple truth.Ive been having all out discussions with the blk men in my family and freinds list to try and figure this out for months. Its just not a logical based choice which is why its no use using logic to dissuade them. Now with that being said most blk men that actually vote will vote for harris. The blk men who we are refering to are the loud minority, but they are a semi substantioal swath of the black community. In a side not its absolutely staggering how many of these anti Harris people have never voted and will mostly likely never vote, even in this election as they sabotage Harris.",

She was so disheartened (cause she was fighting well before she sat down on that bus, in the early 50s when folks just wanted them liberals to shut up and stop making waves) and was on the brink of quitting but she went to a retreat that reengaged her then the murder of Emit Till both galvanized her. I say all that to say that we always have to fight to even get folks to care. But we’re fighting huge machines with decades and centuries of mind f**kery. And I hope none of yall quite fighting (though mental health is a real thing so I get it) but it’s not a new phenomenon! Anyway I loved this episode of Olay and Fraaaaans ❤",

However if a non-Black candidate does it, \"they care\". The only exceptions seem to be when if a city is predominantly Black.\n\nLaughing about how MLK's I Have a Dream speech would be received during the age of socy media. That was hilarious. Honestly that would be a great video topic to show how social  media has hurt certain causes. Would the Civil Rights Movement have been able to have the same momentum and outcome with social media or the state of current society.\n\n46:20 - Great point about how social media created a rise of contrarians and those monetizing their pro-Blackness. In and of itself is not bad, but the book Elite Capture shows the essence of this.",

Black women being “progressive” by voting democrat is not the reason they have done better in the society, getting more education. Progressivism or conservatism is not the reason we are faced with injustice. The system is made to be of service to a certain type and vise versa. It’s not about our mindset. All black men can vote Democratic Party and it’s still going to be the same situation. But then nuance is a thing I guess. When nuance doesn’t serve us though, we must pick a side against the system.",

Stay vigilant that these institutions aren't cooped. ie no preachers. 3. Though we aren't a monolith we are bound by trauma and struggle so we need to agree on a platform and move on that. 4  We also need to stop confusing comfort with gains. We have been lulled to sleep by this false sense of inclusion. We aren't included where it counts and that's access to real power. 5.

Mad respect.\n\nI think the one thing that I feel isn’t brought up enough (This is not targeting anybody on the panel) Is the casual racism of how the Obama thing worked, and that Obama played into it, as he always does. If Obama decides to speak to “men“ in general and tell them to stop being sexist/misogynist assholes then that would’ve gotten the message across. The fact that he went out of his way to target black men under the pretense that they are more misogynistic than anybody else is the obnoxious part.  Now to be clear, I’ve met many subpar black men who are definitely sexist, bigoted and generally awful people… But as 12 to 14% of the population, we are not the SOURCE of the issue. It also speaks volumes that the Dems ignore the entire Manosphere and pretend that misogyny more of a black thing than a white thing.  Either blame men or don't, Liberals and the DNC need to stop pretend like black men are the source and look in the mirror. \n\nNow to the point… A lot of the subpar Blackman who jump up and grab the mic (Myron Gaines or Tate types and their wannabes) are desperate for attention and extremely vocal. It’s kind of like the standard Trump supporter… It’s not that they’re that many of them, it’s that they come out and grab the mic anytime they get a chance.  I think they are overrepresented in terms of how they react and respond to this type of thing… I’m willing to bet that if a white guy came out and said the exact same thing Obama said then the comments would skew more towards worthwhile black men who would take offense as opposed to the sellouts… IMO…",

Some of us were raised in households with only women, raised by our mothers, grandmothers and aunts. We watched them go to college while raising us alone, we're more than aware at how capable black women are. To say that black men are somehow more misogynistic than white men, or even white WOMEN, is straight up false. They did the same thing when Stacey Abrams ran. It seems like we're the one demographic it's acceptable to blame for a loss. If the democrats lose (which I doubt they will after the recent Puerto Rico/ protecting women against their will fiascos Trump has had) , it'll be because they ran a bad campaign and refused to stop funding an ongoing genocide. Black men didn't cost them the election, their actions did. It's just racism on their part to blame us really.",

A lot of what you see can be considered parallel attempts to present woman as masculine  black woman or emasculate fellow black men who don’t meet a certain criteria is exactly what slaves did, to maintain order and power. You can definitely see parallels, for many conquering was the first interaction with power. I think these themes could help you see more about black patriarchy.

The “facts only people” aren’t moving mountains either in terms of education and community doesn’t run off of only facts. I think we are (no pun intended) brought up with very black and white thinking. Which leads to blindingly picking sides and not knowing when nuance is needed. \n\nSometimes I argue that feelings create facts about the world. There’s a reason you do what you do, the results are a fact or even the conclusion about something can be a fact. Hence “the fact of the matter is” It’s such a difficult balance to try to workout within a person. \n\nI feel like time and time again no matter what method of feelings or facts are used in our community there’s so much effort to “conquer” something rather than co exist in a way that works for us. Being right doesn’t seems to be a goal worth reaching like perfection I view it as a myth. Or so subjective does it matter, when there are more tangible issues/solutions?
