He uses a screenshot from the Japanese movie Harakiri(1962) which attempts to de-romanticise and even demonise the martial law and 'honour' of imperialist Japan, presenting it as simply a way for the powerful to exert their control over the less-powerful. However, in the thumbnail, it uses that as a sort of idealised history, which was the opposite of what the movie was trying to achieve. But absolutely watch Harakiri, one of the best movies ever with a pressure-cooker atmosphere which just builds amazingly well throughout the movie",

Without the follow through, the full working out of the good idea to its proper fruition, you remain stuck with half an idea, AKA a castrated myth, AKA failure to practise what is preached AKA the Devil citing scripture for his own purpose AKA the pot calling the kettle black AKA ideology AKA playing the man and not the ball AKA having nothing nice to say that’s better left unsaid, AKA argument ad hominem AKA haters running they mouth like some bxxxxs up in this sxxx. Point about all the AKA iterations is to make the point that ....You should have HEARD this already. There should be some faint echo of memory of the manners you were brought up with.

So when you are busy telling anybody listening ( and please remember that CHILDREN are listening too) that half of the world is populated by ogres, monsters, chauvinists, untermensch deplorables, when you are telling the story of systemic racism in the fundamentally and hopelessly evil systemically systemic unconscious intangible aetheric spooky nightmare realm of Society......agh.

You are hungry for the most uncharitable interpretation possible of anything that anybody might have to say. Anybody who disagrees with you is a servant of a long dead Austrian syphilitic madman. Christianity and the a West and freedom and progress and the achievements thereof are nothing but things to be ashamed of and feel bad about. You think this is healthy and worthwhile? You think this is helping? You think people should Vote to affirm this view of the world? You think people should LIVE like this? Where is your content? Where is ONE positive idea in all of this?

If they were given that, maybe they'd realize their dead end underpaid overworked job that serves no real purpose isn't because immigrants take all the good jobs, it's because the \"good jobs\" are outsourced to sweatshops to obtain higher profits from cheaper labor with fewer restrictions, and that corners are cut for the non outsourced jobs because the ruling class wanna make a billion bucks more than last year. Maybe they'd see that social isolation isn't a result of the rising \"decadence\" of the west, but that it was generally always there as a result of the economic relations between workers and their workplaces, as well as with the political system which more often than not exacerbates that alienation. Who knows, if people were better informed maybe they'd realize that the causes of all their problems aren't the people across the way who work in sweatshops, or the gays, or the trans people, or even the opposite gender, but maybe the system itself that they're forced to serve every day... \n\nOr at the very least they'd take a more moderate Social Democratic stance on it.. But thanks to the Red Scare, Capitalist Realism, and the harsh suppression of anything even vaguely resembling Socialism, let alone Social Democracy on even the most arbitrary of surface levels, the poor doomers feel like the only other way is to go further and further right. I certainly don't expect everybody to join me in the cult of Marx/Bakunin, or even to support the Nordic Model as an alternative. That's something people gotta determine for themselves with their own brains and research, but the analyses of Capitalism by it's critics should be looked at and addressed by everyone. ESPECIALLY if you're a far right nutter, after all, you gotta understand your enemy right? \n\n\nBut lets be real, understanding isn't what they want. Fascism is just a package for their extreme social conservatism and often racial regressive ideals and authority fetishes.. And the more people the far right intellectuals can snare, the better. So everyone, focus on deradicalizing the baseline supporters of far right policy, only debate the far right intellectuals when there's an opportunity to put them on blast in front of their supporters, any attempt to directly try to persuade or appeal to the far right intellectuals directly is pretty much a waste of time. Most of them know what they sell is bullshit, and they know *exactly* what they're doing with it. And in regards to engaging the far right personalities in debate, being right isn't enough most times. You have to *humiliate* these people in order to sway their supporters.",

        "text": "@Sergeant Pickles\n\nYou're not wrong, a lotta white nationalists/white supremacists and other far right types usually associated with them don't have very good lives and often have had trouble developing and melding in with society growing up. My own parents didn't do a good job teaching me how to properly care for myself and I had ADHD that messed up my ability to process lessons correctly growing up. I grew up in a Republican family so naturally leaned right. When I encountered actual fascists initially I was careful but within a few years I was into their ideology and explored everything from fascism to monarchism, all sorts of autocratic governments. There was lots of racism, sexism, talk of civil war and martyrdom, embracing emotion. \n\nThen the days came I really started questioning myself and over time I grew away from those people till it finally happened. I didn't wanna be this sort of person because as I thought more about it I just didn't see any other solution than a bleak outlook on life and death. It's trying to apply the rules of the natural world to man. The strongest only fit to survive. Fascism feeds off that sorta world because they wanna force you to sacrifice your empathy and basic humanity for the sake of making their group the strongest so you can do away with all the others they don't want in the world. You're just a pawn for that ultimate goal and what ultimately happens to you is of little concern to the greater tribe. \n\nI came to the conclusion that yes, there are wingnuts and foolishness in the left just as there are in the right, but ultimately the left is right. We have a responsibility to those more worse off than us and shouldn't desire the destruction of other people just because differences in opinion, sex, color, etc. We're human beings, and those of us that succeed in life should find our fulfillment out of helping our fellow man. We don't have to live by the laws of nature, we have a choice in how we conduct ourselves. You have a choice to be compassionate, you have a choice to be understanding. Even if your job isn't great and family a trainwreck you can still be someone's personality to look up to when they wake up today. The nationalists and autocrats want you to cast aside that choice and embrace bigotry and overall make life more miserable collectively for us all and for what? Because they're bitter about their status in life? Because they weren't successful? Who are they to judge what success is? You can be the poorest man in the world yet have your soul, and I choose to have my soul rather than embrace their ideology because in the end I'd rather be poor then have to live with myself burning with hatred for other people.\n\nUltimately I think the left's big issue today is falling into a pit trap alienating whites seeing them as hopelessly attracted to nationalism and bigotry. Given the left in the USA has a preference for talking minority rights and issues over whites and their troubles, I believe that plays a role in why many young whites go fascist/bigot. They see themselves as left behind by everyone outside their group. The only way the left can counter that is to simply embrace it's core principles. Compassion and charity. Treat everyone who needs help as they need it regardless of where they are in life and turn the other cheek when they act foolishly. That's even a Christian principle at it's core with turning the other cheek and showing compassion, but many American Christians have lost sight of that becoming embroiled in right wing populism and American nationalism. I grew distant from religion because of those things but I still see the application of being Christlike and what the left can achieve with it. We are not here to live according to the natural world, we can live outside of it's rules and make our own as mankind. Those rules ought to be bent and broken for the sake of our fellow man. Of course we need to stand against the radicals when they try pushing their hate, but ultimately they will only get far if we fuel their fire. This is the great society that in the end we all ought to strive for and it starts in each of us individually.",

        "text": "As an older time-traveler from the ‘70s, I can tell you: reaching out to and educating these people, and offering them some hope — expanding their minds and imaginations, helping them correctly identify who’s exploiting them, assisting them in envisioning a better civilization — is much harder than reviling them, but ultimately the only path forward. Those people aren’t enemies, but potential allies who simply haven’t been enlightened yet.\n\nYes, among them there are professional recruiters — who’ll resist you no matter what, and who’ll make sure their recruits, at least in public, all toe the line and revile you too. But you must be stoic and stalwart and polite in persisting, because in private some of those recruits will begin to see cracks in their recruiters’ ideology, and many will have been ambivalent all along, and some WILL reach out to you… and a few will even join you!\n\n(And here’s where you must be extra-vigilant, because the newest recruits, especially refugees from absolutism, may have a tendency to continue being absolutist, only now in their new direction — to become “tankies,” in other words — demanding purity and obeisance… ugh. You _really_ must spend time educating them on the values of comity and diversity and tolerance, and on the fact that everyone‘s path to enlightenment is different.)\n\nNever endanger yourself! If you’re face-to-face and sense the people you’re persuading could turn violent, then run… and live to teach another day! Unless you’re a public figure, there’s likely nothing to be gained from your martyrdom. But online, where you’re anonymous and can remain so? Maybe resist the temptation to “own” people, and try badgering them with facts and reason and unfailing kindness instead. It really works.\n\nThat’s the path forward. Those people have been alienated by capitalism, so it’ll take time and effort and there’ll be disappointing failures along the way. But many of them _are_ reachable… with kindness and love and a lot of patience. And if they absorb your ideas AND your kind affect and nurturing teaching style, then in turn employ your methods themselves to reach others… the results of your efforts should be exponential! ❤️",

I don't even like communism and I know that, like, I get that you're on the older end of the spectrum and probably grew up in the good ol' days of the red scare but y'know. I'd still expect ya to know the difference between communism, a political system that to this day remains purely theoretical due to no country actually practicing it, and socialism, a political system that most of the civilized world runs on. I hate arguing with people on the internet because it's literally fuckin' pointless but calling socialist countries communist is peak boomer and guarenteed to rile me the fuck up.\n\nSocialism didn't kill soviet citizens in ww2, Joseph Motherfuckin' Stalin did. Ya ever notice that after he died there weren't any other huge political purges or famines in the ussr? That's because everyone that took charge after him was significantly less insane and were just competent enough to run their shitty government without committing genocide. And considering how hard the cards were stacked against the ussr following the red scare in the 50s I'd say they had a pretty good run. They were able to sustain themselves right up until what, 1992? And that was with the rest of the world trying to starve them into submission with trade restrictions. If the soviet union didn't waste so much of its economy trying to keep up in an arms race with the us it probably could have lasted even longer. Not that I'm saying that'd be a good thing because the soviet union was still an authoritarian shithole where something as basic to us as a car would require state permission to own and even then you're put on a longass waiting list but still. The soviet union didn't collapse in on itself like people think it did, it was strangled into submission by fuckin' international trade bullshit and mismanagement of resources, socialism had little to do with it.\n\nAs for Venezuela, same shit. The US doesn't like them for arbitrary bullshit and have made it impossible for them to trade internationally. Pair that with virtually nonexistent domestic agriculture and ya got some motherfuckin' famine up in their shit.\n\nWait, hold up can someone more aware of the venezuela sitch fill me in on why the us put trade restrictions on them? I'm pretty sure it was retaliation for them trying to nationalize their oil profits or some shit like that, unless I'm confusing them for another country which the us fucked up for that exact reason.\n\nRegardless, All of these failed \"communist\" states you're using to flex your supreme boomer intelligence failed because of us intervention... And... Y'know... Weren't even communist. Fuck not even north korea's communist. It's a fuckin' monarchy. And china? State capitalism\n\nHoly shit look what ya made me do ya done made me do a whole fuckin' wall of text. If ya get through this whole thing make sure to add \"wurm hella gay\" to your reply so I know ya didn't just tl;dr me",

PdVSA, the state-run oil company, 45 years ago, and after Hugo Chávez took power there was a sort of \"re-nationalization\" of the oil industry in the early to mid 2000s, when the company came under more direct government control, private oil company assets were expropriated, and the profits were used to fund social programs.   Partial sanctions affecting PdVSA (which limited Americans from trading Venezuelan bonds and securities) did not come until 2017, and broader sanctions against PdVSA weren't issued until 2019.  \n\nWhile there is plenty to criticize about sanctions, embargoes and the like, by 2017, the crises in Venezuela — shortages of food and medicine, hyperinflation, declining oil production — were already in full swing.

But also, this called to my mind Innuendo Studios’ live presentation on how the alt-right is like an abusive relationship—in order to get people on board, he said in that presentation that he actively chose to compare the alt-right to an abusive relationship rather than a cult in his title, and I can see why they did that, but it seems like it really is very similar to a doomsday cult. Shaun asked once “why is everything so cataclysmic with these alt-right guys?” And I think the answer is “same reason everything is so cataclysmic with those doomsday cults: that’s how they get you in. They sell you on the fact that everything is the problem, and THEY are the only ones who have the solution, and bam—another day, another cultist.”",

The country could be very far Left for a few centuries if Leftist monarchs take power in ensuing battle but could also jump to the Right if a Reactionary wins.

I was naive and surrounded by other 14 year olds who took the other extreme route and constantly talked about all things gender and how bad men were. I guess being irritated by their extreme views and finding that black pill stuff online was not a good combo. Luckily I got out of that very weird mindset.",

But blaming oil and coal barons means attacking the class system and also going after a big and powerful opponent.

I am from Eastern Europe and my grandfather was real antifascist fighting against real nazist and fascist troops during the WW2, and he was also true beliver in communist ideology, but when our country become under communist regime he nearly go to jail because he dissagree with them and lost allmost everything, he died like anticommunist in communist country. Can we speak with facts pls. What is the difference between the far rigt shooter who kills few people and got killed in the end, and the leftist mob going after peoples livehood and destroys their lives. Both are toxic and not helping to fix the issues we have in the society now. Not everything is sexist,racist or fobic and not everything on the left is marxist or worst then Stalin.

Independence is freedom from being governed or ruled by another country. How can a nation be sovereign if it takes laws/orders from a foreign government. The whole brexit debacle exposed this for nearly 4 years. \n\n\nPrivilege is an advantage that only one person or group of people has, usually because of their position or because they are rich. Notice how there's no mention of race/ethnicity.

I don't live in the USA, I live in the UK so I don't get where you got this idea I'm american from. I merely highlighted a flaw with your narrative that the left care for equality while pushing for policies that are discriminatory by definition. \n\n\nIt's not a case of being entitled and I don't know where you got that from. Except in a \"proper democracy\" it's tyranny against the minority view by the public. The word democracy comes from demos, a citizen of a city/village and cratos, the divine personification of strength. You're mistaking voting rights with democracy as they're very different things which is a common mistake with people when it comes to politics. I'm not talking bullshit when I say no nation is actually a democracy. \n\n\nI'm not making a strawman when it's a known fact the vast majority of tyranny in history can be directly associated with religion. \n\n\nAgain there's the social and economic aspect to left/right wing politics but there is also the authoritarian vs libertarian aspect to politics which most people have forgotten. So what kind of government does a \"left wing society\" have in your mind exactly good sir?? From where I'm standing many european nations with monarchies are rather left wing overall in regards to the likes of the UK, Netherlands etc.",

Ignorance can spread like a deseas. \n\nThe left-wing is as it is but not all left-wings are acting ethically appropriate. Then there is the problem that you can act unethical with good intentions just as you can have left-wing intentions but screw up combating inequality. Communism itself may sound nice in concept but it usually fails. In politics, being an idealist is not enough and you always have to have a grip on reality. \n\nIt seems like you are making an etymological fallacy. It is irrelevant where the word comes from.

Anyway, being right-wing in the name of religion is still right-wing. \n\nThe European monarchies of today are not true monarchies. The political power comes from the people and the parliaments.

The english's concept of equality and the continent's concept of equality are two very different things. The english regard equality as in equality under the law whereas the continent regard equality as in absolute equity. The english doesn't advocate equality in regards to economic status compared to the continent hence why they brought about and pushed the ideology of marxism whereas the english for the most part did not.  \n\n\nThose definitions are not always the same globally as I explained with england/UK vs the continent of europe. The reason communism doesn't work is because it ignores human psychology and individual agency. It only works if everyone was a robot or a \"white good\".\n\n\nThe problem is when a word has lost it's original meaning, you ultimately undermine what it stands for hence why the current idea/definition of democracy is so inaccurate to the original definition. \n\n\nI'm saying the vast majority of brutal tyranny was due to religion. You can call it right wing if you wish but just remember, plenty of that brutal tyranny came with invasions where the nation's language/religions were replaced with the conquerer's religion/language which can be seen in a similar light to how communism undermined nation's traditions and religion. \n\n\nThey're still monarchies as in they're not voted for, have special privileges etc. Sure they may not be the ones running the nation but in the UK's case, the queen can take back control any time she likes but she chooses not to. The nations are still not democratic technically speaking considering they are ultimately minority ruling. Oppression can come in many forms and it's ultimately about control and power. The problem is we seem to have people who are claiming to be oppressed when really they're pampered overly entitled \"children\" who've never faced a hard day in their life.",

They had enemies on all side fighting them because of their ideology, and never really instituted much \"communist\" policy. Frankly its questionable how much the CCP leaders believed in it considering their later actions. Combined with party politics in the CCP, they went the pragmatic route which was to go to a more capitalist route and join the world economy to build themselves up lest the country split again like it historically had. Plus, it ain't exactly very free. They monitor everything you do and if you speak against the party your in jail. They censor everything. It's not a very free society. It's a perfect example of how being capitalist, doesn't mean being \"free\".",

Like again, I'll reiterate, I ain't a socialist or communist, but Christian socialism is very much a thing. Dr. Cornel West is a Christian Socialist in fact. He describes himself as a non-marxist socialist, as one need not be a marxist to be a socialist, and he believes marxism and christianity are irreconcilable. His idea of christianity is at the core of his socialist ideology, Democratic Socialism. The idea behind the further left ideologies is that the average person doesn't have much power as an individual, but together as a group, large change for the better can be done. And that all humans deserve certain rights. It also doesn't help that Communism itself in comparison to capitalism is pretty amorphous due to the fact that people have many different ideas on the system, and that no set rules were ever defined for it. Mao, and Stalin persecuted Christians because they were horrible authoritarians who didn't want a potential subversive element like christianity fucking things up for them. *Not* because they were communists. And hating individualism is...a subject I'm not sure what to respond to aside from saying that while too much collectivism is bad, I think, at the risk of sounding like a centrist which as someone who is left wing makes me wanna throw up in my mouth, going too far in the other direction is foolhardy, and I think that's what America has done.\n\nIf however you're talking about the Chinese citizens being free-ER in comparison then yes, in some ways they are, in others it's the same as it was years ago for them in the 1950s. \n\nAnd in many ways you're just as free to die with no rhyme or reason because an authority decided you weren't deserving of a surgery, or starvation here under America's current form of capitalism as you would under communist China and Russia in the 50s and 60s",

Nobody moves to communist states because capitalists do everything they can to violently crush or destabilize any competing ideology: ironic for an ideology that prides itself on fair competition.

Young people are more prone to feeling alienation, so many changes are happening in their formitive years and that can often lead to depression and men generally aren't as open and talkative about these things as women unfortunately, there is still a stigma-often self imposed I believe-about talking about their feelings and so bigoted content creators harness that alienation, channel it into anger and direct it at the things they hate like minorities, left leaning politics, people not like them basically. And the more they can harness that anger the more they capture their audience and so it guarantees them an income since emotion holds attention more than a reasoned discussion.\nAnyway I'm really pleased you found a way out of it and that your managing your depression in a healthier way. I know how depression feels, unfortunately I turned to heroin instead when I was 15 (im nearly 37 now) so while my outlook on other people hasn't been effected my health certainly was lol just over 10yrs clean now mind you so it's all good in the end.

He was a very smart, very optimistic and nice young man in his early twenties, he had worked for two years, paying taxes and contributing to the economy, he learned both the local languages and made friends.\n\nThere are muslims living in my current town, they work, run business, pay taxes and I have yet to see any of them even behave rudely. I do however have close friends that have been raped and/or drugged, friends who have been sexually harassed and stalked, friends that have been stabbed and friends that have been beaten up. I have personally been threatened with violence for dressing a certain way and for going to \"gay artschool\" and for speaking the \"wrong language\". ALL this violence has come from natives, not from the reportedly 'oh so' savage and dangerous muslims. Yet, I don't hate white men, even though they have caused literally a 100% of the violence in my life. I also don't think white men are somehow incompatible with a civilized society. \n\nThen we have the economic arguments for why immigration is good and all the statistical data that makes this xenophobic fear mongering look so silly.\nAre there issues regarding immigration that cannot be ignored? Yes, absolutely without a doubt.\nBut since \"closing the borders\" is not a functioning solution to mass immigration and emigration, we need to find other ones. And that's why I'm not very interested in having the same argument with you I've already had with so many others, its only going to waste my time AND its off topic to boot, so.",

Eastern Europe is like Dixie on steroids, even more so for the Middle east. Latin America has abortion laws more restrictive  than the most evangelical Americans (most of the world does in fact). Africa is mostly centrist with no real identifiably left or right wing planks in most nations parties (with the notable exceptions of parties in Southern Africa, Nigeria, Ethiopia and maybe Rwanda.

Western Europe is literally the only collective region where we're far right in comparison. \n\nSorry if my words were harsh but I really get tired of addressing this specific point.\n\n\n\nAnd I didn't say there were no rights wing states with poverty, I said there weren't any right wing states as bad as California.

There's a myriad of reasons for causal depression, in some cases, observing the current influence of alt-right politics and the ease with which some individuals buy into the ideology can be a real downer. And then there's the idea of strictly endogenous depression (which coincidentally plays well with producers of anti-depressant pharmaceuticals)... Certainly, extremists will often try to take advantage of people who are lost in life, and/or  so desperate to belong that they'll even embrace hateful paranoia, but not all of us are THAT desperate.

The States even had book burnings, those of the work of WIlhelm Reich, for example, as well as attempts by conservative Christian groups to ban various titles. Note also the antebellum refusal of the US Postmaster General to carry abolitionist materials. Or the journalism ban during the invasion of Grenada in the 80's, the press restrictions during the Gulf War, the invasion of Iraq, or George W. Bush's censorship of climate studies. Pity that your excellent reply was lost by youtube and this one is all that was left behind, but the argument that only the left practices censorship is demonstrably false. \nPer Japanese racism, how happy were the Ainu people, when discriminated against by the Wa-jin? How happy were the 'comfort women' abducted from abroad and abused? A burglar may be happy to loot your home, a murderer happy to end their victim, but this happiness alone does not qualify their acts as good.",

They think \"their\" country is better and identify their ancestors as the heroes and statesmen of whatever great civilization they arbitrarily trace themselves back to (probably Rome) rather than the very ordinary people from a variety of cultures that their ancestors actually were.  This idea that they are descended from their idealized version of this civilization is vital to their identity, and so if reality doesn't match up to what they perceive to be \"ideal,\" it must be due to foreign/ _female_ influence and moral decay.",

I.E. returning to Obama era politics with Biden, returning to a better time. That time being subjectively better based on the ideological preference of an individual. Conservatism is an ideology that tends to be... conservative, as in conserving what you already have. Yes it will slow down progress but it also helps maintain what you have gained. I.E. freedoms of speech. Conservatives want to conserve freedom of speech in America. Because civil liberties are built on the ability to express your self freely in a society. Yet progressives in an attempt to progress beyond the current status quo attack freedom of speech. In a truly tolerant society conservatives and progressives would balance each other. Conservatives act as a counter to rapid progress. And progressives counter stagnate conservative ideology. The impasse we see in society is not a failure of conservative or progressive ideology but an acceptance of authoritarianism by the left to shift society into a state of rapid \"progress\". Which is why conservatism is often misrepresented, in order to demonize those who have differing views of the world.",

        "text": "Samuel Francis argued that the problems of managerial state extend to issues of crime and justice. In 1992, he introduced the word “anarcho-tyranny” into the paleocon vocabulary.[16] Francis argued that this situation extends across the U.S. and Europe but especially the UK . While the government functions normally, violent crime remains a constant, creating a climate of fear (anarchy) the UK has a history of this and to this day. He says that “laws that are supposed to protect ordinary citizens against ordinary criminals” routinely go unenforced, even though the state is “perfectly capable” of doing so. While this problem rages on, government elites concentrate their interests on law-abiding citizens. In fact, Middle America winds up on the receiving end of both anarchy and tyranny.",

Realistically the biggest defining feature is nationalism to rally support of totalitarian ideology. Stalin used \"communism\" to gain support however was totalitarian. He used the \"cult of personality\" and other propaganda to be incredibly nationalist. Kim Jong-un is very similar in this way. I get that some definitions would say fascists attack communism however neither Stalin or Kim-Jong Un are particularly left wing and that is more important. Well at least that's my take. Fascism is such a broad term that it's hard to say if certain leaders are \"fascist\"",

I do very well understand where he comes from as in HE comes from. If I had to guess, middle class upbringing not in but close to a metro area in germany - probably west germany. Went abroad a year after maybe to AUS or NZ. Goes or now went to Uni in one of these metro areas studying social Sciences.\n\nYou can tell from the topics presented, the logo used as well as the terminology that <<< knows his 20th century history as well being staunchley pro left/antifa. Tbf, one in a million and <<< is in my view on the more moderate side of things. But like his comrades, a few sore points stick out. \nIncluding calling every one he doesnt like far right, dumb or mentally ill. Exactly this arrogant behavior drives ppl into the arms of the far right, why should white (yes, western countries are primarily white as african ones are primarily black, suprise suprise) workers vote for a party which nominally represented their interests for 100 years and now shits on them left and right?\n\nAnd I wont even touch on hypocrisy exemplified by our jet set climate saving elites, corporations trying to virtue signal away the actual harm they create and the unwilligness to see the loonies on one's side as the ones on the other. Their calling for safe spaces, but how dare you want a safe space from their incessant drivel.\nAn example: no one gave a shit about womens roles in blockbuster movies. And dont tell me there were none. In contrary, female actors and directors tried to make a good movie for everyone instead of pandering to their partisan group. Please compare most movies with female leads from before 2010 to those after. People are sick of lectures on feminism during movies, especially if done so blandly. None of these ppl want to ban women to the kitchen, as i privately noticed a while ago equality wasnt only for the girls it also freed us men. Touching on that would be too much now.",

I might have missed it but I didn't notice in this video that Three Arrows claimed he was a holocaust denier; maybe, I didn't notice it, but I found that part to be very strange. Why dispel something that you haven't been accused of? For example,  if I went into work and said for no apparent reason \"I don't have sex with animals\" my colleagues would wonder why I said it. Likewise, with the racism, why did he mention having a singular black friend? It seemed a very strange thing to add unless it was a case of \"the lady doth protest  too much\"\n You may not believe in white privilege now which is of course your right, but are you saying it never existed in the past?  That in many countries  still the colour of your skin does not grant you things that others may be denied? First, I would say go to countries like Bolivia where the lightness of your skin most definitely is a benefit. The same in many countries in Asia although you can argue one reason for it in Asia is that people there assume westerners have an abundance of money, it is  something that many, predominantly old, white  Male people actually freely say is a major reason that they have relocated to those countries.

Again if he had highlighted videos that aren't all doom and paranoia instead of doom and gloom videos on disease and feminism,  you'd have a point,  but he didn't.  Or even if he had shown some of the endings where he supposedly lets in some sunlight (not having watched his videos, I can't attest to whether he does or not)\nMaybe, next time BPS decides to make a response to a response video,  he should ask you for some help 😉",

Don't get me wrong, I understand the points they're trying to get across in these dark times. You're very right that BPS does always end on that positive note of hope.\n\nNevertheless, I can still detect a strong hint of manipulation in his videos. The music he chooses, the narrative he pushes, the insults he gives out. It all paints a picture over time and I've been listening to his content for 2-3 years. He even chooses his tone of voice very methodically and it all points to someone very adept with human psychology using methodology seen in even late night infomercials. Beyond the narrative itself, I don't like how he tries to guide my emotions whilst delivering those views.\n\nThe silver lining feels like a call to action. I'll wager money this guy has The Art of War memorized. But that approach is purely speculation and gut instinct on my end, so take it with a grain of salt. I never trust anyone who appears to be too good at influencing.\n\nEver watch a video by the youtuber \"chills\" and notice his annoying cadence? He's not doing the best job with it, but he's using his upward inflections at the end of his sentences to build suspense (but it's just uncanny and jarring with him). I've seen a couple MGTOW youtubers do the same thing more effectively. BPS is reinforcing totality in every aspect of his video and the stimuli present therein. It's the biggest part of why I call him a sensationalist doomsayer for profit who lies by omission as well. The arguments he presented are complex and multifaceted to the enth degree but he is only capable of providing his one facet, his limited side. This would be fine if he displayed his views as opinions based on real world data, but with the nature of his presentation, it's all presented as alarming fact and the silver lining can also serve as a non overt call to action. But like I said, that's my limited view of it.",

It's because those who yearn for the crown tend to be corrupt assholes, and outnumber those who want to take the reigns to help people.\n\nThe more diffuse the power is over a given community, the less chances for abuse there is.

That's when I can't say the N-word.\n\nAlso, I don't think that's very abstract.\n\nI live in the only first world country where medical care is run like a business, and rich people go to Canada for health care while buying our political system to ensure it stays that way. That's a pretty well-defined example.\n\n\n\nLaws are changed to be made more lenient, not in a way that actually helps mitigate the harm it does to people, but in a way that clearly is designed to allow the rich to get away with it while the poor hold the bag.\n\n\n\nFines are definitely designed to allow rich and poor people to play by separate rules. A billionaire doesn't care about a 300 dollar speeding ticket, my girlfriend and I on our way to the hospital 2 months ago do. Sure, we will both most likely end up paying the fine(though it's less likely in the case of the rich), but we don't both face consequences.\n\nLike Epstein and a lot of the rich and powerful got away with raping teenagers on his private jet for so long, but a massive percentage of people of color can't get away with smoking what is now a legalized substance, with many still in prison for what has become legal.\n\nThis is literally just the most modern examples of the state being inherently shit.

        "text": "​ Chalk O'holic  1) To make things clear I am an anarcho-communist. I don't want there to be a state beyond community driven communes where society rather than benefiting the greedy,  at the expense of the poor, instead is designed on working together. \n\nIt isn't achievable in my lifetime but is my goal. I don't want to ignore the injustice of the state, or to counteract one injustice with another. I seek justice.\r\n\n2) Speeding tickets and the like were examples. Not the key issue.\n\n3) My main points overall were that unequal enforcement of laws isn't \"anarcho-tyranny\" it's the state acting as intended.\n\n (I'm not sure why you think the term has to do with saying the n word) The phrase we're mocking was coined by BPS, who is a white nationalist. He was talking about Brittain which does have Hate Speech laws.\n\n(. But if that weren't the case, and one group uses a banned term and isn't punished, because it is a politically favored group,) Okay, but here is the key issue. When a member of a group uses a banned term in most of these cases in the modern world, it's a term under hate speech laws. They can be used biographically, in quoting of another person, and typically aren't pursued by law if a member of the groups targeted by that word use them. So I can't think of a case of this sort of thing in Brittain.",

        "text": "​Chalk O'holic Again I'm not saying it's illegitimate to analyze things. I'm talking in response to -this video- about Black Pidgeon Speaks, and him saying any country that doesn't allow you to be racist is a tyranny.\n\nLike again. I'm an anarcho-communist, I say this not to draw some line in the sand, I say this because it defines my positions on these things. Yes, issues of state tyranny and corruption are important issues and should be weeded out, justice should be sought.\n\nBut in response to Britain being an anarcho-tyranny state, it isn't such in any way that isn't any worse than any other country or at least this has not been demonstrated.\n\nIt isn't a failed state, people aren't being burned at the stake, the level of corruption is casual at best. It's fucked up, yeah, but BPS isn't the person or the framing to talk about it.\n\nLastly, yes, the state doing something condradictory to its laws is the norm and inherent to the state. For example, the most basic example. If a group of bakers, masoners, and construction workers burn a man at the stake for murder, they are commiting a crime (I agree it's a crime against humanity especially without fair trial) but if a police kills him there is first a series of investigations to see if it is a crime or not because the state has the inherent contradiction and monopoly on violence.\n\nYou can debate on if that contradiction is valid or invalid, but the contradiction exists.",
