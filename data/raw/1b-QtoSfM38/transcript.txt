hey what's up so i love making response videos they are fun to make they generally do well and they are a great vehicle to get a larger point across you know someone clicks to see stephen crotter get dunked on and hopefully leaves with a better understanding of a certain topic last year when my channel was much smaller i took a look at a video of a youtuber called black pigeon speaks the video on the surface seemed to be about the decay of the west but that was largely just a front to whitewash holocaust denial and push some other garbage ideas what sets this response video apart from my other ones is that i had to go to much greater lengths to figure out what black pigeon speaks is even trying to say when steven crowder says the big reason for the first crusade was the fall of constantinople it's rather easy for me to point out that this happened hundreds of years after the first crusade there you go debunked but with a statement like the west is dying because it hates itself and no further clarification given it's not that easy what is the west in this instance how is it dying and how would you even quantify a collection of nation-states hating themselves it's a very bizarre thing to say as far as political commentary goes but when you get familiar with more of his content it becomes apparent that this sort of bleak narrative about inevitable collapse is almost all he talks about so much so that a big part of his content is virtually the same here's an example of black pigeon speaks his work regarding the uk number one britain abolishes itself with the thumbnail reading uk ssr which doesn't even make sense as an abbreviation really number two uk brave new fahrenheit 1984 okay number three uk rise of the police state number four uk the police state via snoopers has arrived then another video about how the police state has arrived but then i guess it went away for a moment since after that the uk is supposedly descending into a police state again and then the uploader ends on a twist with uk rise of the anarcho-tyranny state if you're in the uk maybe write a comment below at which state the uk currently is right now because i've completely lost track anyway all these videos are basically identical at their core they might reference or rather misinterpret different news stories but the takeaway never changes namely the uk is either about to collapse or become an authoritarian regime or something along those lines now you might say isn't that a bit cherry-picked of me to just pick five out of a bunch of videos so just we're on the same page here's another example about the country of canada in no particular order canada the dumpster fire globalist experiment votes canada 2019 world's first meme country canada the post-western non-binary nation canada the post-national meme with no future post-national country has no core identity canada abolishes itself canada a nation crashing with no survivors canada has just joined the top 10 strongest economies in the world again by the way halal canada diversity and the end of free speech if virtual signaling was a country it'd be canada a warning for america and number 10 canada the next failed state there are many many more examples of this on the channel and sometimes he goes as far as to just re-record a video he made in the past but switched things around a bit here's a section of the video california america's first third world state and dystopia california window to america's future side by side if california was an independent nation it would be the 17th most unequal country in the world tucked just between honduras and guarana yes those countries that send comparison caravans to social borders now on a regular basis for example and norway is the one hundred and california also ranked countries and amazing before we go further into that i don't really feel the need to point out that black pigeon speaks is actually way more extreme in his political views than he can openly admit on a public platform my seven others already made videos laying that out but i'm just gonna throw one in for good measure maybe you just caught that one of the thumbnails read the sentence day of the rake which is a 4chan meme about the annexation or destruction of canada it's also a reference to the fiction book the toner diaries in which at one point everyone in the us who is deemed a race traitor gets publicly hanged in an event called day of the rope the book is basically the bible of american white supremacists and is said to have inspired numerous terror attacks like the oklahoma city bombing or the 1999 latin nato bombings as well as a bunch of other stuff but again whitewashing holocaust denial is probably enough to indicate someone's politics the uk and canada are far from being the only topics blackpigeon speaks repeats endlessly on his channel and when boiled down to basics most of his videos aren't really about anything all the information given to the viewer only serves the purpose of painting a doomsday scenario the collapse of your country the eu or the west as a whole is seemingly always imminent and there's almost never a point in exploring any subject beyond giving the viewers an apocalyptic outlook of their situation the goal of these videos doesn't revolve around what is said but how it lands with the viewer for example on his channel or his second channel felix rex he uses every historical concept he can find to convince his viewers that it's all about to go south with no chance of preventing catastrophe well not no chance but we'll get to that like in the video caesarism the decline of the west where he uses the theories of oswald spengler which claimed that the societies most of us live in have already reached their peak in culture art and general level of progress what is left for us is just to witness a nation on its downturn with literally no way of stopping it not only that but all contemporary culture for instance your favorite movie is actually trash according to spangler it is impossible for us to create anything as valuable as what came before simply because the time when your society produced great culture has already passed in an essay called pessimism he writes germany will never again produce another gerte although it's not always spread out like spangler does political videos by blackpigeon speaks follow his footsteps of conveying a feeling of hopelessness information gets thrown at the viewer completely out of context or regardless of accuracy as long as it creates a version of reality that's bleak and depressing it's much much different from for instance a stephen crowder video which mostly exists to simply misinform and for steven to make money in that sense i would go as far as to say the content of black pigeon speaks is closer to fiction than any political commentary i'm familiar with apart from isis recruiting videos i can really only think of a single piece of media outside of youtube that impacts whoever views these videos regularly in a similar fashion a few years ago i stumbled over a series of books called the red riding quartet by author david peace the events in the series mainly revolve around two things one is the hunt for a serial killer named the yorkshire ripper and the other one is a series of child abduction cases what sets this series apart from other crime fiction books is that the experience of reading it is nothing short of repulsive and depressing not only through the plot but how the story is conveyed they are written in a way that makes it almost impossible to follow the plot for a big chunk of the series the information the reader gets always feels significant but it's hard to find any real meaningful connection between one piece of information and another in the murder mystery genre it often feels like each chapter gives you a new puzzle piece until you are able to grasp the big picture in the red riding quartet it is as if you receive puzzle pieces belonging to an entirely different puzzle rather than solving a crime case the book puts much more effort into conveying a feeling of getting punched in the stomach certain bits of information or descriptions or the constant repetition of specific sentences serve no purpose at all except making you feel bad and drawing you further into this world at the end of the series you might have made several connections of who has done what horrible thing but the last pages render it all completely meaningless spoilers ahead by the way at the climax of the last book in the series one of our main characters finds the hideout when a ductile shot has been taken but he's too late to save it in addition to that he finds out that anybody who could have done something about this child abuse and murdering either already knows of its existence or was actively part of it including his own deceased father the series leaves you with a feeling of complete emptiness and even worse you're the stupid one for expecting that there would be anything positive at the end the only meaningful difference between the writing quartet and content like blackpigeon speaks is is that one at least admits it is fiction now i know upon first hearing me say this it sounds a little farfetched comparing political commentary to a work of fiction but i would argue that reading the red writing quartet gives you about just as much a truthful image of the events it portrays as blackpigeon speaks does with the events he talks about they both create a fictionalized version of reality the yorkshire ripper really existed as well as the child abduction cases the book is based on but that's really about it they just serve as a basis for the story the studies or news stories black pigeon speaks picks serve the exact same function here's an example that is supposed to indicate that britain is abolishing itself the uk's capital now has more murders in real terms than new york city for the first time in modern history but devotes its resources to prosecute native citizens that make posts critical of the increasing enrichment of their city on social media so this is a great example because it brings something up that is technically true but the extrapolation drawn from it is complete nonsense talking about london's moderate exceeding the one of new york is supposed to convey the feeling that british society is deteriorating with crime spiraling out of control according to the news story it is true that there was a short stretch in 2018 during which the murder rate of london topped that of new york when we take a look at the broader picture though it becomes clear that it's not the result of london's skyrocketing murder rate but rather the result of new york's falling murder rate in addition to that in the timeframe the headline is based on there was an unusually high number of murder cases in london and an unusually low number of murder cases in new york in the entire year of 2018 the murder rate in new york was still twice as high as in london despite the downward trend it's not an indicator of anything especially not britain abolishing itself the statistical outlier that is way more representative of new york success than london's failure is not enough to assume a general trend when it comes to the talking points he brings up in his videos like this one it really doesn't matter though if they are truthful or that the conclusion of the video logically follows these videos are based on true events so to say i'll show you another example from the video i mentioned earlier [Music] there is very much a civilizational crisis across the entirety of the western world our nations are buried under so much debt that it would previously have been unimaginable unfunded liabilities that are bankrupting nations as the boomers retire on mass so the collapse of the west is imminent nothing new so far but what follows after is another great example of gov meant to scare the viewer a high national debt barely tells us anything about the overall financial state of a country the reason he brings this up is because someone who doesn't know any better will think of the type of debt they might have with a credit card company and think this must be really bad and not to get t dupe and not to get too deep into this but the sheer amount of debt doesn't tell us much because if a country makes a lot of money then having a bit more debt isn't really that big of a deal a better indicator would be the debt to gross domestic product ratio in the us for instance it's currently quite high partially because of trump's tax cut which mostly benefited the super rich but it's not a record high so i don't know why this would have been previously unthinkable as the video states jumping to a different country like germany the ratio is actually pretty good and i stood below the one of 2007. looking at the entire eurozone it's also lower than it was four years ago but even a high debt to gdp ratio doesn't have to be a bad thing especially right now where borrowing money is dirt cheap so much so that it might be better for a country to just refinance that debt than to pay it off what really matters is not the amount of debt but the interest rate is borrowed at a lot of that debt also is usually intra-governmental so money the government owes to its own agencies to fund things like social security and even if none of that mattered if the entire world is horribly in-depth who do you think that money is owed to wouldn't that be like four friends each lending 50 bucks to one another i think you get the idea but nuance like that would ruin the punch of hearing our countries are horribly in debt debt equals bad that's why this talking point is in the video also while the boomers retiring will most likely cause a spike in social spending them leaving the workforce also has the potential to bring in new people who previously had trouble finding a job it's not as much a doomsday scenario as our narrator makes it out to be although it's definitely a challenge he goes on to talk about the theories of spengler who we talked about before and specifically his idea of caesarism described in his book the untagang des ablandes or the decline of the west according to spengler history rather than being viewed linear should be seen as functioning in cycles and to follow the same patterns each time in this theory the last phase of a civilization is ushered in by the abolition of democracy and a strong caesar-esque figure taking over the supposed conclusion of this video is that we are currently at this stage of caesarism and bases that on information like a poll taking in the uk chile to spain the u.s to italy and points in between civilization exhaustion and trust in the political process and in democracy itself is eroding and spilling into the streets violently political gridlock today is no better exemplified than that by the failure despite a political mandate provided by popular referendum over three years ago for the united kingdom to exit from the european union and the disgust with the political class has now become so entrenched and so thorough that in fact a majority of people in england wales and scotland now believe that violence against members of parliament is a price worth paying if it meant that their views on brexit won out and that is a majority of people both leavers and remainers according to a recent poll taken by academics from the university of edinburgh and cardiff for yougov and also shockingly there was a large percentage of people surveyed who said that turning on their fellow citizens could be justified even if it resulted in them being badly injured if it settled brexit in their favor so we have the assertion that a majority of voters in the uk say violence against mp is worth it to get brexit their way with this being another indicator of society falling apart putting aside that i don't see how a poll on brexit would speak for any country but the uk the claim put forward in the video is a flat out lie what the poll actually said was that a majority of those surveyed did see violence against mps as a risk worth taking to get their preferred brexit outcome now that might not sound like much of a distinction at first but when we dig deeper into the poll it makes all the difference for instance a person answering the question of the poll might think the risk is worth it because they deemed that risk to be rather low the same poll concluded that 66 percent of leave voters thought violence being directed towards mps was unlikely if britain left the eu apart from that the survey didn't even include a possible answer for people who didn't see violence towards mps as a risk or people who thought there would be a risk of violence either way it would be like asking me if i accept the possibility of being hit by a car when i go outside to walk my extremely good and cute dog obviously i'd say yes because i think the risk of that happening is very low someone extrapolating from my answer that i'm willing to die in a car crash to get my dog the proper exercise would be ridiculous it's the same with the second claim our narrator makes where 38 of those surveyed said protests in which members of the public are badly injured are a risk worth taking it's also possible that some of those survey didn't take the poll seriously or didn't understand some of the questions since according to the reported data five percent say they want to get substantially poorer regardless of brexit and about 11 percent say they want the party they support to lose the next general election but again none of these facts matter to black pigeon speaks because that headline sounds bad that's the only thing that counts another good example of that is spengler's theory on the decline of the west in itself because europe already went through its caesarism phase spengler despite being a huge anti-semite didn't think hitler was the right guy for the job of the german caesar but put his trust into italian dictator benito mussolini and that glorious caesar face for italy yeah never really happened the only thing he really accomplished was driving italy into the historical ditch and end up mutilated hanging upside down from a gas station and guess what italy germany they're still there doing much better than during their time under a dictatorial regime by putting all that to the side you might ask yourself how does springer argue for his theory of history as cycles when that symmetry just doesn't match reality well that's a very good question with an entertaining answer spengler saw history as a living organism and compared it to a caterpillar which you wouldn't expect to just keep on growing and stay a caterpillar forever but for us and for a black pigeon speaks it's not that important to go into spangler's weird musings about his overall perception of history because he is only interested in what he and spengler want to communicate back then and to this day the right replaces actual history with mysticism and uses that as a tool to push their ideas you know we have to curb immigration because that's the way the roman empire fell and nonsense like that the reason why blackpigeon speaks and the writer in general are interested in spangler is not his comparing history to a tree or caterpillar but his pessimism there's even a german word for that kind of person that our narrator fits to a t it's called a tzvek pessimist or purposeful pessimist who make a big show of how terrible everything is to get a certain reaction and in this case exploit it spengler's work is interesting to study in terms of cultural impact since he was widely read in germany's interwar years and really tapped into the pessimism towards the country's future when it comes to the actual content of the book though it's worthless pseudo-historical trash but even if all that is true and this entire channel runs on misinformation how does this mean that black pigeon speaks doesn't actually care about what he is saying and that only the effect matters the simple answer is that there is absolutely no indication that he cares about the coherence of his ideas in the slightest let's jump to a different recent video on his second channel felix rex titled end game the fall of the west it starts out with the usual incoherent rambling about how civilization will most likely collapse soon and then puts forth a historical theory just as we have seen in the video before this one is based on the writing of sir john glubb and his paper the fate of empires and search for survival in this paper he claims empires or superpowers have a lifespan of about 250 years exuding outliers like the german empire for instance and i really don't want to get too deep into this because i considered a waste of time but broadly speaking there is no systemic model that comprehensively explains everything in history the reason why the vast majority of historians do not adhere to these models is that they do not sufficiently explain the past neither do they reliably predict the future glub even admits in his paper that the dates his theory is based on are largely arbitrary the ottoman empire for instance remained the great power after 1570 even though they were entering a period of decline the byzantine empire which isn't listed here even lasted for over a thousand years and while glub tries to acknowledge outliers by comparing the lifespan of empires so that of a human that allows for variation no human reaches four or five times their average life expectancy your theory becomes useless at that point because history apart from not being a caterpillar is also not like a human the reason why i'm talking about glub's theory as indication that our narrator doesn't care about what he is saying is that while club is obviously influenced by spengler he ultimately disagrees with his model of historical cycles spengler rejected the idea that history just keeps on going in a linear fashion where globe writes this in his paper to derive any useful instruction from history it seems to me essential first of all to grasp the principle that history to be meaningful must be the history of the human race for history is a continuous process gradually developing changing and turning back but in general moving forward in a single mighty stream any useful lessons to be derived must be learned by the study of the whole flow of human development not by the selection of short periods here and there in one country or another in the video this theory is brought up there is no attempt to reconcile these two with one another or even acknowledge the contradictions ultimately gloves and spengler's models are incompatible and the one thing they have in common is an effort to be as pessimistic as possible and to me this really lays barrel the aim of content like this portraying studies events or even outdated historical theories in an honest way or not regurgitating something talked about 15 times already all come secondary to the effort of depressing the viewer this interwoven with videos on how women destroy civilizations for instance is supposed to lay the groundwork for the political project of the channel and just to zoom in on this a bit even if these videos didn't have the aim to pull people to the far right or you don't believe they do they still have the potential to be incredibly harmful let's say you don't end up a griper or whatever dork you stuff these people into these days maybe you just think spangler is correct and believe doom is inevitable or by the argument that women really do destroy civilizations just believing a bunch of these assertions on their own it's easy to see how this content well i would say further social isolation and prevents you from making meaningful connections in your life a less sensitive way someone else might say it is turning into a massive constantly sad loser think of yourself as an impressionable young guy and stumbling over a video about how women destroy civilizations and buying at wholesale imagine making your first experiences with women while always having in the back of your head that they're fundamentally disloyal and will leave you to gain any advantage and then when you're totally socially inept and incapable of connecting to other people you get hit with the solution which is packaged as constituting society along different lines as he says at the end of the video in the coming troubles that have been brought about by the decadence in our civilization we will hear inevitable calls for order and assurances of renewed stability but there's always going to be a price for this and yes maybe the experiment in universal suffrage for example has run its course or maybe a reorientation of society is needed or as yet something unclear or unknown these things can be worked out in the future adjustments will of course have to be made along new ways of problem solving it's either this or the alternative naturally he never actually gets into the specifics of what he wants to happen because he'd be banned off the platform if he did what he does instead is tiptoe around what he really wants to say and uses sentences like adjustments will have to be made and that when doing so we shouldn't shy away from being called illiberal which is the advertiser friendly way of advocating for the restriction of personal freedoms if you would only throw your fellow citizens under the bus who are anything but straight cis white males then you'll be good to go and the fictitious reality that you have been sold previously won't be as bleak i'm not gonna lie and pretend that i know what it's like to have such a dark outlook as black pigeon speaks sells his viewers but even the thought to be in that headspace to never be able to leave yorkshire so to say and live in that world sends shivers down my spine now i get this might come off as me making excuses for someone who shares blackpigeon speaks worldview after watching his videos and empathizing with people who maybe don't deserve it and while i think these people should be held accountable for their beliefs just looking at this content like i have before and focusing on the accuracy of the displayed information leaves out why it is there in the first place these videos aren't simply bad because they're full of lies but also because they're by design predatory one thing this look at black pigeon speaks content as a piece of media already has drawn into focus for me is to what pathetic means the forward has to resort to to spread their ideas not only twisting studies or news stories that's always been obvious but also to fester and then exploit social isolation when the left says to be a fascist is to be a loser since it's an ideology that history shows to always fail the far right seemingly has taken that literally and acknowledged that they have to make you vulnerable to even get a foot in the door the argument always boils down to desperate times call for desperate measures and if you're not desperate yet well let me tell you a thing or two and by things i mean lies obviously thank you for watching everyone one thing real quick i think it's important to stretch that obviously the majority of people who suffer from depression don't become far-right lunatics it's not an excuse for bad politics also a heartfelt thank you to all my patrons i mean it when i say this content wouldn't exist without you if you're thinking about becoming one of these lovely people you can check out the rewards over the link in the description apart from that my apologies to author david peace for comparing his books to far-right propaganda but they only served a narrative purpose here and i actually really like them if you're okay with maybe having some dark thoughts for a bit they are really thrilling he also has two books set in japan called tokyo year zero and tokyo occupied city which are good remember to subscribe and ring the bell if you like follow on twitter and all that stuff otherwise i'll see you in a couple of weeks hopefully until then have a good one
