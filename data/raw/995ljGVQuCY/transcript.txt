but so what's what's been what's been happening with the bbc so the uh this is this sort of small story that i thought was going to be small but no it's kind of blown up so this is uh a front page news on the bbc and then i i got into it and uh the bbc are unhappy that youtubers are saying things that they don't like oh no therefore they have to go and they are they're exacting their will here don't worry about this tweet i'll just remember it so that's uh let's get up the first tweet which is from a a bbc funded journalist who is working for a welsh news outlet but the welsh news outlet is uh funded by the bbc right so and he's he's um saying that this youtuber which he doesn't like needs to go because that's it because i don't like them because i don't like them they have to go and of course they're political and of course they're anti-work because like always so the the the the youtube channel they're targeting is an explicitly anti-work channel right yeah yeah i've watched some of their stuff they just seem to be pretty much anti-web types just normal right they i watched a couple of their videos too they seem to be normal working-class welsh people yeah so let's get this one up so this is and just say a half of my family's welsh i'm very familiar with this kind of culture is a good culture i like it no no no no no it's it's very much family family oriented and you can see it in their videos because they've got like you know a few of them doing it and it's very sort of like uh very very um unpretentious is a good way of describing you know like based wholesome you know but caring loving family environments you know it's it's good good salt of the earth sort of people they seemed uh i'm not explicitly familiar but that's what the impression i came away with so this is this journalist tweeting out so he says here quinn tonight on the news in in welsh the first two of a special report on welsh youtube channel accused of being quote racist and quote sharing abominable language and thinking oh how dare they think his crime is thinking wrong literally you've had too much to think there but i love that the problem that they've been accused of being racist as if that's a crime in and of itself we're accusing you of racism how do you plead but secondly can you point someone that you don't accuse being racist like it's is this remarkable or unique in any way shape or form i mean literally everyone gets accused of racism for chest feeding now i guess not using that term so anyone anyway just uh just to point out here pubs pubs are just racist because people drink in them who aren't black i want to put up the wikipedia page of the of the news organization so the next one this is just uh confirming that yes they are the parent company is bbc whales so they are funded by the bbc even though it's got a welsh name and i want to play the first clip sorry about the quality being a bit low but this is the reporting on uh this youtube channel for existing so let's just play the welsh youtube channel has been labeled racist after an investigation by bbc wales founded and shared videos with members of the proud boys a group that's been outflowed as a terrorist group in canada have been removed by youtube but the people running it say they're giving a voice to people who aren't represented by the mainstream media opposing the housing of asylum seekers at a local military training camp also present broadcasting seemingly supportive coverage is a youtube channel called voice of wales it's rendered by dan morgan and stan robinson who claim to be journalists giving voice to those not heard in mainstream media but we've heard concerns they have a darker side but county councillor has told us that he's been harassed by voice of wales after opposing the protests in pembrokeshire this harassment included an allegation that he shared a sexually explicit video of an underage school bill a claim he totally rejects obviously they do take an eventual toll i suppose on you i mean not just me i suppose friends and family as well who are obviously concerned to make sort of false allegations just a bit of your narrative is very very wrong so voice of wales keeps controversial company guests on the channel include the proud boys a far-right group active in north america banned from twitter facebook and instagram and now classed as an illegal terrorist group in canada they've also been involved in discussions with figures such as tommy robinson and katie hopkins both banned by twitter for preaching hateful conduct guidelines and some have raised concern about the language used by the presenters too including these remarks by stan robinson during a recent broadcast if i want to uh you know go and and invite all things indian i'll get on a jet and i'll fly to india i don't want to get out of my house and have it on my doorstep thank you very much the only thing i suppose where maybe we differ on that a little is um you know the indian community our hindu community i believe are the best of us actually you're right that was a bad analogy india is it it is pakistan but actually in my power yes that i find particularly problematic and that's my personal view yeah yeah yeah displaying posters of prominent black individuals during a recent live stream this is what dan [Music] that's what wales is going to become senior politicians have criticized boys of wales it's very very worrying and it is very dangerous unfortunately their real aim is to create hatred to create the vision to stir up racism this kind of uh politics and then that can develop into consequences for the society as a whole which nevertheless i think uh i'm sure it should allow it to happen and what we see the welsh conservatives said they also had concerns in a statement condemning what they regard as foul and unacceptable language and ideas possible to deny allegations of racism and say free speech includes the right to offend and of course to be offended after we contacted them youtube confirmed they had removed three videos and denied advertising on six others featuring voice of wales as they were found to breach their policies that was unreal so what this looks like to me is that wales has been getting their dose of mass immigration and the working-class people of wales don't really seem to like it and the elite of wales who are profiting from all of this i like oh my god well if we allow them to keep saying that mass immigration is bad for their communities then that could cause the er you know that could cause us to actually accept that the welsh people have a moral claim to wales that foreigners don't have and that would actually cause quite a lot of trouble because we've been creating the condition that insists that no they don't and foreigners have just got as much a claim to wales as they do and that can't be allowed that's an accurate description of how things are going here i would say so i wanted to just go through a few points there so the first one that claiming proud boys terrorists because the canadians say so well i look forward to the people what does your ping say i look forward to the bbc reporting that anti-far have been terrorists oh wait they never do they got claimed as terrorists internationally by the trump administration never any matter no it doesn't matter um they also have him claiming to be a journalist that was a great quote by the one of the voice of wales guys look if a man can claim to be a woman i can claim to be a journalist more importantly if the bbc reporters can claim to be journalists anyone else can definitely anyone else can so he also accused a welsh councillor of being a nonce or doing non-sorry things i don't know the truth of this but i i did notice that they happened to just say he was a counselor and they didn't explain which parties are from so this is just and this guy was like hey hey wait a minute so his twitter account here 23 welsh labour county councillor economics grad trustee and master student persistent about doing the right thing uh gay flag i'm just gonna say welsh flag eu flag he him oh yeah there's no way this guy is going to be found eventually to have been grooming young boys like the lincoln project or anything that's what's being alleged against him no that's definitely not going to happen certainly not and again if joshua if you have such a problem with voice of wales saying these slanderous things on this sue yeah like they're claiming something serious so you could just say absolutely you can get some money out of this assuming that it's just as untrue as you say yeah so they also say that um they're complaining about pakistani integration not being perfect like understating this this situation there are a bunch of black americans being celebrated at the welsh art council as you would expect like why wouldn't they be a welsh art council and then that they interviewed mrs hopkins who cares that's not a crime and lord voldemort and they interviewed lord voldemort how can they do this except that's a complete lie they even the clip they show so let's get the the first he was there wasn't he no he was there but you'll notice that's actually not their live stream oh is it not theirs someone else's first image this is the right view which is a completely different channel right okay they just happen to be vital and part of a group and there we go that's them interviewing voldemort here which is just a lie just outright lie by the bbc right okay why not and in response the bbc lobbied youtube and they say that they've had three million videos removed and six demonetized uh they're claiming that apparently two of them removed for covered stasis so i don't know what how many but they seem to have been able to successfully lobby youtube from the establishment side in in cohorts with labour party members here yeah like they're definitely giving the labour party perspective i mean the politicians they had on there they had but did you just uh just uh sorry to interrupt what i love about this is literally the the framing of this was we're giving a voice to the unheard people of wales and the bbc's like that's unacceptable we don't want to hear from them that's the problem well i mean look at the production quality for example this is what i know that some people can take this as criticism but i actually love how this sort of stuff looks because it looks real yeah it's authentic like they're sat there with a little green screen and it's great it's absolutely great having a good time anyway so the the labor mp was criticizing them there the leader replied comrey basically just leftism day you give a voice to these plebs and then a leftist uh counselor and then the conservatives so uh proto leftist saying that they had unacceptable ideas and language pathetic pathetic people and of course just because the the local welsh news coverage was that the bbc had to cover this as well so the next uh article was the this was on the front page like i logged into the bbc just see what they're reporting on every day i just got out that just like front page reporting was this bbc story of them saying that this you know accused racist channel exists just accuse of racism that means nothing do you know how little that narrows it down bbc okay what isn't being accused of racism that would be a shorter list yeah look at that this yeah this is bbc reporting here like promoting it okay oh they were accused of racism were they don't care nobody asked so i just clipped out a little bit here of the reporting bbc did that was not done by the other site so let's play video two so this is the the bbc reporting on water hurts you know the the crime that's taking place there no sound to this not to the start you know go and and imbibe all things indian i'll get on a jet and i'll fly to india i don't want to get out of my house and and have it on my doorstep thank you very much a lot of these the things that they're saying are putting so many people in danger directly and entirely they spelled a lot of ideology around immigrants and refugees and um and the muslim community and knowing these sort of people myself it really does um make me fear for their safety because i know that a lot of impressionable people she's smiling and targeting all their anger and she can hardly stop herself from laughing she can hardly stop herself from laughing she is lying and she knows she's lying why are we taking a lecture from a child anyway in the first place i'm so sick of this because this is the state-funded media and the state-funded media have determined this person's view is important it's so transparent i don't care about this 12-year-old lecturing me about people being engaged and then flee flee the country but on this youtube channel just saying that you know integration hasn't been perfect i mean that's essentially his complaint i would rather wales look like whales than india oh my god controversy take him down yeah he's going to shut it down this guy's anti-colonialism you know what so that was uh a woman who was labeled from the bbc is from an organization called stand up to racism yeah this is image two so this is just the officers that stand up to racism president diane abbott there so labour party affiliated but it gets worse i thought it might just be labor party i found out today that it's not just them oh which conservatives are on there oh no well uh david cameron endorsed it once which of course [ __ ] but the the next image here is uh this is a uh thing i found this was an argument within leftist organizations so i'm getting this from leftists or complaining that they don't like that the labour party and the socialist workers party are combining here so this is a uh what's described as a leading member of the socialist workers party he went to some debate or another and then the next image here is just a segment of his his speech and in here says finally we are aided by the fact that the socialist workers party is closely identified with the anti-racist movement in britain we are central to stand up to racism of course they are so they're saying that they're part of the central running of this organization and if you just go to the socialist workers party's page they're a trotskyist organization self-identified they self-identify as trotskyist so commies are driving the agenda once again and the state media calls them up and like hey we've had someone criticizing immigration shut it down will you they're like no problem buddy and they jump in there and say that this is horrible mad it's it's a really good way of seeing how the state in the uk works though someone criticizes something and they're like lobby youtube get the state media involved call in the trotskyist we gotta deal with this yeah how the cathedral operates but it's not against the working class incidentally and you also have to take into example this is the bbc and i just wanted to bring this up because they still not taking this down so this is a statue at the bbc which uh paul joseph watson's pointing out here was created by a convicted pedophile uh the bbc know this what i mean let's talk about the fact that bbc you know uh jimmy savile gary clinton all that stuff yeah this is still there they know people have complained about this there have been petitions to get rid of it when was it created um i think it was like a couple of decades ago something like that so it's not even if it was an ancient statue okay no but for people who can't see as well it's like an elderly man with a whole beard holding a naked child with his genitalia out it's just like okay it's weird at the best of times but then the guy who made it was a convicted nuns who was not single on his own daughters you think you'd remove it yeah i mean you'll notice all the statues that have to be taken down for you know he once owned a slave yeah the time where slavery was universal i don't think that noncerey has ever been universal no about i suppose at the bbc different case well i mean jimmy savile yeah that's it literally bbc jimmy savile shut up and of course the establishment also had to call and hope not hate here which is just a organization we need experts on nonsense i guess you can uh you can give me a call nick so they promoted this story as well being like oh we need to take this down because they're criticizing immigration hope not hate also being a front for communism yeah next one here is just a link to remember for everyone to remember the head of research i hope not hate is a self-identified member of the communist party of great britain so not as radical as the trotsky as i suppose but still an out-and-out communist by his own i mean how it depends he might be a leninist or something but look at look at this i mean it's just a channel it's just a random channel right and you must be thinking like they must be storming youtube the way that they get this much coverage oh well i mean millions millions millions they must have yeah hundreds of thousands of subscribers millions of views a month uh they must be clearly having an impact on the culture of wales yeah they must be destroying the uh applied comrade guys at the next election or something next link is just their channel um six thousand seven hundred subs they used to be five thousand they got a thousand just from this media report now i i don't wanna i don't wanna suggest that there's something inadequate about that um but it demonstrates that even the slightest that's the point disagreement about the fact that integration's not perfect in this case the smallest amount and it's it's not it's not so much about that either i think it's also about the position that voice of whales come from as in they are welsh and the you know they are indigenous welsh people and they are complaining about the colonization of their country and that makes it the the pinprick i think that they can't resist so they're that's why like that it's not like they're even getting like viral videos or something it's just their audience that's watching their videos right which normal don't get me wrong oh it's not even neo-nazium or anything or actually racist i watch their stuff they're not they're just anti-woke you know center-right people conservatives let's say and that's enough to get the entire british establishment involved in shutting it down we've got a lobby youtube because remember this is how they got rid of voldemort as well that's why he's gone yep they literally pulled in a guy from youtube and berated him for an hour about how they're still getting recommended videos in their recommended site and the guy was just saying they're like well stop watching them this isn't my fault the labour mps are so interested in him you can't stop watching lord voldemort not me they're all women as well so i do have to wonder it's all yeah well you know anyway last couple of things i wanted to uh cover here because the semi-related in the free speech realm is that we got this report out um that of the police log in this country non-hate crime incidents so not crimes but their hate incidents yeah we covered this a while ago where the police were actively saying well look even if it's not crime come and report it to us anyway so why the hell would you need to do that so they've done it they've got 120 000 reports they've said um after a freedom of information quests were made and they said that not one crime was uh was helped by this so they they got 120 000 reports from the public about incidents you know all the administration that goes along with that yeah we're paying for all of this and they they didn't help one iota i would like them to calculate how much it costs to log one hate crime report that is not a crime and then we can work out exactly how much of our money they've wasted yeah i mean they're literally saying here they were not able of the freedom of information requests 43 police forces uh not one could say that they could have one crime was prevented by this and 20 admitted they didn't even have a system in place to monitor the effectiveness so they're just they're just doing this for you know fulfilling the law's sake for labor yeah um reports on non-crime hates incidents can show up in criminal records for at least six years so if you have one put against you which again is not a crime it will be on your criminal record for six years at least we've got a record of you doing something that wasn't illegal how do you plead not guilty yeah i mean am i guilty of doing something that wasn't illegal and the most absurd things like there was a harry miller you must remember i remember harry the owl yeah he was a hate criminal he's limerick he liked a limerick he liked a limerick and that was it the police came around to quote check his thinking in the same way they were discussing the thinking of this youtube channel that was exactly the term they used and it was it was a transphobic limerick and so you can see why they would need to check his thinking in those words the police of vice and virtue yes so he says he should have statemented this because he runs fair cop now apparently he's a co-founder uh these reports have allowed the police to become weaponized by woke activists who seek to attack and shut people down if they dare express a view which does not agree with which they do not agree with correct totally right totally right correct the college of policing's point of view is that social media hate crime must be treated as a priority why they don't they don't mention one here because presumably the labor activists who put all of this into place were on twitter and they've been told by the people on twitter this is a big deal they've got to deal with it i mean it is the law and i don't know why the conservatives don't just get rid of it i don't know we're all waiting it's been 10 years literally get rid of the supreme court get rid of tony blair's immigration reforms get rid of almost everything that tony blair did in his tenure just get rid of it all i mean for americans who might not understand it's not like they don't have control of different houses oh yeah they've got it all they've got it all they have absolute power because that's the way the parliament works here yeah and they parliament is sovereign well okay we'll stack it with conservatives ah you're regretting that no because we control the conservatives like there are checks and balances just to be accurate in the house of lords and stuff but there's nothing stopping them from getting rid of old labor policy nothing at all literally they could have done it in a week yeah and then the next thing was the the lib dems tweet just to show the absolute state of this country which we can't show you because they've deleted it but i did watch it so yeah it was a clip from what question time so this is question time and a labor sorry lib dem mp liberal democrat was asked is free speech a priority in this country and she responded with no but it was the way she responded with no as well it wasn't just that because i mean like you know you're in the middle of a war and you know you go to churchill miss churchill there's free speech priority be like no not the moment we're trying to defeat the nazis but that wasn't the way that she approached it she got all high and mighty and hoity talks about no this is not so priority let me tell you why it's like how about you shut up then you know how about we take away your free speech if it's not priority don't tell us but the point is she was almost offended by the the question of whether free speech is a priority absolutely not yeah absolutely absolutely not in response unbelievable liberal democrats but that's the stance of free speech in the uk you will be investigated for your thinking if not by the police by the state media who are funded by you [Music] you
