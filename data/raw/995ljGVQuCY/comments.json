    "text": "Voice of Wales statement: \n\n\"Voice of Wales has hosted politicians from across the political spectrum including the former advisor to the Mayor of London and Respect Party candidate, Lee Jasper (whose Twitter account is currently suspended for violation), Caroline Jones MS, and Katie Hopkins. We also operate an open invitation to BLM, ANTIFA, SWP, councillors, AMs and Ministers we have named on our programs.\r\n\r\nWe do not believe in deplatforming and have faith in our viewers to formulate their own views based on a variety of opinions.\r\n\r\nUnlike the BBC, our platform gives a voice to people who aren’t represented by the mainstream media. We readily state that any errors we make will be publicly broadcast and an apology given. So far, we have not had to correct any content or offer an apology to our wide array of guests.\r\n\r\nAll viewers have an option to switch off and, unlike the BBC, our channel is growing because people like to hear the truth and we can readily supply comments and interviewees along with guests who positively endorse our work and our journalism.\r\n\r\nVoice of Wales takes the safeguarding of children very seriously. The councillor in question has made numerous wildly inappropriate comments over sex education which, given his position as an elected representative and school governor, must be exposed. We believe his constituents have a right to know about the views of their representative when it comes to the sexualisation of their children in schools.\r\n\r\nBlack Lives Matter is a self-confessed Marxist organisation and Voice of Wales has strictly advocated the elimination of politics from sport – a position which is backed up by the FA’s own regulations. We have openly stated that we wish to see a return to ‘Kick Racism Out’ & ‘Show Racism the Red Card’ to combat discrimination in football rather than kneeling to a brazenly political organisation responsible for violence on our streets.\r\n\r\nWhilst there has been a concerted effort by the same handful of people to shut us down, the Voice of Wales has never been suspended from YouTube and we work within the platform’s community guidelines. Free speech includes the right to offend and, of course, to be offended.\"",
