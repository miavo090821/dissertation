Figuratively anyone ever talks about these days.\nGermany and the tribes that made up the population living on German ground have a history of +1000 years.\nBut sure, let's all reduce it down to those 15 years.\n\nYou think yourself smart, but the truth is that you're really just boring. Whatever you or anyone else hopes to bring up talking about Nazis I have heard a million times before. We had it drilled into our heads in torturous long and emotionally manipulative classes in school - The same talking points over and over.\n\nI don't care about Nazis. I'm not even phased by the word Nazi. When someone suddenly brings up Nazis, I usually start laughing at how ridiculous the word in itself sounds and how silly the guy argumenting Nazis is. Nevermind the fact that whatever you think to know of that time is going to be in all likelihood dangerous half-truths. A lot of good information about that time were altered, censored or \"book burned\" because it cannot be what must not be.",

The writing is on the wall, the \"activists\" are out and about and the ship has set sail for fail.\n\nClearly important lessons weren't learned. The lessons the Weimar Republic teaches, that is. You're living in a modernized replica of it and chances are you have noticed but are unable to stop it.\n\nPolarization of the nation, leftwing and rightwing squads patrolling the streets and causing harm, impoverished working class with constantly worsening conditions, over-privileged ruling and corporate class, high crime rate, sexual degeneracy everywhere, nothing is sacred anymore - Not even children - And finally the whole thing comes crumbling down. All that's missing is the economic spark of depression to ignite the powder keg. And almost as if it was strategically called in, here comes the awfully convenient covid lockdowns, which have surely kneecapped any GDP momentum you initially had. Millions have lost their jobs over nothing.\n\nThe political actors are dropping their facade of a fair debate-based fighting stage and go for low-blow after low-blow:\nEmergency laws and executive orders executed by the president, because he otherwise can't even get any legislative changes done. A largely *hostile* parliament that constantly defies its own mission statement just to block the legislative process from happening. Smear campaign after smear campaign making the news indoctrinating the masses with lies and slander for or against one side.\nTalks of a \"revolution\" everywhere, yet everyone talking about it somehow expects to magically go through the whole process unscathed, clearly thinking everyone else will pay the toll.\n\nIn one sentence: Delusion rules the day and destruction the night.\n\nAll of this and much more would describe the Weimar Republic to a T,  which quickly was descending the downwards spiral from the mid 20's onward. Yet these words are also valid for the USA now. The result from decades worth of sabotage and a weak democracy that just took the pounding year after year without fighting back against the *OBVIOUS* aggressors.\n\nSo how 'bout that history of yours? Seems many a person didn't learn from it. Go tell those college students and activists about the Weimar Republic and how it came to fall. Because, spoilers, no matter who \"wins\" the fighting in the end - It's going to end badly for most of you. I don't think you will be able to change their mind, though.\nYuri Bezmenov said it best: \"Once the demoralization is complete - Even if you showed them that White is White and Black is Black, they'd still not believe it.\"",

That said, the middle of the political spectrum is murky waters, and there are no saints there, it's all haggling and compromise and hard to see a clear vision, and noone will ever be too happy with the results for that very reason, but it's there opposing sides can meet in a way that does not lead to war, that encourages conversation between opposing parties and shuts out deconstructionists, anti democratic reactionaries and dangerous revolutionaries from power. It's the only way to have peace. The alternative is some degree of totalitarianism, left or right, and such societies are plagued by violence and held together by might of force.",

Meinungs- und Satirefreiheit sind wichtig und richtig, aber Moderation muss dort walten wo Schadenspotential entsteht; besonders, wo Hass geschürt wird, der darauf abzielt, Menschenrechte zu verletzen. Echokammern die soetwas ermöglichen müssen aufgebrochen werden. Das kann man als Individuum nur insofern tun, dass man in denjenigen Diskussionen, die außerhalb oder am Rand der eigenen Blase stattfinden, dem von mir oben beschriebenen Prinzip zu folgen. \n\nSoll nicht heissen dass ich meine dass im Internet kein Platz für kontroverse Meinungen sein sollte, oder gar für Meinungen und Persönlichkeiten, die nicht dem aktuellen kulturellen Mainstream entsprechen, sondern dass diese durch Moderation davon abgehalten werden sollten, zu extrem zu werden und zu reale Gewalt zu katalysieren. Ich glaube, Menschen sind dazu in der Lage eine Ordnung die eine solche Balance gewährleistet aufzubauen und aufrechtzuerhalten, aber wenn sie das nicht tun, und anderen Sichtweisen nicht mit Vernunft begegnen, dazu tendieren mögen, der stärkeren, der lauteren, der Stimme die die Welt in zu einfache Begriffe herunterbrechen will und die anderen Menschen schaden möchte, das Feld zu überlassen oder ihr hinterherzurennen.",

Deswegen unterhalte ich mich immernoch mit dir. :) Aber ich muss dich einfach fragen .. hast du mit dieser Situation Erfahrung gemacht? - Denn 'Moderation' liegt oftmals im Ermessen des jeweiligen Moderators. Es gibt keine Moderatoren für die Moderation, sie sind die Entscheider. Und viele lassen ihre eigene Sichtweise, ihre Meinung, ihre Politische Richtung in ihre Entscheidungen miteinfließen. Alleine deswegen bin ich schon der Meinung, lieber garkeine Moderation & alle die ein dünnes Fell haben, sollten sich einfach vom Internet fern halten. Als dass man einzelnen Individuen die Macht gibt, alles nach ihrem Willen beeinflussen zu können. Das ist einfach falsch & wir erleben aktuell schon die Folgen dessen. Wohin soll das in der Zukunft führen? - Ein Normalo schreibt wütend einen Kommentar, jemand bestimmtes gefällt das nicht & schon darf diese Person gar nichts mehr kommentieren? Scheiße nein. - Lieber Brutale Ehrlichkeit, als gelogene Arschkriecherei. \n\nUnd was die Echokammern angeht .. nur die Deppen, entscheiden sich dafür in einer zu leben. - Der Rest, wird durch Stigmatisierung & Ausgrenzung dazu getrieben. Dass ist das tatsächliche Problem mit der Moderation des Internets, denn es gibt keine tatsächlichen Regeln, alles liegt im Ermessen desjenigen, der sich in der Richtigen Position befindet. - Und die Menschen, die regelmäßig erfahren das ihre Meinung, ihre Art oder ihr Humor unerwünscht ist .. wird sich nach & nach zurückziehen, sie wird regelrecht in diese Echokammern gezwungen, denn nur dort werden sie überhaupt akzeptiert. Nur dort, erleben sie es mal, nicht wegen ihrer Ansicht, ihres Humors oder sonstiges Angegriffen & beleidigt zu werden. \n\nDie Situation ist weitaus komplexer als dass es scheint. Man muss beide Seiten einnehmen, einmal aus beiden Sichtweisen auf das Problem blicken. Ich schwör dir, zu glauben dass das ausschließen bestimmter Menschen etwas verbessern wird, wird schreckliche Konsequenzen haben. Ich habe solche extremen Menschen schon kennengelernt, es ist nicht schön was die zu sagen haben. Das was man dort in solchen Kammern zuhören bekommt, macht einem Verdammt Sorgen. Glaub mir, das wird verflucht nochmal böse Enden wenn wir nicht alle zusammen an einem Tisch sitzen.",

Auf Instagram gibt es beispielsweise einige Seiten die sich LGBT, Neuroatipischen oder Übergewichtigen widmen und die von Individuen aus diesen Gruppen sind moderiert werden. Solche Safespaces scheinen eine gute Lösung für dieses Problem zu sein, insbesondere da ich dort die positive Erfahrung gemacht habe, dass Kritikfähigkeit durchaus vorhanden ist, sofern sie sachlich geäußert wird.

Verweichlicht ist evt auch was was sich leicht dahersagen lässt wenn man vielleicht wenig Erfahrung mit sowas hat wie sich täglich Dinge anhören zu müssen wie \"bitte stirb einfach du scheiss tranny\". \nOhne da speziell aus erster Hand zu sprechen kann ich sagen dass egal für wie resilient  man sich hält, die langfristigen psychischen Folgen die sowas haben kann sind äusserst real. Und jedes Mal wenn ein Arschloch die Frechheit hat sowas zu sagen wirkt es gesellschaftsfähiger auf irgendwelche anderen Arschlöcher die es mitkriegen. Egal wie gross der Backlash ist, der bestätigt sie vielleicht sogar noch, weil sie ja einen Nerv getroffen haben.",

Was darf ich unter diesem Wort verstehen? 🤔 - Aber natürlich habe ich keine Erfahrung mit Aussagen welche mir den Tot wünschen. Das möchte ich mir auch garnicht anmaßen. - Um über diese spezielle Situation zu urteilen, bräuchte ich ein paar mehr Informationen .. Zb. Kommen solche Aussagen bei einem persönlichen, offenen Social Media Account oder dann wenn sich Person Anonym im Internet bewegt? Also so wie wir beide es aktuell tun? 🤔\n\nUm ein paar unbelehrbare Deppen & ihre Aussagen zu unterbinden, tun wir nun was? Die Worte an sich, lassen sich halt auch nicht Sperren. Denn ansonsten verhindert man nämlich auch automatisch die Verwendung in normalen Gesprächen. - Also, zu welchem Schluss wollen wir diesbezüglich gelangen? Ich sehe da keine andere Möglichkeit als das diejenigen, denen sowas widerfährt, es ignorieren müssen & die jeweiligen Deppen melden/blockieren. - Anders würde es viel mehr Leute betreffen, als das es Recht wäre.",

Now, what happened at Roanoke is still a mystery, as we really don’t know what happened, but I guess it is a possibility that the native Americans slaughtered the settlers. But let’s look at the outcome, the Native American population is steadily decreasing as more people are being shown popular culture and moving out. Look at the Navajo, they’re losing their culture, language, and population. So I would have to agree that the whites have done much more damage than vice versa.

Eventually the band sued the German government and won reversing all restrictions placed on the sale and performance of the album. They also got money for damages but that took almost a decade.",

It was a nice leather suitcase. One day, he set it down when he waited for the bus, and a thief stole it and ran off with it. My Granddad ran after him only to find the pile of paper money on the ground where the thief had dumped it, as the suitcase with the money was too heavy and slowed him down in running away.

        "text": "@Freakazoidmaxxing Not everything you read on the Internet is true, unless it comes from a peer reviewed paper. \nThe first thing is, yes there were other humanoids find in Europe, that lived here a few million years ago, but these were not much more human than a chimpanzee is today and the have no direct lineage, meaning they probably went extinct again with changing climate. \nSecond the color of their skin is totally irrelevant to ones skeleton and the genetic differences within African populations are usually greater then when comparing one african population and one european population. \nThe neanderthaler seemed to have lived in large parts of eurasia and have also interbreed with us in those areas, as there were no neanderthalers in Africa, everyone with neanderthaler DNA in Africa has ancestors from europe or asia. \nAnyways when pretty well when the modern humans left Africa, there were four major events either through Egypt or the horn of Africa, we can even test exactly which way and what period our mothers line came from, because we only inherit mitochondria from our mother and can trace mitochondrial mutations precisely, as someone who studied biology, I even did that myself (doing the experiments). \nThird it is possible that some very early primates settled in Africa from Asia or Europe but from what we know that's unlikely, the likely chronology is, that humans developed in the African savanna, evolved and settled all over Africa, some left Africa very early and developed into other species like the neanderthaler, then the modern human left Africa roughly some 200-300 thousand years ago and spreads everywhere, a few also coming back ofc.\nBtw. One interesting fact you might not know, from DNA evidence in mummies found in swamps or ice, we know for certain that all humans at least until 4-5 thousand bc. almost all at least until 2000 bc. were \"black\" /far dark skin, light skin color is a mutation that happened two times, once in Asia a bit earlier and later in Europe.",

Persecution of the LBGTQ+ community has become especially prevalent in the country unfortunately. I’m half Polish myself (Glowaski), and it’s very disappointing to witness Poland backsliding like this. They were such a beacon of hope, democratic values, and people-power during the final years of the Cold War. The Solidarity Movement was a huge inspiration in shaping my own political beliefs, and now it’s legacy is being spat on. I sincerely hope that Poland Is Not Yet Lost. ✌🏻🇺🇸🇵🇱",

It hurts me greatly to know that I had ancestors who hurt so many people whether it was native americans, black folks or Asian folks. Whomever it is I feel awful. We have a brutal past and I know that what the rest of the world sees is a nation of people who are, at least at this moment in time, fracturing the nation.  I speak for all the sane, calm and collected people of my home when I say we don’t condone the actions of our ancestors. We are sickened and hurt by the bloody and violent history of our home but there are some of my generation who want to burry our history and erase it and there are many many others who disagree. I myself own a confederate flag and its not because I condone their stance, quite the opposite. I keep it as a reminder that this was one event in history that shaped my home into what it is and without it we may not be what we are today.  This song speaks to me like this, it says to me that each country has a dark side of its history like it or not. That we have all fought bloody and brutal battles. Some that were pointless and others that were very much needed. My nations history is full of ups and downs. By a lot of the world America is seen as a bully of smaller countries, bossing them around and putting rules in place for them even though they are their own country. The way we see it is we have to be that big brother figure, putting rules in place to try to keep some countries from harming others. Sadly we haven’t done much to Russia for their attacks on Ukraine though. But I want to say this, To anyone who believes my country has wronged you or those who have been hurt by us I’m sorry. I hope y’all can forgive us for our wrong doings and that we can move forward from our past mistakes. I want to say this, my countries leaders a lot of times do not represent what the average person stands for. I wish to make amends with everyone in the world and I dream of a day where we all can grow closer as allies and friends. I know it sounds cheesy or cliche, especially over a song but I mean everything I’ve said. I hope one day in my lifetime that I can see more countries forgive and move forward from what our ancestors did",

On the other hand the recent war and russia being... well, everything I have been warned of in the storys my grandparents told me... I felt the urge to go back and help. Halp in any way I can, help the people and if they would DARE to step on polish soil... I don't know, I honestly think I might just go back then. Go and protect Poland like my Grandfather did when he joined the Armia Krajowa, 80 years ago. At the same time a am insanely proud of 'my people' in Poland. I'm not even sure I'm allowed to feel that way (which is ridiculous) but I still feel a very strong connection to the history of my family and Poland and yes - am proud of it. At the same time I can be proud of german aspects of my personality without the guilt a 'germanic' German feels. My family was on the other side, we fought against the Nazis... but if I cherish being orderly and being good at execution of rigid protocols (when you work in science this is a good thing) don't I cherish something I learned from a people who went way, WAY too far and lost their humanity for a while there? Is that even a good thing then...?  \nNational identity and the love and/or hate one might have for their home nation is a complicated thing.",

The very characteristics, goals, and beliefs that define fascism as an ideology, are completely antithetical to the beliefs, and goals that define what are defined as left-wing ideologies. The left can manifest itself by authoritarian means similar to fascism yes, but that’s something any political ideology, or government can be susceptible to. Right, center, or left. It just muddies the waters and makes discourse that much harder when we start swapping definitions of words back and forth. Just my opinion 🤷‍♂️",

This is entirely about wanting to be proud of germany's long and very deep history, but also condemning commiting some of the very worst acts that humanity inflicts upon each other. The perspective of other countries is irrelevant here, this is to germans, from a german band born out of the communist controlled east germany.",

The broader point of whether these depictions should be allowed is really contentious and might just be cultural, Americans are more individualistic and tend to think censorship doesn't even exist in our country. I'm definitely not one of those \"heritage\" weirdos, rather I think it's important to look at your country's past very honestly and consider the implications. American history is defined by racism, there's no way around that fact, but what does that mean for people of color living here?",

I, for instance, would've been killed at birth in Sparta,but done well in Athens. And, killing gays doesn't really have much to do with spreading genes, just like killing disabled ppl.

That's very good in my opinion but it also develops the feeling described in this video. I developed my own solution over time. I am proud of my country for many things after 1945 and also (not quite so many but also some things) before 1933. Tbh Germany before 1933 haven't had a particularly worse history then other big nations (they were rather \"way less harmful\" in comparison to the US, the UK, France, Spain, the Netherlands or Portugal). And I think many Germans should develop a similar feeling to, still say that this 12 years were one of the worst of any nation at any time and try everything to make sure the victims are honored and that it never happens again, but also don't exaggerate that 2000years of history were bad and so much worse than that of any other country only because of 12 years. That doesn't mean that besides that German history was free from attrocities but as I sad it was way less harmful than the history of many other western nations.",

Which is why I said every country should have media like this. \n\nI live in the UK and this country has been responsible for so much horrendous shit but it’s completely waved away by pointing at places like Germany ect. which only leads to a demonisation of other people and a false narrative that we’ve never done anything wrong.

        "text": "@samgreen5517 I know it's like two months later but whatever. My interpretation of that is that it's a comment on the plight of the masses in mediaeval Germany. This period, together with the early modern period (up until ca. the Thirty Year's War, which is thought of as a kind of \"breaking point\" in German history), is often taught from a very elitist perspective where we learn a lot about the respective Holy Roman Emperors, their struggles with the Pope, etc. but relatively little about the daily life of the peasants and craftsmen who made that stuff possible. So my personal suspicion is that the red box represents the people living under the thumb of local princes, counts etc as well as the Church, who would keep them quiet for their own benefit and demand money to forgive their sins (one of the commonly mentioned reasons why people like Luther broke with the Catholic Church) as well as have major worldly holdings in mediaeval Germany. There were frequent uprisings by peasants in the early modern period as well, which were often analysed as early revolutionaries by left-wing thinkers; they were mostly just chaotic, anarchic revolts but could often be very bloody. The people in the box are the ordinary people upholding and enabling the power of the Church to \"feast\" on Germania; although they don't do so by choice (hence the box). The red light probably mostly is there to enhance the atmosphere of panic and craziness, although it may also symbolise the blood that has been shed in peasant revolts and executions, as well as draw a line to the communist interpretations of these events.",

Jesus was a Jew, many countries hitler hated where chatolic, the chatolics helped the disabled and poor, which the nazies hated. But hitler also realised that the chatolic germans where many and very patriotic, so he didn't want to alienate them. The treathy with the pope basicly guaranteed at that time that the chatolics wouldn't be discriminated against, which was a legit concern, in exchange of that the Church would distance itself from politics and tolerate the nazi party. But many chatolic priest still weren't cooperative and they vehemently and sometimes publicly went against the regime.",

Have you read Nietzsche?\nThis idea, of course, is best picked up by germans, because of such works as Goethe's Faust. An eternal search and devotion for knowledge and learning. A tradition, that always kept Europe at the forefront of invention and science. The unwavering spirit and thirst of an expanding mind.\nYou probably took it as the Hollywood adaption of \"perfect race\". Which is absolute non-sense. There is tables and writings of Germany recognizing 5 races, from european stock, as being compatible and even living in Germany. The nordic look was simply the look Germany respected most, because it's the germanic people's look.\n\n\"Wer hoch steigt, der wird tief fallen\"\nYou completely miss that they actually \"rose up\" from having fallen - they faced hyperinflation, complete degeneracy and communist revolution. They pulled through by collectively voting for a better future, and it was improved soon after.\nYou already face the problems Germany faced back then, right now. The difference being: You are part of the problem.\nThere is irony in your words though: You think Germany was already \"way above all else\" (meaning it was good) and it only can downhill and get worse. Contradicting your own worldview, by being way too stupid to even understand what you actually think; Either that, or: You are suicidal and welcome the complete destruction of Germany.\n\nDeutschland, Deutschland, über \"allen\" is also altered. \"Alles\" is the original. Again, non-sensical lyrics, because they rhyme. \"Über Alles\" meant: \"Above all problems\", not \"Above all nations\". The devotion, i.e. Übermensch idea, to struggle throughout one's life to improve the nation and the people, by leading as an example.\nWhich is, ironically, personified in Hitler himself: A non-smoker, non-drinker vegetarian, that preached what he lived. Compared to leaders like Stalin and Eisenhower (both decorated, although they never served a day in the military) Hitler only wore one medal: The Iron Cross, which he earned in war. Manifested in \"Mein Kampf\" (my struggle)\nIt has NOTHING to do with \"rising above\" \"others\" (i.e. people), at all.\nI would argue sending 42 peace offerings to Britain, before and during the war, is humble.\n\nAt least the rest of Europe is waking up. I can tell you are asleep in your own coom-consoom-paradise - either that or you are simply a J.",

They can never unconditionally love their own country because of all the blood in our past.\n\nThe point of the song and the video is that it's important to remember it all, the good and bad stuff, instead of trying to brush aside the bad stuff and only focus on the good stuff.\n\nYes, our ancestors achieved a lot of things, but they also committed some horrible atrocities. Both are equally true. Germany is neither completely good nor completely bad.\n\nUltimately, the point of the song is a rejection of blind nationalism because that's always based on a rose-tinted view of any given country's history.",

I do understand that it's some kind of an inner joke in response to accusations made by russians but still it makes my stomach hurt. And it's not because I'm of jewish heritage(not saying \"Jewish\" inherently as it has to do with the religion and I'm an atheist 😊) or live in Israel nowadays but in utter disgrace of these kinds of \"jokes\". Still better than what russians on Ukrainian soil are tho😅",

Anglo-Saxons are the moral heart of a nation that brought the world the mother of parliaments, common law, innocent until proven guilty, and the rights of man and equality to the world. The lifespan of the British Empire encompasses many common errors of empires but also the story of redemption, in ways that no other empire achieved or attempted, such as the great crusade against world slavery. That mistakes were made is not only accepted but drilled into kids heads in Britain. However, while mistakes were made, we marched uphill and expended ourselves conquering a greater evil, twice. If anything, not enough is taught in Britain about our great and good achievements. Why? Because the Cold War never ended, marxist propaganda exists in our television and educational establishment to demoralise and disunite the British, fueled by those jealous of our achievements, prominence and how we dismantled the Empire largely peacefully, with almost ALL former colonies, protectorates and dependencies voluntarily CHOOSING to join the commonwealth. Educate yourselves. We are not just the wrongs of our past, but the lived and proven evidence that we learned from it. We are here, now. We evolved. You cannot pin us to one page in the past.",

Every VE Day on May 8th it's the same now.  The UK never used to mark that day and then in 2020 it replaced the May Day bank holiday with one the following weekend with 'socially distanced' drunken street parties. \n\nMay Day is based on Beltane and then became International Workers' Day with trade union rallies and marches on the day or the following Saturday.  It was first made a bank holiday by a Labour Government in 1978.\n\nThe Nazis take much of their influences from the UK.  Winston Churchill was the first to use concentration camps.  Hitler Youth was inspired by photos of pupils at the top private boarding schools which are Rugby, Eton and Harrow.",

I can sorta see where the shock elements in the hard aesthetic would remind you of that, but they're distinctly counter-culture and counter-authority and have a very clear disdain for fascism. They also have zero issue portraying minorities such as POC or LGBT+ individuals in an empowered and positive light in their music\n\n\nWhy can't the controversy be more centred around how damn filthy they are sometimes lmao.

And there's also the fact that the Nazis destroyed decades of medical and technical knowledge, namely the institut für sexualwissenschaft, which had by far the most advanced research into medical science relating to sex and trans people's medical care. In fact, the institute already had done several different womb transplants for trans women and pioneered trans people's rights - at least until the Nazis murdered them and burned the institute to the ground.",

They made a blatant political statement on their tours when protesting anti-homosexuality laws\n\n\"Paying dues\" is a really disingenuous way of interpreting clear political actions as being apolitical. Why would they \"pay dues\" in the first place if it wasn't something they believed in? No one forced them to protest anti-homosexuality laws in Russia, and it straight up put them under fire from multiple organisations, including the government of an entire country, yet they did so anyway. Deutschland was incredibly political and deeply personal. This isn't \"paying dues\", this is expressing their own personal feelings about the country they love through art, a medium that specifically allows you to do so. \n\nI can't see why you'd want to detach any political nature from their artform so strongly unless you disagree with it in some way, and dont' want to believe the art you're enjoying supports it.",

As a german, you can only let these feelings come out at sport events :)\nIt's complicated and irritating. \nI think, we all could be proud of this nation, maybe it comes with age.\nWe should never forget the brutal and terrifying horror of the 'Third Reich' ! But we must somehow find a way, to let the good things Germany did, invented and so on be a bigger part of our souls. We also should celebrate, that Germany has become one of the most tolerant, open-minded and open-hearted societies in the world.\n\nI'm thankful for my birth in a free, secure and open country. \nDon't forget, all people are part of the human family ! \n\nBest wishes to you from a little town nearly in the middle of good old Germany !  🇪🇺🇪🇺❤🇩🇪🇩🇪❤🇷🇺🇷🇺❤🇺🇦🇺🇦❤🇺🇳🇺🇳❤🏳‍🌈🏳‍🌈❤🕊🕊❤☮☮❤",

        "text": "@deinvater797 A definition of \"a nazi\" would encompass quite a bit more than a three paragraph rant, since it's a fairly complex subject. A nazi is a particular kind of fascist, differing from other flavours in how the new class distinctions are to be drawn. Specifically they're white supremacists and anti-semites.\n\n\nI don't think Jared Taylor is a nazi, since he's not particularly anti-semitic. He's most certainly a fascist, though.\n\n\nI have no headcount of how many nazis there are in the US, Europe or worldwide. Enough, apparently that they can openly congregate, chant Blut und Boden and wave the nazi flag.\n\n\nISIS fighters aren't nazis. Their fascism is of a theological nature (that is, class distinction is based on religious and only remotely ethnic grounds).\n\n\nRegarding Trump supporters, that's an odd question. Certainly most of them aren't nazis, I would hope. The aforementioned kind chanting nazi slogans and waving nazi flags probably are. Ironically, the Trump administration isn't really compatible with Nazism, since the racial currents are a bit of a fluke and motivations are nearly entirely economic. Trump doesn't have any issue employing illegal immigrants after all. The rhetoric is purely aimed at voters, not due to personal or administrative conviction.\n\n\nIn regards to a definition of fascism, refer to Umberto Eco's Ur-Fascism or The 14 characteristics of Fascism by Lawrence Britt for a cursory glance. Again, not all fascists are nazis, but all nazis are fascist. And the subject fills books, so you'll not just get \"a definition\" you can settle with.\n\n\nAnd yes, punch all the fascists. Including nazis, the red-fash Stalinists and ISIS fighters.",

ESPECIALLY before during and after the revolutionary action that brought it into reality. \nthis is not a socialist only thing. its caused primarily by perceived threat from outside forces. but relaxes in time, for better or worse, nations will liberalize, reform. \nand it is not inherently a bad (or good) thing that people are killed. as good and bad do not exist. what does exist, is the effort to reduce harm, and being willing or unwilling to cause harm in order to reduce harm to a greater number of people. sadly, this is how the world is. and sometimes pragmatic action causes suffering, either stand in our way, and more harm is done to us as one people, or try to talk to us, work with us, and maybe we can convince you to not resist, and you might be happier.  you worry socialism causes famines or some shit? join the workers party and make damn sure preparations are put in place, jsut because a state is repressive does not mean you cannot make your case either.. how do you think people rose through the ranks of those states that supposedly slaughtered all opposition? they made their case, and were given position out of merit. dont be afraid. be active and be armed. (remember socialists support the right to be armed for self and workplace defense? you wont be abused by a socialist state if you react damn swiftly to any mention of liberalizing gun ownership. you vote with your gun on your back in the voting booth, you make your voice heard while holding your rifle. and you make sure people know your rifle is loaded. can we come to a greater understanding knowing this now?\n\nstalins family didnt get high government positions and nepotism was to my knowledge commonly punished or atleast extremely scrutinized in the USSR. it could be possible that lots of court records could corroborate that but ill be honest im not getting a source for that claim. itd be WORK. lmao.\n\nyou think when i was younger i didnt \"fear the others?\" the only peopel we should be fearing and hating, are fascists and conservatives. but knowing they may have good intentions isnt enough, because they mix their hatred or misunderstanding of and want forced conformity for, PEOPLE THEMSELVES(wow what a mouthful) into their minds which makes us simply incompatible. so it a fight that must be fought. \n\n\ni guess to extremely summarize things, the world is a wheel and were pushing and pulling at each other. a decent amount of us have good intentions. but the wheel must move on. resisting is only going to harm us, its better to just come to an understanding and let people liberate themselves.",

I do think it´s fine to have national pride. I have such pride myself, but it becomes dificult if people do not understand the source for that pride. \nThere are countries with history and then there is Germany. I think no country has been the fokal point of world history just like Germany. In it´s darkest hours it showed the world just how dark and evil humanity can be but it also shows in it´s history after WW2 how a nation can redefine itself. Germany today, maybe more than any major world leader (even USA after 2016) is maybe the quintessential democratic and liberal country. When in all western democracys the far right made a comeback, Germany manages to keep their own right wing at bay. When the world turned a blind eye to the migrants in 2015 germany was the one western country that reached out in big numbers. Germany has it´s own problems and even though we keep our far right nationalist at bay, their presence is worrying, but we know our history, the good the bad and the ugly and take that and move forward with it in mind. We do not rewrite it or try to reframe it into something more pleasant to look at.

        "text": "​@alexrenxa7700 well if you are proud of what your country has reached and you still ackknowledge its faults then you're a patriot which often is used in place of 'nationalist' but is the opposite in it's true meaning. A nationalist doesn't see any flaws or undesirable developments, on the contrary a patriot not only sees them but he tries to solve them. Also he does this in a way which serves everone in his country and not only those who follow his ideology while everyone other suffers from it.\nNot everyone will share this opinion, but I do not care because the understanding of the terms 'nationalist' and 'patriot' is clearly defined.\nA similar misunderstanding exists, for example, with the expressions 'to know' and 'believe to know / believe'. As soon as you believe, assume, suspect or consider something to be very likely, you automatically say that you just don't know.\nBut in general, 'believe' is far too often seen as a weakened form of 'knowing'. However, there are only two options, namely to know or not to know, which just includes 'believing' (I don't know, but I believe ...).",

Didnt matter if it was a Communist, Facist or Centrist Democrat. All looked at their country, loved it to death, but realized how things are now are bad and wrong and have to change.\n\nBeing a Communist in early 20th century doesnt mean destroying, hating your nation, but reshaping and rebuilding it from a old to new, better form. And thats what made Nationalists, Nationalists and why Nationalist movements spread Europe-wide in such a short time. Because everyone loved their culture and regions, they had different views on how to run said beloved country. That was is so different from todays politics. Back then they all believed in their great country that was just currently under wrong management and some wanted Revolutions, some wanted moderate change and some wanted to return to old teachings. But they were all united in the Love and Patriotism for their country. They all accepted the good and bad of their past, pretty much. Not everyone ofcourse. There will always be nutjobs only seeing great and good, not acknowledging the bad.",

If you think it's disrespectful, I would start by pointing out that the original comment is from two years ago. It's not like this was the first or only reaction to someone sharing a personal anecdote. I understand it feels icky to see this under a post by a Jewish person sharing their family's story about German aggression and the shoa. I also understand someone else noticing the Israeli part of the post and going but wait, Israel is an aggressor committing crimes. It seems tasteless, but it's true. It does not negate OP's suffering on one social axis, that of being Jewish. What do you think?",

A visit to a concentration camp is in most parts of Germany part of the curriculum. There are memorials to the victims of the holocaust all over Germany (most prominently the one in Berlin).\nThere are stumbling stones marking the houses where Jews have lived before they were murdered. The German government feels a responsibility for the atrocities to this day and made clear that it wouldn't move its position of unquestioning support for Israel.\n\nGermans have a hard time with just being proud of their country patriotism always has the reek of nationalism following it.\nThe ambivalence Rammstein describes of wanting to hate and love Germany is not new. \nThe german satirist Jan Böhmermann made a song a few years before where he praises Germany and at the same time declares himselft to be proud not to be proud[to be german] ( youtube link: /watch?v=HMQkV5cTuoY )",

The Marshall Plan (and the US military presence) greatly increased US influence in western Europe. I guess not many Germans would speak English if the war had ended in a Stalemate. (I don't want to imagine what would have happened if Hitler had won.)\n\n\nWhether that US influence is a good or a bad thing depends on your point of view. I think it's a pretty good outcome, if you compare the current peace and harmony with Europe's history. Chilling it under the extended sphere of influence of the US imperium is nice. (But their freedom treatment for those who don't want to isn't.)\n\n\nDon't know whether Francisco Serra is really thinking about this, or just blurting out twisted ideas. Likely the latter, but I'm bored and need to waste some time :)\n\nPS: This is my personal opinion. You are free to disagree.",

It's incredibly telling how you felt the need to mention the ethnicity of your (probably made up) friend because them being Jewish would shield you from accusations of racism, but you intentionally avoided mentioning that your taxi driver was of North African descent, because that would lend credibility to the notion that you were a racist.\n\nIt's pretty obvious what actually happened there: You were in a taxi, you mentioned loving Munich to the driver, the driver responded that he didn't like Munich because there are too many racists/Nazis there (because Munich is pretty infamous in Germany for having a higher than average number of racists and Neo-Nazis) and in the retelling now you've made up a friend who is conveniently Jewish and changed the claim from the taxi driver from 'too many nazis' to 'everyone there is a nazi'. \n\nAnd it's fucking pathetic.",

If someone calls you a Nazi, they don't say that you are a literal member  of the NSDAP, they mean that you are a Neo-Nazi. \nAnd interstingly enough, I definitely have more right-wing Kommilitonen than I'd expected. I always though philosophy is a more leftist class (since Morals and ethics arent really the first thing I think of when I think about right-winged people). I'd say around 1/5 are centric-right to right-winged. It's hard to tell because some are more vocal about it than others. Like we have some Querdenker in our groups that spread right-wing conspiracy theories, but also people who \"just\" strongly oppose the left and are against refugees/gay rights. I had a class on historical responsibility (we read Adornos \"Erziehung nach Auschwitz) and that's where I met most vocal right-winged people, which makes sense since this is a topic that related to their political views the most. Our professor called some people out for saying extreme stuff, and they'd always get defensive or mad when getting called \"right-winged\". Same when she called the AfD right-winged (and some AfD politicians Nazis). We had a student who admitted that he voted for the AfD but that the AfD is not right-winged.",

That is total fallacy when people imply that it does.",

        "text": "​@MushroomCloudConfetti You might be surprised to hear that a lot of us Americans are not very patriotic. The American patriot stereotype only accounts for about half of the nation, mostly on the politically right side. You'll occasionally hear a pundit on the right warning of globalization. The politically left side is more prone to be critical of the country, feeling greater guilt for its failures and wanting to learn from other cultures. This is a very broad generalization, though. The country is so big and the culture so self-absorbed that many Americans on both sides of the political spectrum are unconcerned with the rest of the world and almost oblivious to it. The other countries of the world rarely have any noticeable influence on the average US citizen's life since our big corporations produce almost everything we see, so it's easy to feel like the rest of the world is irrelevant. I married an immigrant partly because he has an outsider's view of the US, providing me a lot of much-needed perspective that I probably wouldn't have gotten from another American.",

They think that by removing the statues they are removing the negative feelings from that time period. Sadly, I believe that it is only going to cause more problems. Unlike Germany, it seems that people want to forget our painful past by erasing it. This is not what will happen. What people don't understand is that I have friends who had family members still alive who had been slaves when they were born in the 1970s. So the truth is slavery isn't that far away from current times. Yes, it was a very dark time in our countries history but we shouldn't forget it just because it is ugly. The way blacks were treated back then should never happen again. The only way to do this is by not forgetting our past. \n\nWe are living through some very dark and uncertain times right now. We are currently dealing with the pandemic, outrage over blatant racism, police brutality, and an uncertain economic environment. I believe like many we are scared. People all over the world are feeling this as well. I pray that we as a people can be united and hopefully learn from this pandemic. \n\nAs for the song it is wonderful, scare, and sad all at the same time. I can see that they are showing the world their country including all the ugly bits that most others would want to hide from the rest of the world. It takes a strong person to be able to look inward and see the worst parts of themselves. I believe they are doing this for Germany. \n\nI hope that you understand how I related this song to the current events here in my home state of Virginia, USA.",

Rammstein want to love their country and embrace their national identity as Germans, but the country has gone down so many different dark roads that they have a largely love/hate relationship with Germany.\n\n\nThe concentration camps scene in particular shows the band members as the victims, rather than the perpetrators, and the camera's focus on Till singing as one of said victims illustrates who they're sympathising with.\n\n\nNot to mention the end of the second verse being \"Deutschland, Deutschland, Uber Allen/Germany, Germany Above All\" (please pardon my terrible spelling) is delivered by a concentration camp inmate, turning back to the camera. This to me is a clear display of irony, openly mocking the fascist use of German Nationalism to kill religious and ethnic minorities within such a supposedly amazing nation.",

        "text": "@karimshebeika8010 The five mark coins were silver.  Hyperinflation only affects fiat currency, silver and gold doesn't suffer hyperinflation.  Whatever an ounce of silver will get you today is ROUGHLY comparable to what it will get you a year from now.  To put it into context, today, silver is up 21% for the year, but only up 0.5% over five years.  So it's beat inflation quite a bit this year, and has lost over inflation over five years, but on average, it's comparable.  Right now, however, the Venezuelan Bolivar lost 90% of its value in about 3-4 months, after losing 90% of its previous value in 3 months, after losing 90% of its previous value in 4 months, after losing 90% of its previous value in 6 months, etc. etc.\n\n\nAdd to that, in these circumstances, banks themselves aren't stable, and you can find a highly valuable life savings reduced to the value it would cost to buy a lunch, and then not even be able to withdraw it.  This was before countries had their own versions of the US\"s FDIC.  That's why people in countries with distressed currencies with hyperinflation don't trust banks, often well past that era.  When you live with a hyperinflated currency, the cost of everything goes up, and people often have to be given leave from work several times a day to get basic necessities before the prices go up again.  Productivity is shot, consumer confidence is shot, and the value of work is shot.\n\n\nThat Venzuela example is a tame version of why his grandmother kept silver 5 Mark coins under her mattress.  Those retained their value, as silver was always actually worth something, unlike a wheelbarrow of hyperinflated currency.",

It was the last European country to come together as a nation state, in that sense. Everyone else got their shit sorted way sooner. The UK even got the prize for spearheading democracy.\nFun fact, German founding/unification at that time was also a major reason why all the other great powers were itching for a fight. France especially feared a strong German neighbour. And Germany, in its own right, feared losing out on overseas colonies.\nAnother fun fact – at its founding and before WW1, Germany had a larger economy than the US. That looks much different now after everyone in Europe was fighting for so long while Americans pretty much got to sit it out and develop freely. So, now they're far at the top.\n\"Wer hoch steigt der wird tief fallen.\"",

I feel I know a lot about the US and the UK because of media, but very little about Germany which has had such profound influence on so many things.\n\nLike I walk around in Oslo, Norway where I live in the beautiful old neighborhoods from the 1800s and it is only in the last few years I came to learn that the style was all influenced from Germany. That they bought whole building sections from Germany. When visiting Germany I see how so much in Scandinavia has this German influence and connection we never even hear about.\n\nBerlin is very fascinating to visit I think, because you see the legacy of WWII as well as the cold war and the divided city.

Well because it was a sumbering super power for so long. The only thing that stood in the way of becoming a world leading power were the Germans themselves. It was also situated between the super powers of France, Britain, Austria and Russia, creating a balance of power for hundreds of years, until Germany united and suddenly became a superpower in itself.",

As someone who learned German as a foreign language in high school, Rammstein were pivotal in keeping my interest in German culture and literature alive, as all of their songs have a plethora of more or less cryptic references to Goethe (in \"Dalai Lama\"), Feuerbach, (in \"Mein Teil\"),  Brecht (in \"Haifisch\") and so on. \n\nProbably wouldn't have had the same drive to learn and understand the language without them. I love how they create this double layer for the audience  - a \"superficial\" layer of interpretation that is just gory, shocking and weird, and a \"deeper\" one that is dense with poetry and commentary and kind of hidden behind a linguistic/cultural barrier. \n\nI sincerely believe Rammstein actually intended to spark a controversy. They knew some people would have taken the imagery at face value without making an intepretive effort. It's almost as if the shocking imagery was meant to cause a \"Verfremdungseffekt\" and force the audience to think deeper.\n\nCheers from Italy, a country which hasn't problematized its past nearly as much as Germany did, unfortunately.",

When the song was written, there was no single German state, but German states, connected by their language, which were all but unified. The Holy Roman Empire had just crumbled under Napoleon's conquests. The lyrics of the song call for the German states to cease their petty quarrels and unify as a single nation for all German people. They should put the still-to-be-made German state \"above all\" other agendas. It is not, and never was, intended to mean to put Germany above all other nations.",

Die wichtigste Frage ist doch, warum hat Deutschland sein Land verloren, wenn im Ersten Weltkrieg alle Nationen Kriege führen wollten, warum hat man nicht Frankreich ein Stück Land weggenommen? Das war alles so politisch provoziert worden, die Franzosen und die Briten und die Amerikaner hassen Deutsche, sie wollten nach dem Ersten Weltkrieg den Samen für einen neuen Krieg setzen. Und vor dem Ersten Weltkrieg gab es kein Deutschland, aber die ständigen Angriffe von Frankreich haben dazu geführt, dass Deutschland gegründet wurde, also wer hat jetzt den Samen der Gewalt eingepflanzt?\n\nWar es Deutschland gegen die ganze Welt, oder Deutschland gegen das britische Imperium und das französische Weltreich? Beide Imperien haben die ganze Welt beherrscht. Die Deutschen haben viele tausend Jahre lang friedlich gelebt. Es gab nie ein Deutschland. Wir Deutschen brauchen keine aggressiven Nachbarn, wie Frankreich und England, die uns ständig in Kriege hinein treiben, wie jetzt gegen Russland.",

    "text": "One thing that I want to add to your interpretation about Germania being a black woman is that Germany is usually referenced as the fatherland. This is different to most other cultures that call them the motherland (or some other femenine variation). So to turn that upside down is immense. She births a litter of puppies as an Angel. What that means is anybody's guess, but it definitely flys in the face of a militaristic, masculine fatherland. Also when Germania is in the officer uniform of the Third Reich, that Shes blinded. That the Nazi party has blinded (her *Left* eye no less) and scarred her to come along (not something a nationalist would portray).\n\nAfter watching it and not understanding the words, i wouldn't have guessed it was right leaning even. But i love your insight arrows!\n\nKeep up the good work and I hope to see another video soon",

Which I of course disagree on on two fronts: a) it's not like you'd use the word 'vateland' / 'motherland' only refering to Germany / england, but to your place of origin in general, wherever that is, as somebody pointed out before. And secondly I pointed out 'patria' because that's another word in latin and most roman languages, which also comes from 'vater' ... In that sense the word isn't a special case either.

        "text": "Portraying Germania as female is not \"immense\" at all. She has been protrayed as female since 1848 and is a traditionally female character. You also seem to imply that the term \"fatherland\" is somehow bad... whether a language features \"fatherland\" or \"motherland\" is defined by a long linguistic history, not by their views on men and women. Germanic languages evolved to use fatherland (vaterland, vaderland, etc. is a theme in Germanic languages), some others have motherland like the Slavic languages, etc. It has no meaning and also stems from a time before we (Germanic peoples, that is) had a strict Christian patriarchy installed and had a more egalitarian view of women in pagan times (note: they weren't perfect societies of course, but they were nowhere near as patriarchal as the later Christian societies and women were a lot more prominent in the religion, culture and they were more flexible when it came to traditional roles). You can compare this to the outrage I sometimes see over the term \"mankind\" in English, even though linguistically mankind doesn't refer to men at all. Linguistically, man and woman started out as wereman and woman, with man referring to both. Wereman evolved to drop the \"were\", but mankind stayed the same. To compare, in Germanic languages it's man/frau/mensch, man/vrouw/mens etc. etc., you see the three distinct terms. More often than not, linguistics is just linguistics with no bad intentions behind them.",

In Northern European countries the term fatherland is very common and it's used in the Nordics as well so it's not like most of the world uses motherland. In Danish it's the fatherland but the language is the mother's tongue so there is a historical duality there. And I think in this case given that personifications of countries often were women and specifically Germania was a woman this isn't really weird. Many other countries had similar personifications like Columbia for the US, and Britannia for the UK. The difference just is that those two haven't really survived and Uncle Sam has become the personification of the US instead with Mother Russia sorta being the only one to stick around. And of course quite a few countries never really had a personification in that sense.\n\n\nGood catch on the thing with the eye and scaring though, that's actually genuinely super clever and I hadn't thought about that myself.",

There was no attempt in British, or US history to deliberately exterminate the entirety of the Meso-American Race. The closest thing to that is Spain, and Portugal's \"Blanqueamiento\" policy which incentivised lower class immigrants from Iberia to marry Natives in order to \"Whiten\" them up. (Paraguay even went so far as to make it illegal for people to marry within their own race). This is the origin of the vast majority of Latin America's Mestizo population.",

        "text": "@Quotenwagnerianer The Germans of the time when the \"Lied der Deutschen\" was composed had seen again and again that their tiny nation-states had absolutely no bloody chance at defending against larger, stronger nation's armies, such as at that time most recently, the French. Every other nation-state in Europe held much more political and military power compared to almost any of the tiny nation states of the Holy Roman Empire of Germanic Nations, possibly with the exception of Austria-Hungary, Bavaria, and Prussia. Any neighbor who wanted to could easily take chunks out of the HRE at any time because there was no unified army to defend the states; only the small local armed forces of the local nobles.\n The \"Deutschland, Deutschland über alles\" actually refers to the idea  from the 1848 \"Lied der Deutschen\" / \"Song of the Germans\" of a whole, unified Germany as opposed to seeing yourself as a Badenser, Swabian, Bavarian, Frankonian, Hannoveranian, Bremerian, Schleswiger, Holsteiner, Rhinelander, Prussian, Silesian, Pommeraninan, yada-yada-yada, you get the drift. The HRE's previous tiny noble fiefdoms looked across their borders and saw strong, powerful nation states pop up everywhere around them, and were very afraid for their saftey. The only solution they saw to prevent themselves from being gobbled up in nice bite-sized chunks was to become part of a unified whole nation-state that would defend ALL of its member states.\nTherefore you should not think as a member of one of the dozens, if not hundreds of small, independent tiny baronies, duchies, earldoms, and micro-kingdoms that made up the 'Holy Roman Empire of Germanic Nations', but rather as a person of a unified nation of Germany. The idea of a whole, unified Germany should thus actually be translated much more as \"Germany before the sub-set of states\". That was the basic drive of the time: to finally unify Germany so it might have a chance to defend itsself against its many times more powerful neighbors. Agreed, it does not have the same ring or fluidity to it. That's what cramming such a line into a song does for the context, damn it.\n\n\nSo the \"Deutschland über allen\" is much more the Nazi intent. Obviously (hopefully, I got it immediately) this version means the superiority complex the Nazis had. As such it was, again, obviously a very bitterly-cynical parody of the original lyrics.",

Forgetting the power and compelling value of wonderful art for the sake of nefarrious propaganda is like forgetting history. The sensivity cult is a cancer in our society and incredibly dangerous. It just prohibit knowing the past and the arguments about it and creates only trenches. Nothing should be forgotten, nothing should be taboo and everything should spoken about let it be horrible or painful. Otherwise we are going into a society, where we forgot our violent past and our mistakes, creating opinion bubbles and labelling everybody who wants to think proper and thoroughly as nazi, homophob anti lmtbq, racist etc. and creating an atmosphere where you are either a nazi and revolutionarist or a proper self minde censored individual without questions. That can only lead to end any meaningful quarrels and the evolution of our society.

    "text": "There's another level of analysis you're missing about the song \"Radio\" beyond a simple portrayal of the DDR's state censorship and the ray of hope provided by Western radio broadcasts. The Slovenian Marxist philosopher Slavoj Žižek who is very close to Rammstein's ideological orbit (essentially the house intellectual of the Neue Slowenische Kunst art collective whose musical wing, the band Laibach, is possibly Rammstein's single most important musical and aesthetic influence) has claimed that illicit availability of Western media was actually a helpful safety valve for the old Eastern Bloc regimes in maintaining control for as long as they did, since it directed people's political hopes toward the fantasy of escaping to a utopian society somewhere else, and thereby helped divert their political hopes from the possibility of tangibly changing the society they actually lived in. (Ironically, this also strongly resembles the classic Marxist critique of religion: by goading people into believing that they'll get \"pie in the sky when they die\" in Heaven, the ruling elite tries to dilute the political potency of people's demands for a better life here and now on Earth.)\n\n\nSigns of this critique are clear in at least a few places in the music video for the song \"Radio\". First you have what seems to be a popular street uprising, complete with visual allusions to the iconic \"Liberty Leading the People\" figure from the French Revolution, but then it turns out to just be a consumerist mob descending on an electronics store to loot a bunch of radios; Žižek himself has talked at length about the role of consumerist looting frenzies as a diversion from more substantive political protest, a type of scene also depicted more explicitly and at greater length by the Bosnian leftist band Dubioza Kolektiv in their video for the song \"Himna Generacije\" (\"Hymn for a Generation\"). Then you have the scene where East German riot police show up at the recording studio to break up the band's radio broadcast, but it turns out they're swinging their riot clubs through holograms of the band members, and soon they launch into a choreographed dance routine on the outro chorus; one could interpret this as Western music finally capturing the hearts and minds of even the regime's own hired thugs, but a deeper interpretation is that the regime itself is tolerating and tacitly endorsing the broadcast, and they're only superficially play-acting to trick people into thinking they want to shut it down.\n\n\nThe coup de grâce though is in the last few seconds, where the video cuts from black-and-white to color and the band is shown leaving the studio: the banners flying outside the studio are colored in vintage communist red-and-yellow, but instead of a hammer and sickle, the logo on the banners is the star circle of the present-day EU flag. To me the message here is that on a deeper level, the band isn't really singing about the DDR at all, and much like Žižek often does in his philosophical lectures, they're using the more obvious (especially in hindsight) ideological repression of the Eastern Bloc period as an analogy to help understand the less obvious (especially in the moment) ideological repression of the modern capitalist West. So maybe the song is actually trying to tell us that we shouldn't think of ourselves as so much less ideologically restricted than those poor communist Easterners tuning their radios to Western media as a form of escapism, because maybe our computers and smartphones tuned to social media or Netflix or YouTube are playing the same escapist safety-valve role for us right now today.",

It's difficult to say for sure how deep the Radio vid was meant to go into all that political stuff. I mean, there are people who can explain all the physics and biology and psychology of dancing. And then there are people who just wow us with the dance itself. I'll wait for Rammstein to explain what they meant for the audience to take away from their vid  ;)",

And futuristic Germania giving birth to those dogs closing the circle with the image of West Germany dripping in gold chains holding German Schäferhund. Is that Barbarossa‘s grave orbiting the Earth at the very end? \nI just read Herfried Munkler last summer and there are a lot of specific myths to unpack.

And I kinda respect and admire that.\n\nAs a French, I wish I could say the same about my country, but unfortunately, we have a much more complicated relationship with the dark sides of our past. Whenever we look at our history, our eyes get distracted away by the \"radiant light\" of glorious historical characters and events with all the national myth built around them. And thus, all the bad stuff we did ends up remaining invisible, in the shadow of the more glorious sides. \nAnd whenever you try to talk about the crimes our country did, or whenever to try to bring some nuance to a character important in the national myth, you have hordes of bitter french jumping at your throat, accusing you of all names. They will go on rant about how nowadays all the education and the public discussion is about teaching young french to hate their own country, and that we don't have to keep giving excuses forever. But the truth is that, because of those reactions from a big part of the population, the discussions on the topic are really touchy and always end up being manichean. \nUnlike Germany, we haven't been forced to face our history, because we were part of the \"good guys\" in WW2 and Cold War, so we were kinda protected by the \"morally good\" aura. But really, we are like UK, in the sense that our history is full of very dark moments that are still talked about, and that cause a lot uneasiness in the public discussion.\nPeople will accuse you of not loving your country, but this is when I ask: how can you truly love your country if you haven't faced and accepted its sins before?",

    "text": "*+Three Arrows* What about that \"Germania\" dies and is given a space burial, suggesting that the idea of Germany will die in the future anyway. And that all this nationalism was a weird and troubled concept to begin with. An outsider's fiction (Romans) in the first place; that was nevertheless adopted by the natives that didn't really seem to live up to it (the scene of Germans eating Germania during the middle ages), with sometimes being a uniting force (Germania in battle gear); with the notion of \"Germania\" being fully corrupted during WW2 and the DDR-time; and after being somewhat salvaged the RAF tries to tare it all up; but eventually...she dies when we reach space and earthbound nationality doesn't even register. To me this suggests something like: the only way we can finally be free of all the negativity it has, is once it just dies; because it can always be corrupted, always held hostage; it can change, but it's always a tool that's never just 'good'.",

Iceland - with a population the size of a regional hub city - had its fair share of warfare (both raiding and being raided) and violent religious and political struggles. It's capitalised heavily on its strategic military location to get US support from WW2 on. For instance, it received the most per capita funds from the Marshall plan, despite having been neutral and largely untouched in WW2. It also used its importance to the US to force the UK fishing fleet to abandon its traditional fishing grounds. \nIncidentally, Iceland is one of the very few European countries that supported the US's invasion of Iraq (including sending forces).",

    "text": "Very good analysis and one I adhere to wholehartedly. \n\n\nI must say Rammstein's 'synopsis' of Germany's history  is admirably self-critical and is - at least in my eyes - not at all offensive. I really detest the reflex by some to protest against this depiction without even understanding (or trying to understand) what they see or what the message is. I know, this may sound very shallow with the recent events in Halle in mind, but everyone with a right mind can see that Rammstein's message is pretty simple: the old sentiments are never far away, beware. And as you rightfuly state: those sentiments were never and still are not unique to Germany. \nBeing Dutch I have got to say, that there's no nation that I know of that has shown such devotion to dealing with the dark pages of its history. Most other nations still glorify their past, even when it consists of conquest, supression and exploitation (colonialism, anyone?). The way I perceive our German neighbours is with respect. Of course there are biggots in Germany like anywhere else. But the mainstay of German people are decent, polite (\"höfflich\"), hard working, honest and sympathetic men and women. I hope that anyone who sees Rammstein's video would stay away from the reflex-like reaction and instead becomes interested in Germany, its rich culture, history and beautiful language (yes, of course, wenn not pronounciated like a Gestapo-officer). It saddens me to see that so many never have read (or heard about) Erich Kästner, Hermann Hesse, Goethe, Lessing (\"Nathan der Weise!!!\") or Rilke. If the only way we can see Germany is through a lense of the 2nd Worldwar, we fail ourselves. So from the Netherlands: a heartfelt compliment both on this video, as on Rammstein and present day Germany. Zum Wohl.",

And we certainly aren't willing to look at where we went wrong, and we have gone wrong in so many ways. It's the most frustrating aspect of this era, we've had these tragedies before, so they now play out as bitterly unfunny farces. Great analysis of the video btw and some interesting questions raised and tidbits of German history.\n\n\nETA: Tying into your point about why should skin-color effect whether someone is considered German or not, I did some googling and noted the fact that Ruby Commey is not only German but was born in Berlin, i.e. not an immigrant. Yet if we use the AfD's standard of how someone \"looks\" to decide who is German and who's an \"immigrant,\" this woman who has lived her entire life in Germany and by all standards lives a life much like other German women of her class and is a respected member of the Berlin Theater is somehow not a \"real\" German because she's black.

They do live in a bubble and have sank so deep into cognitive dissonance that they may never escape. Every single statistic in every single western country that have opened the floodgates to illegal migrants posing as refugees have shown nothing but negative effects on society.

This video discusses wether the video is controversial or not, which it kinda isn't, but a full analysis of what it actually tries to say isn't complete without an analysis of the fantasy and futuristic elements as well.\n\nMy overall analysis of the video would be that it's a critique of the continual use of the national image to serve various elites, a germania that's continually reinvented, resurrected, abused and held hostage, but where the common denominator is the violence against the people of germany (minorities, workers, individuals) and its collapse in violence. Then its history is re-analysed, re-invented, whitewashed and re-used. The wealthy men walking away from the zeppelin as it explodes, then walking ahead of Germania as dogs and then Germania giving birth to Leonberger puppies IMHO reinforces this Destruction, Reinvention, Whitewashing, Re-use storytelling, as does the continual use of red lasers which are omni-present but when functionally used they're used as scanners in some scenes, and destructive beams in others.\n\nThe use of a black actress (and german citizen) as Germania is both to distance itself from right-wing ideas of what germany is, but also due to aesthetics. Her very dark skin colour is used in combination with a Gold&Red or White&Red colourscheme, representing the Black/White/Red and Black/Gold/Red colourscheme of the german flag.",

    "text": "The battle at Teutoburg forest and the story of Armenius doesn't actually go like that. He was a Germanic guy educated and brought up in Rome as a hostage, but he was also a Roman officer commanding the Germanic auxiliaries in Germania Magna. Even though Germania Magna was still not a pacified and integrated province, it was roaming with Roman soldiers and the legions annihilated at Teutoburg forest were actually moving from their summer camp near the river Wesser to their winter camp closer to the river Rhine where Roman influence was much stronger and they were much better protected from attack by the local unsubjugated tribes. So, while Varus, the commander of the legions soon to be annihilated was travelling with his forces toward West, his trusted subcommander, scout and guide Armenius with his Germanic forces was present and riding with the rest of the Roman force. Due to his influence and trust with Varus, he was able to convince him in the existence of a rebellion in the region that required Varus's immediate response, convincing Varus to take the quickest possible rout through territories unfamiliar to Varus and the Romans. He was able to do that due to Varus holding a lot of trust in his fellow subcommander and, even though he realized that passing through unfamiliar forested terrain was dangerous for him and his forces, he held complete trust in Armenius and his Germanic cavalry guiding them through and watching over their flanks. That's how Varus and his legions walked into an ambush set by Armenius who simply disappeared along with his forces when the ambush sprang. In the end, Armenius was murdered by his fellow Germans due to behaving like he was taught in Rome, like their ruler and not one of the tribal chiefs.",

    "text": "A historical note on the part from 10:07: I disagree with the mainstream notion that hyperinflation was the key economic shock that created the basis for the rise of Nazism. This overplays the actual importance of hyperinflation and erases another, bigger economic shock from German history.\n\nHyperinflation did not hit all classes equally: it hit first and foremost those with savings, that is, the upper classes and the middle class. Of course, the voters of Adenauer's CDU remembered this the most, but they weren't the key demographic for the rise of Nazism. Indeed in spite of the violent birth of the Weimar Republic, hyperinflation wasn't followed by a wave of violence, and extremist parties did not rise for several years after it.\n\nHowever, there was an economic shock which directly preceded/was contemporaneous with the rise of the Nazis and which impacted the different classes quite differently. It was the austerity policies implemented by the minority government of Heinrich Brüning, which governed with outside support from the Social Democrats from March 1930. This austerity regime was a reaction to runaway budget deficits caused by both the onset of Depression in the US (which was a key trading partner) and reinforced demands for speedy war reparations from European countries. Based on entirely wrong conservative fiscal dogma (which dominates Germany to this day and was key to the crushing of Greece during the Euro crisis), this austerity regime failed to correct the fiscal situation, while making millions of workers jobless. Those workers were in a much more precarious situation than those hit by hyperinflation a few years earlier. As a consequence, many joined militias, and even more abandoned their traditional parties in the next elections, especially the Social Democrats (who, sadly, chose to only remember the subplot of this story that was the Communist vs Social Democrat conflict, instead of recognising their then leaders' error in judgement, and placing the main blame squarely on the centre-right).",

        "text": "Since Three Arrows actually credits, in part, the austerity measures with the improvement of the financial situation after the Nazi takeover (when speaking about full employment), I should add my disagreement on that, too. \n\nFirst, a bit more on why austerity was a failure. Prior to the 1929 crash, Germany could only service its WWI debts thanks to its trade surplus with the US. When Depression hit the US, for Germany, that meant a major drop in exports to the US, thus servicing the debt from taxes on economic production already became mathematically impossible. (The alternatives would have been to sell parts of the national wealth or heavily tax private wealth.) The Brüning government, due to their belief that the finances of a national economy work just like those of a household, thought saving on government expenses will do the trick. But a national economy is different from a household because the expenses of one economic player are the income of another economic player within the national economy. In this instance, the private economy was hit by the loss of government orders, the income loss of fired workers and government employees translated into a reduced demand for consumer goods and thus an even stronger shrinking of economic activity, and the recession resulted in reduced tax income for the government, keeping the deficit from closing.\n\nThe Nazis ended this death spiral by ending the payment of WWI debt. Of course, this wasn't a temporary suspension motivated by financial rationality, but a permanent refusal motivated by a nationalistic denial of war responsibility and an underlying aim to start re-armament, something the debt payments were supposed to prevent. (Arguably, Germany could have serviced its debts again after the onset of the New Deal in the US.)",

Oh, they would love that we just forget everything... And our \"democratical\" Transaction refused to punish the fascists (maybe because people in charge were those same fascists, and their children, and grandchildren now...) The only way to solve that is to do now what hasn't been done in 40 years. Praise the republicans for their bravery in the defense of our democracy and against fascism, and expose the traitors who call themselves \"patriots\", while doing the opposite of that in reality. But that will be difficult since we people forget our history so quickly. I think the only we to solve it is through politics (however we can, being most of our political parties right-wing and descendents from that past won't be easy) and activism, LOTS of activism.",

They just royally fucked up when they got together under Hitler. Even WWI wasn’t their fault, it was the Austro-Hungarians, but in came Hitler to just totally fuck up German pride and patriotism. \n\nNow to be German and proud is basically a crime unless you clearly state that you are ashamed of the Nazi years, even then in today’s society you have to make it clear that you’re pro immigration and that anyone can be German/German ethnicity and culture is something anyone can be. \n\n(5AM no sleep brain, so I don’t think some of these sentences or grammar will be perfect.

Everywhere you go in Berlin there are reminders and memorials. This video makes perfect sense to me. The only thing that I would disagree with is calling it lazy marketing. Rammstein is all about playing with people's perception of reality and preconceived notions in order to turn them on their head and get people talking. The conclusions that people jump to in turn say a lot more about the observer than the artist.",
