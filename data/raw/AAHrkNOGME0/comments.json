It is a Union of education workers ran by women and is 65-70% women membership. We fought for childcare workers who did state subsidized care for poor and working-class families and transformed these workers' wages and benefits. There is still work to be done but great strides have been made. I was often the only male in a room full of strong, powerful women of the working class. You are right on, we talked about wages, benefits, retirement, affordable health care. But I will say that even with this working class, Marxist work I still had to deal with the Democratic Party, the Unions are wedded to them, and all the Identify politics. But I think we are on the verge of a shift away from this to more working-class analysis and action. Thanks for your work. Tyler",

She says \"we\" i.e the PMC should be focussing more on the working class instead of identity but that is ipso facto an articulation of the same class-collaborationist, reformist, social fascist identity politics she claims to be rejecting. The only reason the PMC would collaborate with the people they are oppressing, would be to secure their own reproduction via a mass identity that integrating some of the oppressed into the lower ranks of the exploiters. Which, by definition, would exclude the vast majority of the human race, and reject violent anti-parliamentary revolution as the primary strategic goal. Besides all of that, the conditions for a renewed class collaborationist capitalism are rotting in the trash heap of 20th century leftism. It's sad and pathetic that this is the horizon of anti-establishment \"leftism\" in 2024.\n\nAn internationally organized working class would, by definition, focus on its collective needs and the discussion of race/lgbt issues which is currently hegemonised by identity politics would also become emancipatory within that movement. The fundamental question then is why _that_ hasn't happened yet and how it might happen in the future... instead of why liberal PMCs aren't being nice to the \"working class\". And that is exactly what anti-woke socialism amounts to because real working class demands have to come out of a real working class movement and its party. They can never be conjured up by self-critical and apologetic members of the parasitic classes interested in doing good things for the people.",

A lot of leftists who claim to be critical of identity politics continue to cling to aspects of it because they insist there is some 'good', truly revolutionary form of idpol as opposed to the 'bad' kind that is pushed by the Democrats and corporations. The reality is, the more you study the origins and genealogy of queer theory, contemporary feminism and Critical Race Theory, the more you realize it was a bourgeois op from the get go. It was anti working class from early onwards, from the 1960's at least. Moreover, the working class does not care that your version of identity politics has some rhetoric about socialism and communism sprinkled in, its still essentially the same as what the Democrats are pushing. If it looks like a duck, sounds like a talk, walks like a duck, its a duck. This election shows this discourse and rhetoric is utterly toxic to the working class beyond a reasonable doubt.",

There are private hospitals, but the insurance for those is not a heck of a lot cheaper than it is here in the US since these are typical typically foreign providers and foreign owned hospitals. In the public hospitals, where waiting in long lines is common, it’s common even to have a Caesarian  pushed on the woman to get her through the hospital quick quicker. The Chinese medical system is complicated and I’m not gonna try to claim that it’s drastically worse than the one here because it has some merits, and the one here is so bad, But certainly not one of those areas where the PRC has excelled.

This is the exact same idealism at the centre of Liu's PMC thesis, but applied to \"women\" instead of \"working class\". Obviously you're not talking about all women, but middle-class and rich and mostly white women. And Liu is obviously not talking about the working class, but lower-middle-class and mostly white Americans. There is no reason to believe any group will advance human liberation because a petty-bourgeois academic abstractly identifies a contradiction between their identity and a specific form of the rule of capital.\n\n\"i think it's actually men who are tearing solidarity apart, by being assholes (to put it lightly).\"\n\nMen were assholes when there was a working class movement that included women. The billions of men in the third world whose deprivation and misery fuels your middle-class life (regardless of how \"guilty\" you feel about that) are also assholes. Are \"hard-working Americans\" of all genders refusing to act (as opposed to posture) in solidarity with the third world because they are assholes? Or is it because they have no objective reason to do so, which is largely if not totally unrelated to whether they are nice or assholes?\n\nAll revolutions inherited the contradictions of the very same social order they sought to abolish, and which led to more revolution or reform. Women's emancipation as labour emerged out of the broader working class movement while being antagonistic to it. Nonetheless, making revolution is the only way to resolve contradictions, and no one has the power to decide how or why it is made. The question is what one does when the revolution happens, not how one would like it to happen. The essence of reformism/social fascism is to idealistically derive the former from the latter. Because _how contradictions should be mediated_ is always nothing more than the self-criticism of capital and therefore an articulation of its structural logic.
