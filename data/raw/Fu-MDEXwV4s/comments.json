Look on the bright side, you got more engineering than anyone else and cap level general exceptionalism across many fields like science and chemistry, physics and medicine, Musical composition and technology, etc. Your accent makes you automatically sound like a brilliant galaxy brain who is unquestionably trustworthy in all academic fields. These are pretty great abilities to have, overpowered even. So Im a little confused why you would be so stung by taking the realistic approach when that simply shows your own society to be meta defining despite its flaws. Everyone else gets it. Germany is the most admired country in the world (every year Gallup does the same survey of the 147 most developed countries and every year Germany wins despite not having very many funny people in it.) \n\nMaybe I’m biased because i was born in Japan where Germany is strongly adored. But you guys have an awesome civilization with just a few weaknesses here or there and yet you, a member of that society, still complain about not being completely perfect? \n\nOn second thought, maybe that IS pretty German. *laugh track*",

When you fight everyone else, even if you lose, any amount of progress you make looks really impressive. So fighting on two fronts against... everyone? and losing (but it was close there for a minute) ends up making you look like you would clap any of those other states in a 1v1. Like Akechi vs The phantom thieves. He lost but it was against 8 endgame badasses teaming up and they still had a hard time even then. That shows the player how capable he is and makes him seem like by far the strongest character individually. In this case obviously that isn’t reflective of reality since the US definitely could’ve beat Germany 1v1 no items fox only. at least i think so. The rest of the world looks to me like they get bagged 1v1 since Germany fought everyone PLUS the US and made it competitive. But I’m not an expert. And maybe I’m also biased, Here in Japan Germany is deeply admired.",

And if you’re familiar with the SMT games you will recognize his stats and moves as being dramatically better than anything the phantom thieves get until probably ever lol. That was the first thing that tipped me off to him being a temporary cast member. Because he was just way too strong to be a permanent member of the team, he invalidates basically every enemy as well as the phantom thieves lol. Not balanced at all. And then you have to include how We’re explicitly shown that Akechi hides his TRUE strength and abilities until the moment you get the black mask Loki reveal and it lines up perfectly with Makoto’s dialogue supporting it through the gameplay experience itself",

He told me about it from a very young age, and it was quite a shock for me when I finally was old enough to make the connection between the Nazis and my Grandfather. My other grandfather, being only 14, was drafted as a \"Flakhelfer\" (a member of the auxiliary staff of the Luftwaffe) and he never spoke with anything but disdain for the nazis and his military service, he was never proud of what he had to do, never boasted and only talked to me about it until I was much older. Both my grandfathers were strict but loving and very respected by their families and peers, both were never outright racist or antisemitic and originally came from anti-hitler families, but one chose to go to war, justified his crimes with \"no one knew Hitler was that bad\" and boasted about them openly without shame, while the other reflected on the acts he more or less was forced to do and talked to his grandkids about them to make them understand and beware of fascists. These two ways of dealing with what happened make all the difference in my opinion.",

He was drafted at the age of 15 I think, and he apparently hadn't gotten his growth spurt yet so he was too small to properly handle the weapons given to him.  He deserted with the help of an older soldier, who later died; my mom was not even sure if it was the germans or the allies that killed him, so yeah, even to her he did not say much. I think the only other thing I ever learned is that my great-grandfather fought in world war I and permanently injured his leg. I genuinely have no idea what my grandfather though of the nazis and now he's dead so I'm not sure I'll ever find out.\nEdit: Well, ok, saying I have no idea is maybe innaccurate. I can guess that he didn't like them based on other things I know about him and his family. He became a doctor, which usually isn't a choice made by someone pro-war, and one of his sons is a communist, yet neither ever cut contact with each other as far as I'm aware.",

Also I dont want to deny or even justify anything that the Wehrmacht commited. I know that the \"they were forced to do it\" argument is often used by nazis, and I want to distance myself from these people, but there is some truth to it. I mean they were just drafted, they werent asked if they actually wanted to go to war and fight for this fucked ideology. So no, its not ahistorical. And if the point isnt that there were some people that disavowed, then what is even the point of asking about the individual? The video does it as well, he asks if every individual is bad, but then awnsers the question by taking a look at the institution that is the Wehrmacht (which obviously was bad) instead of actually looking at the individual.",

        "text": "​@tomtomtom6970 sry, i wasn't saying its ahistorical to say that some members of the Wermacht ever felt coerced into service, i'm saying (like the video does) that _applying the blanket statement that they generally mostly did_ (as the Band of Brothers scene might be encouraging us to do) is ahistorical. \nYour question of \"what is the point of talking about the individual?\" is a good one, without an easy answer. It's tricky to decide what to focus on; do we consider the historical consequences (or lack thereof) of \"individual decisions/ideologies,\" or try to amalgamate these into a broader image of the entire group, and how to we decide how \"individual decisions\" are affected by the group environment/values etc...\n\nHonestly, i feel like it can become a bit of a shadowplay. With enough background information and historical context, it's possible to justify pretty much any decision a given individual makes as a product of their time and perhaps inevitable/destined... and not that that's even strictly \"wrong\", but I think it robs us of an opportunity to try to look at our own present situations and our own involvement and potential complicity in cruel systems and historical trends. \n\n i think the primary aim of the video, along with attempting to dispel the blanket statement mentioned above, is to show us that in fact the individual views of the soldiers didn't actually end up mattering all that much at the time of the war. In fact, the Wermacht seemed to count on that fact (as he says at 31:08 ). those of us who may claim to hold humanitarian views in today's strange and turbulent times might do well to heed that lesson.",

While in the bigger picture, of course us germans were the bad guys and of course we are guilty and to be held accountable for everything that happened, but the farmer boy that was drafted really only could do so much to stop the fascist authoritarian regime that was the third reich. It`s just that I think it sucks that people are so quick to morally judge every last german for not putting their lives and those of their family in danger by staying low",

It also relies on an assumption of the nature of 'bad' . Is it 'bad' to follow atrocious orders to keep oneself and one's family safe? Is it 'bad' to attempt to assassinate a despot \"for the wrong reasons\"? \n\nI don't claim to have the answer to any of the questions above, but i do think the video seeks to grapple with them... But the promise of a 'clean' answer to the title question (or any others in this matter) might be too much to ask for. \n\nAgain I think one of the biggest takeaways is to place ourselves in our own contexts, within systems we inhabit, that may well be atrocious themselves. Does it really matter if we are \"bad\" people? And if not, what then?",

The police force is a unified system of oppression in our society, while \"leftists\" is a vague category of very different people with different goals, jobs, methods etc. All police do police work, not all leftists do \"leftist\" work.\nAnd even then, many leftists do fight against bad ideas within the left, a way bigger proportion of the total group than can be said for police. All cops wouldn't be bad cops if the majority of cops fought against the bad cops, even if localized police forces did protect their bad apples, but since the protection of bad cops, bad apples, is prevalent across the entire police force, this just isn't the reality.\n\nAs mentioned above, left is also a very vague category on a spectrum. What is really \"the left\"? Anarchists, socialists and social democrats all have VERY different views on society, but they are all \"left\". While you could be more specific about cops, talking about NYC cops, officers, etc. the differences between these specific groups are not as big as the differences between anarchists and social democrats, and their function in society is even less diverse in comparison.\nAs you even mention yourself, \"left\" is also a self-ascribed identity, while cops are not. I could easily differentiate myself and dissasociate with the \"bad apple left\" by just saying I'm not a leftist, but cops can't do that. A cop can't just say they're not a cop without actually quitting, something a lot of people saying ACAB and similar slogans are advocating for the \"good cops\" to do.\nThe people that do claim all cops are rotten apples are urging \"good cops\" to leave and fight with them against the bad cops, and rejoin whatever system replaces cops, instead of being complicit and indirectly helping the bad apples by for example taking place in anti-riot action that often hurts a ton of peaceful protestors.",

        "text": "@d007ization I don't think you are considering the argument in its entirety. First off, the people you mentioned were barely involved in any of the things this argument involves. If they died early on, they didn't have time to implicitely accept any atrocities. They didn't help the corrupt system they took part in in any meaningful way, because they died too quickly.\nDying on their first mission implies their help was minimal, but even then, they are morally responsible for the help they DID give to the tool of genocide that the army was.\nEven having your life threatened does not excuse immoral behavior. But since he died so quickly, he didn't really participate in any immoral behavior. Had he however fought for over a year and helped as much as the average soldier did, he would be as morally responsible for his actions as the average soldier was. Not AS bad as the SS and people that literally gassed the jews and enjoyed it, but the distinction is hardly important because both are morally reprehensible enough that you can't really condemn the worse offender anymore than you should already be condemning the lesser.\nYour great uncle would not have been excused by being threatened. It CANNOT excuse immoral behavior.\n\nBut even with the above being said, we should differentiate between moral responsibility and punishment. While moral responsibility might not be lessened by being threatened, or at least not be removed by it, punishment should be.\nI could not punish someone, despite their moral responsibility for their actions, if the cause of said actions was outside their control, or understandably hard to refuse. I think there is an important distinction here we should hold high.\nDoing bad things and receiving punishment for those things are separated by context.\n\nAnd you see in the final paragraph why excusing immoral behavior through context is a bad idea. You CAN'T excuse tear gassing innocent people through the person commiting the horrible act's situation. It does not make it somehow moral or ok. It is STILL morally reprehensible to tear gas innocent people, even if your livelyhood and your family's well-being is on the line. Maybe you shouldn't be punished for it if the circumstances truly do force them to be cops (though it is the case that almost no police officer truly HAS to be a cop for any of the possible reasons, even if some feel like that is the case), but the moral responsibility does not disappear.\nThat's a dangerous equivocation to let slip through.",

I think religion should be fought because it leads to irrationality in too many people, but specifically terrorism is not inherent to the religion.\n\nYou must also consider the difference in groupings. Islam is a religion, a very vague group of humans with all different jobs, roles in society, goals and beliefs. Cops all have the same job, the same role (with tiny variation between officer and sherrif etc.) the same goal (assuming they follow commands, thus their goals are what those in command wants). They are part of the same system and work together towards the same end. The same cannot be said for any specific religion.\nThere is an inherent difference between being a part of and indirectly help a corrupt system, and being a part of a large, diverse group of people that only match up in a certain aspect of who they are as humans. A such vague aspect that it can't even be properly defined. What counts as Christian is infamously hard to define, as some self-identify as Christians despite fitting none of the normal signifiers like believing in the literal ressurection of Christ.\nBeing a cop is a job, and thus participation in the system is easy to define.

In my family at least, those who came back from the wars barely spoke about it - they're great men and I hold them in high regard; the situations they found themselves in have been something to overcome over decades, and come to terms with.

Cause I believe the right is a FAR worse problem in modern day society than the extreme left have ever been, and thus focus should obviously be put on them. Time is limited, and videos take a long time to create, and thus you don't have to make many videos about problems within the left to have exceeded their relative problematic nature in our society. Three Arrows specifically makes few videos, but long ones and thus even one video would be a huge percent of his catalogue.\nIf you look at breatubers like ThoughtSlime, you'll see a decent chunk of their content mentioning problems within the left, more than I think is representative of how big an issue they are in society, I just don't think Three Arrows is the type of channel that has the amount of content to justify spending time on the left.\nOf course, you can disagree all you want with me about how big a problem the extreme left actually is, but I don't think you can rightly claim the criticism isn't common, even if it isn't given a dedicated video to talk about it.

        "text": "@papageitaucher618 I don't see the logic of that. First off, giant echochamber implies more than a lack of dissent. I don't think the word fits the left as a group.\nEchochambers are usually smaller places, with even less dissent than the left overall. They also actively discourage dissent, not just refrain from dissenting themselves, and that is not a significant problem within the left.\nThere are some anti-secterians, but they don't actually encourage echochambers, they still argue for their version of leftist ideas, they just don't actively target leftists with differing opinions, and only the most strict anti-secterian would let extremism get too far before they would respond. There is a difference between encouraging unity and discouraging dissent.\nYou must also consider what you think of as left vs. what they think of as left. Breadtubers don't view liberals as leftists, but republicans would (assuming they use the proper definition and not the bastardization of it that the US has normalized). Anarcho-capitalists are similarly frequently grouped in with normal anarchists, but as many breadtubers would point out, the ideology is fundamentally opposed to anarchism.\n\nAnd you don't really explain why an echochamber would be unfit to take on such a problem in our society to begin with. If they are a big enough threat, some would argue that anyone can participate in fighting them, in fact, that is exactly what anti-secterians do. Why would an echochamber be unfit to fight against threats to our society? I understand the problem of letting an echochamber roll over society unopposed in the \"powervacuum\" if we defeat right wing extremism, but wouldn't that be the point at which left wing extremism would be a big enough threat that people like Three Arrows would consider them worth their time?\nI don't think there is a significant issue here, not a substantial enough threat that we ever have to worry about it. I see enough criticism aimed at them as it is (how ingrained in breadtube etc are you really?), and I don't think they have advanced enough strategies of deception and dishonest rethoric to ever rival white supremacy and other such extremists.",

It's true that not everyone has the luxury to choose to do the right thing without getting punished, but would you say that about people in high positions of power?

They are both nonfiction books that share accounts by Soviet survivors of the war. The amount of casual brutality displayed by Germans in these accounts is terrifying, far worse than any horror film. \n\nData on casualties and physical evidence backs up these accounts. We have found mass graves of civilians, we have data that shows how few Soviet prisoners survived captivity. 1 in 4 people in the Soviet Republic of Belarus died in the war, which is if not the highest, one of the highest death rates from the war. Most of them were civilians. Not to mention the documented orders like Hitler's commisar order blatantly encouraged killing of civilians and prisoners. This was an order given to the military as a whole, not just the SS. Given all this, I don't know why Priere Panda's comment is so unbelievable. It's not even half as messed up as anything the Dirlewanger Brigade got up to in the war. \n\nAre you a holocaust denier too? Or do you only hate slavs?",

        "text": "@epicgamer-hf4jb Multiple times. It just happens that its ultimate conclusions are far from complete; which is why I wrote this comment \"The Wehrmacht is the rough equivalent to the Red army. Both committed w*r crimes but we are not talking about a majority of the enlisted fighters. And ultimately, both served pretty messed up regimes, one clearly far more immoral than the other but people really should stop trying to turn questions about people into questions of institutions.\n\nThe myth of the clean Wehrmacht which is really just a question about Germans ideology and actions during WW2 is actually not really that far off when it claims that the average German, in a country with no free press, massive propaganda and often far away from the front, had little idea what exactly happened with the \"relocated\" people who were brought to the KZs or to the civilians & POWs in occupied territories.\n\nThe average soldiers themselves were, while not blind, simply not closely involved with most crimes committed by stuff like the military police behind the lines. When this video argues that the collective Wehrmacht passively helped to commit the atrocities, it’s as true as to argue that a factory worker making rations directly contributed to w*r crimes committed by men who ate his products. \n\nCapturing soldiers & civilians for instance is not the same as then letting them starve& freeze to death, not even mentioning the power imbalance between even an officer and the logistical decisions happening in distant w*r rooms etc. . While one may lead to the other, the intention is different and shouldn’t be so willingly intertwined.\n\nThe Nzs knew that their actions were outlandish even for their own citizens, so a ton of propaganda tried to hide what was really going on. Arguably, with a lot more success than people may imagine today.\n\nThe invasion of the Soviet Union was framed as a massive defensive effort against a beastlike opponent as opposed to the ideological ideas that lead the high command & the general Nzi elite to go through with the war. Trying to intermingle the ideals of a nation's leadership with its citizens is a surefire way to make connections that are far too often only half-truths. \n\nWhen we proclaim that the Wehrmacht was fighting for one reason or another, we purposefully limit our observation to the parts of the army which we can clearly categorize. \n\nArguing that fighting in the Wehrmacht enabled the w*r behind the lines is therefore like arguing that the universe being conceived is what caused the atrocities in WW2. It’s very clearly connected but there was no thought-out effort connecting the actions of individual soldiers who fought in a tank platoon or an infantry battalion with the actions of \"anti-partisan\" operations so to speak. \n\nThe Wehrmacht itself was also not some kind of blob with a hive-mind mentality. Serving in different units could lead to an entirely different experience of the conflict.\n\nThis video fails to understand that the question of whether or not the Wehrmacht was totally clean, completely dirty or something in between is not only related to the broader intentions of the people that were in charge of the army. It’s actually indeed also a question about individual intentions. For if a soldier refuses to carry out an order, he may get shot and he is not the one deciding where he marches etc. - orders are not just some hypothetical concept. They are a reality that is IMPOSSIBLE to ignore when refusal equals punishment and when the information a soldier can access is INCREDIBLY limited. \n\nQuite frankly, stating that the Wehrmacht as an institution served a highly immoral purpose dehumanizes the fighting soldiers. We can not put people in such a collective solely based on being part of an army where many soldiers would never even see many regions of the war where they were not deployed.\"\n\n\nYou're welcome.",

        "text": "@itskarl7575 It does matter. The myth of the clean Wehrmacht which is really just a question about German ideology and actions during WW2 is actually not really that far off when it claims that the average German, in a country with no free press, massive propaganda and often far away from the front, had little idea what exactly happened with the \"relocated\" people who were brought to the KZs or to the civilians & POWs in occupied territories.\n\nThe average soldiers themselves were, while not blind, simply not closely involved with most crimes committed by stuff like the military police behind the lines. When this video argues that the collective Wehrmacht passively helped to commit the atrocities, it’s as true as to argue that a factory worker making rations directly contributed to w*r crimes committed by men who ate his products. \n\nCapturing soldiers & civilians for instance is not the same as then letting them starve& freeze to death, not even mentioning the power imbalance between even an officer and the logistical decisions happening in distant w*r rooms etc. . While one may lead to the other, the intention is different and shouldn’t be so willingly intertwined.\n\nThe Nzs knew that their actions were outlandish even for their own citizens, so a ton of propaganda tried to hide what was really going on. Arguably, with a lot more success than people may imagine today.\n\nThe invasion of the Soviet Union was framed as a massive defensive effort against a beastlike opponent as opposed to the ideological ideas that lead the high command & the general Nzi elite to go through with the war. Trying to intermingle the ideals of a nation's leadership with its citizens is a surefire way to make connections that are far too often only half-truths. \n\nWhen we proclaim that the Wehrmacht was fighting for one reason or another, we purposefully limit our observation to the parts of the army which we can clearly categorize. \n\nArguing that fighting in the Wehrmacht enabled the w*r behind the lines is therefore like arguing that the universe being conceived is what caused the atrocities in WW2. It’s very clearly connected but there was no thought-out effort connecting the actions of individual soldiers who fought in a tank platoon or an infantry battalion with the actions of \"anti-partisan\" operations so to speak. \n\nThe Wehrmacht itself was also not some kind of blob with a hive-mind mentality. Serving in different units could lead to an entirely different experience of the conflict.\n\nThis video fails to understand that the question of whether or not the Wehrmacht was totally clean, completely dirty or something in between is not only related to the broader intentions of the people that were in charge of the army. It’s actually indeed also a question about individual intentions. For if a soldier refuses to carry out an order, he may get shot and he is not the one deciding where he marches etc. - orders are not just some hypothetical concept. They are a reality that is IMPOSSIBLE to ignore when refusal equals punishment and when the information a soldier can access is INCREDIBLY limited. \n\nQuite frankly, stating that the Wehrmacht as an institution served a highly immoral purpose dehumanizes the fighting soldiers. We can not put people in such a collective solely based on being part of an army where many soldiers would never even see many regions of the war where they were not deployed.",

        "text": "​@Arcaryon Every single German knew that Jews were being sent off to camps. Every single German also knew that those Jews would never be seen again. The precise goings on were not known (but rumours abounded), but that's not important. They knew that Jews, simply because they were Jews, were being forced out of their homes and sent to concentration camps to slave until they died. Whether you fought at the front, were stationed in some comfortable location, were out at sea, worked a civilian job back home in Germany, you _knew_ this was the case.\n\nYou knew that Jews lost their citizenships in 1933, you knew of all the incremental disenfranchisements of the Jews from that point onwards, and you knew about Kristallnacht in 1938 - all before the Jews were being rounded up en masse and sent off to the camps, which you also knew about. You also knew that the wars Germany was fighting were not in defence, but for revenge.\n\nYes, the war in the East was framed as a necessary war to rid the world of the communist threat, but before that happened there was Poland - and Denmark - and Norway - and Belgium - and the Netherlands - and France - and Britain. And if you were dumb enough to believe you were fighting a \"defensive\" war against Russia, then you were also firmly believing that Jews were the mortal enemies of the Reich, and deserved everything that was coming to them.\n\nNot a single German above the age of 5 could truthfully plead ignorance. _They knew,_ whether they approved or not.\n\nI have to adress this directly:\n\n*\"When this video argues that the collective Wehrmacht passively helped to commit the atrocities, it’s as true as to argue that a factory worker making rations directly contributed to w*r crimes committed by men who ate his products.\"*\n\nOr in other words, \"to say that the difference between 5 cm and 7 cm is slight is the same as saying the difference between 1 cm and 700 cm is slight\". Someone making rations in a factory isn't actually in the Wehrmacht, and is not part of the soldier's culture of the Wehrmacht. The degree to which the soldiers of the Wehrmacht eagerly participated in atrocities is something largely swept under the carpet. In many cases they gladly volunteered. If you were in the armed forces, you knew what you were fighting for.",

        "text": "@Ashok76_gr Muahahahahahahahahaha. I think if you look at for how many years (and for how many lessons a week on average) a German who today is maybe in his late 30s had to learn English and combine that with the possibility that he didn't do much more than he had to for this subject and that he may not have used his English on a more than very basic level since leaving school, you will realize that it is very, very normal for a German to suck at English. Not that I say that the *average* German that age - or of any age - sucks at English. Not at all. But it's still very normal thing that can happen. And on a more personal note: A sibling of mine had maybe four to five years of mandatory English lessons in school and thanks to that and occasionally needing to speak English in her job - thereby having an opportunity to use what she knows - she speaks the language with a very low level of \"fluency\". Meaning that she can speak freely in full but relatively simple sentences without making too many pauses to think. And she makes a lot of grammar mistakes. So while she gets by *actively talking* , she would still be extremely overwhelmed with the level of *passive* English skills required to be able to follow a video like this one. She's not a German but I bet she'd beat a lot of way younger Germans - who most would consider to have better English skills than someone like her - in some kind of \"English speaking contest\".",

Wir haben über die Propaganda der Nazis, ihre Machtergreifung und die Indoktrination der Jugend gesprochen. Außerdem haben wir uns verschiedene Arten des Widerstandes angeguckt. Über Kriegsverbrechen der Wehrmacht haben wir nichts gelernt. (Meine Schule ist in Bundesland, über Nazideutschland haben wir vor allem in der 9. Klasse geredet.)\nDas einzige in der Art, durch das man vielleicht darauf schließen könnte, war das wir über die Idee gelernt haben, dass Osteuropäer Umtermenschen sind.

        "text": "@PureSwedishViking yes actually it did. Off the top of my head, native American reservation camps (you should really look into that. Even in modern day America the standards are horrific) the systematic lynching of black people, the internment of Japanese Americans...and so on.\n\nThe phrase 'it isn't a one-party state' is very strange. During the time of N@zi Germany, it really wouldn't matter if there were multiple parties (which there were actually, up until the point where Hitler rose to power and suspended the constitution) the n@zi propaganda and f@scist ideals were far too imbedded in the German population at that time for it to have made a difference. N@zi Germany's existence was inevitable taking into account the political, cultural, and economic climate at that time. \n\nThe US being a two-party state changes absolutely nothing when comparing it to n@zi Germany. Atrocities don't come in a one-party state mold it must adhere to. Additionally, the US - though not a one party state - is not a technical democracy. Majority doesn't rule. Following your logic there your point falls flat.\n\nStarting world war two was not what made n@zi Germany 'bad' 💀what? \n\nYes. Again. Yes it did. The native American genocide? Where native American people are still greatly targeted and killed to this day? Even without bringing that up, it was quoted that Hitler fashioned his concentration camps after American residential schools. He 'took inspiration' so to speak. That...should say enough on its own.\n\nTo conclude, this was a really bad take. I will take a leap of faith and hope it wasn't done intentionally but rather due to ignorance and a great lack of knowledge. So to that I'll say, please examine why it is you are ready to defend your country's history when it's horrors are rightfully condemned...when you do not seem to have much information on any of the topics?",

Germans already see themselves as the victims of the Nazis while their families profited off the regime, (and they continue to do so to this day, economically and with their material possessions) getting jobs, the break of civilization goes so far, the main conflict, class issues, were made almost non existent, the main conflict became Arians vs Jews. Most Germans agreed with Hitler. I think if you don't live here, in Germany and aren't able to research the history of this country you might not know, but antisemitism is deeply, structurally ingrained in German culture and society. During the building of the German nation-state, the Germans had to define themselves against different people, the main group they defined themselves in opposition to was Jews. Antisemitism is a pillar of German culture and ingrained in the construct of Germans as a people. Hitler said what they were all already thinking anyway, or at least a vast majority was. I know Hollywood makes it seem different but 0.001% of the population resisted against the Nazis. Remember, the Germans weren't the ones who decided they didn't want to live under the Nazi regime, they just lost the war and were forced by the allies to not be Nazis anymore and even that didn't work that well. It's also a slippery slope to compare national socialism to capitalism that can lead to literal perpetuators of genocide being excused. We didn't chose to live under capitalism but the Germans did in large part chose to be Nazis and those people who were actively commiting genocide chose exactly where they were and loved every second of it",

If people had to vote on a referendum \"Should all Jews be killed\", I strongly doubt that this would have succeeded. If there is something to \"It's the economy, stupid\", then a look at how stuff changed after the election - chronologically, not necessarily causally evaluated - also should be considered.\n\nSo if Germans (soldiers and voters) choose their fate and thus cannot be considered victims, what should we thing about statements that start with \"The American people deserve\" or \"The great people of [some hillbilly state] deserve\"? They never get what they supposedly deserve, but they always get what they voted for.\n\nGermans should have known better. After all, Hitler told everybody who would listen what he wants be done. Completely agree. But should that not also mean that Americans should know better today? We don't know what's going to happen, it's not history yet. But that was also true 1933. There is a chance that Trump will be a candidate next year and it's not at all a given that he would loose the election. If all Trump does is just what he says he will do, that will be quite bad. Not Holocaust bad, but definitely too bad. And who knows what he might do.\n\n\nAnd still, in the land of the free, a people who is not in dire straights, who is not experiencing the aftermath of a devastating war and a complete economical collapse is perfectly willing to support this guy - because \"they deserve better\".

        "text": "Really interesting video and really insightful.  I love your videos and your perspective on these issues but I must say, in the example given about the Wehrmacht officer refusing to kill Jews in his sphere of influence I find the idea that this was somehow not sufficiently commendable to be somewhat difficult to accept.  Assuming that his military service began before the Nazi leadership took control, what would a moral but patriotic leader do?  Are we meant to believe that in the face of a gradually rising Nazi leadership that his only choice to be “morally adequate” (or whatever we would call our reasonable expectation of an ethical actor’s actions) is to throw his metals in the trash and join the resistance forces?  I would hate to assume this was your opinion and straw man your argument but if that’s the standard for being a “moral” person it seems like that’s really rejecting any reasonable expectation of men.  In my opinion (whatever it’s worth), if you’re willing to risk being persecuted by a murderous totalitarian regime even just to save a single life that says something about your character.  I guess the point of my comment is that I was totally following you line of logic until that point in he video, but I feel like the example you gave completely rejected your thesis and I hope you further elaborate on this idea in the future.  All the best",

The argument around the \"not all x\" is about trying to redirect the conduct of an organization to that of the individual which therefore absolves the organization of wrongdoing AND provides plausible deniability to anyone who wants it. \n\nIn the case of the officer, being on board with the war at all means being on board with the destruction of all Jews and the genocide of non Germans. Saying, \"this part is too far\" but still actively moving forward with the campaign means he made the choice to support a military mission of extermination. That was the goal. He only objected to small segment of that goal.\n\nThis is like joining a group of men who have the goal to go indiscriminately raping then objecting when they start raping children but don't do anything yourself except keeping yourself to only raping the adults.

Also, violence in self-defence is quite legal in the US.  This would be much more feasible if the police were easier to work with.  It's a lot easier to single someone out for them that you saw throw a brick if they didn't jump to tear gassing everyone and marching forward in formation and arresting a huge number of people.  They make themselves impossible to work with and considering their position I think they should be able to take a little abuse and show some self-restraint.  What kind of double standard do we have where when people throw things at police they can gas everyone, shove them around, and strike them with batons, even use rubber bullets and flash-bangs... but when they do that anyone that tries to defend themselves from this blatant violence gets charged with resisting arrest and assaulting and officer.  It's ridiculous.  Police response to violence should only be to the violent, and this kind of force is unnecessary as well in the vast majority of cases.  In many cases they know who it is anyway and could go arrest them later rather than endangering everyone by using these tactics on the spot.",

So ye there are racist cops. So? Ye it's horrible but what are you going to do about it? Man maybe instead of saying acab focuse on saying all criminals are bastards.

What do you think is gonna happen of you stone insult spit one and shoot on an entire profession? They'll feel abandonned. This is what breeds racism in the police and brutality.

    "text": "This is off topic, but it reminds me of a story that I think is worth telling.\nA few years ago I went on a short vacation with my stepdad's family. Because we were so many people, we had to share the cars and I ended up driving with my step dads uncle, who was in his 80es at that time. We went through a village and he said that he remembered the village from his childhood, because it was one of the places where he went with the \"hitlerjugend\" (the Nazi boyscouts). We started talking about that time and he told me how he had experienced the end of the war. He told me, that in the last days of the war, he was 13 years old and through growing up in Nazi Germany, he was a fanatical Nazi trough and trough. He had tried to join the army earlier, but was permitted because of his age. When finally the \"Volkssturm\" (the armament of children and old people, to defend Germany to the last man) was called out, he finally saw his chance to do his duty and as in his own words \"die for Germany if necessary\".\nSo he went to the local Garrison, where they gave him an uniform-Jacket and an army hat and kept him and the other \"volunteers\" (a lot of them weren't there because of their free will) there. A few days later he was send as a delivery boy to a nearby outpost. He left the garrison in the early in the morning, so he would get there before sunrise. On the way to the outpost, he passed trough the village, where he's been growing up and met the local Baker, who was the only one who was already up so early. The Baker reckond him in his uniform and asked him if he wanted some bread for breakfast. He replied with a yes and followed the Baker in to the bakery. As soon as both were inside, the Baker loked the door, grapped him and pulled him down into the basement. Down there he tied him up and gagged him and kept him down there,  basically kidnapping him. The Baker did tell no one that he was keeping the boy and released him just a week after the war was over (which was basically two weeks after the kidnapping), because he did know that if anybody would found out, he would be executed immediately for undermining war effort. When released my step-dads uncle was furious, that he missed the chance to fight, called the baker a coward, traitor and \"saujude\"* (pig-jew), but it took him not to long to realize, that this man had probably saved his life.\nHe would stay in close contact with that until he died some 25 years later and he could never repay him, for what he had done.\n\nAfter telling me this story, I asked him how he did feel about that time in retrospective and he answered. \"... I just cannot comprehend, how you can completely turn a Human into someone like the person I was back then ... Yes I know, I was young and it was not my fault ... Everybody told me that ... But I still can't comprehend... How can put that madness into a person ... It still scares me when I think how it was and still is possible\"\n\nSo sorry for that long story, but that story has until today a lot of meaning to me, so I though I might share it.\n\n*Annotation: I also asked him later, if he was antisemitic back then and he replied: \"Yes of course I was ... nearly Everybody was and I don't mean that as an excuse ... Even though nobody of us had ever in his life met one, we were just to eager to believe all that crap ... Can you believe it ... We had a teacher who teached us in racial science ... After the war he continued his job ... Just with a  different school subject ... He was only fired years later, because he beat one kid bloody in the 70es [flogging was abolished in 1973], until his dead he was a full blown Nazi, but nobody did give a damn.\"",

In the middle of nowhere he told them to get rid of their uniforms, to put on their civilian clothes and go home. He said they would meet on the very same spot three weeks later for a very important but secret operation so they weren't allowed to talk about it. It was all nonsense of course but in that way the officer prevented them from fighting because he knew the Americans would arrive in just a few days and the boys were stupid enough to fight or to betray those who wanted to surrender. Later on, my grandmothers brother was very thankful of course.",

I'm not downplaying its existence, it was an accepted thing and everyone knew it. However, everyone also understood that it was meant for huge systemic issues where it was clear the whole country was failing or becoming actively tyrannical to some members. The South used it to quit the country over not getting their way in one election over an issue most of the world agreed was a dying form of monstrous barbarity. This put the economy and safety of both nations in jeopardy on basically a whim, not to mention effectively stealing US armaments and infrastructure because they made no attempt to ACTUALLY go through a legal process of secession, so yeah, the Union called bullshit.

They just got to write all that off because it wasn't Europeans getting wrecked by them. Sure, you could say the Axis started the war, but the Allies were only too happy to stomp all over human rights and commit war crimes in turn.\nIn fact, the similarities in actions is probably the number one reason Germany went shocked Pikachu face once the Allies decided to clap back.\nIn fact, I think the Allies only learned an important lesson there; as long as they maintain the Nazi-puncher facade, they can do whatever they want.

I was with electronic warfare (drafted in '09) and I'm quite happy to say that we were a pretty colourful bunch in basic training and while the guys that stuck around (incl. our NCOs and COs) were primarily Biodeutsche there was a great deal of respect and camaraderie with our primarily Iranian-/Afghan-German translators. There were still really stupid NCOs, though who were all too happy to share super racist comments on a regular basis, too.\n\nBut something as blatant as having pictures of Wehrmacht soldiers on the wall is not something that I think would've been deemed acceptable there.\n\n(also, electronic warfare seems to be perceived as one of the least militaristic type of unit you can find in the German military)",

The only thing that they had in common was that we were all rather young, none was older than 25 and except for the one that was discharged in the beginning none had any unusal political views. \n\nThat propably was partially because of my branch as we were in a medical unit, but even later on in other bases i never encountered someone who was a political extremist. \n\nWe also never sang any marching songs, wich I thought was a shame because it certainly would have helped on long marches but I also understand the controversy arround some. \n\nUltimately I experienced the average soldier not as someone who saw themself in the tradition of the Wehrmacht but rather a young person that wanted to serve their country. \nThat is not to say that there are no bad examples, however I think that the  Bundeswehr has changed a lot in recent years and the old image of it as some kind of far right club neither holds up nor is it helpfull in recruiting responsible, democratic citizen into the ranks.",

Generally speaking those belonging to the \"Deutsche Burschenschaft\" (ein Dachverband) are on the right to far right. Then there are two other large groups who are right to center and then some who are on their own who can be anything from far right to far left.\n\nThen there are the other kinds of Verbindungen. As mentioned in this comment section many of which are Christian. There are the Catholic and protestant ones, and them some that accept members of either faith and sometimes even non Christians. Then there are Corps which take their name from the military unit and predate Burschenschaften by quite some time. To generalise them. They are snobs, but usually have a centris political view (but are overall a political in organisation) and many of them resisted the Nazis and integration into the nazi regime. Then there are the so called Landsmanschaften und Turnerschaften. They are also quite old and a political. Their main purpose is the keeping of tradition, education of their members in a large area of history as well as sports (as implied by the name).\n\nBeyond that you have Sängerdchaften( similar to Landsmanaschaften but with a focus on singing in a choir), VDSt literally \"fraternity of German students\" who's aim is to political educate their members. They are usually Liberal, left or centrist and despise the far right or even the center right. \nAfter that we have ATB fraternities who's single members go by ATV or similar. They focus on sports and more American style fraternity parties and are also a mostly gender mixed bunch (note: most of the ones I named before only accept male members, with some outliners) \nAnd last but not least we have ADV or DV or akademische Damenverbibdung. This bunch can not be categorised as their main aim is to be a fraternity for women and theyr aims beyond that differ. They are also mostly less than 10 years old, though some are 60+ years.",

You argue that the Brits declared war, as if that mattered, then they point out that Germany invaded Poland without declaring war as an obvious point for why your argument is stupid, and you deflect by mentioning Russian invasion of Poland? Obvious evidence that your opinion is bullshit, misinformed nonsense.\nDeclaring war is irrelevant when one party is clearly in the wrong long before any declarations have been made.

You are either seriously stupid, or you are purposefully misrepresenting my arguments.\nI would argue that if Iraq invades Kuwait, every country on earth is morally responsible for stopping said invasion (assuming the invasion wasn't itself a necessary action to stop someone else from doing immoral things), but I never argued that the actions taken to reach that result HAD to be war. In the specific case of Hitler and Germany, I don't think their strategy was good, I don't think appeasement was the right way to stop Hitler, but war wasn't the necessary action to take and I never claimed it was. You are reading way too far into my comments and making huge illogical leaps of judgement based on bare minimum information about my positions.\n\nAnd I don't give a shit about what the Founding Fathers wanted for the US. They did great things, but their opinions on what is and isn't morally required of us was shit. Most of them owned slaves my dude. Their opinions on what is and isn't morally right can go die in a ditch.\nThe US SHOULD intervene when other countries commit atrocities, when other people do immoral behavior (though they shouldn't meddle in other countries' internal affairs if they are themselves handling the issue fine). We are implicit in bad behavior if we have the power to stop it and we don't. \nThe Founding Fathers can roll in their graves over their neutrality, I won't let others off scott-free when they do bad things because of something people dead long ago thought.\n\nYeah, the Brits let Russia of the hook, but it is irrelevant. The point was that your \"technicality\" over who started the war is meaningless in the context of who was in the wrong, and your example of \"discretion\" does nothing to argue the point. That's called whataboutism. Just because the Brits did something unrelated wrong, does not mean they were also wrong about starting the war. (and just because whataboutism doesn't mean they were wrong, does not mean they weren't wrong. That's also a fallacy)\n\nNone of your excuses and semantics will ever change historical fact - Germany was in the wrong during WW2 (which doesn't mean everything the Brits did was good, and I never claimed otherwise).

        "text": "@flyingsnake3737 There was always going to be an extremist regime in Germany because of the stipulations of the Versailles treaty. The SA outnumbered the Reichswehr (limited to 100,000 personnel by the aforementioned treaty) 40 to 1 and most would've had no qualms destroying German state institutions such as the armed forces since they were explicitly loyal to the NSDAP and not Germany. If the Reichswehr took up arms against the NSDAP, it would've been obliterated in very short order and replaced with the Wehrmacht soon after. The Reichswehr did actually try to kind of sort of curb the NSDAP by playing a major role in pushing for the Night of the Long Knives, but that was of course for matters of self-preservation and not for helping Germany to get free of the NSDAP.\n\nAnyway, what I'm saying is that the Treaty of Versailles and the climate of early 20th-century Europe combined to pretty much guarantee that the Weimar Republic would fall to extremism sooner or later, and Germany would've been almost certainly steered in the direction of crimes against peace once again by whoever came to power. There's nothing that any one neutral institution could've really done to upend Hitler and the party, even (or maybe especially) early on. In the years between 1934 and 1939, the Wehrmacht was established and grew rapidly and could've maybe done something about Hitler if it had the will, but I'm still skeptical because of the relatively high popularity of the NSDAP among the German people and the thorough Nazification of most state institutions, like the police, as well as the growing influence and power of the SS (even before the war started and the SS ballooned the way it did.)\n\nThe Wehrmacht still should've at least *tried* to remove the NSDAP, undo the Enabling Act, etc. in 1938 or 39, before the war started, that much I can say and I think you'd agree.",

They were SS as well. Where normally, those in the wehrmacht who did horrible things were normal people, doing horrible things. \n\nThe brutality and barbarism of the nazis was certainly not limited to SS, or the wehrmacht, or even the military. Even in the film, collaborators gleefully assisting in the \"bullet holocaust\" (as in, pogroms not committed in death camps) were particularly horrifying. I cannot imagine the paranoia, your neighbor could happily help an invading german battalion, grab you laughing and joking and toss you in a burning pit with your family for fun.",

From the few greek friends I have, it seems they go extremly in depth to ancient greek history or well 3000BC - 500AC and just talk less about more current history. \nCompared to germany where we learn next to nothing about ancient history beside a few details, people like Caesar, Augustus, Alexander, Hannibal should at least be names children heard of 1 time. But we go super in depth from frensh revolution onward and 5  years are basicaly leading events for  WW1 till post WW2. With the major subject Hitlers rise to power.\nIt's not narrow minded there just isn't enough time to teach everything so they set a focus to what is important for their own history.",

Not just physically, the Allies did a really good job at that, but also its legitimacy. \n\nThey were supposed to be the unbeatable defenders of Japan, and they sacrificed considerably for it. Because of the nature of Japanese politics at the time, the Army and Navy wielded considerable political power which was not only used to suppress the civilian government, but also against each other. They ruled the nation and led it to war. And well, they lost. Hard. \n\nAnd the surrender was a tremendous shock to… everyone. That kind of national shock is transformative. While the acknowledgement of war crimes may be iffy, the overwhelming sentiment is toward peace and nonviolence, distinctly antimilitarist. \n\nWith the disbandment of the military, there was no serious threat to Japanese democracy. When a military of some form was created as the Self-Defense Forces, they were largely recruited from former Army and Navy soldiers and officers up to the lieutenant colonel rank. While the SDF did maintain some of the outward traditions of the old military like its marching music, the structure was radically altered to be more American in that it is obedient to the civilian government, and unified across branches to avoid the bitter and lethal conflict that played a key role in the defeat.",

I told one of my colleagues that patriotism for me means being willing to raise your weapons against your own country, if necessary. All I got was raised eyebrows to which I gave the example of The Third Reich. However the discussion led nowhere sadly as most conversations we've had were under the influence of uncountable litres of beer and most young men on military duty did not really seem to question the situation they were in.

Germans were expelled from their previous territories as a punishment for what they did to us during ww2. Germany shouldn't have killed millions of Poles, raped and steal our national treasures and treat us with unprecedented racism. Saying that Slavic people are somehow worse than Germans, and then behaving like complete animals really showed what the Nazis really were. Thankfully Germans redeemed themselves later in my opinion, and I like that country. I don't like your attitude though. Yes, history always remembers and that's why you should remember what your ancestors did and show some humility, as well as I should show forgiveness. Let's move on and live peacefully together, without making anything 100% anything, because that always leads to death, horror and destruction.",

This of course means that the true purpose for going against that argument is to enable united and justified violence against the entirety of 'X,' which is a very effective strategy if you intended it to be that way. It's framed as though rejecting the \"Not all X are bad\" argument will stop group 'X' from attempting to justify their actions, when in actuality you're simply justifying the use of those exact same actions against them. In somewhat insane irony, rejecting the argument actually enables your soldiers to commit terrible actions against the opposition.",

Having served in the Bush-Cheney war machine in Iraq (USMC, infantry, Al Anbar Province, June-December 2004), I've given a lot of thought to comparing the US in Iraq/Afghanistan to Germany in WW2. I was well educated on past US military atrocities before, after, and during WW2. I was still able to look past the obvious problems with the war, because the people I envisioned myself fighting were theocratic, patriarchal, authoritarian, and generally bigoted (I wanted to be an actual SJW). Initially I was surprised to learn that these were not uncommon traits within the US military. Even though I didn't actually join to oppress Muslims/Middle-easterners I still served under a policy and climate that killed a million of them in Iraq. There is a common saying among troops in the anglophone world: \"It is better to be judged by twelve than carried by six.\" It's an unwritten rule that says killing is always justified if you make it home alive (and is also ignorant of that fact that tribunal literally means \"judged by three\"). What we are seeing is the result of this idea having been thoroughly adopted by our heavily militarized and systemically racist police forces. I would also argue that war has directly contributed to this.\n\nPS: \"corps\" sounds like \"core,\"  and \"corpse\" sounds like \"corps.\"",

There’s no “Send me to war so I can be evil! Bazinga!”\nI served with the 18th Airborne Corps in the Gulf War. Virtually every other enlisted man I knew was there because (1) they needed a job, (2) didn’t want to go to college, (3) joined for access to the GI Bill or (4) were fleeing some fairly serious home situations and the military was an escape. Most of the guys who decided to stay in decided they would be better off in uniform that going back home and starting over. Nobody wanted to “be Audie Murphy,” or had any serious thoughts about killing anyone until they (we) found ourselves facing actual combat deployment. By the way, even Audie Murphy didn’t join the military looking to be a hero. He was the oldest son in his family, his father abandoned them and he quit school to help his mother provide for younger siblings. When his mom became fatally ill, he went into the service in order to have money to send to relatives who took his siblings in. Because of his size (five feet five, 120lbs “soaking wet”), the Navy and the Marines refused to induct him and his commander in the 3rd Infantry Division wanted to discharge him before deployment because they just didn’t think he could physically “hack it” in combat. The point is, he was there for basic “bread and butter” family reasons…just like a LOT of others who have since served in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq (either time) and Afghanistan. Just saying.",

    "text": "The Wehrmacht not only quantitatively committed more war crimes than their Allied counterparts but also, and this can not be emphasized enough, the way they waged war during WWII was criminal from the outset as a matter of institutional policy. And not just in the way that the IMT in Nürnberg found that they were guilty of waging a war of aggression but the very way how they fought and what forms of warfare they encouraged was steeped in Nazi ideology.\r\n\r\nThis started from the very beginning of the war when the attack on Gleiwitz was faked in order to produce a casus belli against Poland, to the regular collaboration of the Wehrmacht with the SS and Einsatzgruppen in Poland, to the attack on neutral countries in the Benelux, to the blatant disregard to the laws of war in France where e.g. Rommel both used tactics such as setting civilians' houses on fire in order to mask his troops' advance to feigning surrender in order to draw French troops in, to the anti-Partisan operations in the Balkans, to the war against the Soviet Union being planned as a war of annihilation and thus constituting a war crime in itself, down to the lowest level of the units where massive violence against civilians and their property was encouraged as a tactic of warfare on a massive level.\r\n\r\nThe Wehrmacht as an institution superseded the \"normal\" function of an army within your average nation state  and crossed the territory into becoming an institution heavily involved and complicit in the crimes of the Nazi state.\r\n\r\nThis came to bear in that the Wehrmacht and especially its higher echelons were by the time of the attack on the Soviet Union thoroughly \"nazified\". The war against the Soviets was in their mind not a \"normal\" war but a war of annihilation. Meaning that civilians as well as the soldiers of the other side were perceived as such an existential thread that extreme violence and terror were the only appropriate measure in dealing with them.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't come as a great shock then that new research by Sönke Neitzel and Harald Welzer as well as Felix Römer based on newly discovered eve's dropping protocols from British and American POW camps shows that within the Wehrmacht a vast majority of soldiers considered violence against civilians, even women and children in some cases, as a legitimate form of warfare, especially when justified with Partisan warfare. Examples of this, specifically referenced by the Wehrmacht soldiers themselves, include using women and children to clear mine fields; burning down buildings with the inhabitants inside; and the use of public hangings in order to deter support for real or imagined Partisan groups.\r\n\r\nThe frequency of such happenings as well as the level of involvement on part of the individual soldier are hard to gauge but from all research up to date, it is possible to conclude that almost every unit involved in the war in the Soviet Union or the Balkans did commit atrocities in one form or another on regular basis. Similarly, it is hard to number the victims of Wehrmacht atrocities but even discounting the starved Soviet POWs the number of civilian murdered by the Wehrmacht runs in the several millions.",

(1 opportunist, 1 fascist, 1 unlucky, 1 lucky)\nI quite recently learned a lot about my family's history and the slightly chlling details during WWI and II because my uncle spend the lockdown digging through old documents of my grandfather.\nMy grandfather himself was studying to become a telecommunication engineer in former Königsberg when he got drafted and sent to France as a radio operator. He had three brothers of which only one survived. All of the four sons were raised \"preußisch und kaisertreu\" (proud prussians and loyal to the emperor) by my greatgrandfather (a marine general) and therefore willingly accepting the tale of defending their homeland (prussia) against invaders. \nOne brother was a fanatic nazi and joined the U85 submarine voluntarily where he got killed after fleeing the sinking ship by american soldiers refusing to rescue the soldiers from the freezing water and instead, the americans were throwing water bombs at them. \nHis youngest brother wanted to become an engineer like his my grandfather, just got 18 in january 1945 and  when he was drafted out of school a few weeks before the war ended and vanished somewhere in the east where his remains where never found.\nThe brother who survived was a milker who secretely supplied forced laborers with cream and butter whenever he could. When the russian army freed the region, the only reason he wasn't shot, was that one of the forced laborers remembered him and told the russian soldiers to let him go (which they did).\nSo yeah, I would say my ancestors definitely knew about what was going on and taking their sides. It still leaves a big question mark how on an individual level each of them was really thinking about the war but your video gave me another perspective on it, thanks!",

    "text": "You rightfully say at the end of the video, that we cannot assume, that with the end of WW2 and the punishment of the nazi leaders, german society was suddenly cleansed off nazi ideology. \n\nI would go a bit further: We cannot assume, that nazi ideology has ever been an actually integral part of german society to begin with:  We are talking about people who lived in the monarchy of the Kaiserreich first, than in the Weimarer Republik, then in the dictatorship of the nazis and then either in the BRD or the DDR (and some first in the DDR and then in the BRD). Under all of these regimes they were just ordinary, decent citizens, trying to live ordinary and decent lives. They changed there apparent beliefs just as the system of government changed. If they would have had any actual ideological beliefs, at least a sizeable amount would have wanted to return to the Kaiserreich etc., there would have been resistances trying to restore the former way of government. But that was scarcely the case, because most people don't care for ideology.\n\nNow that may sound like some sort oft apology at first glance: Most germans were never actually convinced nazis, not even when they elected and supported the nazis. But what it actually means is that such people would just follow any ideology as long as in doing so they would secure their own standing in that society. It makes their behaviour not less evil, it merely makes their evil a trivial thing, grounded not in evil convictions, but in a lack of any conviction at all - and therefore also a lack of any moral principle. It is wrong to emphasize ideology, because by removing some evil ideology you don't make people morally better. They usually don't really care for that ideology in the first place. They just care for themselves and the possibility to live a decent life and be left alone. And if, in order to live such a life, you have to turn a blind eye against the murder of millions of jews, or the deaths of hundreds of thousends of refugees drowning in the mediterranian, well then most people do just that. The evil here is not antisemitism or racism or whatever ideology you might come up with, but indifference and lazyness. Some diehard nazis driven by hatred against jews won't be able to do much. Millions of indifferent decent citizens however provide the condition for these crimes to take place, not because of malevolence or hatred or some sadistic urge to murder and destroy, but the trivial wish to fit in and to not take any responsibility. So we don't need to argue against evil ideology. But we need to teach people take responsibility. The ideological betterment will then follow anyway.",

Sure, you still have extremists as outlined in this video, but you're at least willing to have these discussions and aren't socially allowed to declare Nazism as your \"heritage\" without catching severe criticism and ire. I wish us Southerners could have this discussion regarding the Confederacy and move towards properly educating our children about the horrors of what slave owners stood for and even died for. You don't have to be like your shitty ancestors. Same also goes for cops in America who aren't willing to hold fellow officers accountable when they objectively fail at protecting people. You're not them, so stop defending them and embrace police reform.",

Thats why Peterson - and this isnt his unique idea - has a point here. We always like to push away those horros commited by humanity as far away from ourselfs as possible (we have call them inhumane), but in reality we are always bordering at it. We arent immune to fachism, state-socialism or religious fanatism and other ideologies similar to these. Such absolute and extremist ideologies go as well with human nature.

What about all those artistic written works from Rome and Greece which preserved to our times thanks to the christian monks who were preserving them and were making copies. What about episcopal network left after the Roman Empire collapsed which helped establish medieaval Europian states which then led to creation of modern national states. Christianity were doing bad and good things long before that even most of the people in Europe had any idea that other continents exist. Yet you deny existence of all this and apparantly for you history starts when Colombus landed in America. Well, I have news for you 1) Christianity existed by that time for more than 1000 years 2) It may suprise you but world history is about other things than colonialism.

    "text": "I think this issue is one of the reasons Johannes Blaskowitz is a figure that deserves more research and attention. He’s a promising general who - after leading the 8th army in the invasion of Poland - is given the title of Commander in Chief of Poland. During that time, he not only writes voraciously protesting the harsh treatment of Jews and Poles but even sentences SS men to death for carrying out such crimes. He’s probably the highest-ranking German commander to resist the Nazi leadership on something that wasn’t an affront to his or the OKH’s sense of authority.\n\nWell, he’s mocked by Hitler for his “Salvation Army attitude” and removed from command and position (and those death sentences are never carried out, Himmler intervenes) - as opposed to just “being shot” as other German generals insisted would’ve happened had they raised serious concern. He’s sent to the German equivalent of Burma, the front where you send misfits you want out of the way, eventually taking charge of part of Northern France at some point. According to author Christopher Clark, Blaskowitz attempted to do in France what he was he was blocked from doing in Poland and conduct a ‘hearts and minds’-centric occupation, but the French had already experienced massacres and harsh measures and were having fucking none of it and walking the line of fighting an insurgency effectively, enforcing measures dictated from higher up, and trying to win the acquiescence of the locals proved untenable. \n\nAnyway, here’s the kicker, later in the war, Blaskowitz - who so adamantly protested the actions going on in Poland and who knows to some degree what must be going on in the Soviet theater (enough to reportedly try and convince Rommel anyway) - goes BACK when Hitler beckons him with an army command - Army group G. Not only does he go back but after the July coup attempt Blaskowitz sends to Hitler a personal letter professing his utter loyalty. I believe only two German generals of this senior level never served on the Soviet front - Blaskowitz and this utterly-irrelevant midget tax-evader named Erwin Rommel, but I could be wrong. \n\nAnyway, Blaskowitz commands army group G for a while and eventually ends up in charge of the still-occupied parts of the Netherlands (or maybe just Holland) during the ‘hungerwinter’ - the period of starvation that occurred there late in the war. He makes an agreement with the allied commanders that if they don’t bomb German positions he wont fire on their airlifts of food supplies to the Dutch civilians. He may or may not have gone against orders to do this, I’m not really sure. \n\nWell, the war eventually ends and ole’ Blaskowitz is indicted at the Nuremberg trials which actually makes sense - I mean, look at his commands - Occupation of Poland, Occupation of France, Occupation of Holland during a famine. At face value it was probably safe to assume he had some dirt on his jacket, however, after an investigation is carried out he’s supposedly informed by his lawyer that he’s going to be acquitted of all the charges. \n\nBlaskowitz promptly plunges off a balcony to his death, which is ruled a suicide - befuddling historians and conspiracy theorists ever since. His fellow prisoners said he was murdered by the SS to prevent him from providing information on their activities in Poland - Blaskowitz big ‘act of resistance’ from earlier in the war. Here’s the thing - the fucking idiots in charge of the Nuremberg trials enlisted former SS men - Hiwis - to act as guards. That gives the theory some bite and I don’t for a minute consider Blasko the type to kill himself, firstly he had YEARS to off himself during and after the war if he felt so guilty - secondly - he probably didn’t feel guilty which brings me to my goal in bringing him up. \n\nThe Blaskowitz story is pretty sad (in say the British or American or even Italian armies, he probably would’ve risen to a high rank and been a decent guy by the low low standards of generals), but he’s not a hero or a martyr and that’s the whole point. Blaskowitz not only shows that German generals could voice opposition without execution (they simply only chose to resist when their authority was undermined on strategic matters) but that despite ALL of the things Blaskowitz did to make his little pocket of hell a little less hellish, he was still a willing cog in the murder machine who justified his position, because of his position - as a soldier he went along with it all despite knowing a decent amount about what was going on. \n\nStill, there is a tremendous amount of humanity to Blaskowitz. His story begs the question, what would you do in his situation? How much can you justify or reconcile? Blaskowitz was not an evil man and he didn’t have to be the devil,, but he was middle-management all the same. It also gives a glimpse into the psyche of the commander’s “ends justify the means” mindset, the command-blinders. Blaskowitz could’ve been any American general in the Vietnam war.",

Not the ‘Manifest Destiny but in a fraction of the time’ level of cruelty. \n\nOf all the useless, self-aggrandizing memoirs German generals inflicted on the world post-war, I think his would’ve been enlightening.

He chose the latter, and thus cannot be remembered as anything but a nazi (and possibly a war criminal, considering how brutal the Wehrmacht were toward the slavs).\n\nIt’s important to hold your morals above most other things, including family history. If someone in your family tree was awful, or fought for a terrible cause, then you must accept that reality. This goes for all terrible causes throughout history, like nazi germany, the CSA, etc. To live in denial of the possible harm a member of your family tree has done does nothing but legitimize what they did, and increase the chance that it happens again. \n\nAnyway, that’s just my two cents.",

    "text": "One of the main reasons why there's this image of the \"clean wehrmacht\" is simply because of how little they were punished after the war, which you mentioned with the statements and actions of Eisenhower and Adenauer. Not to get like, too into this and just ramble in your comments, but I think its important to really note why America and West Germany were so lenient on the Wehrmacht; they needed soldiers to stand opposed to the Soviet Union! When you get down to it, for the American occupiers the USSR and socialism in general was a much bigger threat ideologically, economically, politically than remnant Nazism. That's why America did all in its power to electorally weaken the SPD in postwar Germany even though SoPaDe, the exile SPD organization, was supported by the British. And that is ultimately why a Wehrmacht general, Hans Speidel, ended up becoming Supreme Commander of NATO ground forces in central Europe. I think the ethos of the time was put best by mercenary and former Wehrmacht soldier Siegfried Müller who, in an interview in 1966, described himself as fighting for the values of Western Civilization when he was committing atrocities in the Congo in service of Belgium and the United States in fighting the supporters of Congolese PM Patrice Lumumba. For the Wehrmacht soldier in the post-war world, their worldview barely had to change; their enemies were still the communists that Hitler railed against for years, just now they were on a different payroll.\n\nI actually think a much more fascinating example of denazification is the role of former Wehrmacht soldiers in the German Democratic Republic, mostly just because its much more complicated than what they ended up doing in postwar West Germany and elsewhere. The Soviet Union wasn't interested in co-opting former Nazis like America was, but East Germany did still deal with the large presence of Wehrmacht soldiers in a unique way. There was a political party called the National Democratic Party which was formed and encouraged by communist politician Lothar Bolz to transition former NSDAP members and Wehrmacht soldiers into postwar politics. I will admit I'm not an expert on it by any means, and I still think that there is a lot to criticize in the postwar restructuring of German society in the East, but at the very least they didn't just give former Wehrmacht soldiers high positions or jobs fighting in proxy conflicts /shrug.\n\nSorry for the rambling response btw it was just some stuff I was thinking of as I was watching this! Fantastic video by the way!\n\ntl;dr: the reason why Eisenhower and Adenauer were lenient on the Wehrmacht and eventually the Waffen-SS is because they shared an enemy in socialism and could co-opt the Nazi military to Cold War ends.",

The average soldier is a lot more complicated because most of them had been propogandized at for their entire life, many of them had been drafted, and even if they had objections to what their commanders had done, most of them individually couldn't do anything about it. To call them evil ignores the systems that caused them and, even worse in my eyes, leads to the idea of \"Well im good, so if i were alive back then i would have stopped them!\", which i feel is the worst form of \"It could never happen here\" that a person can have",

You frequently see people saying that \"Well not all Wehrmacht/Confederate soldiers were bad...\" but you never see them portraying their enemies that way. The Soviets/Chinese/Vietnamese/Iraqis are never the example being used in these arguments. If anything, the same people generally view the Soviets/Iraqis as being borderline subhuman rapists or bug people that are all responsible for the war crimes of their regimes. Or even worse, they attempt to compare the two: \"Well, even though the Wehrmacht occasionally assisted in the Holocaust they were not as bad as those horrible Soviets. Look at how many people they raped!\". As if the morality of conflict is decided on who is the worst, and not the fact that those things are happening at all. It's easy to justify your nation's actions through that lense, and it's a scary belief to let yourself be lost in.",

I think you're totally missing the point of my comment: the issue with the way the language surrounding it is often used to minimize atrocities rather than humanize soldiers for political purposes rather than moral ones. Again, reread it. Claiming I'm \"generalizing a whole group of people\" or \"making up a narrative\" is a huge stretch, I never accussed everyone who believes what you do, just some of the loudest (predominantly nationalistic ones like the \"Clean Wehrmacht believers\" in Germany). Your strawmanning my argument by making it into something it's not.",

Even to liberals, conservative policy is, at worst, something we have dealt with and can survive through again, rather than a destructive political ideology that deserves the same level of scrutiny as any communist or revolutionary regime.\n\nIt's taken for granted that the nazis were \"bad\" because it has even become familiar and comfortable to decry their crimes from members of the new right.  What we don't get in discourse in the west is what actual systems and ideas allowed for the holocaust to happen.  Analyzing those things are uncomfortable and unfamiliar because people don't realize how normalized a system of genocide had become to the german people by that time, and they also don't want to reflect on how many of those systems are already in place in their society right now.",

    "text": "At about 20:00 I’d like to expand; \nThis was apart of Nazi rear guard operations, which they called “Bandit warfare” (Bandenbekämpfung). By the very doctrine of bandit warfare, the term “partisan” was replaced with “bandit”, and there were many saying among the Wehrmacht  such as “where there’s a bandit, there’s a Jew, where there a Jew, there’s a bandit”. The doctrine   purposefully obfuscated lines between partisans and civilians with the intent of mass casualties, against even the recommendations of many in army high command. Himmler and the SS, specifically SS General Bach-Zelewski, emphasized that this conflict was to be constant. By 1942, historian Timothy Snyder Sumerians that this doctrine of anti partisan operations “were indistinguishable from massacre of Jews” as the Wehrmacht made no effort to draw discrimination between partisans and Jews. Basically, it’s incredibly fucked.",

Taft is the one who pretty much made it a thing that the Supreme Court could \"reinterpret\" the Constitution and that the Court could decide what cases to hear and which not to. Now the Court has the power to do anything it wants in theory by rejecting cases that challenge unjust laws or taking on cases to basically change the law without going through Congress or facing presidential veto. Thanks a lot Taft.",

I'll never forget how my father, a Northern Irishman who was in the Royal Engineers in Sicily, Italy, and Austria, told me that, while he was \"a kind of Socialist\", something I already knew, he was also \"a Fascist\". \n\nHe admired Mussolini, and when he was in the army of occupation in Austria, serving on ordinance-finding & removal duties, applied to marry a local, Austrian girl. I'm not sure of the extent of her support for the fash, but my grandfather's telegram back to Dad (he asked permission to marry, first to his CO, then forwarded back home) was... interesting. \"Not having son of mine marry one of enemy\"\n\nI assume it also read:\n\"STOP\"😂\n\nOnya, Grandad. No offense to the fine womenfolk of Austria. \n\nDad was definitely impressed by Fascism, although I think his lifelong love of Italian Opera and Austrian food (weekends at the Austrian Cafe in Christchurch NZ, fun times...not) was basically innocent..he just liked the food and the music. \n\nBut he also liked the politics.\n\nHe thought the Nazis were kind of a joke tho. A dangerous joke. Didn't go in for hardline racism. Just the casual stuff typical to a white man of his generation. \n\nHe tended to fetishise power and strength. That was, i think, the root of it. Maybe the Catholicism also played a role, hard to say. It certainly tracks with the \"corporate populist\" variety of Fascism he seemed to identify with.",
