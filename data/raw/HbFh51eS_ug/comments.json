Many times in history though, a form of trans identity still wasn't treated as average either, sometimes an exalted part of the community. \n\nThat being said, we don't find ourselves in ancient Sumer or something, but in the US in 2024 after an election where the right spent $222million on anti-trans messaging for trump. I don't even think that counts the many down ballot  races that even democrats got in on the fun. So I share in your despair. I think that it that piggy-backing on larger bills is a step toward normalization. All liberation is ultimately interdependent and interconnected anyway. Your fight for other struggles endears other oppressed peoples to our liberation. So you are fighting for our liberation whether you like it or not, it is interconnected. Fighting for future generations is not a hopeless endeavor, and us just being as we are is enough. Living our trans lives as if they matter, on some level unfortunately, is a form of resistance towards liberation.",

I try to keep my news intake thorough and well rounded with multiple sources, but from what i can see trump was elected based on lies about who pays for tarriffs, pretending he wasnt on board with project 2025, saying he was going to improve the economy and not elaborating on how, Enough americans voted for him to get elected. I want to believe not all of them were googling \"what are tarrifs?\" And \"how do i change my vote?\" Immediately after the election. I want to believe that some of them saw something good that i didnt. Im stressing about how much more expensive everything is going to get, how we are isolating ourselves from our biggest allies, how he seems to be trying to become the smartest man in the white house by getting rid of anyone smarter than him and filling his cabenet with political donors, and unqualified people even the republican party doesnt seem to like, im worried about him rolling back regulations that are keeping big companies from screwing us over as bad as they possibly can, im worried about people i know and work with having their legally obtained citizenship and green cards revoked for no reason,  im worried about how much the deficit is going to increase because hes extending his 2017 tax cuts to the rich, and adding more to them. So many more negative things i cant list them all. Im worried. I am asking you, as i believe we both care about america, tell me what the silver lining is, tell me something about a trump presidency that i should look forward to, tell me how were not screwed, tell me what made you vote for him even if i disagree.",

As someone who stood up for bullied kids when I was young, & always sought to include others who appeared alone with me & my friends, it boggles the mind when people just stand by. The only time I’ve didn’t do that is when I was older & thought stepping in would embarrass or hurt someone further, like if it was male on male bullying (me being a girl I was also told by at least 2 male people being victimized to please stop - we were teens by then). I wish people had stood up for you, stuck their neck out. I wish things were different now. I could never stand a bully. Just bc I am louder & generally confident, I was often spared by bullies or rather, I would bully them back, which didn’t really fix the problem as it still damaged my emotional health. \n\nAll I know is there is safety in numbers & there is no greater sin than cowardice or apathy when you have the power to change something. As an adult I’ve become soo much more complacent. I lost the confidence to act or speak that I had a kid, but I haven’t lost the ideals. I will no longer let my fellow human being with power slide if they have any form of power to do something. This goes for in public & in private.",

        "text": "Your comment hits hard. \nAs someone who was bullied through much of my schooling, I can  totally relate. In my case, I was fortunate/blessed to have some awesome teachers who did actually look out for me. Mostly they would just make sure they talked to me, but I had a couple who would give me stuff to do or let me go run laps around the playground if I was too hyper. Being in class became a safe space for me. \nNow, as an educator, hearing about situations like yours, where no one intervened, or worse yet actively ignored is angering and heartbreaking. In my classes, I have zero tolerance for bullying or bigotry of any kind. Many of my students come from rough home situations, so I want them to feel safe in my class. \nWhen I have seen issues, they're handled, even if it means me physically getting in between. I know that not all teachers or administrators are like that, but I've been impressed on how many who are in my school district. \nNo one deserves to be treated less than, especially kids in a school setting. School is supposed to be a safe space, so that kids can learn. \n\nThat said, I hope you have a good support network now. Having \"people\" or community is important. Also, hopefully you have access to good MH care when you need it. That's another problem in this country. The fact that adequate MH care isn't available to many. \nI wish you the best through these insane times. 🍀",

        "text": "I remember when I changed schools to escape my bullies, and then, on the very first day, this one kid targeted me. He was short and overweight, with a migrant background and arabic name. It just so happened that my mother had known his dad who had been stabbed to death when he was small. And she recognized the fact he bullied me to avoid being targeted himself, and due to trauma. He was the class clown so that the cool kids would \"accept\" him. It was even suggested to me that maybe he has a crush on me. But, you know, I don't care. \n\nI don't care about these people's sob stories. I don't care about their motivations. This kid could have joined our group of misfits, make real friends who don't just tolerate him. I did hear years later that he grew up to regret it and speak out against bullying, and I'm glad. Everyone should do that. But he had chosen to be a coward and hurt others. I've tried and tried to understand, but what of the trauma and stories of the rest of us? Who will understand us, if not even all of us?",

The short reason capitalism always breaks down into fascism is because capitalism is a hierarchical power structure of inheritance and democracy is a diffuse power structure of solidarity and capitalism can't survive when poor and working class people can identify problems and solve them.\n\nBecause capitalism keeps proving to be the problem and it gets really obvious when the people suffering have the words to express it.",

        "text": "That's simple.  Race and capitalism were invented together to leverage and control European commoners for the enrichment of the peerage, who were basically the only people who had capital to invest.  Colonies were capitalist investments of the various monarchies.  And as they grew, race was refined as a legal and cultural tool to exploit various people for greater and greater profits.\n\nFor example, take the major rebellion in colonial NYC.  Indentured servants, indigenous people, and enslaved Africans united and almost succeeded in overthrowing the wealthy, powerful rulers.    When the powerful won, they deliberately gave each racial group separate and unequal punishment.  They were fairly light on the whites, harsh on the indigenous people including banishment, and publicly tortured the enslaved Africans.  Most notably killing the leader by \"slow burning\" him alive for 7 to 9 hours.  They then outlawed fraternization among the three groups.\n\nThe \"American dream\" involves owning land, because it's the European commoner's dream of becoming a member of the peerage.  That inherently implies serfs to enrich the new peerage.  Those serfs, globally, have been African and American indigenous peoples, and Asian and Middle Eastern peoples to a lesser and generally more recent extent.\n\nWhen capitalism fails, the powerful use race and ethnic bigotry, a romantization of the height of imperialism and racial/ethnic exploitation, and the promise of being rewarded for joining and obeying the cult of whiteness that was and is foundational to capitalism to prevent major class gains.  \n\nThe whole reason European nations have more liberal governments is that their resident racial minorities have been much fewer.  No one is going to forego universal healthcare just to spite a tiny bit of immigrants and Roma or Irish Travelers.  But it's not an accident that British conservatives Britain have been able to chip away at the NHS as their colonial power has waned, and non-white citizens of those former colonies have moved to where their countries' wealth has gone.",

One person offering water to a protestor does not have any significant value by any direct measurement of impact. But the indirect? Immeasurable.

        "text": "@teegee7801 Well the Nostalgia creates this \"mythology\" that things were just definitively better than they're now, and it's a way for you a disaffected person to buy back into the system that put you there in the first place. It makes people think about the time when men were men, and women knew their place, and children obeyed their parents, and morals were respected. This mythos puts the thinkers, leaders, and fighters of the time on a pedalstal, that they have had some crucial insight that we somehow lack. This creates the cycle of longing for a sense of certainty that the system provides, but to fully buy in you must participate in the necessary violence to get your share, otherwise you'll never get access to what your ancestors in this 'mythology' had. It's about purifying all that ails the world today, wether it being the suffrage of women, to the emancipation of minorties to equal status, and through this we'll be able to re-adjust the system, and you'll get your privledges restored. \n\nFacism at it's core is an emotional movement, and has no real underpinning ideology outside of the mythology that the uber-powerful create, and they'll make people year for their old chains. I think that people even think that life was better pre-civil war, and that the civil war era amendments were unconstitutional, or create problems. Although Mussolini created the movement, it was always captured from even back in antiquity with Justinian yearning for the old Empire, that they somehow had some kind of secret knowledge or ability to fix what's ailing the empire today. \n\nUnfortunately it's super appealing to those who feel like their birthright is stolen from them. Young men especially feel wronged, and sign up with gusto to enact the violence necessary to re-establish the hierarchy. Now a-days social and non-traditional media is able to articulate this yearning with Alpha/Sigma content, of Tradwives, and Homesteaders, and Ultra-Nationalists who fly flags and talk about heroic struggles of a beleaguered soldier in the trench or whatever. All of that is part of this birthright..",

        "text": "@josephmarch7142  Why not go back the this?: \"Life for American and immigrant families during the Industrial Revolution in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was marked by significant challenges and hardships. The rapid industrialization of the United States brought about profound changes in family life, work conditions, and social structures. Here is an overview of what family life was like during this period:\r\n\r\n1. Working Conditions\r\nFactory Work: Many American and immigrant families worked in factories, where conditions were often harsh and dangerous. Workers, including children, labored for long hours in poorly ventilated, noisy, and unsafe environments.\r\n\r\nLong Hours: It was common for workers to work 10 to 16 hours a day, six days a week. The lack of regulated work hours meant that families had little time to spend together.\r\n\r\nLow Wages: Wages were extremely low, especially for unskilled laborers. Many families struggled to make ends meet, and even with multiple family members working, they often lived in poverty.\r\n\r\nChild Labor: Child labor was prevalent, with children as young as five or six working in factories, mines, and mills. This deprived them of education and a normal childhood.\r\n\r\n2. Living Conditions\r\nTenements and Slums: Many families lived in overcrowded and unsanitary tenements or slums near industrial areas. These dwellings were often poorly constructed, with inadequate ventilation, heating, and sanitation.\r\n\r\nHealth Hazards: The lack of proper sanitation and healthcare led to the spread of diseases such as tuberculosis, cholera, and typhoid. Infant mortality rates were high, and life expectancy was low.\r\n\r\nLack of Privacy: Living spaces were cramped, with multiple families sometimes sharing a single apartment. This lack of privacy and personal space added to the stress and strain on family life.\r\n\r\n3. Family Structure\r\nNuclear Family: While the ideal of the nuclear family (parents and their children) existed, the reality was often different. Extended family members, such as grandparents, aunts, and uncles, might live together or nearby to provide support.\r\n\r\nRole of Women: Women played a crucial role in maintaining family life. In addition to working in factories or taking in piecework, they were responsible for managing the household, cooking, cleaning, and caring for children.\r\n\r\nChildren: Children often contributed to the family income by working in factories or performing domestic tasks. Education was often secondary to the need for income, and many children had limited access to schooling.\r\n\r\n4. Immigrant Families\r\nEthnic Enclaves: Immigrant families often settled in ethnic enclaves, where they could find support from their community. These enclaves provided a sense of belonging and cultural continuity.\r\n\r\nLanguage Barriers: Many immigrants faced language barriers and discrimination, which made it difficult to integrate into American society and find better-paying jobs.\r\n\r\nCultural Adaptation: Immigrant families had to navigate the challenges of adapting to a new culture while preserving their own traditions and values. This often created tension between generations.\r\n\r\n5. Wages and Economic Struggles\r\nLow Wages: Wages for factory workers were barely enough to cover basic living expenses. Many families lived paycheck to paycheck, with little to no savings for emergencies.\r\n\r\nEconomic Instability: The industrial economy was volatile, with frequent layoffs, strikes, and economic downturns. This instability made it difficult for families to maintain a consistent income.\r\n\r\nCompany Towns: In some cases, workers lived in company towns, where the company owned the housing, stores, and other services. This often led to exploitation, with workers paying inflated prices for goods and services.\r\n\r\n6. Social and Political Movements\r\nLabor Unions: The harsh conditions of industrial work led to the rise of labor unions, which fought for better wages, shorter hours, and safer working conditions. Strikes and labor activism were common, though often met with violent repression.\r\nProgressive Reforms: The Progressive Era (late 19th to early 20th century) saw the emergence of social and political reforms aimed at addressing the issues faced by industrial workers. These reforms included child labor laws, workplace safety regulations, and the establishment of a minimum wage.\r\nConclusion\r\nLife for American and immigrant families during the Industrial Revolution was characterized by harsh working conditions, low wages, and challenging living conditions. While the nuclear family ideal existed, the reality was often more complex, with extended family members and community support playing crucial roles. The economic struggles and social challenges of this period led to significant social and political movements that sought to improve the lives of industrial workers and their families.\"\n\nWhy pick the 50's and 60's?",

Medicare does not cover everything, so a supplemental policy is needed. That costs me $320 per month, but does include a little dental and vision coverage. Oh, and prescription coverage is extra. My prescription coverage is included in the $320/month I pay for the supplemental Anthem plan. And there are copays and other charges that neither one covers. Health insurance is not cheap, even if you have worked full-time for 38 years like I did and paid into the Soc Sec system with every paycheck.\n(The reason I said Part B cost a minimum of $185 per month is because people with high retirement income can pay more than $500 a month for Part B. There's a 5-step scale that's available on line. Yeah, you need to be well off income wise to get hammered by the IRMAA surcharge for something you think you've already paid for during decades of work. It is what it is.)\n\nMedicare is not a solution for people who cannot afford the premiums and the copays There is Medicaid, similar but different, but there again it doesn't cover everything.\n\nThere is always the option of the Advantage plans we all see advertised on tv. The ones where coverage is free or almost free and they give you money every month for other things. Medicare pays them to cover you and pay you and guess who makes the decisions about what medical services get approved. They do. Same old, same old.",

I think the fact that the movies, shows, etc. that have been platformed by the mainstream have sucked ass the past 10-15 years (a little longer probably, but i’m not that old) goes to prove this. \n\nEverything is a story, we’ve always told the best ones, and we’ve got to start telling them like our life depends on it.

Also, many people stayed home because they don't like Trump as a person but also felt Kamala was \"too radical\"; I personally know several of them. They would have voted Republican if DeSantis or Haley was the R nominee. I'm not saying voter outreach isn't important, it obviously is, but you cannot ignore the role of the COVID-19 pandemic in mobilizing people against Trump in 2020 when asking why so many people voted for Biden and not Harris.\n\nEdit: It was also extremely easy to vote in 2020 because of the pandemic making vote by mail more accessible than it normally is.

The caste system still exists and needs to be broken down. 'Black' is a term that strengthens the caste system. Isabel Wilkerson wrote that an African told her, \"there are no 'black' people in Africa\". 'Race' is another term that needs to be dropped. It is a made up concept, There is only one race, the human race. I try my best not to use those terms. If you call someone racist you are accepting it as a reality. Call people prejudiced or bigoted, colorist or nosist or curly hair haters. As I say these things I also know that changing people's attitudes won't work. Changing systems will. If there is a good enough suggestion for what to do and how to do it, it will be done. I am working on it. Policies without Politicians. Saw Tooth not Pyramid. Everyone who wants a say has a say. Change one aspect of social organization at a time. Health and Education probably come first. Food, finance and arms come a close second. Global constitutions with local considerations are needed. Traffic lights stop us but they also allow access to all. People may come on board if the benefits are obvious and there is no alliance with current political persuasions. This is a huge shift in our social organizational approach. I hope to publish soon, possibly on substack. It will be the beginning of a plan and a strategy for transition. All are invited to have input and discussion. I will not live to see it completed but I hope to see it started. Obviously there is not enough space here to elaborate but perhaps I can spark a few like minded people. Thanks to anyone who made it this far into my rave. And finally thanks, Olurinatti.",

When some of these people talk about the election, it's like they're doing everything in their power to avoid talking about the OBVOiUS reason that Trump won - misogyny and white supremacy. And I appreciate so much that you said comparing Harris to Obama or Hilary Clinton is not a fair comparison. Harris was in a particularly bad situation that _no one_ (well, no one with a wide reach) seems to take into account. People keep talking like she could do what white and/or male politicians do, but, because she was a \"bad\" politician, or because she ran a \"bad\" campaign, she didn't do it. That completely ignores how the same behavior is judged differently when white or Black people do it, or when men or women do it, or when white women and Black women do it. I feel like Harris is getting unfairly blamed for - well, not being a white man!\n\nFor me, the bottom line for being a leftist is you must be willing to follow the lead of the marginalized. Always. You cannot do what you want to do and say it's for their own good. That is no different than Trump saying he will protect women whether they like it or not. I see a lot of leftists who seem more concerned about the Democrats winning an election than the people who are suffering in this country. I think elections are important, but we can't raise ourselves above the people \"below\" us in order to \"win.\" That's not really a victory.",

I understood where you were coming from then and if people are misinterpreting it that's a reflection of how lost we are as a group.  \n\nThere is a YouTuber (WW) that commented on how \"united\" the country is over the death of the UnitedHealth CEO. She said liberals should capitalize on this moment to bridge the gap between the left and right. She is one of those people that mistakenly think \"we need to communicate better\" and they will be on our side. We have a large portion of the country that finds it acceptable to vote away people's rights for money. The process to bridge the gap takes time, one incident can't fix that.",

They lost because a strategist idea of a moderate is someone who rides the middle rather than somebody who hates both parties.  They lost because they means test, and focus group, and make decisions based on individualized demographics.   Too much focus on that which is a moral issue (abortion) with not enough on economic issues.  Middle voters go back and forth when they didn't get the change they were expecting from the last guy. \n\nDemocrats are financially incentived by the billionaire, Robber Baron class to fail though.  \n\nThe strategy, is to replace the DNC leadership with someone who will get corporate money out of politics.  Fight for universal programs like Medicare for all, Pre-K, childcare, housing as a right, education as a right, 4 day work week. Actual economic policies that ALL Americans will FEEL.  And then DEMONIZE the wealthy oligarchs who fight against it.  Class warfare. Eat the rich.  \n\nThe sentiment of most people who stay home and don't bother to vote, that would be Democratic voters otherwise, is that it don't matter because both parties are corrupt.  Both parties captured by the billionaire class.\n\nSo long as made up social issues are made to be the forefront of political discourse, the billionaire class will always use the corporate media apparatus to manufacture consent, and trick people into either staying home, or voting against their own interests. \n\nMessaging, leadership, economic populism.

People keep citing how there was lower turnout this election (and there was, but now that it’s been a while, it’s clear it wasn’t as wide of a gap as we thought) without mentioning the amount of mail-in ballots in 2020 due to the pandemic. People that are too preoccupied/overwhelmed need it to be as easy as possible. The lack of accessibility has to do with all the red tape and gerrymandering, but speaking on a personal note, the school I teach at has been really successful at creating incentives to get our HS seniors that are of age to vote. Counselor gets everyone registered during a study hall period, and there’s a dedicated day where we take the kids to vote (a field trip basically) and get them lunch.  \n\nIt’s going to come down to community initiatives and targeting legislation in your area that makes it harder for people to vote.

        "text": "@njpme  Who is \"we\"? You act like \"we\" didn't just make it through a whole pandemic. A pandemic, I might add, that was poorly mismanaged because the previous administration LIED about the severity of the virus and would not implement federal health and safety protocol.  Bob Woodward was able to to investigate that 45 new about the virus as early as October 2019. He lied about where the virus came from and how it spread to the US. He politicized a health crisis, and spread xenophobic rhetoric about the virus. As a result, our economy shut down and our supply chain collapsed. The current president implemented a child tax credit for parents with new born babies and a monthly tax credit that he tried to make permanent. It passed Pelosi's House and it died in McConnell's Senate.  Build Back Better had important investments in infrastructure that would have lessened dependence on fossil fuels and created jobs to address climate issues. It passed in Pelosi's House and died in McConnell's Senate.  The inflation that you speak of is a result of GREEDflation. Our supply chain has stabilized, but greedy corporations,  bringing in record profits this year, continue to charge Americans more for less. One candidate had policies for price gouging. The one coming into office next month DOESN'T.  The housing market? An the majority of purchases of new and existing homes are being purchased by CORPORATIONS. They are buying up entire subdivisions and driving up the cost of home purchases. One candidate had a plan to help first-time homebuyers. The person going to the WH next month doesn't. Lastly, Biden's DOJ has been investigating property management firms that have been using software to drive up the cost of rent while also having vacancies properties. They are using algorithms to create false supply-demand rates. So please miss me with this GOP and cable news talking points and actually research the facts. Because if you were really worried about the price of eggs, gas, milk, bread, and bacon, the American people sure as hell wouldn't have voted the way they did AND be spending at record numbers this holiday season. You can't piss and moan about eggs and bacon but go get a 65-inch TV and PS5 at Walmart on Black Friday.",

We’ve seen before how support for progressive policies can be achieved when it is disconnected from “progressivism” in the minds of the public. I mean, there’s a decent amount of right wing support for legalizing weed that will evaporate in a heartbeat if Dems choose to campaign on it.\nThere was a slew of studies after 2016 attempting to explain the results of that election, and by far the best predictor of support for Trump is an inclination toward authoritarianism. *How did researchers measure authoritarianism? By measuring people’s views of parenting.* People who support the subjugation of children will support the subjugation of any other group. And it kind of doesn’t matter what else they might believe, to an extent, because they believe that people should not have control over their lives. They kind of want to just surrender themselves over to whoever promises to be in control.\nTBH, I don’t see a solution to this that does not include child liberation.

    "text": "I'm a white person who talks to coworkers and acquaintances quite often about leftist topics, and I don't know to what extent I'm viewed as an insufferable interlocutor by most in earshot, but I feel like I see a lot of success in these conversations, and a lot of people who used to say they were libertarians (or \"classical liberals\") are pretty radically left in my social circle.\n\nI don't know if I can say I've found the secret ingredient or whatever, but I've always hated buzzwords, and unfortunately, \"the left,\" \"progressive,\" obviously \"woke,\" \"inclusive\" and many such words are in this category. I'm actually alarmed at how fast the buzzword umbrella is increasing.\n\nAnyway, it's kinda sad when you put it in the way that \"you have to trick people,\" but the truth is that we're taught a lot of things about how we're supposed to treat or regard people as kids that becomes... just sort of background noise as we grow up? A lot of people seem to lose sight of how things should be, but it's also easy to remind them that people shouldn't be bankrupted over a broken arm, and minority groups should be protected because everybody should be protected, right?\n\nThese things really are apolitical when you scrape off the buzzwords. When people see both left and right as a valid choice, they don't yet know how antithetical the US right is to common sense. They need to be reminded what the common sense is and that wanting the best for other people isn't just a childish fantasy that they need to let go in order to grow up. Unfortunately, all the major news media organizations and personalities seem to be screaming this message at us 24/7. Even the \"liberal\" ones.",
