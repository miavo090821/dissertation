this video was brought to you by Ray conon stay tuned to hear more about that later on the heels of Donald Trump winning the 2024 election I made a video sharing my thoughts many of which made many different kinds of people angry but one particular thought I shared really struck a nerve with some of the people on my side of the aisle and that was my assertion that the results of the election are proof that the country has moved further right I asserted that Republicans winning all across the country the presidential election the house the Senate as well as defeating Progressive legislation on the ballots all across the nation and the many many polls throughout the election season as well as the final exit polls that stated clearly that Americans feel that the Democratic party and KLA Harris alike are too liberal which much to my chagrin is far from the truth but that it all stands as proof that the country moved further right explicitly rejected the left and that KLA Harris would not have won running on the leftist platform many of us would have liked her to and I haven't changed my position but I want to expand on it because I realized that many people seem to have misconstrued my points misunderstood the point or willfully misinterpreted it in bad faith to push their own fruitless agenda that I'm anti-left or blaming the left or not the real left so allow me to both reiterate and expound on my position for those who care in my Election Day video I said it's obvious that America has moved further right and would not have voted for a truly leftist candidate or platform and some have taken that to me and that I'm happy with that that I want that to be the case or that I'm in some way arguing we should move further right or abandon leftist beliefs or something none of that is the case I'm simply identifying the sad State of Affairs we have found ourselves in I am attempting to identify the problems we are facing so that hopefully we can address it because we cannot fix a problem we won't acknowledge exists I have always recognized that our views our Progressive values are in the minority we are challenging the status quo so we have always been fighting an uphill battle and that will continue to be the truth although that Hill will be much sleeper going forward but nevertheless we have been swimming against the current trying to get the majority have been indoctrinated to hate other to see helping one another as the true enemy ah welfare ah socialism we've always been fighting an uphill battle trying to persuade them over to our side by trying to challenge debunk and dismantle their entrenched foundational beliefs so I'm not sure why anyone would misinterpret me pointing out that we are currently losing that battle by a lot more points than I would like to mean that I think we should give up or join the majority what I'm saying is we need to stop deluding ourselves into believing a nation full of people who are so Prejudice they can be easily convinced to support a raging bigot explicitly planning to destroy all of their lives because they're just happy to have their neighbors lives destroyed are really on our side that a couple of quick fixes and messaging changes in three months of a campaign would have done the trick no we're in much worse shape than that we obviously have a lot to do to move America to our side something I hear a lot is that Americans support Progressive legislation when they don't know it's Progressive legislation and when this is said it's usually said by someone trying to advance the point that Americans are really more Progressive than we're giving them credit for but I'm here to tell you that tricking a bigot doesn't make them a progressive if you have to trick someone into supporting Progressive legislation that would benefit them because if you told them the truth they would oppose it because they prefer to align themselves with politics politicians and ideologies that won't necessarily benefit them but will explicitly harm others the fact that you were able to trick them does not make them a progressive it's not proof that America supports Progressive legislation it's proof that they are both a bigot and an idiot which is a lethal combination the fact that Americans oppose Obamacare but support the Affordable Care Act is not proof that they're secretly Progressive it's proof that they're racist and dumb the fact that Americans hated Michelle Obama's healthy food agenda when the Obamas were in office but can easily accept RFK Jr's bootleg knock off of it make America healthy again is again proof that those people are racist and dumb in fact it's proof that they're so racist and stupid they won't support legislation that would benefit them a nation that has to be tricked into helping others but flocks to a candidate and party campaigning on the promise of destroying the lives of millions of people is not one that will be so quickly won over by the tweaks and messages I've heard so many people throw out and I'm not saying that because I think the Democrats did nothing wrong I'm saying that because I want people like me who are in the business of trying to bring people over to our side of thinking to go back to the drawing board and and figure out how we start walking some of these people over to our side and to stop embracing these silly ass Notions that our beliefs are secretly popular and Americans can be easily swayed overnight if we did XYZ I don't want us to abandon trans people black people immigrants Asians Latinos or anything else I want us to sit down and assess how our biases were played on how right-wing media and right-wing politicians have been so successful at playing on people's prejudices fears rugged individualism selfishness and downright stupid and I want us to figure out how we undo it I'm not saying I don't think we would have won on a leftist platform because I'm happy or even okay with that fact I say that with great pain as someone explicitly building a leftist platform whether you believe I'm left enough for you or not you watch who you believe is and get off my ass I simply want us to tackle the issue which is we are losing on messaging we are being out propagandized and we are persona non grata in the court of public opinion and the reason for that Americans consume year round right-wing propaganda in the form of most of their media mainstream independent and social most of the political content people are consuming is not the news or content that explicitly labels itself as political content they're getting it from content that packages itself as entertainment while only pedling Antiquated right-wing views meant to make people look down on and exclude women minorities and the LGBT community it's in the Manis Fair content the tradwife content the gossip logs and platforms like the shade room academics no jumper TMZ and all the other wildly popular plagues in the mind that America keeps embracing but none of that means we abandon our causes our communities are the most marginalized Among Us it means we have to figure out how we tap into the majority's base instincts to bring them to our side how we take what we know about people and use it to our advantage and we can't do any of that if we are hellbent on lying about what the majority's base instincts are if we keep refusing to believe what they have told us about them what history and our lived experiences confirm what we have to do is educate people about about these issues all year round and not only do we have to constantly fight debunk and respond to misinformation steeped in bigotry we have to lead the charge to educate the masses unprompted we have to choose to not just be advocates for oursel and others but we have to invite the people who are other who are most vulnerable to tell their own stories to humanize their own stories to dispel the caricatures of them that the bigots present to the society and none of that happens if we're constantly downplaying the impact and threats of these kinds of content and the ideologies that they espouse especially when it's all significantly more popular than any explicitly leftist political content none of that happens if we refuse to see our pop culture and social discussions are truly political in nature and affect how people see the world around them and thus what kind of politicians and legislation they will support we also cannot do this following the white leftist model of trying to strip race and gender from every analysis bigotry and hate is not as nuanced as we insist on pretending it is it's not economic anxiety or any other term people have grabbed on to explain why everyone but black people voted for a white supremacist it's more than class anybody pedling this idea that the working class was abandoned to explain why white people voted for a white racist like they always do when the Black working class all chose not to vote for a white supremacist and Biden's Administration is allowed for some of the biggest Union wins we've seen in a while is wrong and I mean that even if Bernie Sanders is the one who said it so many people want to divorce race and gender from the analysis of kamla Harris's loss even though it's inextricable from any meaningful analysis of how white supremacist who was impeached twice and incited an Insurrection beat a far more qualified black woman who served in every branch of government the mayor fact that kamla Harris is viewed by many of the left as a moderate or maybe even a right-leaning one to some and she never once ran on or even mentioned identity politics trans issues being woke or anything else that the right was able to convince the majority she represented and even many of the white liberals and Democrats echoed these outright facius assumptions is proof of the fact that she wasn't listened to who she actually presented herself and her beliefs to be either ignored discounted unheard or disbelieved and that is itself proof of how misin war and white supremacy functions this effort by white people on both sides of the aisle to render race gender and the intersection of both irrelevant to kamla Harris's LW is reductive lazy and useless and I want to emphasize not just race and gender but the intersection of both because people think kamla Harris's identity and thus people's perception of her is as simple as being black or a Woman They dismiss the Prejudice she faced and the unique perception and obstacle she was up against as a black woman by comparing her to Barack Obama a black man or Hillary Clinton a white woman as though these experiences identities or ples are all the same they are not black women are not either black or woman we are both and that brings about its own specific obstacles the function of white supremacy is to create conditions where white people are presented as having done exceptionally well or having been exceptionally great to explain why a medoc white person benefited from a system meant to benefit them and that's what this post-election whitewashing has been it's meant to paint Donald Trump as an exceptionally great candidate who ran an exceptionally great campaign that was more nuanced than we got while doing everything imaginable to paint kamla Harris is a bad candidate and responsible for not coming out on top in a system designed for her to fail where somehow the only truth can be that she just wasn't good enough that she just didn't do enough I hate the white leftist tradition of trying to present as Progressive and woke by acknowledging racism and misogyny in the abstract but always dismissing it in application fighting hard to have class reductionist Arguments for why everything happens and to dismiss race gender and intersection white people in the world around them have an instinctual vested interest and always coming up with a non bigoted explanation for why white people support bigotry and we're all forced to live in their delusion but I refuse we do not have to over complicate this what's the reason Trump's most successful commercials attacking kamla Harris were the ones painting her as an ally of the trans Community because America hates trans people not because trans people have done anything to them not because the trans Community is even big enough for most of these people voting against them to encounter a trans person but simply because it's that easy to turn Americans the majority against anyone they deem other we can keep going down this list here's another one what's the reason Trump can promise to not just Mass Deport undocumented immigrants but to reverse the Naturalization literally strip citizenship from people who are already citizens who did it the right way why can he promise to end Birthright citizenship and Americans chair for him because they hate immigrants a fact they scream from the rooftop every second of every single day I am exhausted of people trying to pretend this nation and its inhabitants are something it's not because again we cannot fix our problems if we won't acknowledge they exist we cannot sit by and watch right-wing propaganda become more and more popular without being checked for years on end or Worse lean into their Framing and then convince ourselves Democrats could have overcome deeply ingrained right-wing sentiments in 3 months had they simply spoken to left-wing belief systems the Democrats and our failure was not failing to stand up for these communities during kamla Harris's three-month campaign it's the failure to do it adequately for years while Republicans passed more anti-trans legislation in the last several years than ever before in US history and mainstream media leaned completely into Republican hate campaigns on trans people and even Independent Media like tyt home of the progressive left and largest Independent leftist Media actively insisted that the left should completely ignore trans issues because the party doesn't support it and even eventually lean fully into anti-trans arguments and talking points and that is truly not a dig at tyt or blaming the left it's just illustrative of the problem we have on our side of the aisle and I am focused on what we can do better on our side of the aisle we cannot simply ignore right-wing hate and it's also woefully insufficient for us to Simply respond to it after allowing them to construct these harmful and ignorant narratives and to lead the conversations we have to understand that people do not just Embrace left-wing ideologies in a vacuum because they're better for everyone or more intelligent which they are getting people to embrace left-wing and Progressive beliefs and agendas requires us to First help them unlearn their right-wing belief systems before we can even begin educating them about left-wing ones it's a process and it's a process because we quite literally live in a country that systemically and institutionally indoctrinates us to believe in gender rules and the patriarchy and sexism and racism and xenophobia and capitalism that's why it's so easy to get people on board with platforms built entirely on hating trans people hating black people hating women hating immigrants and keeping us all out of the rooms they don't want us in and then calling it a culture war that does not mean that we should move right it doesn't mean either us or the Democrats should abandon our messages or each other it means we have to contend with reality and stop believing there's a quick fix which is why it's not enough to respond to the horrible things Republicans want to do to trans people or immigrants or women or people in the criminal system by telling them it's horrible they don't care because they think it's the way it should be that it's the natural order of things that it's what's right we can't ignore downplay or dismiss the onslaught of attacks in the trans Community for at least the last four years and then expect people to give a that Republican bigot Nancy mace is working overtime to ban trans employees in the federal government from using the bathroom because they've been consuming propaganda for years that have told them that trans people are a threat to them and their safety we can't just respond to attacks in the trans Community we have to actively advocate for them first we have to educate people about gender about gender roles about binaries about patriarchy about the murders and violence that trans people experience at higher rates than any of us and everything in between and we can't educate anyone about the humanity of trans people we have to show them the humanity of trans people and that requires us to give trans people seats at our table not just to advocate for themselves but to be seen it's so easy to other people you never truly see or hear from it's very easy to convince people to believe lies about people if they never get to hear those people's truths the same is true for immigrants homeless people people within the criminal system the list goes on we have to educate each other and we have to craft our messages to quietly address people's preconceived biases and misconceptions out the gate not because I agree with or think those preconceived biases and misconceptions are Justified but because they're there and we have to first tackle them to get people to hair our point this is something I consciously think about whenever I think about how I'm going to approach advocating for any issue to the public take for example Rikers or even abolition as a whole I can want people to oppose Rikers in the criminal system as a whole all I want and I can think that the reasons they should are all that's just or logical but I have to recognize the majority of people are not inclined to agree with me because everything they've been taught to believe about police prisons jails and the people who find themselves trapped within the criminal system tells them that police are the good guys prisons and courts are Justice and anyone who finds themselves on the bad side of the criminal system are the bad guys deserving of what they get so I have to work from there whether I want to or not I know that when people think about Rikers it's infamy precedes it and they believe that it's an exceptionally horrible place for exceptionally horrible people who've been convicted for exceptionally horrible things so whenever I talk about Rikers the first thing I mention is that it's actually a pre-trial detention center and the people there have not been convicted of a crime they just don't have the money for bail I don't say that because I believe we should only have comp passion for people who haven't been convicted or people who may be innocent I say it because I know it dispels their preconceived misconceptions and biases similarly whenever I discuss abolition in depth I go out of my way to explain that when I first heard about abolition that it sounded crazy to me too and that even as a person who knew prison police and the courts were unjust it was still hard for me to conceive of a world without them and that I didn't suddenly become an abolitionist overnight after reading our prison's obsolete because it's impossible to Simply abandon the entire found foundation for your beliefs the first time it's challenged I go out of my way to say that because it's necessary to make people feel like it's safe for them to keep learning more asking questions exploring issues and coming to conclusions over time that I'm not indicting or hating them for not switching over to my side immediately even if that's how I feel internally or what I would like to happen meeting people where they're at does not mean allowing them to stay there it means building your arguments from there choosing messages that will resonate but never abandoning the causes and the communities none of what I'm saying means that I believe I or any other leftist or the left as a whole is responsible for the position we find ourselves in I'm simply diagnosing where we're at and trying to figure out how we can better bring folks over to our side as someone who has managed to persuade tens of thousands of people to support some of my arguments whether you like me
