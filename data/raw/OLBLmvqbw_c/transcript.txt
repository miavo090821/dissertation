you feel like I already have an obligation to be more politically involver at the very least to support these black platforms and creators I wish they would I wish they felt obligated because I made comments about what Drake had to say about this as America a lot of people focused on what artists they think you don't like or who you criticize but who do you like who in this new Arena or in the last however many years who has surprised you was impressed you what would you work for that matter there's no evidence to suggest that you ready for prime time so let's see what you got Roy I was brought up that's tough love there's always a constant discussion around sound like now every time a new female rapper drops us on the Twitter dialogue I guess oh my God another simple track how do you feel how do you feel about our sampling how do you feel about the state of it you know did you do anything interesting with the sample we've never supported them in a mainstream successful way and then when they pivot to something else we act as though they the ones you know abandoned in the blueprint I feel like I said a lot with Chloe is a good example of that chantillo come out a song that I'm like I know exactly where she's going with it it's jigging to the Americans and when I look at my Caribbean timeline you know and and I mean I don't do a lot of these and the reason I'm here is because I think you're one of the people that really got something unique and awesome to offer the first question I have to ask you and is what's it feel like to be an icon hero there is a thing about music when they're when we're all going through something collectively traumatic and a song comes out from someone who is talented and can tap into that vibration the right way that's right it feels like we're all being seen and we're not alone [Music] I don't even know if I uh I mean I received that love but I don't know if I really comprehend that as a concept in a real life way but I appreciate it A hip-hop staple for quite literally over 20 years yeah um I think I I think um most of the time I find myself just being happy that people still give a [ __ ] you know what I'm saying it'd be an honor to like you know be asked by somebody like yourself or like you know people who are you know doing doing uh work uh in in the real world right because I don't really think what the work that I do is like the real world like you know what I'm saying like it's like I talk [ __ ] we play music and I talk about some real [ __ ] but like people like yourself are like really y'all really been in the trenches like really on the front lines or like my homegirl Tamika Mallory or Carmen Perez or you know what I'm saying people that you know my homegirl Erica Ford or you know people who just really been outside and really are trying to be that for people and um so I just I don't know I look at it through that lens um that I'm just honored to kind of you know still be be able to to help people and use my platform and people tune in and and then when I show up to work my key cards still be working and they the advertisers they ran me up out of there yet so we good it's so good that's honestly that's a big deal bro I don't think you you know before long before I was in America I knew you Ebro as a staple a staple in hip-hop and I don't think people even realize I think this is your 20th year at r97 right yeah it is it is that's a big deal what does that feel like uh it feels it feels like a blessing um I think you know I came up in this industry I started uh it was in in media specifically not really you know I don't really see myself like in the music business I kind of see myself adjacent to the music business because I'm not in that business like I help artists get the word all about their music and I pick music that I like but I'm not I don't care if an album sells or doesn't sell you know what I'm saying I just that's not I didn't record it I wasn't there for the recording I didn't have anything to do with like the ideas that's the business of music yeah uh I'm in the media business right so um the media business is very Cutthroat you know what I'm saying you here today going tomorrow you know what I'm saying you show up to work they playing you know I came up in the 90s where they would tell you off top like yo you might come in tomorrow they playing country music so you know enjoy Wildlife you don't own these microphones you don't own this broadcast license they don't owe you nothing and I've definitely been in positions where you know a program director will be like hey come in do this shift and you'll be like okay you know being 17 18 years old you don't know meanwhile the person who had this shift before and then it got into some [ __ ] and and they didn't tell like I'm from that era where they didn't even call you they would just somebody show up to work and somebody doing your shift and you're looking around like yo I had no idea that y'all was going through some [ __ ] they just asked me to show up you know so yeah you learn um you learn that you know every day is a blessing that you know the key card works and the business is still going and you got a place to go right because you're right the industry has changed you see radio in and of itself has been like people have a hard time staying in media in any capacity mainstream independent radio and all these things for any period of time so how do you make it 20 years um I think uh one is stay humble two is understand the tote the the the the macro of the business you know and I think you can apply that to anything that you're doing right like um these businesses are in business to make money and so you got to go in understanding like okay they're here to make money I want to get paid for what I'm bringing them uh what are the things that make their cash register ring and am I willing to participate in those things because you may not be willing to participate in them things so don't show up for the bag and then be mad that the way they go about getting the bag is against your beliefs and then you mad at them like who you mad at like they that's how they get their money like don't take that bag so um I think I've always tried to uh have an understanding of the total totality of the business and have respect for that um and then I think the other part is you pick and choose your moment like every moment uh every every convo every interview every show uh isn't a make or break right like so you don't have to be out here chasing everything and every new shiny object or every new like I've never been the one to chase every interview it's a lot of interviews I'm not doing this a lot of people I'm not sitting down talk to you like I'm some people I'm not sitting down and arguing with you about some [ __ ] that we don't agree on like I'm not interviewing racists like we I'm not doing this I'm not interviewing white supremacists on some you know on the internet today people would be like yo but you need to come to an understanding there's no understanding bro you don't like people who look like me or my parents you don't like that uh you do we don't like each other and that's fine like we ain't gotta like each other I gotta [ __ ] with you you ain't gotta [ __ ] with me I don't believe what you believe you don't believe all right cool peace like go somewhere else with that so I think that's another way too um search y'all just don't [ __ ] with and that's just that Integrity I think that's one of the main reasons I respect you so much Ebro I always tell my friends I'm like I know a lot of public figures and a lot of people in this industry have access to you you know and this information but they will not use it I'm like Ebro will call me up and be like hey explain this right quick what's going on before I even engage with this propaganda is or what's happening with bail explain it for me and I'm like that that goes a long way and I think that has a lot to do personally with what I see your longevity to be right because I think you see times change times change and they change fast they continue to change but the internet and the customs and I'm like you see that from egro like a willingness to evolve to evolve to recognize kind of the times and also to make those kind of like Integrity stances like I've there have been times where you've gone viral for things and I'm like yeah that's what that that's that's what history would want him to say would want him to acknowledge uh politically what's happening make these kinds of you know critiques and I think something I really wanted to ask you about because I think it's probably demonstrated here I've seen people comment about like how some artists don't go like I think Drake is the one I think it was Elliott Wilson that made a comment about them not going to Black platforms like not going to go into these black platforms and making sure they're there and how do you feel about that do you feel like I already have an obligation to be more politically involved at the very least to support you know other of these black platforms and creators no I I don't um I I I wish they would I wish they felt obligated but I don't you know what I'm saying like I don't feel like they have an obligation um you know I I uh I just don't you know I think that and I also don't want people to be phony either like if you don't feel that and you're not connected to that or you're uncomfortable in that or you you know um you know it's just not who you are or how you you know what I'm saying like I don't and and and and I wish that people would be I do wish that people would be more vulnerable like if they see people who look like them going through something they're not connected to it at least maybe say hey I don't understand that how can I help you you know what I mean like what's what's your message maybe I could uplift your message like I don't you know what I'm saying I think but that's how I would do it right like but I can't expect everybody to see things the way I see it or have the lived experiences that I have so I don't I don't feel an obligation now recently you know there was a whole little stuff on the internet because I you know made comments about what Drake had to say about this is America and he's entitled to his opinion but now you talking about a song that for for me like I'm not involved in whatever you and Childish Gambino is going through I just know that in that moment when that song came out it felt good for people who was feeling emotional about the State of Affairs in society and so now you want to take commentary about something that I know is Meaningful to me and my community and people that live in the United States or or have friends who are actively on the front lines dealing with police brutality dealing with you know of you know just just the violence in society and abuse in society whether it's from powerful institutions or powerful politicians or you know or the police state and you know that kind of commentary whether whether you like it or not is subjective it's art it's cool but let's not just act like it's irrelevant or didn't matter because it did matter you know what I mean and so now you want to you want to say something about that so I'm gonna say something about the fact that well why you didn't you don't ever show up but you got something to say about this yeah and I think you know what I'm saying so I think that's a valid right I think it's a valid critique um yeah otherwise don't say nothing yeah and I think that's valid right because you know the obviously the blogs took it out of context all they say is oh Ebro criticizes Drake for not commenting on on race of politics and that's not at all oh yeah they wanted clicks and they that's how they're getting they advertising up right they're getting their engagement up off that you know you take Drake black not showing up black that [ __ ] gonna go crazy and it wasn't my intention for it to go crazy that [ __ ] is like a week old I was just doing what I normally do all the time like some people pick up on [ __ ] I stay some people don't give a [ __ ] you know don't move but on this particular day it did um and and I personally really really really like what Drake brings to the game as an artist like I you know they I don't know you know I don't believe they like me too much because I've had critiques of them before but I've had critiques of Jay-Z I've had critiques of Nas I've had critiques of Beyonce I've had critiques of I mean they're public figures so yeah when you're a public figure and I and by the way and these are some of my friends friends like I consider them friends I support them I want to help them um but that the same way my friends and family if I did some wild [ __ ] or it was off point y'all Olaf's calling me B she's gonna be like yo Ebro you [ __ ] that up bro you need to fix that up Tamika Mallory my son they gonna call me and be like yo you fell short on this like tighten this up and they may say it in public like if I said something in public they're gonna be like look I [ __ ] with Ebro but this is wrong yeah I think that and I want that and we need that and I expect that like like we need that for each other to not feel what what's the term above reproach yes yeah no because honestly sometimes it's like you get these legitimate perspectives right because when I saw that obviously everybody just used the headline and then they launch into a million different diet drives on Twitter everybody's like oh we don't want these artists talking about these things and blah blah but that made me go watch the watch the video I was like I'm gonna go watch the whole thing see what ebro's talking about on YouTube and I watch it and I'm like I don't think people really appreciate how perspectives evolve and these larger things I think you were talking about the way the internet in general like they've been on you for like seven years uh about Uzi right about Uzi in these in these different takes in the way they age then I wanted to ask you like what do you think who do you think does do it right right because we we don't think our artists have an obligation to get involved politically and you don't want them talking talking out of turn if they don't understand or pretending to be about something but who do you think is doing it well [Applause] hmm I think uh um just celebrities or musicians in General anybody anybody um you know I've seen obviously I'm close to it because we just saw the the book of Hove right uh the whole Brooklyn library thing and I know about the Sean Carter Foundation I also know about the critiques people gave hope about the NFL and I understand who Jay-Z's always been as a businessman and a capitalist um I think that you know um Jay-Z has done a great job over a long period of time like we've got to see things play out has he made mistakes short term have we seen things that we don't like or particularly like have we had to you know look during the NFL thing which I was very much outspoken about you know supporting Colin Kaepernick and not supporting the NFL and all of that but I understood that young black men were still going to be going to play football and so it wasn't as if we weren't still going to be out on that field chasing that bag and who's gonna be in those rooms and who so I understood that side of it too I don't love it I don't like it um but I understand and I think Jay-Z somebody that I was like you know what let me see where this goes he's earned the right for us to give him an opportunity to see if he can finesse this into something that we may like later on we don't love it now but maybe we'll like it later on right um so I think he's had a good balance with I think Beyonce's had a great balance with it does you know she continues to do work and do things um you know I think when you're as rich as they are I don't think we're ever gonna be completely satisfied you're upset like we're never gonna be like you know what I mean like it's like you know when you're dealing with billionaires it's like yo fix everything tomorrow you know what I mean so do more like I don't think we'll ever be completely satisfied with people who are at that Financial level I don't think yeah you know I don't I don't see that being a thing um you know and then obviously there's there's uh you know a lot of people you know quietly that have done a lot of things like 50 Cent does a lot of things that people never hear about right right um but even like what he does in Queens and parks and taking care of parks and business and and making sure money flows back and I think that's another thing that I think we often uh look over in this capitalist Society is that we live in a construct that is based on finances and and that's the hustle like that's the whole grift of this [ __ ] they marketed to the world this Freedom [ __ ] and when you get here this [ __ ] is about bread and who's getting it and how you getting it and so I think a lot of times we don't really give credit to the entrepreneurs of hip-hop and the way that we've provided jobs and opportunities through this music even though yes there's toxicity in it but there's toxicity in society there's no way hip-hop or any entity is going to be able to be better in some ways than the the the the levels of toxicity in society like we're we all come Pro pre-programmed and pre-packaged from the world that we kind of grew up in right yeah and and has influenced us and we can only try to be better each day uh so it's gonna come with some [ __ ] but I think we I think I think giving a thumbs up to uh and acknowledging the amount of jobs and opportunities that have been provided uh by individuals that have made money through hip-hop and entrepreneurialism or you know uh even what Tyler Perry's doing you know down in Atlanta and providing jobs and buying that land and all that I don't really I don't know if we stop and really appreciate that level of of uh of business and Legacy and all of the things that are happening right in front of our eyes right now um that puts food in people's refrigerators you know what I mean yeah I don't think we do honestly we very much so live in the time of and I know this that somebody was online and very active on Twitter it was very much on the time of what can I criticize where's the hole in this where's the Gap like we see something good and they're like um but what must be bad where is there a source of critique before we really you know uh recognize the magnitude of the good or where something is creating progress that otherwise was in there and I guess that makes me think of because hip-hop culture the black community in general anything black but let alone hip-hop is given all of the negative attention what do you think is the most underrated positive aspect of WhatsApp happens in the community um I think in sharing of information and sharing of experienced um I think also you know I talk about this a lot because you know I remember when there was a huge critique on hip-hop of sampling right and the artist of you know the artists that came and and the elders that came before us and created these Monumental soundscapes through music uh where pistol was like yo y'all sampling our [ __ ] create your own [ __ ] right like whatever whatever which is valid which is valid critique uh but what we you know what we sit here today and understand I think is that one of the positives was that we were able to remember and celebrate music from a generation before us and keep it alive right and so I think in many ways that's one of those moments that built bridges for generations for us to really enjoy I firmly believe that you know black music is our natural resource and it can't be duplicated anywhere else on the planet and us our stories can't be duplicated and so um I think our our ability to monetize and and own is obviously uh lacking right because of the the infrastructure and access to resources and Banks and you know that whole capitalistic system uh but what what kind of uh emits from our soul and and broadcast from just our spirit to one another and our ability to connect with each other and make sure that we don't feel alone and we find joy and all those kind of things I think that's where um I find uh a lot of a lot of happiness and you know I think that's one of the kind of overlooked pieces like even right now where you have you know burner boy selling out a stadium in New York City right and you have African artists you know working with Caribbean artists and artists who are African and Caribbean in the UK who are working with American artists in this kind of you know reconnection of creativity and art and you know people traveling to West Africa annually just just to have a party and have a good time right like I know people are gonna poke holes in that and you know you should be showing up and doing the knowledge and learning but getting there getting people there is the first step making it commonplace making it regular is the first step The Next Step becomes really appreciating culture and really connecting and sharing sharing what uh each other went through uh and having that familiarity with one another so I think that for me is one of those um kind of uh uh not not smoking or not smoking on victories that we're experiencing right now yeah no that is beautiful and since you brought up sampling I feel like I have to ass because you know there's always a constant discussion around sound like now every time a new female rapper drops a song the Twitter dialogue is oh my God another simple track and we've always done sampling but I think there probably is something to the argument that the samples have become maybe last I think before but you have to tell me I'm obviously going to defer to you um I think before it seemed probably like there was more of them let's look for samples and songs that people maybe might not recognize or older things and it seems more like maybe they're more like mainstream history more readily identifiable identify but how do you feel how do you feel about our sampling how do you feel about the state of it listen I think first you gotta look at you know it's art right so people are gonna like it people not gonna like it like that's just that's just all right uh and then there's some kind of like subjective of like is it good or like yeah you know I think this is dope and you know whatever but then there's kind of like you know when you get off in the weeds of like production and like you know did you do anything interesting with the sample like I think that's kind of what people sometimes are saying like you didn't even do nothing like you just yeah nothing happened like you just right and we and we still love the other song but some of that is generational right because remember Notorious B.I.G juicy they did and nothing happened it was just a loop of the original now biggie is so amazing as an artist and a rapper that that was the amazing piece of it right like his abilities what he brought to it um But after when people heard juicy I remember you know I'm an old head so I remember always being like that that ain't nothing but that ain't too man like this ain't special you know what I'm saying like ain't nothing happening here um so that critique also has been around for a while just wasn't no social media right so a lot of these voices a lot of these voices and these ideas these conversations was happening in barber shops hair salons you know at the club amongst DJs whatever but what nobody posting them online so now the old herods are evolving and we have internet now now y'all know old heads were internet you know what I'm saying that's all it is that's hilarious because that is I'm sure true that is so funny okay um all right who do you think because you know a lot of people focus it's funny when people focus on it's everything the internet our whole world is a negativity Focus right um and they'll focus on what artists say think you don't like or who you criticize but they're not talking about all the many artists you do like and have given a platform and talk to you who do you like who in this new Arena or in the last however many years who has surprised you was impressed you uh impre so I have a layer of response right so it first let me say it took me a while to get used to the reality that when we meet artists now they are not developed and ready for prime time yeah that's right so when we meet an artist now um it's not like what I'm what I was accustomed to which was they know their perspective they know what they want to say they've been developed they've been kind of like run through the gauntlet of like what this is what is this offering you are bringing to the market right yeah it was it was it was kind of like built right yeah now we're meeting people before it's built yeah so I had to reconna calibrate my brain to go okay I need to look at like what's the Raw Talent here what are people finding particularly interesting or special about this offering and what I see today may not be what I see in a couple of years as they figure out their path right and we're gonna see it all happen it's gonna unfold on the internet they're gonna make mistake like we're gonna see the all the [ __ ] and we're gonna have to like sift through that to try to like stay focused on the fact that this person really does have a unique talent they just haven't really calibrated it all and gotten it lined up yeah right so um you know it would be hard you know I would say this um there's a lot of artists that I really really like that are like brand new that are super talented and I hear and see the talent uh but they haven't you know had a hit yet or it hasn't you know because I work for Apple music too so I'm actually in the weeds every day kind of like listening to you know this one and that one who has like two songs like they not even but like oh that's dope or they got a really great voice or this is a great idea but it ain't you know mixed right or don't you know the production could be better like there's so many elements you know I think I think the audience also needs to understand this music is Art but it's also about vibration and people are attracted to certain vibration and Vibes you know you had to wear Vibes vibrations differently but then there's certain vibrations of songs that are Universal yeah there are certain moods that transcend A specific group and can and can connect there's other moods and Vibes that are specific to like a certain group or a certain mindset or a certain geography or a certain you know what I mean so not everything is for everybody um and and so um it's tough for me to say like you know just a couple of names right because like I I I'm surprised by little TJ who's from the Bronx who just really put out of the first album who I've been watching have success for a few years and you know he just survived being shot seven times and this kid been in and out of jail since he's 14 15 years old from the Bronx when I met him he had just got out of jail he's been in jail since high school but he's got a story to tell and he's got an interesting voice and he loves the music and he you know what I mean he's really he's and and not only that but he's a he's an adopted foster kid you know what I'm saying who came up and and you know we know these kids from the Bronx like we see these kids and not everybody gets to survive that [ __ ] you know this Foster system and adoption system and all that in jail and all that [ __ ] oh he been in all that [ __ ] yeah and so and then and so that's this is someone that has a a vulnerable story and he's trying to he's really trying to find his place in the game and he's having success um Uzi vert for that matter you know my boy drama sanduzy verse so I know Uzi vert's Talent from early and you know when me and him had our little back and forth it was me challenging like prove me wrong I want you to yeah like I based on what I'm seeing right now I'm not sure you're gonna make it there's no evidence to suggest that you ready for prime time so let's see what you got right you know that's in my way I was brought up that's tough love you know I mean you might not be nothing bro don't mean we don't love you but if you don't have to focus in tenacity you may not be here but he's still here right you know what I'm saying and he's created a brand for himself and he proved me wrong and I love that and I love I love how he's mixing metal and and finding his his own lane and he's very unique and offering I mean hell even now I just want to rock record is so important because it brought basically like just dropping a break beat in a club and people dancing back yeah yeah right like if you think about it in that context that beat comes on everybody knows what to do hype hype right my friend you know the assignment when that record comes on and we haven't had that in a while yes right and so that's dope too I love that oh that is amazing so that makes me so I have multiple questions that that makes me want to offshoot Ebro because you wanted a few people you know they'll talk to we have a lot of we have a couple of people a couple of figures that I would consider hip-hop Staples and you obviously one of them that are usually they have come up in radio and are still there the shop remains of the world and stuff but you are somebody who has your foot in apple music too so what is that like right because I feel like a lot of other people I feel like the you have a diversity you have a diversified portfolio so I think that makes you the safe giant that you are how does that feel like being in radio what do you think is the future what's happening with radio how do you like your experience at Apple music how's that um so uh uh the question is how do I like where radio's going or or is it is it two-pronged questions where is it going two-prong question um you know radio is um radio's not going anywhere because people keep making things and calling it radio even though it's not even actually radio so you know what I mean like there's like actual things that are like oh this is this radio and you're like well that's not really radio radio is like you tune it in in your car and it's like an FM signal what you're doing is actually an internet stream so it's not really radio but I get what you're saying um so I think in that regard people love the idea of radio right and I think that radio has a place because it's easily accessible and it the other part of of radio that's been great for Generations is it's in some ways very diverse right like you go up and down the dial you hear Spanish you hear you know uh news you hear this type of music here that there's so many different types of things you can run into for free uh on the radio so I think people love free I think many corporations are learning that people love free they don't mind commercials like they will sit through commercials to not pay another subscription so I think people I think people uh in in big business are are seeing that I think whether or not people invest in radio and growing radio and whatever that is is really determined by the advertising world and whether or not they value the engagement or the the way radio is measured right like how the actual ratings come in and does an Advertiser feel like they get good return on the money they spend at that type of medium so that's that aside um then the the Apple music space that I work in um you know I've had the the I guess fortunate opportunity to learn management and dealing with back office and dealing with corporations and speaking their language and helping them understand audience and helping them speak to audiences and this sort of thing so um that provided me an opportunity to to be in the Apple music space so they also have a free radio station on Apple music so I do host a radio show there I do do interviews there but a lot of people don't know that behind the scenes I have a team that I manage and work with and you know work with some of the other Executives on uh you know hip-hop and R B all over the globe uh creating content all over the globe as well as you know other things like you know we have a big inclusion and diversity team at Apple we have something called racial equity and Justice initiative where we're building like incubators we have a thing we do with hbcus at the Propel Center um you can look it up at Clark Atlanta where we bring in students to learn the music business and it's all funded by Apple uh we have a thing in Detroit yeah we have a thing in Detroit um that we just got up a couple of years ago uh which is a program where uh predominantly black women but women almost specifically and and minority groups uh get to learn the business of apple right from a coding and Engineering perspective where you actually get to understand the work that happens at Apple uh and then you go through this program and it and it kind of makes you uh available to get employment with Apple um you know and then we have like you know other things that we do like making sure monitoring and making sure that just that Apple we're spending with uh black and brown and women owned businesses when we're doing contracts for different things all the way through design and all of this sort of stuff so I'm kind of involved in a lot of that stuff behind the scenes that is that hey bro and that's the stuff that you that you don't hear right and people like don't realize the way that you make spaces larger the way that you get more people involved and really teach them this business I you know I was having a conversation with my friend because my friend's very excited for me interviewing you we have been thank you he probably thinks you're gonna ask him political questions and he don't know you deeply in his hip-hop business and I'm like right absolutely absolutely right because we were talking I'm like you know I don't think people under under appreciate not underestimate that radio is still around because I when I had a car in 2016 in law school so I don't know when I had a car I was just an exclusively to radio and how I first became like young M.A was first made known to me because they beat her they beat that song So Bad on the radio yeah that was a joint though hey I drove like three hours into Long Island one night with my dragged my friend so that you could go see young ma perform I was obsessed and I remember the level to which I knew the radio broke that song and that artist for me because I did not know young Ma point where I think it was one of y'all in the radio referred to her as a she and I was like what I keep calling her she why did I keep calling this man is she like I was like oh let me find out yeah so what do you what's the last song you feel like the radio really made the song because I think that's I think the radio made over me you know it I I don't know if radio can single-handedly take credit look a lot of people think radio broke records back in the day and and and the Frankie Crocker days in some ways it didn't right yeah because the label would get it from the artist and they would go straight to the radio to play it in many cases it didn't because it was playing being played at the Paradise Garage and Frankie Crocker heard it and brought it to the radio but then people like showing your mind you're saying we broke young M.A but I know that the internet was kind of buzzing on young in May before we played it on the radio so it's kind of it's relative to you know how you kind of run into to the content um yeah and then some people would debate will radio mix in a household name like it takes it from this you know a small cultural group or a small community and exposes it to other communities but that Community that's coming from gonna be like yeah I break [ __ ] we've been on this yes though that's fine you know what I'm saying absolutely Fox right so and like that happens with Caribbean and African music all the time because I always tell people I'll be like yo if the community don't say it's popping it ain't popping yeah like you can't just take a Caribbean African record and jump on the radio like yo we got this new they're gonna be like nah we ain't co-signed that yet that ain't it that's how people doing chancia now I feel like I feel like the Caribbean is not on on the pop change on on they are doing her very much so like that like chantille come out a song that I'm like I know exactly where she's going with it there's jigging to the Americans and when I look at my Caribbean timeline they are not they're not right and shouldn't see it's fire like talent wise fire yes yes yes and they're not having these changes they are not happy they are not hot and I think it's so funny I'm like we will accept green we talk till we blew in the face about how Drake's Drake Drake will take these elements and co-opt and need watering it down but I don't know one of us that wasn't jigging to all of those but since you do it shinsia it was authentic too and she give a little pop a little mainstream Spin and they like [Laughter] but I think it's because you know there is a you know uh you have an obligation to your community that's a that's a thing you that's the thing and and you know I don't think people um you know people sometimes it's kind of like you know it's kind of like when your parents been telling you to do something and you know and and you go out and you go against your parents and then you gotta come back home eventually your parents is like yo we told you like you should listen you should listen I think the same thing happens in our community where you run out here too fast speeding and you ain't and you don't bring the the people who you don't you don't stick with the people who brought you to the dance in the right way yeah yeah right yeah and it's hard for artists right because artists evolve right like they go out and see the world they go out and live life they you know their their bank account changes and they're able to leave and travel and see new things and experience new things and they want more and new things for themselves but the community they come from has it doesn't get to change as fast exactly right like there's limitations on that change based on you know finances and just based on the fact that [ __ ] I'm going to work every day you was in Spain or you know Prague or from Japan wherever he was I was around you know I was around the way getting this money and trying to get my kid to daycare so yes I love that you wouldn't change but can you entertain me you know and the way I want you to entertain me and yeah it's tough for artists you know um like since she is an artist and every time she drops I'm supporting like because I see what it is like I saw the work from early um I love I love that she experiments but yeah like people be giving a hard way they be giving her a heart give my girl a hard time I didn't give my girl a hard time I'm like y'all please get off and see us back I swear this is a joke they like man no but she it's gonna something gonna happen it I think you know maybe this clip will move around and people will start to have the convo because I think sometimes that's what it is people feel like yo did you forget see because I think what's what's often missed is many of our communities yeah have been uh scorned yeah right by people uh leaving uh not coming home not paying homage right like and so there is a lack of trust yes that you're just gonna run off and and you're gonna take all the stars that comes from our community but not bring us along for the ride yeah yeah that's absolutely true I think sometimes too we I something I see also happen a lot the other side of that is sometimes I feel like we don't support artists in what was their original you know of the authentic or the kind of music it is that we insist we want from them we've never supported them in a mainstream successful way and then when they pivot to something else we act as though they the ones you know abandoned in the blueprint I feel like I said a lot with Chloe is a good example of that like I've been listening to Napoleon Hallie for years I listened the the kids are all right is amazing no amazing album amazing and that never even got the kind of commercial success and the second album ungodly hour did better than the first one but still even though they were them girls were working also let's talk about it in pandemic they were working the most original change in their performances doing everything they could do everything not checking for them on any level they was not checking for them the minute Chloe decides she's a bad [ __ ] and what a post and want to do a pop music why won't you give me a ballad you wasn't listening to them ballads and I feel like that is a thing we also see right artists can you never you don't give them the credit and we also don't want them to switch up please do that thing I was not commercially supporting you doing well and I think two in there is sometimes the math ain't mathing yeah that's true right so that's true they could have been supporting but it wasn't enough people there wasn't enough bodies and so then the artists pivot and go yo I need to bring more people into the store yeah right and so the people that have been in the store he was like yo there's five of us in here and they like yo but I need 50 in here and so you know what I'm saying like they're gonna try to get their numbers up by making a different sound a different vibration so that they could bring other people into the party and the people that's been at the party is like like I don't I only want these people at my party it's my part that is very much so true you know what I mean and so I think it's it's tough it's a tough job it's a tough game uh but I think you know in the specifically for shinsia Chloe and Halle I think um Chloe and Holly excuse me I think um they have time like they so I'm gonna click because they're putting in the work that's familiar I think sometimes too um social media is kind of like a gift and a curse boy right because you know you you want to connect with your people every single day in the ways that you can but in that connection they have they sometimes feel like they already have you so then you release some new art and they're like maybe not passionate enough to run out and get the new art because they feel like but we've been talking I've been seeing you I've been supporting you they think clicking on Instagram and supporting hey hey people and they really do not understand I feel like there's so much commentary from people who don't run platforms they they actually do not get the difference between it'll be like they'll blow down on artists because of artists views on YouTubers and what their Twitter stuff is or they're so their Instagram they're like these platforms are siled what happens on what the numbers you think are on Instagram and all these things an entirely different ball game but people will look at that and hold artists like oh you did that but they did that there but not hair and oh it's a it's a flop and I also think in the same way you said you had to kind of come to terms with the fact that artists are not where they used to be they did not come out fully developed uh in the times right and artists can kind of blow overnight and I think overnight success is it's something everybody seems to want and I don't think is good in most in most I people want that they'd be like oh you want a Vibe of it no I don't I don't want my YouTube a video to go incredibly viral before I have any other content to keep those people there and go there but they're very smart they don't think about things like uh like that and something I realize I feel like artists get played is in the same way that we we can quickly make an artist we also don't give artists any time for anything like an example I saw on Twitter with the other day was dochi song what it is someone was like this was supposed to be a hit like I can't believe you know this didn't blow up but this didn't flop it just came out like four weeks ago if something doesn't have overnight if people aren't saying that something is greatness immediately everyone's like forget it and that kind of mentality doesn't get the wire acknowledged as the greatest show you know what I mean what is the immediate pickup and I think that also makes a lot of artists disheartened because something I think also because you see it a lot you see a lot more artists or just public figures feelings because I certainly be cursing people out on the internet um you you see artists take that to heart more too right because being told having the internet jump on them like they flop you'll see the Ari lennox's be like I'm not coming on this social media with y'all no more you're not getting this live you're not getting this JT was cussing people out yesterday I wonder how you think that impacts what they do with their careers that kind of quick reception oh uh you know I I really don't know I think you know I don't know if there's a right answer um because they're being vulnerable and they're having they're having they're sharing good and bad moments and I think relation ships of any kind are about good and bad moments like if we're being honest right like because you know people love or come up but they love a tear down and then they love a comeback yeah yeah I mean so I don't know if there's a right answer there like you know I think I think being vulnerable has its has its upside uh I think being too erratic all the time has a downside where people are like yo I can't with you like every day is something different you know what I mean like yeah um you know so I don't know if there's a right answer to that question or should I say I don't know if there's one answer to that question you know what boom yeah and and you're right let me see I have a I have so many things that I want to ask you about you bro I'm like well I got you here yes um I guess so all right let's talk about drill music I feel like something somebody pointed this out to me and I was like how was I not gonna ask him about that because there's obviously drill is constantly a thing being focused on and in a very negative in a very negative way especially you know with relation to our mirror you know laws Bill all these different types of things is why I think about it more what is what are your thoughts on the rising like the drill music scene um I think that people I think my first thought is why y'all telling on yourself that's my first start like what are you doing what are you doing um but then my second thought is you know uh violence in music isn't a new phenomenon I think real I think real time violence in a music is a phenomenon right like wait you're talking about something that happened last night and it's on the internet today right you know what I mean like that's crazy um but that has more to do with technology than it has to do with violence and music right from all types of violence whether it's violence against uh each other in our neighborhoods or violence against women or you know any type of violence right um yeah so I think uh I think that's not a new phenomenon um yeah I I I uh you know look I came up in hip-hop man people been talking crazy in these records for a long time and and there's been re and there's things that didn't transcend mainstream that were just around the way neighborhood violent [ __ ] you know what I'm saying like people don't remember the Crips and bloods albums from La that used to get sold at swap meet you know what I'm saying like you had to be in La for that you know what I mean um so there's always been this undercurrent and most of the music that we're talking about in New York City doesn't transcend into the mainstream like when you're talking about these drill records right like they're just big maybe they're big on YouTube they're big on Instagram or maybe they're played in you know late night rotation on the radio station when they're playing like the underground sounds of a city but they're not playing at 10 o'clock in the afternoon but there have been some records you know like when Shmurda and them was talking crazy on on that record like that which wasn't technically a drill record based on what we understand the the Dynamics and the sonics of drill to be today uh like the emergence that I've seen right like that definitely was a thing right and that record was a hit uh and it transcended so uh you know I think once again I if we were if we zoom out and take a macro View we have individuals in our society that live in some of the most treacherous toxic uh death traps that you can imagine in our country yeah that doesn't mean they're not creative and that doesn't mean they don't have something to say and so they're giving you what them and their friends want to hear and say yeah yeah right and they also understand that we live in a society that monetizes violence showed us sure does that is an excellent point me bro so they're not stupid they're like oh I can get money talking about my real life [ __ ] that I'm living right that most of y'all [ __ ] are scared to come fix or won't come fix or right well I ain't even interested in talking to me about it so I I have mixed feelings like there's definitely been times you know I work in the morning so I work six six a.m in the morning there's somewhere I'm like yo y'all we're not playing that bro it's eight o'clock in the morning we're not playing that we're not playing that it's not happening I'm not playing like that is not the Vibes that I'm starting it's eight o'clock in the morning we're not doing it I took the bar listening to the most I took the bar my bar exam listening to the most violent hype trap drill music if you hear what I listen to and then when I show up in court you know based on the attitude I'm giving the prosecutor back right if I listen to rap I'm on go I get the court ready to fight well and you know a lot of people use it for working out or whatever their challenges are that they're faced with today right because that's the same energy that these people are making this music in like ah yeah you know what I'm saying I'm trying to survive I'm trying to live I want to get the [ __ ] out of here and what is the fastest route to me getting a bag to get the [ __ ] out of this [ __ ] that I'm in absolutely right so um and I've also I've had these debates for a long time people be like you know do you feel a responsibility should you be supported she and I'm like it's tough so I'm I'm not gonna support a kid who's trying to get out of a situation and help him see the world help him or her see the world and then there and inspire you know other young people that maybe they could come home and tell them hey yo there's a world out here that you ain't even gotta like all of this [ __ ] we doing we ain't even gotta do that this whole world out here that loves us you know what I'm saying wants to see us when we when we travel they love black people the world many parts of the world just want to see us because we are on planet Earth we are some of the most highly beloved remarkable human beings with a unique experience that nobody has ever been through and when they see us survive it they want to meet us they're like yo you survived that [ __ ] like Bravo they may not like how we went about it they may not like all of those things but you know I think I I get torn it's I'm torn that's the answer that's the answer I mean you know me too because I think there's a I think one I think there's a way to do things I think you could think that something ultimately is destructive while recognizing their the lived reality of somebody and the validity and certain like feelings or how they came to certain positions or why they're even response to things is a particular thing because at the end of the day where the product our environments and I think too you see the other side of it is we'll say we don't you know the people that criticize that kind of music or be like oh we want these artists to change we want them to make it but then when they do we do see a sign of them kind of being like I've survived and I'm kind of chilling I'm not on that the way we're not happy because every time Bobby Schmurda do a little jig put out a little wholesome Bob they like hey we we waited on you bro they are mad they are mad every time I'm like how about this and Bobby's in a place where you don't give a [ __ ] he don't have nothing to prove exactly he like look I don't want to be that person I'm gonna go out here and meet these girls yeah y'all gonna see me with some white girls I ain't never been with white girls before I'm about to go see what this is all about you know what I'm saying and I'm about to go out here and I'm about to put some different clothes on and laugh and smile and dance and do what I do and ain't none of y'all gonna tell me nothing cause you know what you know what this really could be and who I really was yes and they and we should look at that we should look at that as success like I watched a video on YouTube the other day it was like oh Bobby Shmurda the biggest flop and some white guy and I'm like babes is that is that not him truly being successful and making it is that not it because I'm not looking at my child I don't want my child to work as much as I was working if my child could be an American citizen and be chilling I love that for you congratulations it looks like you've won right yeah you had that perspective like that's perspective right there and I yeah I just think we lose sight of that like um and also the internet's not real let's be honest y'all like at some point if y'all not real y'all not really mad y'all not really you you you're mad you're mad in the in the safety of your own little Enclave wherever you are you're at your desk at work man just cause you ain't got nothing better to do you don't want to do the work that's in front of you but you're not really mad you're not really mad and you don't really care having those fights in real life no exactly exactly you know and you know I know it too I have to check my own self right because Twitter is funny Twitter run so much discourse but it's a very small percentage of us on Twitter that I actually you know putting up most of the takes and I think to myself sometimes like the amount of times I want to jump down somebody's throat on Twitter for something that if they said to me in the hair salon like if I was at my hair salon in Harlem and we talking jokes you know I'm hearing this different thing or blah blah and it's not a problem like someone to tell me a take in real life that like I don't agree rebate but we have a whole discourse I don't think you're demon but I heard on Twitter and I'm like what you saying and I have to check my own self like ma'am please close this app look what it's doing to you it's prying your brain miss Mama see um something I wanted to ask you Ebro is how because I'm gonna ask you a couple more questions but I let you be free because I know you were a busy man and I so appreciate you um it's basically one like how's the landscape changed right because I you have again you have a you have a look at this this whole Arena of like what's expect or and how do you or more so I guess the question I should ask is how do you think your role your role in hip-hop and the work that you do has changed over over the years like from beginning to now um you know I I feel like my role I I don't even know what my role was in the beginning right like I just was happy to be here right like I was just kind of like oh I you know I gotta I got a show on the radio and I get to play music and they you know I'm meeting artists and you know I get to identify records but then I also got to do the [ __ ] that I don't want to do which is you know bring play songs I don't like and that's just part of the gig you know what I mean that's what it is yeah um and then I think now um I just try to be someone who can you know impart some information on a young artist and let them know from where I sit and what I've seen how the game's gonna play out or ways for them to manage longevity or you know um helping other media folks if I can understand where the opportunities are and you know Mentor folks when I can and you know help them understand where where business is going right like um I think you know one of the things I always talk to people about is following the money you know like you know I know I know you got things you want to do and you got your dreams but at a certain point you know you're gonna have to figure out how you're gonna pay these bills and and what life do you actually want for yourself um so uh some of that just being just being an old head you know what I mean and trying to be positive and then also being somebody who's not afraid to give give tough love or a tough you know take on something that I see some [ __ ] even you know for me even if people um disagree with me that's fine I just want to make that make sure it's on the record that's it like y'all ain't got to agree it might be unfun what I'm saying I might be ruined in the moment just want to make sure it's on the record I said go ahead do what you got to do it's on the record so when they look back at this moment in history somebody said something about the [ __ ] yes and I yo and that's that brings I'm glad you brought it full circle toys saying at the beginning like you are a person that says I'm thing that I think is very aware of what the times are and how they change and tries to adapt to that and you know I want some advice for you while um Harry because you're right you are media which is why you are because I'm media Jason I'm my hand in many different you know pots what is your advice and also do you think because the you know like they're all these figures coming up who do you think uh as far as any other in the hip-hop and media who do you think is doing a good job any new emerging figures you like anybody you think that'll be around and what advice would you give Ebro I think there's a first there's a lot and there's a lot of people doing a great job um yeah a device I would give is kind of what I said earlier in the convo which is don't don't make your brand or whatever content you're creating reliant on other people's content meaning I got a word if you are creating content and the content you make is reliant on an interview yeah you don't have anything else to offer other than asking someone else to come and sit with you you probably want to take a deep look at that because everybody there's gonna be Ebbs and flows in that yeah right then the other part is um you know uh I think you gotta scan the landscape and ask yourself what what can I bring to the table that's unique yeah right um which isn't the which is The Road Less Traveled you know what I'm saying so it's tough right because it's easy to go ahead and Chase down where the money is for the sake of short-term bag but are you really building longevity that way if you're doing what everybody else is doing yeah because then when the when the world shifts what do you do what are you gonna have right what's your pivot gonna be uh and on that I think I think you do have to kind of plan your pivots right yeah you got to say hey what are my strengths um you know what am I doing today like even me I still think I have ideas that I haven't even got to yet and I'm on the radio every day you know what I'm saying and there's things that I just have stockpiled from other things I've done in the past that I'm a remix to the future you know angles that I could take on you know ways to engage the audience and get them involved right um and so I think you gotta just kind of map that stuff out for yourself uh and then I think you also gotta know how to build community absolutely thank you bro yeah you're welcome thanks for having me it's great to see you I love your work um you know and and I mean I don't do a lot of these and the reason I'm here is because I think you're one of the people that really got something unique and awesome to offer right not only cultural takes but you've been in the courtroom you've been in these jails you have passion for it you understand politics so I think you're you're uh very um very well well-rounded in in what you have to offer in a conversation and I think that's so much you bro right I think that's super unique right like from from election coverage to local politics and police to music to you know what I'm saying to you know I think I've seen you talking about uh uh well I see each other are you talking about relationships or something one time hell you could even do pet you could do a pet show you know what I'm saying what's the cat's name yeah yo you and Raheem will be out here bro y'all that's like I just gave that's like five different shows Hey listen and Ebro the minute the US government give me my green card I'm out of here hey I'm off to the races okay I got it in the tank trust me they're gonna have all that cat that cat is gonna earn his key every day and
