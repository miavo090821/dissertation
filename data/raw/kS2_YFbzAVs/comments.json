(BTW Clinton left office in 2000, 3 years before the Iraq War). You have confused the ICC with the International Tribunals of Nuremberg and the Far East (Tokyo), which were inspirations for the ICC but were not, you know, the ICC.

He and the few survivors of the POW camp in the slaughter house walked out to see only devastation and in the book that is portrayed in the most bleak and objective way. the book is half science fiction, dealing with a character who experiences time in a non-linear manner. but the period marked by war in the characters life is the first hand account of the author himself. and it paints noone as heroes. you dont finish slaughterhouse 5 with the sense that the Dresden bombing was an uncharacteristic act of villainy, you leave the book with a sense of the horror inherent to war itself. Vonneguts main thing in the writing of this book was to show how young and unprepared the american soldiers were. his firsthand account in war was brief and filled with needless suffering. there is no trying to recontextulize the dresden bombing in the book. just a bleak chapter in a mans life.",

He said he was sure Vonnegut wouldn't agree with this interpretation, though. And I'm almost certain the book is more about how it feels to the main character, rather than being a solid case against trying to wrap your head around history and understanding what happened - an enlightened and critical view. \r\nAnyway, I didn't feel comfortable reading this especially knowing that to him Auschwitz wasn't as bad the Dresden bombing, simply because Auschwitz was slower and not one big massacre in which a lot of people died in a short time. (Slaughterhouse Five - Kurt Vonnegut (Bloom's Modern Critical Interpretations p. 84, if my paper can still be trusted), thereby completely neglecting the quality of the matter or the historical context.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong even the Royal Air Forcer (or the American Air Force I'm not sure tbh) completed a report which effectively made clear that the \"Moral Bombing\" had no effect and that in fact the allies had underestimated certain parts of the german industrial centers, such as big transformer stations and the vastness of the german electrical network, thus bombing the wrong targets. \r\nNevertheless the way people deal with this book is objectionable.",

The book implies nothing of the sort. and it is very odd to me that you would acuse of \"warping historic facts\" the first hand account of a man who was actually there. \nAlso if read Voneguts other works you can know exactly what the \"So it goes\" phrase means. He explains explicitly that this is a phrase he uses in the end of stories to make it clear that in real life, stories have no end or begining. You assign some moral equivalency for the times when he uses the phrase that simply wasnt put there by the author. \nand if you finish Slaughterhouse 5 with the sense that all sides of the war, and indeed all humans are following a deterministic path laied out since the big bang and that the universe has no moral, then good. Vonegut point with the the aliens that see future and past simultaniously as immutable is exactly to paint the picture of an uncaring universe that offers no moral standart but the one we make ourselves. both the villains and the heros die in the same war and the war itself continues to be appaling. \nIf you can read the book and still talk about moral bombings or lesser evils that only shows you didnt get what the point was. Slaughterhouse 5 is about children suffering in a war they dont fully understand and how humans assing meaning to that suffering after the fact when in reality the universe is a cold uncaring one.",

Well, maybe kind of, but there are certain light houses and certain dark storms you can make out easily and stir for or avoid them. So some things, even on the vast open see of consciousness in the universe are pretty clear and of that is that suffering Nazis are not the same as suffering Jews in World War II.\nAnd how can you say, that determinisitc view is good? Or rather you say that interpretation is good, but I don't see you saying that view itself sucks. Because it does big time, as, as I have pointed out it exculpates everyone, making a Nazi deciding to kill a Jew just as meaningless as a soldier trying to save one. Sorry, but that is just mad, cold and uncaring and don't tell me, that is just the way the universe is, because with that attitude you might as well have fought for the Nazis or the allies and it wouldn't have mattered to you; That is exactly the damnable viewpoint I loath so much.",

It's not that the main character SHOUDLNT do anything, it's that he CAN'T. Lack of agency is only really for him, because he's the only one who time travels. Those fighting go on because they think that their country is threatened or that innocents will be killed, but only our \"hero\" can see that even passion enough to kill for is ultimately killing. It's not that we shouldnt ever use violence, it's that it really, really, really sucks for everybody whenever it's used, deserved or not. It always sucks, even for those who are right (though have no way of knowing, because they're not time-travellers). \nAs to Auschwitz, I see nothing that is exculpatory of Nazi genocide. His saying that Auschwitz \"didn't count\" as a massacre because it doesn't fit into our silly categorization of \"massacre\". He heard Dresden was the \"biggest slaughter\" and then says \"I guess the fuckin genocide didn't count then..!?!?!\"",

He is not minimizing death by offering the same epitaph to humans and animals alike; he is urging the reader to see that _life is life!_ the phrase “So it goes” is bitterly ironic. It’s a scream into the blackness of oblivion, saying that in spite of the incalculable suffering, life is precious. You’re not supposed to agree “So it goes.” It’s supposed to alert you to the idea that beneath the banality, what has happened - what _is_ happening - is horrible and tragic. \n\nAlso, the whole thing is as potent a metaphor for POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER as I have ever encountered. (And I have firsthand experience with the affliction).  \n\nI would recommend that you try reading MotherNight, Slaughterhouse Five, and Breakfast of Champions to better grok Vonnegut’s intended message. All three novels are basically identical thematically, and serve as refinements on the core theme and moral philosophy. \n\nAll of that said, I must agree with you assessment of Vonnegut’s quote on Dresden vs Auschwitz. What a horrible, pointless thing to say. I hope there was some larger context, because it physically pains me to read these words.",

(See what I did there?)  ;)\n\nMy real reason is that the B theory of time where all potentialities are equally real is vindicated by relativity and I believe that determinism is true, yet the awful consequences of determinism as a worldview don’t affect me. \n\nJust because a person’s actions were determined before they occurred, doesn’t mean they necessarily have the same moral weight. So many steps in the chain could have been altered and their actions could been prevented if something in their environment caused them to act better or worse. I absolutely think a Nazi killing a Jew is worse than a soldier saving a Jew. Neither of these events are meaningless. Every actions has a reaction. Hearing the first, I scowl. Hearing the second, I smile.\n\nI think the world is deterministic, but the thing is that I can be one of the factors that help determine my future. If I don’t put effort into doing my part to make the world better, then the world will surely be worse than if I had. Causes have direct and traceable effects. I can be a cause that either affects the world for better or for worse, and it’s up to the molecular activity that makes up my thoughts to determine which. (I’m shooting for the former). \n\nI hope this provides a more hopeful alternative to your interpretation of determinism as a “...viewpoint [you] loathe so much”. I also hope you have a great day.",

        "text": "@juliadonati8245 thanks! Appreciate you reading my words and agreeing with my interpretation. Vonnegut was like a father to me in some ways. His books taught me about morality, humility, and storytelling writ large. That last one is especially important as I am a writer by trade. And Vonnegut definitely set me down that path. \n\nFunny thing about the word Grok. I learned it as just a word. It was something my college girlfriend would say. She learned it from her father. It wasn’t until years later that I learned it was a reference to Stranger in a Strange Land. But that’s the sign of a good neologism. You can use the phrase independent of the original context. As lovely and detailed as the Nadsat is, no word of phrase from that lexicon can hold up to the sheer utility of “Grok.”",

I've been studying military history for more than forty years. 100,000 is a very reasonable estimate. 35,000 bodies were recovered, but obviously they couldn't recover remains that were totally incinerated, and they also didn't recover remains that were trapped under rubble. Like I said, the population just a few years after the war was at least down by 100,000. What I am suggesting is that someone try to model the bombing attack, which took place over about three days, with hundreds of tons of bombs dropped. It was the first attack using more than 1,000 heavy bombers, and they deliberately came back the next day when rescue operations were underway. In case you didn't know, Germany is still occupied until 2099. They aren't even in charge of their own country. The victors are still in charge, so obviously they might have an agenda to downplay the losses.",

He said he was sure Vonnegut wouldn't agree with this interpretation, though. And I'm almost certain the book is more about how it feels to the main character, rather than being a solid case against trying to wrap your head around history and understanding what happened - an enlightened and critical view. \nAnyway, I didn't feel comfortable reading this especially knowing that to him Auschwitz wasn't as bad the Dresden bombing, simply because Auschwitz was slower and not one big massacre in which a lot of people died in a short time. (Slaughterhouse Five - Kurt Vonnegut (Bloom's Modern Critical Interpretations p. 84, if my paper can still be trusted), thereby completely neglecting the quality of the matter or the historical context.\n\nDon't get me wrong even the Royal Air Forcer (or the American Air Force I'm not sure tbh) completed a report which effectively made clear that the \"Moral Bombing\" had no effect and that in fact the allies had underestimated certain parts of the german industrial centers, such as big transformer stations and the vastness of the german electrical network, thus bombing the wrong targets. \nNevertheless the way people deal with this book is objectionable.",

        "text": "​@LinusE \n*Petty personal bickering section*\n_________________________\n\n\"It's ok to be a jerk on the internet because it's the internet\". ...followed by a bunch more \"You obviously don't understand _____.\" \n\n\"Quite frankly, through your writing seem like you’re very loose and what you’re trying to say.\" ..criticizing my writing with a sentence that doesn't even make sense.\n\nAwesome. \n\nI edited that reply almost immediately after typing it because I re-read your comment one more time and decided to both subtract from and add to my response. I didn't know you had already responded. If I were trying to hide things WHY WOULD I FREELY ADMIT I DID IT? Stop trying to \"own\" me for 20 seconds and use your brain for god's sake. \r\n\r\nI've written enough here to illustrate that I'm clearly not the idiot bro that you assumed I was in the beginning. Just drop the schtick already and I can stop calling you out on all your logical fallacies. \n\n*Actual debate section*\n________________________\n\nI'm VERY familiar with the concept of \"H denial is a danger to our democracy\" rhetoric. First of all, I think it's laughable BS. If it's such a fringe, wacko belief and the historical record is unassailable, how are these deniers a credible threat to anyone besides a few other idiots?  ..and how is that specter of a _possible_ future threat more dangerous than the _actual current threat_ of making certain parts of history \"illegal\" to discuss? That's absurd.  \n\nNormally, legally censoring history would be setting off alarm bells - but this time it's totally different because \"muh Nazis\". Nah, man. I need a WAY better argument than that. \n\nAlso, who gets to define H Denial? There's a WIDE spectrum of opinions and people that are smeared as deniers or bigots and only a percentage actually are. Who gets to define \"misinformation\" when we all decide that censoring misinformation is also normal in a free society? Who defines these \"dangers to democracy\" and do the people enforcing them have conflicts of interest? Common sense concerns - based on knowledge of history. \n\nYou're really ok with normalizing this type of top down authoritarianism - in an effort to make sure we don't repeat history and create a top down authoritarian system again? Really? Lmao That logic checks out for you, does it? \n\nYou're ok with just sitting back and watching these precedents being set because \"OMG Nazis are scary!\"? Nazis literally tried to kill my grandmother and send my great grandparents to Dachau and even I'm not scared enough to think that a few deniers are going to magically usher in the Fourth Reich.   \n\nBTW Revisionism isn't inherently a bad thing. It was considered a standard practice in historical research until it got turned into a buzzword. History is always in a constant state of being revised. History IS revisionism. The USC Shoa Foundation, Yad Vashem, Auschwitz, and many other VERY \"official\" sources for this history have _themselves_ done MASSIVE revision to important aspects. (Though they did it very begrudgingly after \"fringe lunatic deniers\" brought forth new evidence and _revision_ of the record became necessary.\n\n\n\"History is written by the victors\" is also a very mainstream opinion, so I'm not sure why you think I'm fringe for agreeing with the concept. In general, I only think about 15-20% of any given history is propaganda. ..but that's a big enough number for me to explore further.\n\n\nAlso still waiting for your thoughts on the Wikipedia editing source that I provided at your request. Maybe we could discuss that instead of calling each other idiots for the 37th time. :) \n\nI will give you some credit and genuinely thank you for not trying to imply that I'm some sort of secret Nazi sympathizer or antisemite. That's usually the first place people go when this topic is broached  because they won't even entertain debate.",

        "text": "What is true is that Vonnegut was a POW in Germany when the firebombing occurred and this was clearly while WW2 in Germany was still going on -- well before May 7, 1945. It is interesting that KV mentions Irving's book decades before DI became known for Holocaust denial and racism. Importantly, I do not think Irving states that the bombing occurred after Germany's surrender. But it is also possible that Dresden was chosen to demoralize civilians -- that it was not primarily to interfere, for example, with production of planes or ammunition. Still, anything that happens during total war that helps hasten surrender could be considered valid strategically. Ethan is kind of a dope for not bothering to do some basic research: even if Wikipedia is not always accurate, that the article on Dresden's firebombing states that it occurred in February of 1945 ought to at least make him look at other sources.",

The inability of Nazi troops to move through our even billet in Dresden was the primary aim of those bombing raids on Dresden.\n\nThe troops stationed there were destroyed, the blockbuster bombs put the railroad out of commission, and the firebombs destroyed any chance of Nazi troops getting respite as they rushed to meet the Red Army, which was fighting only 70km away from Berlin.\n\nThe Red Army was then able to consolidate its gains at a position only 60km from Berlin, virtually unopposed,  building their strength to 2.5 million soldiers over the next two months.\n\nBerlin was then crushed by the Red Army in a week, ending the war by easily overwhelming the 750,000 defenders.\n\nThe tactical actions after the Yalta conference, including the firebombing of Dresden, left the Nazis scattered, demoralized and completely unable to counter the Red Army's progress to Berlin - thus ending the war as quickly as possible. \n\nThe ugly aspect of the raids was the deliberate targeting of civilian areas to prevent any possibility of the Nazi troops rushing to Berlin getting any respite in Dresden, causing the deaths of more than 20,000 civilians. \n\n*But it is without any doubt that the sooner the end of the war, the greater the number of lives saved in the Nazi concentration camps.*\n\nAnd, of course, the quicker the Red Army destroyed Berlin, the fewer British and US lives would be lost too.",

All total fucking bullshit lies from the Nazis.\n\nTell me how much you care about the 125,000 civilians who died in the final Red Army assault on Berlin before you whine about Dresden's 22,000.\n\nThe civilian deaths in 1945 lie mostly at the feet of those Nazi _cunts_ like Hilter, Goebells and the _Waffen SS_ who pathologically refused to surrender in the face of an inevitable loss. It was their insistence on fighting to the last man that severely exacerbated the civilian loss of lives. \n\nAnd your point about the guards possibly mass shooting all the prisoners in concentration camps is bullshit. They _could_ have, even before the war ended, but they likely didn't because they wanted some good feeling from the Allied when the inevitable moment of surrender was forced on them.",

I have very close personal connections to both Nazis and neo-Nazis, and also _they frankly make me sick to my stomach._\n\nMy grandfather was an actual, card-carrying Nazi - a soldier in the _Wehrmacht_ who loved Hitler dearly - and who fought on the Russian front until he was captured.  His son, my father, was just a child when the war ended, but yet he was somehow indoctrinated into the cult too.\n\nMy father quoted my grandfather as saying  (translated into English):\n\n*\"The Jews of Auschswitz had the blood of Jesus on their hands, **_and they got what they deserved\"._*\n\nNeedless to say, both my father and grandfather are (or were) devout Catholics who hate Jews with a pathological hartred that is truly disturbing.\n\nThe only clue I have to the thinking that underlies such _filth_ is an *unrestrained arrogance.* Their belief in this \"master race\" concept is both blind and absolute. Their sense of superiority simply cannot be shattered by anything that they observe in reality, so utterly  complete is their devotion to their religion and their \"master race\".\n\nDespite some modern religious people trying to paint Hilter and the Nazis as somehow atheist, the whole horror show of Nazism is deeply religious, or at least quasi-religious, but has nothing to do with atheism.\n\nI don't understand what the hell was going on in the heads of those Nazis and these current neo-Nazis, but whatever it is, it is a dangerous and pathological sickness, and I will fight it wherever I find it lurking.",

I encourage you to go toss some molotov cocktails at some railroad tracks on see how much luck you have.  What you'll end up with nine times out of ten is slightly blackened but functioning railroad tracks.  Fire usually needs to get underneath something to really burn it, and big thick timbers like that are hard to catch on fire period.  This is why you don't build a camp fire by laying a log on the ground and tossing a match on top.  It will never work.  A high explosive would be way more effective.",

Personally I've always held the opinion that the bombing of Dresden could and should have been avoided, and that the Allies' conduct of war was no better than the Nazis'. I've heard the argument of 'ending the war quickly' before, but also that Churchill's strategy was not mere military tactics but also tactics of 'striking terror into the enemy'. In my eyes, the atrocity of the latter outweighed whatever benefits could be gained from ending the war quickly, as I'm not a 'the ends justify the means' person, and as, in a sense, I see the general German populace as victims of National Socialism, too. \nYou're the first person who's managed to explain the reasoning behind the allied tactics, and the outcomes of the bombing, in a way that makes it seem truly necessary. I still can't say, I would've done the same, but at least I understand the rationale behind it much better, thanks.",

You cannot tell the difference of Tokyo vs Hiroshima using pictures to show the aftermath where one was firebombed and the other was an atomic bomb. Saying firebombing Dresden is a war crime is like saying our drone fire-missions were all a war crime too. I mean don't get me wrong. Accidental civilian killings via predator missiles is one of the most disgusting things our modern military does next to depleted uranium in our weapons systems. But war crimes are not based on accidental civilian killings.\n\nDresden had transportation hubs and legitimate military targets. Whenever military attacks another military target and then cry about civilian deaths, perhaps these people shouldn't put these compounds in the middle of a civilian zone? Which Dresden wasn't. War is bad, killing is bad, WMDs are bad, etc etc. Yes we all agree. But we're not talking about the morality of the war.\n\nTo say firebombing Dresden was morally bankrupt doesn't necessarily make sense. Axis had a side that committed genocide on Jews and a side that raped tens of thousands of women in the span of few days where there are single mass graves of PRISONERS and CIVILIANS being executed that stacked up more bodies than the firebombing of Dresden (at max 25,000). It is believed that up to 60,000 or more people were killed/raped in that incident except everyone was killed by individuals and not by firebombings or atomic bombs.",

In it, Vonnegut states how it happened on February 13th, 1945, and tha they were in the meatlocker for about 14 hours because they had to wait for the firestorm outside to die down, not days. He also describes how the civilians in Dresden were digging anti-tank trenches in the weeks after the bombing, preparing for the Soviet advance. However, the number of deaths described in his book has been questioned. But considering the fact that he himself was there collecting the bodies for days, it’s understandable that he would have had a high estimate of the death toll.",

Many ranking officers involved in the Pacific campaign advised against the bombings, stating that the bloated estimations of damage and death without their use didn’t hold water, and the declassified records show that the US was aware that Japan was in talks of negotiating a surrender with the Soviet Union(in the event that the USSR broke it’s stance of neutrality with Japan) long before the nukes were dropped. It was the day after Russia declared war that Japan surrendered. The US went ahead and dropped the bombs anyway, because they stood to gain a lot of clout on the world stage by doing so, and a few hundred thousand foreign civilian lives is a small price to pay for such a huge political advantage.\n\nIn fact, the US didn’t even stop with the nukes, on the day that Japan had surrendered, (but before the surrender had been publicly announced) the US firebombed Japanese cities with nearly 1000 B-29 bombers, along with the bombs, they dropped propaganda leaflets with the writing: “Japan surrenders.” These raids were carried out on civilian populations with the knowledge that the war was already over. If the US was so concerned with Japanese lives, How do you explain these tactics, or the fact that they are conveniently unmentioned in US history books.",

Another point is the method of carpet bombing. Why didn't the allies use more precision bombing runs to precisely destroy military, industry and infrastructure instead of bombing civilians.\n\nBut your challenge doesn't prove a point. You don't need proof of a soldier or SS dying in Dresden because of all the terrible things that were going on:\nChurchill already had declared the war against civilians as necessary, so bombing civs \"was fine\" for the allies (especially since it was in no way worse than what the Nazis did to other civilians), while the Nazi-Volkssturm ordered everyone to defend the Vaterland, effectively turning every German into a \"soldier\" at least from the perspective of the führerbunker. So is that proof of soldiers dying there? \n\nSo many germans surrendered at the sight of the enemy at the late war period, because they knew it was over. Sadly you cannot surrender during a bombing run or while a V2 rocket lands on your head. War is shit and war against civilian is even shittier\n\nEdit:\nThe point is: there is a way to argue against the bombing of civilians (in general) and especially in Dresden. But none of those should be used to defend a Nazi-Ideology or to rewrite history. We should take it as what it is. It is an atrocity of war. Calling those who committed atrocities heroes is wrong, but saying the victims were free of any guilt is also wrong.",

The sign dates back to when Dresden was part of the GDR. Also, the remembering of the bombings was back then done by the broader public. In my opinion, the GDR tried their best to keep up the myth in their own interest of vilifying the US and Britain.\n\nAls Dresdnerin: super gutes Video, weiter so. Eine Anmerkung vielleicht noch, am Zwinger hängt eine Plakette, die zu DDR-Zeiten dort aufgehängt wurde, die von einer Zerstörung durch die imperialistisch-kapitalistischen Amerikaner und Briten spricht. Auch wurde das Gedenken bis '89 jedes Jahr von der Bevölkerung abgehalten und ist erst (logischerweise) nach der Wende zu Naziprotesten geworden. Mein Eindruck ist hier, dass sich die DDR aus eigenem Interesse große Mühe gegeben hat den Mythos aufrecht zu erhalten. Nur so als interessante Randnotiz :)",

        "text": "​@beethovenjunkie Ich würde behaupten, dass man das mit Liedern prinzipiell immer differenziert betrachten muss. Die meisten Lieder stammen nicht aus der Nazizeit, sondern aus dem 19.Jh. und früher. Auch werden Fackelzüge primär mit NS assoziiert, obwohl sie originär mit NS zu tun haben. Der historische Kontext kennen allerdings viele nicht. Ein gutes Beispiel ist \"Wenn alle Untreu werden...\". Ist ein Lied von 1814, welches im Kontext der napoleonischen Befreiungskriege entstanden ist.\n\nAnderseits ist es auch möglich, dass ein Lied aus dem dritten Reich auch keine NS-Propoganda enthält oder ggf. umgedichtet wird . Wenn also Entnazifizierung = verschwinden jeglicher Teile des kulturellen Lebens aus der NS-Zeit bedeutet, dann ja, kann man das natürlich anprangern. Das ist meiner Meinung nach aber nicht Zielführend\n\nDie DDR war ein totalitärer Staat mit einer eigenen stark ausgerpägten Ideologie. In der Ideologie ist das \"faschistische\" NS-Regime auch nur eine Extremstufe der bürgerlichen Herrschaft, während der \"imperialistisch-kapitalistische\" Westen die vorstufe dazu bildet. Diese Tendenzen findet man häufig bis heute im linken Gedankengut, auch wenn man sich heute öffentlich lieber von solchen Formulierungen distanziert.\n\nIn Sachen Entnazifizierung kann man sich streiten, ob die DDR endgültig entnazifiziert wurde oder nicht. Es fand keine tiefe Auseinandersetzung mit dem dritten Reich im heutigem Sinne statt - ein totalitäres Regime wurde mit einem anderem ersetzt. Der personelle Ersatz der Elite durch Exil-Parteikader fand definitiv statt. Im Lichte der BRD, wo Teile der Elite sogar ganz gut entkommen konnten, kann man sich daher streiten, ob die DDR-Entnazifizierung wirklich so oberflächlich war.",

Also, they were overtly racist (of course) and were not exactly interested in women's rights, which is admittedly a relatively modern leftist topic of discussion, but nevertheless defies any comparison between the NSDAP and modern leftists.

These grown up people-foster childs of CCCP who don't like english or can't speak it. They also say how in the middle age Novgorod have not done anything, and later on Ivan the great was not tyrann and killing his own son don't proof anything. Manipulation in the time of CCCP and in these days by different public media persons leads to bad opinion not even a view of history from them. Like Amon Goeth said we are not going to start arguing with these people, when the soviet nation that was not back then a soviet union yet didn't allow Estonia to become independent in 1918 there were no good reasons for that. Russians have their own excuses for commenting facts, I have talked with one lady who is on her 50's and she didn't saw Stalin as a so bad dictator or as a dictator at all! She admitted how her relatives had been killed for no reason in Stalins time but it seemed to be no issue! In Eastern front less than 500 SS-men killed about 28000 jews still people are so stupid that they don't make a difference between these and rest 899500 SS-men and as a subject this seems to have higher value than Bosnian war, radicalization in there in these days, what rebellions did in Spain in killing mayor  Petra Montoro Romero and his sisters Natalia and Marta in 29.11.1936 in province of Jaén, Spain.

Kaufman who lived in the USA printed a pamphlet in 1940 with the intention of inflaming the German authorities to make them reverse their decision to deport the jews to Mauritius \n\nThis did not meet the requirements of the fulfilment of the balfour agreement so they deliberately threatened the German people with annihilation in this pamphlet to fan the flames of hatred and cause a backlash, in other words jews were quiet willing to sacrifice their own people to achieve the creation of the state of israel on stolen Palestinian land\n\nHere are the recommendations from the pamphlet\n\n1. Immediately and completely disarm the German army and have all armaments removed from German territory.\n\n2. Place all German utility and heavy industrial plants under heavy guard, and replace German workers by those of Allied nationality.\n\n3. Segregate the German army into groups, concentrate them in severely restricted areas, and summarily sterilize them.\n\n4. Organize the civilian population, both male and female, within territorial sectors, and effect their sterilization.\n\n5. Divide the German army (after its sterilization has been completed) into labour battalions, and allocate their services toward the rebuilding of those cities which they ruined.\n\n6. Partition Germany and apportion its lands. The accompanying map gives some idea of possible land adjustments which might be made in connection with Germany's extinction.\n\n7. Restrict all German civilian travel beyond established borders until all sterilization has been completed.\n\n8. Compel the German population of the apportioned territories to learn the language of its area, and within one year to cease the publication of all books, newspapers and notices in the German language, as well as to restrict German-language broadcasts and discontinue the maintenance of German-language schools.\n\n9. Make one exception to an otherwise severely strict enforcement of total sterilization, by exempting from such treatment only those Germans whose relatives, being citizens of various victor nations, assume financial responsibility for their actions.\n\nThe new york times called this A WONDERFUL IDEA\n\nAnyone that tries to contradict their narrative of history soon feels the wrath of the chosenites, there was an excellent PDF posted called The Bad War, this goes through their  involvement in World history from 1848 to 1950 however the links to this are pulled down on a regular basis, luckily I downloaded it so I have a copy but this is a really good analysis of history written by an investigative journalist called Mike King so it is worth trying to locate a copy, only people with quite a lot to hide would behave in this manner !!!",

As you pointed out the NYT hailed his suggestions, and I'm pretty sure that every issue in 1940 has been archived, so if it is true, the fruit of your research is assured. I'd certainly be interested to know what editorialist decided Kaufman was worth the time of day.\n\nKaufman was known as a radicalist _at the time._ To be fair there were a lot of radicals who wanted to do radical things, including, for instance, the Bushes (the family from which we've had two Presidents of the United States) who were so enamored of fascism they wanted to install it right here in the US. A plot for a quiet coup was already in place, but it was stopped by Marine Corps general named Smedley. (Yes, really.)\n\nBut one guy is not a movement, as demonstrated every single day online by radicals of every wash caught saying stupid things and getting their mug posted on the internet. A movement involves _people_ at very least by the hundreds. Otherwise, it's more of a congregation or a support group.\n\nThe Kaufmanists did not make much of a mark in history.\n\nThere's also that matter that scientific racism, prenology, eugenics and racial purity were the popular notions world wide. (And yes, applying selective breeding to a group does allow one to favor traits, but who decides what traits are favorable?)\n\nAlso it's probably a good idea not to assume that _any_ identity group (Jews, Conservatives, Feminists, Christians, Communists, whatever) universally share _any_ given ideological notion, even when it might seem axiomatic to that group. If there's more than a thousand of them, you'll always be able to find someone who disagrees.\n\nAnd you'll always be able to find radicals and stupid people who say extreme or stupid at which you can point to besmirch a group as Goebbels did Kaufman. It's a popular pastime, but it's a dishonest argument.",

I did point out some of their misinformation and referenced Wikipedia which they then said was bullshit until I showed them how to use the footnotes to find the sources of information...and that degraded into \"can't trust things on the internet\"... which is exactly where they got the information they trusted without looking at their sources. \nThe truly disturbing part is that they felt so smug, so powerful, being able to quote something, as if they'd found the magic shortcut to being as smart as anyone else. One actually said \"now I know as much as you\" even after his info was disproved. Wow. That alt-crap is a powerful drug.

That's hindsight and not issues easy to change once training and production lines are running, but it could have been done.",

It was an incredibly complex analog computer that allowed the bomber crew to accurately calculate the trajectory the bomb needed to take in order to hit their targets accurately enough to be effective. They were incredibly advanced for the time, and were so precise, and were capable of such a high level of accuracy that they were actually classified top secret until after the war. \n The problem was, their capabilities, and operating procedures were all based on testing conducted in controlled, laboratory conditions, and it was discovered after the war that the Norden Sights had been rendered all but useless when they were used in real world combat conditions that were experienced on the bombing missions. They had been essentially dropping their bombs blind, not realizing they had no idea where they would land. This resulted in countless unnecessary, and preventable civilian casualties. 😞",

Though I study contemporary civil wars, mainly in Africa, I am a Conflict Studies scholar. And how did I come to hear of this video?  After mentioning Dresden in my lecture this week in the context of our discussion of Michael Barnett's book \"Empire of Humanity,\" in which he traces the post-war search for atonement in one of those  moments of \"ethical awakening\" that occur and that have driven the evolution of what he terms the \"International Humanitarian Order,\" a student commented on the pervasive misperceptions about Dresden. I asked him to send me this link, and indeed, I am guilty of advancing Goebbels' message! Thanks to my student Palden Phuntsok and to you for this illuminating video. New subscriber!",

The bombing of Cologne a far more culturally significant and industrially significant city killed 40000, however the fights over what became the cities in East Germany like Berlin fought between the advancing Red Army and the Germans (including drafted women children and old folk) killed far more people. In fact if you do even an ounce of research you would see that the bombigns were asked for by Stalin to prevent another Battle of Budapest where the Soviets had to fight brutal house by house urban combat against the Germans to liberate the city. This killed many more civilians and troops then the bombing of Dresden as there is no Battle of Dresden, The Soviets took it with minimal resistance in a few days,\n\nI find it funny that these neo-Nazis think that this is so bad because either way, long protracted battle or massive bombing campaign.  It’s still a shit load of people dying for no reason, war bad and there is no good war or good way to conduct a war, there is only the least worst way which was evaluated by the allies as the way to get the war over with with as little time and friendly casualties as possible.",

        "text": "@nicobruin8618 that's simplistic, the point is the allies enthusiastically engaged in bombing civilian population centres, in precisely the same way and for the same purpose as the nazis. You could argue that they initiated it back in 1940, or that it was necessary to overthrow a horrific regime as quickly as possible. \n\nHowever when you engage in the same tactics as literally the most horrific dictatorship the world has ever known, then it is far more difficult to paint yourselves as beacons of virtue (which the Western allies still do to this day, on the basis of defeating nazi Germany). Its legitimate to recognise this, without having any sympathies to the nazis. \n\nThree arrows makes a good argument in the video, and there are clearly dangers to having idiots misrepresent what happened, whether that be due to ignorance or for propaganda purposes. But there is also the danger of failing to acknowledge the horrors that the allies unleashed during ww2. If you ignore these facts, or are willing to downplay/justify horrific acts that your side commits, even if it is in the name of a righteous cause, then that that is worrying.\n\nI would argue western powers, particularly the UK and USA have done this ever since 1945. I would also argue that this mindset has made these 2 countries far less wary about waging war and has contributed to recent foreign policy disasters such as Iraq.",

We have a movement in Germany that started in Saxony/Dresden called „PEGIDA“ (patriotic Europeans against the Islamisation of the western world) And they’re marching here every monday, they built fake gallows dor famous opposing politicians and a friend of our family got horribly beaten up and had to move across the country to protect his family because a group of nazis saw him taking off nazi-stickers from a playground. A right-wing party, the AFD is on the rise and and our youth is split in either disinterested brats or FFF-Activists. I actually despise living here and will move soon because this is getting dangerous. Amercians, i know Trump is shitty too but there is something off in the state of germany and Its honestly scary. Lastly, to prove my Identity:\n\nJa, ich bin wirklich deutsch und leben in Dresden. Hier ein Paar Dresdener Fakten: Der einzig wahre Weihnachtsmarkt ist der an der Frauenkirche.

Even in daylight, US bombers could only hope to get 20% of their bombs within 300m of the target. British bombers, at least after the US entered the war, almost exclusively flew at night, and the H2S radar (which was developed to help identify targets) could really only be used to identify a city, not to pinpoint a specific target within it. \n\nEssentially, carpet bombing was a necessity driven by technological limitations. Precision bombing was only viable under certain conditions that simply did not exist over most of German territory, and especially not over Dresden.",

Flying strategic bomber raids over the length of WW2 was very dangerous and bomber crews experienced the highest loss rates of any service arms on the Allied side.

And it wasn’t as bad as the wrong numbers bandied about now-what was bad was that she couldn’t wait for the war to end and to no longer be suspected of being a Mischling, even after marrying an ethnic German from upper Silesia. She couldn’t understand why the Allies weren’t as ruthless as the Nazis, who killed her 2 week old son for being a possible Mischling himself. Emphasis on ‘possible’. There is nothing, including 2 atomic bombs, that the Allies did that can even come close to the evils carried out by the Nazis, and misinformation by those who don’t know enough about the facts nor about when to keep quiet is both irresponsible and painful to those who disagreed with the Nazis but had to live through the war pretending that they were completely onboard for fear of dying themselves. Seriously messed up and adds to the intragenerational trauma that carries   on in my life.",

    "text": "A good, non-hysteria induced summary. Thank you. I've been to Dresden several times and it still is a beautiful city, one can only imagine what it must have been before February '45 (as you correctly point out months before the war ground to a halt) Much has been written concerning the horror of that night and the following day and much of it has been total hogwash. The best account I've read (note I am not saying there were not inaccuracies - there may be but for sure there are fewer than in anything else i've read) is Dresden by Frederick Taylor. I had the pleasure of spending some time with a survivor on one of my trips who showed me round the Altstadt and the Nuestadt. As a  young boy his mother took firstly him out to the street to take charge of the family as she found them and brought them out then went back to the cellar which was filling with water to get others from the family. He never saw her, his siblings or others from his family sheltering the cellars again.\nI can't even begin to imagine that scenario but he lived it. Now I am no apologist for whatever it took to bring the Nazis to their knees and I replied, somewhat crassly really because what can one say to somebody who has that horror in his personal history, that it was a shame that which fell upon Dresden and his family. He stopped me with the following, \"Hey it was Germany which started that whole business, those who brought it to an end cannot be blamed for it just because they ended it so completely, Germans caused this to happen nobody else\". Though at one level I could not argue the logic of that it did not alter the simple fact that it was a shame. Not a thing to be ashamed of as total war means total war but it was something to regret both his personal loss and the loss of such beauty to a world quite short of beauty at the time its destruction. Until fate decreed otherwise I had a plan of retiring to Meissen and even purchased property, so have a deep feeling for the area and many lovely people who I met there. I will return for sure before it's my time to jump off this mortal coil. \nHowever I will never disparage Bomber Harris or the horror of what he was tasked to do.  The Russians in particular needed those marshalling yards at the train station ruined as any resupply/reinforcement of the German Army still fighting them would come through there. Although bombing accuracy had improved in the years from the early bombings of Germany it could in no way ever be termed precision bombing. Bomber Harris and his crews just did what they were tasked to do which was destroy German cities - not pretty, not particularly moral, not particularly ethical but it was total war and nobody should point the finger at anyone simply because they fought that total war more totally in the long run than their opponents. Nobody forced Germany into a warlike tour of Europe in 1939. Germany and the German populace made that decision, nobody else. Do not attack a dog and then act surprised when that dog bites back! \nI lived in Germany for a total of eight wonderful years, 2 of them in Berlin itself and I see Germany as my second home in particular I love the whole area of Sachsen and whilst I view the long since cleared up destruction as regrettable brought about by human folly I will never feel the need to apologize for my forefathers having brought the horror of the Nazi era to a halt by any and all means open to them. If I were German I would probably view it in much the same way. It seems there are some amongst the current generation of Germans who view it differently and would be happy to resurrect the whole notion once more. We can only hope the sane majority prevail but we have to keep an eye on the simple fact the sane majority stood by and allowed Adolf Hitler and his psychopaths to hoodwink and silence them in equal measure and took them down a one way road to the horror and destruction brought to them which they had wished to inflict on others. Don't sleep walk into that abyss again please Germany, you should be admired for your positive traits and natural beauty not the aberrations you cause.",

Otherwise we shall come into control of an utterly ruined land ... The destruction of Dresden remains a serious query against the conduct of Allied bombing. I am of the opinion that military objectives must henceforward be more strictly studied in our own interests than that of the enemy.\n\n\nThe Foreign Secretary has spoken to me on this subject, and I feel the need for more precise concentration upon military objectives such as oil and communications behind the immediate battle-zone, rather than on mere acts of terror and wanton destruction, however impressive.\"\n\n\nWinston Churchill.",

This is particularly tone deaf given that the people in London experienced the same solidarity after the battle of Britain. 2. The western allies did not want the soviets to establish any more presence in the south of Germany according to Richard Overy. So to try and say it was morally ambiguous is a pretty sleazy statement given that 25k people still died in 3 days.

The brits noticed how the random dropping of German bombs and incendiaries had caused firestorms in London so they recreated this purposefully in Dresden.  It is problematic because they knew the loss of civilians would be great and did it anyway.  Still, it wasn’t how a lot of people represent it so kudos to you for clarifying",
