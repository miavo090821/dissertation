    "text": "I think especially for young Black men, the rush and peer pressure \"to be grown\" removes a lot of the awareness of understanding toxic relationship dynamics regardless of whether its man woman or man man. From my own experience, I was sexually harassed my senior year of high school by a female teacher,who was a whole ass predator. \n\nThis woman spent a semester harassing me to try and come over to her home after school. I said no repeatedly because it felt weird, I had just wanted to borrow a book from her on socialism (yes, I was that teenager, but also super curious about history and political movements) Thankfully my mom is Carribbean and not with the shits at ALL. The teacher deadass even had the nerve to even ask her, if I could come to the instructor's house during a parent teacher night of all things. \n\nI don't really talk about this experience a lot around other men in my life, because they've thought it's funny, or call me a \"p***y\" for not having sex with a woman three decades older than me (I was about 18-19 at the time this happened.) I made the mistake of sharing this with a roommate during college thinking he was a safe person to discuss this with. Experiences where you can't really address or talk about this type of harassment or abuse create a lack of safe space for men to talk about trauma, or sexual experiences which were very clearly crossing a line.",

        "text": "Thank you for sharing. Sexual Harassing and assault is often confused with sexual desire taken too far, when in actuality it is one person trying to dominate and dehumanise another mentally and physically. It is far more insidious and complex than one person just wanting to have sex. The non consensual sex is just confirmation of dominance for the abuser. As a fellow survivor, it took me years to have a healthy sex life and not beat myself up for enjoying sex with my partners. I have unwittingly sabotaged many of my relationships as a consequence. I no longer do this however, I feel really bad for those who tried to honestly have a relationship with me before I got help. The trauma effects everyone differently but make no mistake for many abusers the trauma is their goal.\nI hope all is well for you and please know there is support out here for you. \nPeace and love little brother.",

In that in sandbox days, you understand other kids as just another kid. But, during adolescence, society tends to separate kids by gender most of the time, people start to talk about the opposite sex almost mythically. Like your sex comes before your personhood, and that changes how they display empathy. Like you here podcast folk ( no offense) talk about men or women logic. But I've found that people who have very close friends of the opposite gender usually have an easier time communicating and understanding each other.",

    "text": "Fantastic forum. I completely agree with the need for additional info in sex ed. The emotional aspect is super important. Important to have anatomy and STDs taught, but I don't think some of the most important aspects are presented. Most kids learn \"stranger danger\", but what about the predators that are inserted into kids lives via their parents and other adults. It is not say we should create an atmosphere of fear, but to prepare children properly. \nAlso, there are so many double standards with regard to gender, and I'm sure much and little have changed since I was young. I was born in the 70's and as a bi-racial, not popular teen girl, I had that pressure of accepting advances of older boys and men of an inappropriate age because I \"should\" want their attentions. When I was growing up, it was a compliment that someone older would be interested in you, instead of that they might be a predator. Luckily, I unlearned most of my heteronormative and gender based conditioning, after being molested and sexually assaulted numerous times as a child. I moved to NYC from Detroit at 19 and the people I interacted with and was friends with were all about consent, safe sex and boundaries. Not saying that it doesn't exist in other cities, but I see that mentality less in smaller cities.",

    "text": "I completely agree with the guy who lares it from the perspective of a parent to Zion. I hate the “if the genders were reversed thing” for the exact same reason as him, shouldn’t have to qualify what I’m saying with this but you know, ppl, doesn’t make what moriahs doing ok, but the dynamics are way different and that isn’t a valid criticism. I think we’re dealing with an unwell lonely woman and a young guy that can’t learn from his mistakes. Like the one guys story about his pants being pulled down on the dance floor, it’s not just misogyny/patriarchy that ppl laugh, it’s because usually women aren’t going to brutally rape men, whereas that’s pretty much always the case if a man is doing that to a woman. Neither is ok! But there is nuance to it. What she’s doing should have consequences, however. Btw not all men can overpower every woman, so it’s not necessarily physicality that makes the difference, it’s the amount of aggression. I’m be seen women who could easily take the guy down, be sexually assaulted because it’s about power and fear.\nPs: no, I didn’t watch a rape, I’ve known ppl that have gone thru these situations",

    "text": "First of all, I fuckin love your channel. What you're doing for black America is awesome! There is absolutely a lack of empathy when it comes to athletes in these situations because of their success. I have to add that y'all are infantilizing them a little bit. Maybe it's just because I'm 25 and I feel some type of way about it, but the repeated \"he is a young boy\" kinda didn't sit right with me. He is plenty old enough to make his own decisions, he just doesn't necessarily have the experience to make the right ones. People should think about going out into the real world as being born again, like everything is new and nobody is there to help this time. If the mentality around this is shifted I feel that maybe people would give more grace to athletes in these situations. In adult years they're mostly 1-5, which means they know nothing.",
