        "text": "If you know the history of propaganda in the US we might get a clue how propaganda persistents in the US ... Woodrow Wilson gave the greatest boost to modern propaganda in the US when he tried - and largely succeeded - to get Americans aboard a war against the \"Huns\" or so Germans were called pre-WWI. After the war into 30s there were classes open to the public about propaganda and how not be swayed by its messages etc. It was openly acknowledged various groups used it to sway opinion. ... After WWII, however, after the German fascists gave propaganda such dark connotations, there was a change in nomenclature. Propaganda became what is called \"Public Relations\" - today, a multi-billion dollar, multi-disciplinary industry in the US. In fact, the US is a world leader in the field.\n\n\nIf you want to read how effective propaganda, now Public Relations, is, there is a short article titled \"Yanks to the Rescue\" in the July 15th?, 1996, issue of Time Mag. It has drawing of Boris Yeltsin on the front cover. Early in 1996, Yeltsin polled like 10% or less. Yet, through the work of a few PR experts and a whole lot of money, courtesy of the Clinton admin, Yeltsin's numbers in the polls rose and he won the election in the same year.",
