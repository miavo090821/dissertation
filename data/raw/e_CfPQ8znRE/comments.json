Because we don’t act like that… everyone I’ve ever seen that is a Trumpian wants the same thing; to work hard, raise their family & live a happy healthy life free of DRAMA. We love our Country period. That’s all we’re not crazy. We want every to love their life, if u want to be a gay black man since apparently it’s all interchangeable now that’s fine. You want an abortion go for it…. However don’t tell me how to live my life if I’m not intruding on yours. As a person you can make ur own choices…. That’s how I see everyone I’m around….
