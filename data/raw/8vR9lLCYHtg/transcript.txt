receipts proof timeline screenshots everything hey everybody if you're watching this video it means you've probably already seen my interview with New York city mayor Eric Adams on The Breakfast Club but I wanted to make this video so that I could present you with the receipts for all of the facts that I tried to present him with in that interview so this is an unscheduled video interrupting my scheduled programming but I promise you to the returning members of the urinat you will still be getting Olay and friends on Sunday you should subscribe to L and where L and I will be dropping new videos of our podcast every Saturday and you should join the channel we have our own special emotes exclusive videos Early Access to videos live premieres all that it's going to be a good time I didn't want to risk having NYPD out here calling the facts misinformation now could we so here you go but if you're new to the urina and you didn't know me before that Breakfast Club interview hi my name is oami olurin you heard that oami I'mma say that again for y'all Olam me but you can call me Olay I am a movement lawyer a former public defender a political commentator a writer a Creator and what I like to call a professional loud M if you already know me you know that I am the Eric Adams hater if you've watched my magnum opus right here you know that I am a hater with lots and lots of reasons I'm a hater with lots and lots of reasons but if you knew that you were probably so confused when you saw me on The Breakfast Club wondering how did that happen and listen let me tell you I can't quite believe in my damn self I'm not going to hold you I was like nah ain't no way no way literally up until the moment he came in the room I was still pretty sure that was not going to happen because I was trying to picture a world where Eric Adams and I even were in the same room let alone speaking for 40 minutes and you know what I just could not see that [ __ ] I could not see it yet it happened so I just want to take some quick time to give you the receipts for some of the main facts that I tried to present to him in the video and try to debunk some of his lies along the way but I'm not going to keep youall too long because it's 3:00 in the morning Eric Adams acknowledged that New York City is one of the safest big cities in the country with a safe subway station yet people don't feel safe and I said that New York City is safe and people don't feel safe and that has a lot to do with how the mayor himself fair mongers about crime especially crime in the Subways and he told me to provide him with a quote of how he fair mongers about crime but lucky for me let me just show you how he did exactly that in this exact interview National Guard that there's a hyper visibility of police that they're trying to stop people with certain uh records from even using them and now you have this congestion price so how do you reconcile that well let's let's go for first of all I would love give me give me the quotes on my rhetoric because I'm I'm lost on that can you give me the quotes that you fair Monger about the Subways oh you've consistently done that since the day one of your Administration one of the first things you did was add a th officers to the subway because you claimed that the Subways are unridable you an hok did this and said how dangerous it is and you recently did that when you deployed the National Guard sister but that's not that wasn't my question Queen my question was what was my fear mongering what did I say a few people on the far left disagree with me you know many people on the far left they say Eric people should be allowed to sleep on the streets um no matter what they should be allowed to sit on your stoop and inject themselves with drugs they should be allowed to go in stores and steal whatever they want they shouldn't have to pay on the subway system they should be allowed to carry a gun and be able to come out the next day like people disagree with me all the time you the RoR earlier you asked me to point out specifically what you say a fair Monger about crime so I just would like to say exhibit a like what you literally just did you continue to say in this that New York is the safest big city while simultaneously you are the one sensationalizing the crime fact I point out fact is it two Eric Adams said that New Yorkers feel safer when they see a high visible presence of police officers around they said every we see more visible uniform officers in our subway system we're going to feel safer we got we got it oh let me can I can I can I can I PE you can talk you can peel it back we we we so we got it that the numbers are down we got it that we're back on the subway system um postco but when we see this is what the public is saying when we see the visible presence of a uniform officer we feel safer fact check a Sienna study found that only 33% of New Yorkers feel safer when they see police and only 133% of black New Yorkers found that they feel safer when they see police and 61% of black New Yorkers would support some reduction of police funds three I said that since Eric Adams became mayor we've seen the return of stoping Frisk and that Eric Adams revived neighborhood safety teams that have been disbanded after 2020 for their disproportionate abuse of LA and brown people the federal monitor who is tasked with ensuring that NPD is following the law conducted conducted an analysis conducted an analysis that having eight years ago but they're still here monting what you're doing and they said that you have brought back stop in fris policies that are worse than they saw even during the Bloomberg era but more importantly they analyzed the neighborhood they show me that I could show the show the report is available and I know it's been available to you because your spokesperson has commented on it they did an analysis of over 10 precs can't keep putting different precs it is factual there's a federal monitor reporting to judge T Swain on it and presenting information they said that yes listen let me finish so you can peel it back they conducted an analysis of 10 different precincts and of every of the stops of 10 different precincts they found that 97 % of them by the way of the neighborhood safety teams that were disbanded in 2020 because of their disproportionate abuse against Black and Hispanic people that you revived they analyzed 10 of those different neighborhood safety teams and found that they conducting 97% of their stops on black and brown people and a quarter of them are unconstitutional that's what the federal monitor said not me yeah yeah and that's fact check straight from the New York Times quoting the federal monitor's report the New York Police Department's anti-me units are still stopping frisking and searching too many people unlawfully almost all of them people of color despite assurances from mayor Eric Adams that new policies and training would end the practice according to a new report by a court appointed monitor the monitor milin denstein filed a report in federal court in Manhattan on Monday detailing what she described as unlawful policing Miss dennerstein whose position was created in 2013 after a Court rule the police department's use of stop and frisk was unconstitutional is assigned to oversee the units which have a history of targeting Black and Hispanic people earlier versions of the units were responsible for a disproportionate number of police shootings and they were disbanded in 2020 Mr Adams reinstated and renamed them after he took office last year but critics were skeptical that they could be run without racially profiling young men of color as previous units had almost all of the stops made by The rebranded Neighborhood safety teams analyzing the report 97% were Black Or Hispanic people and 24% of the stops were unconstitutional of 230 car stops included in the sample only two appear to have turned up weapons the report said study found especially troubling numbers in a handful of precincts including the 41st Precinct in the Bronx where only where only 41% of the stops 32% of frisks and 26% of searches were constitutional according to the report four Eric Adams was boasting about the programs that he' established at Rikers and I said that that was not true that Eric Adams had actually cut the $17 million for the budget used for the programs the re-entry programs at Rikers Rikers has been dysfunctional for Generations mhm I came in decreased violence putting real incentive programs for young people there but I didn't do it from a distance I went to Rikers and walked to Halls I'm coming here I'm going to see what you're going through I want to make sure you leave here better than how you got here in the first place and we started instituting programs to do so respectfully May Adams fundamentally the things that you saying is untrue you actually cut $17 million of a use for classes for people at right goes rers to reenter Society those were cut under check check out the programs those were cut under your those were cut under your Administration fact check not only did Eric Adams cut the $17 million for re-entry service programs at Rikers it accounted for less than 1% of the entire department of corrections $1.2 billion budget and around 0.001% of the city's budget but he chose to cut these vital and pretty cheap programs for no other reason than [ __ ] the people at Rikers five once I confirmed that Eric Adams had actually cut the budget for the programs he had just been boasting about he started throwing the programs under the bus all together and complaining that they weren't legitimate and that the people providing the programs for the people incarcerated at Rikers are not genuine and don't care about the people or otherwise they would be doing it for free respectfully May Adams fundamentally the things that you are saying is untrue you actually cut 17 million dollar that were used for classes for people at reos reikers to reenter Society those were cut check out check out the program cut under your those were cut under your Administration we were spending millions of dollars 31 people have died at rer since Eric Adams became milons of dollars for these professional folks to do these programs re-entry programs millions of dollars seven people sitting inside the class people have profetizo much money off of black and brown people if we're really true to what we said we want to do why do we have to pay you millions of dollars to do it you know why don't you come on rankus like I do and volunteer this isn't so much a fact check so much as I just wanted to highlight this Insanity in case it had gotten by you the mayor is making the argument that if people really care about black and brown people or people that are incarcerated they will work for free that they don't need wages now mind you this is while Rikers itself gets $860 million yearly to lock up poor black and brown people pre-trial so let's rewind a little bit he cut the $17 million just a tiny percentage of the money that he had and he did that while he was crying broke about the migrant crisis it's not that I have a problem with it it's that again the sensationalism has a lot to do with the fact that you got up and declared that we have this migrant crisis and I thought it was interesting your earlier point about the difference between how Ukrainian migrants are being received versus uh migrants Black and Latino migrants because again you gave a town hall where you were the one who gave this speech and and Inc like you incentivized New Yorkers to feel this way never in my life have I had a problem that I did not see an ending to I don't see an ending to this this issue will destroy New York City you call specific countries I remember you calling with countries that the migrants were from they weren't the Ukrainian migrants you weren't talking about them so what happens when we don't have Hold on Sister Sister I did not call the countries what they were front we're getting 10,000 migrants a month one time we were just in Venezuela now we get Ecuador now we getting Russians speaking coming through Mexico now we getting western Africa a few moments later Ecuador Colombia Mexico but also signing a historic deal with the police benevolent Association it was the third deal it was only the third voluntary contract with the police benevolent Association in 30 years in New York where Eric Adams voluntarily agreed to increase the wages for lots of officers and to allow extra overtime for many officers they're here to announce a new deal with the police benevolent Association that would do just that this is is a historic deal only the third voluntary contract with the PBA in 30 years one that we make sure our officers get the benefits and compensation they deserve allow them to work a more flexible schedule and mind you NYPD blew past their $100 million budget in overtime last year when I brought up the desk at Rikers Eric Adams turned to Charlamagne to say that we need to look at how people are dying that people are not dying because of what happens to them at Rikers but that they're coming to Rikers ill and people say well Eric you know people are people are dying on rikus look at how they di people are coming into rikus in terrible medical conditions and not getting their medical appointments it's not that they were dying because um correction officers were killing them people were coming in with heart problems problems overdosing on on drugs fact Jack not only are people dying for a host of different reasons at Rikers but the death to medical reasons are still at the fault of the Department of Corrections because there were over 94,000 missed medical appointments because Corrections Officers simply fail to take people to their medical appointments and those aren't even all the Miss medical appointments just the ones that can be directly attributed to the fault of Doc number seven I said that last year we spent more than $100 million on police misconduct settlements for the NYPD and that that number has doubled since Eric Adams became mayor just last year we paid out $150 million in settling polic and that was double the number that's double the number in police misconduct since you became May fact check last year New York has paid $21 million in police misconduct settlements which was up from just $85 million in 2021 and that doesn't account for all of the money that New York has paid in police settlements all told the city paid nearly $184 million primarily for personal injuries as well as property damage according to the comproller eight I said to Eric Adams that I remember remember his trip to DC to go see Biden about the migrant crisis because I remember the trip being stopped because the FBI seized his phone I remember you started that tour before you were going to go to go DC and uh when you were going to go to DC to B to talk to Joe Biden about the migrant crisis but you were stopped because they had the FBI had to take your phones good Lord you just make up stuff did I make it up that's that's reported the f I didn't seiz your phon sister the FBI I didn't seize your phones they didn't investigate your top AIDS that's not happening what did you just say you you just I said I remember the you went on when you were going to the Border when you were came back because some pH because it stopped I said I remember on the day of I remember it because it you got you got amnesia oh me and the News fact check and I don't think this clarification is actually going to make it better for Eric Adams but his phones were definitely seized in connection with the FBI investigation that was happening then and his trip was definitely cut short but it wasn't cut short for the FBI seizing his phone it was cut short for the FBI searching and raiding his fundrais homes the FBI has actually raided several of Eric Adam's top AIDS at this point in connection with their investigation against him for illegal campaign donations which he was forced to admit even in that interview despite his outrage and my audacity to ask him about his federal investigation but you were sto because they had to FBI had to take your phones good Lord you just make up stuff did they make it up did they search your top eight did they search the home of SE several people okay that's what I said and bonus fact those are not the only allegations that Eric Adams is dealing with he was also recently sued by a former colleague at the NYPD a black woman who sued the adult survivors act she alleges that while she and Eric Adams were both working for the NYPD she had been passed up for a job promotion multiple times she believed on the basis of her race and gender so she turned to Eric Adams who at the time LED an organization that was meant to help black people within the NYPD dealing with discrimination so she turned to Eric Adams for help and she alleges that he agreed to help her and told her that they would have a meeting at Coney Island after work one day but instead of driving them to Coney Island that he drove to a parking lot and tried to get her to have oral sex with him and that when she didn't he relieved himself in her [Music] presence brother nine when Eric Adams brought up how the media sensationalizes crime I said that it's NYPD using their own Twitter accounts to sensationalize Crime those random acts of violence are being highlighted if you have if you have 24 hours in a day and something that happens to you in an hour in the day you start to Define yourself as that entire day those random acts of violence are plastered on social media they plastered on on newspap they they're plastered on everything people begin to believe that oh I'm living in a city that's out of control we are not she made a good point though if New York if NYPD is is reposting that kind of stuff what are we supposed to think I said at the everybody got a phone brother no no nypd's page is doing this has recently been there so much so that they're arguing with journalists on there it's NYPD on their own Twitter pages that are posting and sensationalizing crime and I said this at the beginning and for the fact check you could honestly just go to any NYPD account on Twitter and see for yourselves or read this entire article from Hellgate devoted to how NYPD uses their Twitter to sensationalize Crime as well as harass journalists but honestly forget all of that because I have nothing better than what's happening right now I think think it's very funny that I said in this interview that NYPD uses their Twitter this way Eric Adams denied it only for his chief of Patrol to get on Twitter and start [ __ ] harassing me okay 10 I said that Eric Adams wants to sensationalize One Police Murder which is a rare occurrence while he has nothing to say of the at least 31 people that have died at rer since he became mayor the at least seven people that have been killed by New York police this year including a 19-year-old that had been murdered by NYPD and queens just a night before our interview after he called the 911 for help when he was in a mental health crisis same breath that you want to sensationalize me want to highlight and point an officer was killed the other day which is a rare occurrence across the United States but let alone in New York New York police officers have killed at least seven people this year including a 19y old NY officer to dismiss I'm not going to dismiss the loss of a life of an innocent person that wears a uniform to protect of the1 peopley I feel like I don't want to take you out of contents and I don't want people to all of a sudden criticize that you been dismissive of a young man being shot that's not going to work on me I'm not trying to R anything on you I'm we I lost a member of the police department the same way I go to see the mother of 11year old baby that was 11mon old baby that was shot in the head when I first became man I sat in the hospital with her the same way I go visit these mothers who lose their children to gun violence I go see them yes but not mothers people are dying rers just as I go just as I go to see a the the the family member of a slain police officer I go visit those parents that lose their loved ones are you visiting the family of first of all yes I did I held a right I I represented to visit you went to visit the family member of a slain officer no not the slain officer of no but what about the 19-year-old that was killed Yesterday by NPD and queen when he called for help have you said anything about that are you visiting them yeah the the the fact check very few officers die in the line of duty in 2021 there was a 25-year record height of police deaths in the line of duty and you know what that number was 73 now compare that to the 779 people police have already killed just this year or the at least 1,247 people killed by police last year in 2023 further at least 31 people have died in Riker since Eric Adams became mayor and I say at least because after getting tired of the backlash from the mounting deaths at Rikers his administration decided that they would stop telling the public about in custody deaths altogether the city reported the change in the doc's death disclosures comes as the federal monitor overseeing the department has criticized correction commissioner LS Molina who Eric Adams hired and his team for failing to properly inform them about a recent death and for other serious and disturbing incidents involving harm to incarcerated persons in a special report Federal monitor Steve Martin wrote he had to rely on media reports including one from the city about a detainee who had been placed in a ventilator for 2 weeks and is now paralyzed from the neck down after being tackled by guards I said that at least seven people have been killed by New York police this year you can go to a website called mapping police violence that I encourage you to utilize where they track police killings all across the country 11 I told Eric Adams that I was aware that he visited Rikers because back in 2022 after a string of deaths he went to Rikers to lend his support to the Corrections Officers I've been on rers island more than any mayor in the history of the city talking with inmates and correction officers to turn around what's happening on I know you go to Rikers in 2022 and there were three deaths back to Bath because Corrections Officers left their post and allowed it to happen you went to Rikers to express your support for the corrections officer I know you go to Rikers what I do want you to do but you keep you keep giving out misinformation fact check New York 1 reported that in 2022 after two detainees died in custody in a 48-hour period following the death of another incarcerated man earlier that month Eric Adams held his first press conference at Rikers to lend his support to the Corrections Officers where he said quote I am not ashamed of you I am proud of you keep doing the job you are doing beyond the fact checks that I'm presenting to you I said you have nothing to say about the 31 deaths you you have nothing to say about the seven deaths nothing to say about the 31 Rikers deaths you have nothing to say about NYPD murdering that 19-year-old boy and you know what he said about it nothing so that's your fact check on how much he cares about anybody that's not the police I think that should be a sufficient amount of receipts that I provided to y'all if you are still interested trust me that's not the tip of the iceberg on all the things that Eric Adams has done wrong in his administration or what's going on again my magnum opus my Eric Adams doc so if you haven't seen it and you want to know more about Eric Adams Administration and why I have the problem with him that I have you should watch that thank you so much for watching this I hope you stick around you like you subscribe and I hope
