you're all that creaking sorry greetings and salutations loyal viewers who have come out for the stream I am so excited to be doing this with my very special guest Alf Benny of the most amazing of all time tyt mashups and the reason we're doing this live stream is because it's very close to Thanksgiving we're both clearly gonna make a video about what's going on here Alpha do what it matches because there's so many clips and it's breaking news and I know you guys would like this reaction so as a Thanksgiving gift from me to you I shall be doing this without so what's up Alf how are you doing what's up what's up guys thanks for having me on I'm sure this is going to be hilarious I can't wait to get into it well you know what's great I haven't seen the whole um the whole thing like the the whole meltdown that we're gonna watch like I've seen a clip that somebody posted online I think it was Dame pesos posted it actually right and chenk actually responded to it I don't know if you saw that but yeah yeah no I did see that it was it was amazing but yeah that's all I've seen is that little clip yeah and like you know it's it's interesting because as more information comes out it turns out that we probably didn't know as much as we thought we knew about this case so it's going to look even worse in terms of the context because Jank is trying to cast blame on his political opponents but it looks like that this guy's at least identifying as a non-binary so who knows how it's gonna who knows what's going on there I saw you posted something from was it daily mail about the dad being a porn star I don't know how true that is though um nails like not really super reliable so who knows but I know I know it's not necessarily true his name is like dick Delaware just great fantastic name and I went to look up like that username and the first video was the one that was there and in the title it was about eating the booty so you know there's there's that but uh yeah this is gonna be amazing in every possible way thank you guys so much for joining us for this yeah thanks everyone for coming what happened I was saying yeah thanks everybody for coming be sure to subscribe's channel he's right at the top of the description he does amazing tyt mashups oh yeah and uh yeah like let's let's bring this this thing get in on it uh-oh I'm gonna give you an honorary black card for being on CPT LOL thank you uh Happy Thanksgiving man I don't know what CPT is yeah I don't know what that is hmm I don't know all right you guys ready so by the way they first started talking about the hero of the event that's like the beginning of this like live thing and yes this is from their website yes I am a page member of The Young Turks oh is CPT Central Pacific time because you're not on Central Pacific time well there is no Central Pacific time never mind I'm freaking in colored people's time because people are saying colored people time and I'm like is that a time no because I was like yeah oh okay that was that I guess that was a little bit both of our faults but I needed a little extra time all right you guys ready press one in the chat if you're ready to see if you want us to delay longer and be on more CPT well more people will come in to see the start of it because a lot of people are going to come in and be like oh I missed the beginning but don't worry it ramps up all right let me just do one quick thing okay I am ready to play this on uh Twitter I don't think we have to tolerate pedophiles because some a-hole shot up or gay bar frankly a lot of people trying to convince us we need to tell tolerate pedophiles seem to be happy use any excuse to silence our opposition I'm sure he had that take when it came to uh getting Roy Moore elected in the senate in Alabama no they right the right wing loves pedophiles I love it and I'll explain that in a second okay all right we love this pedophiles so so already we have like a what about this kind of situation and uh they bring up Roy Moore who lost his Senate race and I think Roy Moore actually uh won a lawsuit like related to the allegations against him can somebody tell me in the chat if that's the case Alf do you remember that or are you yeah you were following the Alabama Senate race no I had no idea by the way uh somebody's like that tyt had a fan that deleted pops uh yeah Gavin long was a tyt watcher and he made positive reaction videos to them and he was encouraged to do the Baton Rouge shooting and by the way one of the cops was actually injured had brain damage and he recently died years later like and his life in his last few years was described as a living death so yeah you should always keep that in mind that tyt directly inspired one of these guys yeah never forget hashtag Gavin long foreign but here we go so then Temple response because there's no end to the depravity of right-wing media he says we shouldn't tolerate pedophiles grooming Kids Club Q had a grooming event how is it a grooming event it's a drag show at a mind your own goddamn business yeah that's two different arguments he just made cut off one and went to a totally worse argument actually funny you know it was um yeah so first of all in the wake of an event like this bringing up whatever event that was happening at the gay bar is a terrible tactic it's horrible it's not a good thing or anything like that that being said I've heard people say it was like a drag brunch or something like that but also given the context that this person is identifying in court documents as a as a non-binary likely as of right now he had a grievance related to the gay bar and they just so happened to be having this event so tyt just so you know are connecting dots that don't need to be connected in order to smear their opponents yeah it could totally be not related at all and they think it might it is but they're instantly thinking it's like a right-wing person right who hates LGBT it's an LGBT attack but it's like it might not even be related to any of that right it could be the person like you said has a grievance with the club itself true yeah who knows we still really don't know what the the reasoning is for all this yeah also you could already see Anna angry and I like the little Chiron Tim pool is homophobia reveals right-wing hypocrisy if it's not even really right away right foreign but Temple is well even in the end even if you do consider Temple right wing it doesn't mean he's like the spokesperson for all of the right ways that's weird even people on the right will sometimes tell Temple to shut up you know somebody's saying that there's no Manifesto oh yeah there is no Manifesto as of right now that I know of but there's a weird Court filing where he wanted to change his name something like six years ago There's issues with encyclopedia dramatica that like some reporter happened to dig up and uh there's him identifying as non-binary and court documents now normally I would be super questionable about that I would say you know he's probably trying to defeat like hate crime charges but the thing is you're being charged with five murders so the idea that you're going to beat hate crime charges or that should be your priority doesn't make any sense so that might be legit it could be trolling who knows maybe he's trying to go into a woman's prison I have no idea but uh it is going to be interesting that this guy if he goes to trial is going to be referred to as MX like NYX instead of mister are you serious I swear that's what's in the court filings weird I hope they uh televise it it's been interesting watching some of these trials somebody's putting the the guy was non-binary I'm aware that's the claim that's that's within his court filings within the court filings right okay I I will I will be looking forward to this person who murdered five people at a gay bar when people are replying to your tweets about it correcting your use of he him with they them because that's going to be the most important what's up Sam no kids there concerning adults can do whatever the hell they please they don't need your goddamn permission oh do we need permission from grifters now to enjoy our adult lives is that what we need I need permission from beanie boy Tim Poole to go to a trash [Laughter] Oh my God and she said that with such like anger in her voice boy I actually like that somebody should make a beanie boy intro for example by the way the fact that there are no kids there if that's true you never know what the Young Turks but the fact that there are no kids there you should probably think well maybe this wasn't targeting a drag kids event I feel like that's not true I read I read an article with the guy who stopped the shooter who was a vet he said it was his first time at a drag event but I'm pretty sure he said that he was there with his family and one of them was a kid but his his family it appears are like adults because he's he's like in his 40s and he's talking about his daughter there with her boyfriend so they're at least you know these teenagers maybe maybe at least like teenagers and all that um so you know I don't know they were younger but you're right now that you put it in that way it makes sense that maybe they are a little older like I've had I've seen his kids he's saying that like they're just his offspring they're not saying they're they're literally kids like does anybody in the chat know the actual time that this occurred because at first I heard it was Saturday night then I heard it was like a brunch so during the day so can somebody you know just let me know hmm yeah I think it was a brunch I think you're right about that somebody sent me the the ad for it it did say all ages on it but that doesn't mean there that people actually brought children there but either way it doesn't justify yeah well if you think kids are being exploited at a certain place bringing a firearm and firing off shots yeah that doesn't make it any better you're gonna kill those poor kids yeah or or traumatize them more than whatever you think is going on there true but but also it they could have been showing you an event for a kid related thing or an all-ages thing like a flyer for it and then the shooting happened at a different time right you know what I mean that's true yeah Chris is saying that the shoot that the person showed up at 11 57 p.m and was arrested at 1202. uh so yeah you're right correct okay so they probably just dug up something about a brunch sit down Tim how about that how about that always involved in everyone's personal life and personal business didn't say a peep when it came to Roy Moore fondling 13 year old girls and molesting them not a peep because it's all about political power it's all about getting your guys elected into Congress and don't give me any of that garbage about how no I'm not on the right I'm not on the right I just spew right wing propaganda all day and all night I'm not on the right shopping did Tim defend Roy Moore I I don't feel like he did that yeah I didn't know about that I don't know anything about that somebody's asking who Rory Moore is Roy Moore is a guy who ran for Senate in Alabama and they said that he had relationships with with girls around age 16 when he was in his 20s or something like I think one of them got as low as age 14. uh and they used as evidence his yearbook but I'm pretty sure Roy Moore ended up suing like a newspaper or something and I think he ended up winning and showing that it wasn't true allegedly somebody Clinton says that Roy Moore rode a horse to go vote it's like Roy Rogers or something and people are saying that Tim Poole attacked Roy Moore multiple times yeah that's probably not true I'm not debating that he's in monstrous right-winger he's a terrible terrible person yeah he said oh yeah look on jaywalking on Progressive but you know I think we should like the all gay people are pedophiles and groomers and we should all attack them and just do all these horrible things [Laughter] oh my God this is like when he said with Cal Rittenhouse went there was said he went there to shoot black people it's like that oh my God somebody says Tim looks better than Anna uh fact check false um uh hey Sean and Alfie good morning from the Left Coast morning what's up Steve thank you thank you Stephen but uh yeah no uh Jenkins Jank is already going off and by the way I've actually pulled up this video last night in order to find that clip that Dame Pace was put in we're in for a long build up like I haven't seen the whole thing but this is really early for Jake to be raging out so stay tuned he's gonna flip out even before right oh for sure the climax I gotta wait for it we're only one minute in and it's taken us 20 minutes into so we can go to our lunatic audience and yes Tim Poole Matt washed Tucker Carlson you all have lunatics in your audience and you weaponize them and you know it I mean look at him he's I'll finish the Tweet to be fair how do we prevent the violence and stop the grooming he says oh in other words well I didn't quite like the way he murdered all those people but hey I really like the fact that he attacked these people that I'm calling groomers based on nothing I mean he said in Club Q had a grooming event it's not a goddamn grooming event you monster okay so what is interesting a drag queen Club too you gotta go back he was so excited he fumbled his word it sounded like he said Club gotta go back you know I think we should like all gay people are pedophiles or groomers and we should all attack them and just do all these adorable things so we can go to our lunatic audience and yes Tim Poole Matt wash Tucker Carlson you all have lunatics in your audience and you weaponize them and you know it I mean look at him I'll finish the Tweet to be fair how do we prevent the violence and stop the grooming he says oh in other words well I didn't quite like the way he murdered all those people but hey I really like the fact that he attacked these people that I'm calling groomers and based on nothing I mean he said it Club Q had a grooming events [Laughter] that's great oh my God I'm gonna you everybody watch out for clubview Club oh my God is like another way to say uh cement like man goo yeah exactly club club goo oh my God stop with the internalized homophobia homophobic stop it yeah now for lunatics in the audience obviously Gavin McGinnis I'm sorry not Gavin McGinnis uh although he's I'm sure he has lunatics in his audience I meant to say Gavin long the other Gavin the much worse Gavin I love Gavin McGinnis guys I didn't mean it uh Gavin long lunatics in the audience Jank directly inspired him by reporting cop stories falsely hmm Jank was thinking of goop oh my God he said it's not a goddamn grooming event you monster okay so what is a drag queen a drag queen is someone who dresses in a way you don't like are you insane are you insane damn he's amped up Club new t-shirt so we might need to do that uh a drag queen is somebody who dresses in a way you don't like it that's what it is insane now I mean I hate to do the what about ISM but I love to do the what about ISM how many people did we see get attacked because they were wearing Trump hats how many times did The Young Turks make excuses for that yeah I mean The Young Turks pop with the Covington story which was about people assuming that the 16 year old was a bad person because he was wearing a trump hat and smiling in an awkward situation where a guy was banging a drum in front of his face all right let's not forget cops either I mean they kind of have a uniform they dress in a way they don't like and also like by the way like drag is most of the time as I said in my modern day debates thing on adult performance which is fine yeah most of them for adults yeah like this weird thing that we have to make every we have to make things for adults for children like I don't even understand why most people in the LGBT community would want that I understand wanting kids to accept like them and not be like bullying other kids if they turn out to be gays or whatever but I don't get why you would want kids in like an adult gay bar going to these events like you know and and it it kind of like if you believe it's an art it kind of degrades the art because the whole point of drag is to be outrageous and if you compare like drag queens who are some of the most unpc people humanly imaginable versus like the woke left that's promoting this culture now it's like these things don't even mesh oh my God I just saw this I just saw this I'm gonna read the super chats after but like drinks coffee mug is filled with garlic butter and he stir stirs it in in gated stairs and gated Romano cheese like sugar okay okay Jake has high cholesterol somebody's like we got to get them away from the goomers somebody just put almost 350 likes there are 2 000 people watching this I should have at least 500 likes let's go yeah let's do it goomers why do you care how they dress why do you care why you don't care why you care not why do you care why are you loud as vocal cords again remember last time we did that I hope shank does that thing where he screams so loud he breaks his microphone yeah yeah that's happened before too he's done that he's blown his voice and then like you could tell in the next couple videos he's like he can't yell anymore his voice is going up why you care why you care Tim why you care I think this is where the beanie thing comes from they're like Tim doesn't like how people dress let's make fun of Timmy yeah anybody wears a beanie as a pedophile [Laughter] stupid it's funny it's like how redundant is it to say stupid and um not only is your beauty stupid but it's also dumb thanks Jake oh my God I gotta play that one more time why are you hiding under that beauty stress why do you care it has nothing to do with kids you should maybe we don't like the way you goddamn dress with your stupid dumb beanie okay [Laughter] ridiculous but he's like a cartoon character like if you just pull back for a second and you think about the premise of this video the premise of this video is Tim Poole inspired a terrorist and jenk's response to this is I don't like your stupid Beanie is responsible you don't like drag queens in front of kids well I don't like your like you're stupid and it's all so dumb oh my God oh Jesus so ridiculous okay so what is it oh should we call you groomer pedophile and they say oh I know somebody should do something to stop Temple he's wearing a beanie he's a monster he probably molest little kids because I'm a stupid baby all right now [Laughter] oh my God he's amazing should we say somebody should do something do you think do you think Tim actually says somebody should do something as in that kind of call for violence oh geez what James yeah they really they really flip the way he's saying things to make it sound like a call listen you could have your disagreements with Tim Poole but come on I mean I even think it's in bad taste when he tweeted it out to be honest it was pretty bad taste I I think there's like a time it's not saying what these people are saying he's like remembering Kobe Bryant died and that one lady was like remember his uh his assault allegations in Colorado like it's not the time for that like Yeah Tim could uh Tim could have pulled back a little bit also if you're identifying an event that doesn't actually turn out to be a bad like thing like whatever that brunch thing was because something has to some somehow the brunch got brought up into this even if it wasn't the even if this wasn't the event going on at the time of the year I feel like it is because that veteran guy who stopped the shooter was talking about that was his first drag event he had gone to himself it's just whether there was miners there or not that's what we don't know but it wasn't drag event that was going on I I don't think I don't think the issue was whether or not there was like a coal miner here or there it was whether or not there was like underage people oh uh because you know coal miners belong in mines they shouldn't be good gay bars so they should be totally illegal for them to go to gay bars because they need to be working 24 7. oh my God I gotta play more we we have so much more to get through I'm pretty sure this goes all the way up to here of him right I think about Temple okay we don't don't try to get people killed unlike you we're not monsters we're not trying to get people killed but not let's not mention Gavin long and there was someone else after gave along too I forget whose name there's there's actually a few of them there was a guy uh an antifa member who shot somebody in Colorado as like a one-off and there was also The Young Turks play defense for um Michael Force Rhino the guy who shot Aaron J Danielson in Portland like I covered that story multiple times on the channel yeah so now constantly attacking people who are gay and in the lgbtq community I'm sick of these right Wingers that somebody at the chat said how long before Sean pauses the video and chank is in the same pose as my my profile picture that's from my last videos that's another video but maybe he does the same thing again let me just pull it up so people get to see it great yeah no it it definitely it's it's definitely a possibility that that could happen and that could be saying there's only two genders [Laughter] oh my God all right we'll see Jing's getting crazy yeah he's he's ready goddamn pom-poms to the shooting listen if you have problems with uh men uh men uh men he's a monster he probably molest little kids because of a stupid Beanie okay we don't do that because unlike you we're not trying to get people killed unlike you we're not monsters we're constantly attacking people who are gay and in the lgbtq community I'm sick of these right Wingers look at it they're almost celebrating it I mean he nearly brought goddamn pom-poms to the shooting listen God damn it was so weird I mean the the irony of this is that uh Jank is basically celebrating this like even though I genuinely believe he feels bad for the victims yeah he's using them as a prop to attack people he already didn't like without any evidence and if this comes out by the way that this is like just a non-binary with the personal grievance at the bar or just a crazy person or whatever like they're gonna drop this story this is exactly what happened with the pulse shooting in Orlando that was an event where the guy was like a radical islamist people only I mean they covered it because of the high death count because it was like horrific but people kept saying it was an anti-gay thing anti-gaything anti-gay thing turns out we find out in his wife's trial that he just Googled a nightclub near me or bar near me and then he went and reportedly while he was there Witnesses said he asked where are all the women at so he didn't even know he was at a gay club and there's one thing I always want to bring up with that story specifically is if you remember early on there were people within the gay community with or one person not like people I don't want to cast a blanket that would say that they would hook up with the guy before to play into him being a closeted gay we never heard from those people after his wife's trial like that was Fame seeking attention-seeking behavior on a tragedy and those stories all just went away when we found out it was totally like nonsense so yeah so they'll drop it as soon as this and you think Jensen apologized no he didn't wait for any evidence before blaming his opponents look at his face I know foreign and by the way the idea that Tim Poole is like socially conservative is absurd you could say he's more right-wing he's maybe more pro-lower taxes now because he makes a lot of money but he's not socially conservative he lives in a compound with a bunch of hippies I've been there trust me and they have orgies [Laughter] no comments if you have problems with uh men dressing as women or men dressing in drag you know first thing I would do as a right winger is I'd clean my own room okay why don't you go have a conversation with Stephen Crowder who never misses an opportunity to dress as a woman which I have no problem with why don't you act clean your own dream Stephen Crowder never misses an opportunity to uh to dress as a woman got got it you know by the way what this is this is them saying that Stephen Crowder is a closet again yeah so during this whole thing about how oh they they never stop attacking the LGBT community or whatever they're doing the joke being that Stephen Crowder is a closeted homosexual like that's the joke that's the comedy which only works if you think that being a closet is gay is bad like this is what they they can't stop and somebody's like she's not wrong about Crowder yeah Crowder does do the drag thing and by the way it's not funny like did you do you guys watch that um that David helping oh did you ever see that Dave Chappelle thing about the dress which one word Dave Chappelle talks about him being on a movie and them handing him a scene where they want him to get in a dress oh yeah yeah I have heard him talk about that yeah now there's a bunch of like conspiracies about why they try to put certain actors in dresses and all that but Dave Chappelle is like most Salient point is I'm funnier than a dress like I don't need to do that it's a stupid gimmick yeah so you know I mean if Steven Crowder brings me on his show I will retract all these statements but uh I don't think the the dress the dress thing is uh is that interesting foreign but clearly he has an affinity for it and you guys seem to think anyone who dresses in drag is somehow a groomer so why don't you go have a conversation with your groomer buddy Stephen Crowder corruption a Goomer uh yeah we we we're at Club goo um there were goomers so let's just point out that um the argument isn't drag equals grooming right like that that's not the argument the argument from a lot of these conservatives if Anna even cared is that drag in front of kids is bringing sexualization to the kids and when you expose children to sexualization in order to normalize it that would be grooming so like you guys can't even give like a basic position so like they're operating under the premise or they're trying to deliver this premise to Their audience that the current right-wing position like the majority right-wing position not like extreme religious right is that everything LGBT is grooming that's what they're trying to put forward and it's just not true like there's a reason when I covered these stories which by the way before anyone else everybody's stealing my thunder go look at when I covered drag queen Story Hour versus every other person who does it I talked specifically about drag queen Story Hour in the public schools because I was like you know what like can we have the minimum that our taxpayer dollars aren't going to fund this right that makes sense or it's not like a place where well the parents take them there so you know what I mean like you can't even use that argument because if it's in a public school you know right kids have to be there basically and again like you know the parents taking it there it's a separate issue and then you could talk about how you feel about the parents or the people who host it and all that right but that requires a separate solution I just think the public schools I mean come on yeah I agree it's a step too far I guess but but the right-wing are disproportionately groomers and pedophiles so let's be super clearly play that again you are disproportionately groomers and pedophiles so let's be super clear he's getting hyped um waiting for him to be like where's the Goddamn play if I've seen this man in a long time if I make a video I might use this image as a as a thumbnail yeah somebody should just like Photoshop a hot dog in his handsome like all the way across I like how he's like let's be super clear but he like says it in such a terrible way that he you can barely understand him yeah he gets excited and he starts fumbling over his own words it gets funny oh this is gonna be fun you are disproportionately groomers and pedophiles so let's be super clear I mean let's talk about what do we know about uh the giant cases of pedophilia in this country number one is Catholic priests one of the most conservative professions in America right with singers Republicans you know Wisconsin oh yeah a Catholic priest said that Nancy Pelosi or Joe Biden couldn't have Community Catholic priests are the best they said oh my god wow he is getting crazy at the best but oh my God it's a weird thing to say like oh yeah there's a lot of Catholic priests that have molested kids therefore no one can look to any Catholic priest that'd be like I like you know Catholicism and I listen to priests like what kind of it doesn't make any sense regardless of of the percentage numbers it would still be a small percentage of priests right like it would be a large have you ever have you ever seen the movie uh American Sniper no oh so American snipers no way that follows like the story of Chris Kyle and he's played by Bradley Cooper right right and at the end of the movie he takes like an impossible distance shot in order to kill some terrorist that they made up for the movie right so but the thing is is like the reason why Chris Kyle was the American Sniper is not because he had like the best range it's because he had like the highest recorded kill count so it was just like the quantity of kills that he had that made him the American Sniper so what jenk doesn't realize and the reason I'm bringing up this analogy is that the thing about the Catholic Church isn't actually the number of priests that got into trouble it's the fact that there was a big institutional cover-up that the church was involved in because if you look at the actual rates of molestation and all this between religious communities it's the Catholic church is no higher than a Protestant church or Protestants overall or Baptists or Mormons or I bet it's I bet it's prayer the numbers would be very similar to like teachers no the the teachers the teachers in the public schools are are what you call are higher Okay and like there's a number of reasons for that it and it doesn't mean like teachers are evil or anything like that no it's just how many it's just the the percentages of of the amount of people with closeness to Children right like if the more more people you're going to have closer children the more likely that small percentage is going to sneak in yeah and people people go into professions where they could be near children in order to do these crimes but the reasons why people are obsessed about the Catholic church is twofold one they have like an aura of sanctity so a violation of that religious sanctity sticks out more in the minds of the American people and number two the reason why the Catholic Church gets more hate than any other church is because the church uh the Catholic Church requires celibacy from the priests and a lot of people try to put um that as the reason why they have all these scandals but again statistically your priest is not any more dangerous than your Reverend or any other religious figure it's just people who have access to children are typically more likely to be messing with children because that's likely why that person who already has that inclination went into that profession it's like if you get stopped by the police more you're more likely to have a bad situation with a police officer where it goes wrong and you get into a violent situation yeah so I'll be right back sure so this it's just totally wrong like what Jake's saying and it's a common mistake that people make and again you can look at the per capita rates of teachers versus Public Schools I'm sorry versus the Catholic church and if you want to talk about cover-ups look at the way that the teachers unions fight on behalf of their members in order to keep them out of jail in order to keep their records suppressed in order to keep them with their licenses so the church is supposed I'm sorry the union is supposed to defend its members including in Criminal excuse me including in criminal charges so they do that and that ends up being effectively similar to what we see in the Catholic Church uh I see Daniel saying can anyone see me am I blocked no you're not blocked all right I'm gonna play this next part of the video well they're the worst pedophiles in the entire country and the Boy Scouts by the way Boy Scouts we just love the Boy Scouts right wing compared to the Girl Scouts nests of vipers and pedophiles and groomers okay oh my God Jesus so yeah again whenever you have organizations that have control over children positions of trust you're going to get larger abuse scandals and I like how he says in comparison to the Girl Scouts first of all conservatives like the Girl Scouts too one of the reasons why they don't like mixing boys and girls in the Boy Scouts is because it destroys the Girl Scouts and the reason why the Girl Scouts have lower rates of offenses than the Boy Scouts is because the counselors are girls and by the way men are more likely to commit almost every crime yeah that's true though I'm almost dangerous and somebody's saying that the Boy Scouts problem is like overstated and all that so you know that's probably true oh yeah well he's like rampant den of vipers and all that you know and by the way if somebody were to if somebody were to take matters into their own hands against Boy Scout leaders you think Jank would be apologizing for this like he said it he said it's rampant it's a den of vipers and all that like he's ginning up the Hysteria and the right way he's like yes I love how they molest the little kids like that boy scouts [Laughter] oh my God that's so insane what is wrong with him God nests of vipers and pedophiles and groomers okay and the right ones like yes I love how they molest the little kids like that go down boy scouts go get them priests tell me I'm wrong you Jake you're wrong so I'll be abroad that the right Wingers don't say I love it you definitely definitely somebody's telling me to clip it if you think I'm not gonna clip this up and make a full response video to this you definitely aren't paying attention to what I do for a living tons of stuff coming out with this you know people people are writing in the chat by the way that he's doing Alex Jones stuff a hundred percent yeah he I've always called them the Alex Jones on the left I've come there for a long time remember when Anna was calling Alex Jones fat when he was standing right next to you and they're almost the same size get off the stage that was so funny I'm gonna play this one more time and the right way he's like yes I love how they molest the little kids like that go get him Boy Scouts go get em please you guys love the Boy Scouts and Catholic which you never criticize them well okay Chef reaction oh you guys love them you don't never criticize them first of all a bunch of um a bunch of prominent Christian conservatives are not Catholic and they don't like the Catholic church right like Ben Carson is a Seventh-Day Adventist like I don't know if you guys are aware of this but they're a Christian Church that observes the Sabbath on Saturday because they think that the Catholic Church perpetrated a hoax on behalf of the devil to move the Sabbath to condemn people to Hell whoa like you think Ben Carson is like I love the Catholic Church so so I did not know that that's crazy yeah so it's crazy we're gonna get to Epstein Donald Trump says he's a great friend of mine he's you know I know he likes some young well twice after she was arrested the biggest rumor it's American history that as president from the podium I wish her well yeah and Tim Poole did you say hey I mean Temple might have said something about that he might have like I bet he probably did yeah so I mean look Trump did know Epstein I know a lot of people say that there was a falling out between the two in like the 90s or in like the early 2000s and all that and you saying he likes them young as in like he could have easily been referring to what he thought were like 20 year olds or whatever that's not necessarily proof of anything but throughout the course of this like Jank is Never Gonna mention a Bill Clinton affiliation or anything like that because the thing is is like Jeffrey Epstein knew almost everybody because when you're that wealthy and well connected you know everyone like the idea that like Prince Charles or whichever Prince I don't want to say the wrong one is is uh what you call it is like some like right-winger conservative American right winger doesn't make any sense um yeah so he knew people from all over because he was well connected and I'm gonna be even more controversial and point out that everybody's like all the elites were in on this or whatever the overwhelming majority of people that he came into contact with probably didn't know anything about what he was up to so even if your name is in Epstein's book or whatever whenever that gets released which will likely be never that doesn't mean that you necessarily um like were involved in anything like this so you know I I people get people get a little too broad in their conspiracy theories also Bill Clinton flew on his plane like seven times so Bill Clinton definitely did Donald Trump is a Monster who supports pedophiles and groomers daddy right he's your daddy right Tim Paul you love your daddy he's your daddy Alf are we not are we not clipping the the you love your daddy you got to clip that and mix it with that Pink Piggy goo thing oh my God you're not saying that after her having not said anything about Jank being a Armenian Genocide denier for how many years and she didn't say anything about that or Jinx doesn't that make her so Jinx her daddy I guess right like you know sure am I your daddy or Jinx multiple um talks about how he uh he he wants to legalize pleasuring animals oh my God yeah the Boy Scouts have fallen out of favor with the right wing like 20 years ago and all that I'm not sure slowly it has over the years it's been less and less Daddy can do no wrong daddy acts well and the temple did you say hey Donald Trump is a Monster who supports pedophiles and groomers Donald Trump's his daddy right he's your daddy right Tim cool you love your daddy daddy can do no wrong Daddy can go ahead and wish Elaine Maxwell and whoever he wants well knowing full well that this woman was standing trial for literally grooming young girls and women to be molested and sexually assaulted and in some cases raped by Jeffrey Epstein but your daddy is the one who wished Elaine Maxwell well so that uh Anna you're making me uncomfortable by saying your daddy so many times yeah it's really strange your daddy I I the chat the chat also um is is very is very confused on how to feel about Anna saying Daddy that many times I'm just saying like it is what it is I call him as I see them and uh yeah Anna Priceless as usual well you didn't say anything he could do no wrong yeah obviously obviously I think this is going to make it into the super cut I mean I'm not saying anything I got I don't speak for Alf I mean yeah well I have another one I'm finishing now and then the next one will probably have this uh maybe maybe Anna's just thinking about family because thanksgiving's coming up that's okay that's okay biggest pedophiles in American politics Dennis hastert former Republican Speaker of the House Mark Foley another Republican who tried to molest the kids who were interns and pages in Congress and every step of the way there were kids who were miners that were in Congress who were eight for the Congress yes like eight-year-olds and how do eight-year-olds end up as interns for congress people I gotta get that guy's name the second guy Mark Foley another Republican who tried to molest the kids who were interns and pages in Congress Mark Foley Mark Foley who tried to molest the kids who were interns what kids are interns in Congress what is he talking about that doesn't seem right to me at all already okay so it says that he so so it says that he what you call it he had to resign abruptly according to the Wikipedia The the most biased and totally not left-wing source and it says that uh he had to resign uh for sending for improper conduct with two 16 year olds like so he was sending them explicit messages I I guess 16 okay I guess they can be interns I guess that's true yeah I mean okay like you know you shouldn't do that like he's an old looking guy and all that but I mean he got kicked out or what what'd you say so then what's the problem so then people did say something about where right wing you're saying no let's keep him like I don't think so yeah then what's the issue right uh criminal violation that happens on the left I mean obviously it does so apparently he was investigated for for messages or contact that he was saying with uh with what you call it with uh different with different teenagers and some of this was in 1995 and some of this was in 2005. now it's interesting that Jank brings up Mark Foley as an example because to give you the Newsweek headline it's or their June 7 2010 headline it talks about Foley who is listed among others as a prominent conservative politician who had a record of anti-getting legislation that was later caught in a gay sex scandal so one of jinx examples is a dude that is gay like I'm not saying anything but the the guys the guys are gay like a closet again no I'm just I'm just saying it is yeah now I'm I'm gonna go further and say like I actually don't think that this guy's a molester I mean age 16 is the age of consent in most of the country that we live in right now 30 States I don't think it is in Florida I think he got away with something because of a statute of limitations but like this this is not a peace Scandal and it's also a gay like he happens to be a republican but he was a gay Republican just just saying not the best example Jake no not at all every step of the way all the Republicans circle the wagons Roy Moore Oh Our molesters are awesome they say pedophiles Republicans say Republicans that's exactly that's an exact quote you could quote them on that oh my God that yeah that's exactly what they said like this should somebody yeah I feel like that phrase should be popped up next to it with the little Dash that say Republicans 2022 wow so you want to know what um Roy Moore was actually rewarded 8.2 million dollars in a defamation lawsuit when he sued a democratic Super PAC for these allegations which were specifically about them defaming him about sexual misconduct allegations So Not only was this Roy Moore thing not true but it was so untrue in the United States of America that he could actually win a defamation case so Roy Moore was accused he actually filed a countersuit and then he won and by the way he lost that senate seat and had his career destroyed even though this happened and by the way the Republicans said that if Roy Moore would have actually won his senate seat that they would have used a technique where they didn't swear him in and refused to see them causing the Alabama Governor to after a point a replacement so the Republicans totally threw this guy under the bus completely and they lost that senate seat and it turns out Roy Moore as goofy as he is actually did win his defamation suit to the tune of 8.2 million against the Super PAC that was putting out these allegations so you know obvious there's somebody like typing in the chat that tyt are Jews like are you stupid like Jank is a former Muslim like his name is Jank euger he's Turkish annikasparian is Armenian former Christian I think they're being trollish just just ridiculous but yeah so the Roy Moore thing is like totally wrong just just so you know oh Jesus Republicans you're guilty okay oh my God uh hold on I gotta play this whole thing again yes look at how mad he is Jake relax your blood pressure somebody got him some medication yeah how long can he he's getting older how long can he keep this up before it does him some serious damage he needs to relax I feel like every time he screams like the gray on his sideburns inches up a little bit like closer to the top he's gonna put himself fully gray now people are saying I'm Jewish I'm not Jewish I'm Irish and Puerto Rican I come from two Catholic backgrounds yeah right yeah I gotta don't believe shot his last name is really Fitzgerald's theme did you know did you know that um did you know that in Spain some Jewish people in order to escape the Inquisition converted to Christianity but still held on to their Judaism and that's where you descend from Sean I'm Jewish had my Puerto Rican side exactly all right I'm gonna replay this again it's so funny or oh our molesters are awesome they say please vote for our molesters and our pedophiles Republicans say Republicans you're guilty okay for my picture it's so close the fingers a little to the to the side of them but he's getting close what what is this Republicans you're guilty oh God it's like a point salute Jesus Jank come on come on CE more with feeling can you imagine if Jenga and by the way uh there was recently uh an accusation that was leveled against jenk's nephew about him dating somebody who is 17 when he was 24. and jenk's nephew like fought back against that and was one of the very few things they were also saying she was 16 and then they're saying she was 17 but in the end she ended up being 19. yeah she was 19. but like yeah it was 24 which is like five years apart that's nothing right yeah but just throwing that out there like endangered his nephew's reputation yeah that was like eight days ago and now Jank is like doing the same thing yeah crazy right by the way all the Republicans circle the wagons Roy Moore Oh Our molesters are awesome they say please vote for our molesters Republicans say Republicans are guilty okay so oh you don't like it does that hurt your feelings meanwhile you call gay people Boomers Non-Stop oh my God public kids are guilty look at his face too Jesus Jank it's like one of his eyes that's like bugging out and the other one's like shrinking looks like he's gonna pop a blood vessel in that ice it's like his eyes are two ends of the same balloon so when one starts bugging out the other has to contract you're guilty somebody's they're just quoting Jank in the chat oh my God Jesus don't don't put rumors of uh Jake's nephew in the chat like relax we're not we're not doing that like I'm making fun of Jank for saying that accusing people of being groomers or whatever is totally wrong while simultaneously doing the same thing in the same sentence so I can't do that and then have you guys do the same thing because then we're gonna get an infinite Loop of hypocrisy and I think the world will actually end there's also people saying that he's brown Fabio I'm aware of the nickname Devon's not here or Chen's nephew either one is acceptable and you don't care about their feelings now they're doing another talking point all teachers are rumors and pedophiles why because the teachers union gives money to Democrats so they're trying to destroy the teachers union uh Jank you unbelievably ridiculous imbecile you were talking about how the Catholic church is a total molester organization so you are bordering on the all and people point out in response to that that study after study statistic after statistic shows us that public school teachers are more likely disproportionately more likely to offend against your children in that way more so than the church that doesn't mean all you fool that means more likely on top of that even more likely than your public school teachers are all of these like unaccountable staff and counselors and all that these people that just hang around the school that don't really have a lot of supervision and all that like that actually see your kids in context of doing their job more often in one-on-one scenario so that's just what it is so it's it's not about them giving I mean sure part of it is they give money to Democrats and all that but it's also about the fact that it's statistically more likely and this is said in response to you being disingenuous mm-hmm so Joe Rogan does it Tim Poole does it every Republican politician does it and then I don't have to care about your God damned feelings as you encourage people to murder gay people day in and day out he said it he talked about how Club Q were groomers after they were after they were massacred that's crazy he throws Joe Rogan in there like Joe Rogan's like the tamest political podcaster in the world I know again Joe Rogan's super pro gay and all that also noticed that Jake was about to say the f word and he had to back out of it yeah yeah they've been trying not to curse lately and every time I've caught them a few times capture themselves I'm gonna play that again so you can see uh him say Well Rogan does it Tim Poole does it every Republican politician does it and then I'm supposed to care about your God your Gog damn feelings GOG he looks like he's about to drop a turd your goddamn Felix Jesus Christ feelings as you encourage people to murder gay people day in and day out he said it he talked about how Club Q were groomers after they were after they were massacred he cracked he cracked on that first after two he was like oh yeah yeah again we're gonna start feeling today that's pretty funny again this is exactly this is exactly what happened when we in many scenarios where Jen thought it was somebody with an ideology that he was against and then things started to come out to lead away from that and Jen covered the story completely differently so if it turns out that this guy was a legitimate member of the LGBT community and all that and he had a personal grievance against the bar then a Jank will likely never touch the story but if he does touch it he'll make a story about guns instead of this like it was just 100 be about guns because this is what happened in that like San Bernardino situation Jang thought it was a white guy and then it turned out the next day so he said it was terrorism and all these horrible things and then the next day when it came out that it was an Islamic attack Jank all of a sudden made the whole situation about guns so if it's a white person then it's hateful ideology coming from the right wing if it's not a white person if it's a black person or if it's a if it's a Muslim or whatever there was a white guy yeah exactly then then it's about the gun or it's about not covering it at all the right wing are monsters and I'll tell you right now the number one reason they're constantly talk about pedophilia is because it's going through their heads often Republicans are monsters he says that so often it's like his catchphrase now he it's it's almost once a week I catch him saying that somebody's like typing in the chat oh you said it was a straight guy what happened [Laughter] oh my God non-stop they're thinking about kids I guarantee it the reason Temple wears a beanie is because he's trying to contain the pedophilia that's in his head oh my God earlier what are you trying to harden that [Laughter] oh my God oh yeah again remember the basis of this is that it's very inappropriate to call people who are your political enemies uh child molesters and groomers Etc so now Jake has fully came around to this is exactly why the Republicans talk about it constantly talk about pedophilia is because it's going through their heads non-stop they're thinking about kids I guarantee it the reason Temple wears a beanie is because he's trying to contain the pedophilia that's in his head that's why he's always talking about it he's oh God that's insane [Laughter] so crazy man it's just what are we gonna do with Jank I mean come on oh my God sing it everywhere why because he's projecting oh Tim did your feelings get hurt you call everybody groomers and pedophy and pedophiles pedophies you call everybody groomers and pedophies yeah no concern knowing full wall there are lunatics who can't wait to murder them in your audience in your audience oh you can't say that about me oh I can I don't know I this is another perfect like thumbnail image for Jake oh you can't say that about me oh my God this is the only time that there's a hands up don't shoot that actually makes sense that makes sense yeah oh geez Jank what are you gonna do with you what me ah we're gonna have to we're gonna have to go back a little tiny bit because he's doing this Weasley thing where he's gonna accuse him by the way look at this Freeze Frame we're doing this Weasley thing where he's like accusing him but then he's like gonna back out of it for like legal like plausible deniability like that's the goal right here oh I'm just saying it's no big deal not me no of course and and pedophiles and you have no concern knowing full while there are lunatics can't wait to murder them in your audience Jank calm down yes no oh open oh you can't say that about me oh I think I think that was anti-semitic right there where Jake like put his hands like that like they do this all the time to answer for the other side like they did this with Joe Rogan when Joe Rogan says something they were like calling Joe Rogan I'll call you a groomer Joe how do you like that and then they pretend to be Joe Rogan and go oh my feelings are heard oh and it's like not that's that's not at all how these people act what are you talking about like you can't answer and talk about the feelings of other people it doesn't work that way just look at this Freeze Frame it looks like Jenkins look is uh is like covering up the ring of power right now yeah oh my God Jenkins like what would happen to Sam if he got corrupted as much as Gollum just look at him Jesus Jank what are you doing please oh you can't say that about me oh I can I don't know I don't know that if you are I do know you show all the signs of it oh my God so all the signs of it that's crazy I know I don't know you don't get food to hell like it doesn't make any sense to me to be clear Jank uh Temple lives in a compound in the middle of nowhere with no children on the compound so like the whole point of the whole reason why you should be cautious of of Catholic priests and teachers and counselors and all these people who have access to your to your what you call it and all these people who have access to your children is because there are some people with bad intent who work to get in positions of trust with your children Tim does the exact opposite like you could say a lot of things about how weird Tim pool is but the thing is he lives in a compound in the middle of nowhere with too many adults there's no children there at all and look how satisfied Jank is yeah look at his face I got him you can play at that game yeah I mean look and keep going if you want to keep going because you you'll go after Oh I thought you I thought she was telling Jank to keep going like you know like like keep going Jake we could use a lawsuit or something by the way I don't know if you know this and Stephen Michael Davis actually has a great video on this Alex Jones actually sued The Young Turks for reporting something related to this category and The Young Turks took down the video from their Channel now they say that they won the lawsuit and all that because Alex Jones kept the the the lawsuit going but eventually they the reason that they won is because they retracted it upon requests of the lawsuit so they actually did something specifically like this I believe it was with images related to Alex Jones Alex Jones had proven that what was actually or those images were emailed to him and never opened by anybody at his company like through a forensic audit and all that because it was turned over for an investigation and The Young Turks took down the video so they've actually done this before and backed out of it just so you guys know medical professionals doctors nurses you'll go after teachers you'll go after workers all sorts of groups of people who have no power and then elections so uh Anna brings up workers because I don't know if you guys know this what we needed in this was more communist garbage we needed to hear about the workers the working class I mean the issue is a horrible event at a gay bar and then there's like a side issue of what's going on with these drag shows and kids but somehow this is an issue of workers you know working and workers you know that's that's what it is foreign you only have six thoughts in your head I mean yeah we're like wow how did the Republicans underperform so significantly could it be that they spend all their time attacking hard-working people in this country uh they spend all their time defaming in the first possible way I don't think so to the degree she's saying she's saying like it was like horrifically like a big underperformed it wasn't that big it was close no it's it's so it depends on how you look at it so in the midterm elections Republicans overall won the popular uh popular vote uh because like obviously there's all these problems with Biden but in the specific key Races they clearly underperformed so more people voted Republican than Democrat overwhelmingly and part of the reason why is because these culture War issues do matter people do care about their kids they're not insignificant like Anna things and part but part of the reason they underperformed is because they ran really bad candidates in really key spots you know like as much as I make fun of Dr Oz He was weighed down by mastriano the gubernatorial candidate who was just like ridiculous and he totally underperformed Oz and he dragged down the ticket um I mean Oz was a terrible Trace as well if he had a better Republican there you probably could have you might have taken that right listen uh mods if you see anybody calling anybody like a groomer or whatever whether it's Jank timpoole whoever put that person in timeout if they keep doing it kick them off I'm not like doing this camera in the channel like it like you know like you guys are emboldened so use your power abuse it you are mod gods and you run the show Bringing Down the hammer is innocent people in this country because that's their bread and butter Jank so I mean the projection point I think is a good point because we've seen it play out so many times with so many right-wing public figures but the other possibility is this is Temple's bread and butter this is how he makes his money this is what that's their bread and butter I like the projection point but the other possibility is this is their bread and butter right now I don't know if you guys can hear it the audio might be a little low Jank is salivating because he's like bread and butter I'll take that that's funny that that hypocrisy here in the projection because it's like this is a like Temple how does Temple do anything different that they do you know like yeah I mean and you could also do the same thing where you point out about oh all these super pro women feminist like guys end up with all these like sex scandals in the past I mean people like Jake they have all those blog posts that came off as very sexist and all that you have uh politicians like Al Franken Bill Clinton Etc somebody's saying Sean signed Tim's NDA I never worked for Tim Poole and I didn't sign an NDA to go on his show nor would I and or what is was it about anything to do with orgies or anything like that true and I hear compounds and I think orgies all right that's just me I just choose not to talk about the orgies yeah yeah it was no NDA for a small faction of rabid right-wing zealots eat up this is what they want for dinner and this is what they consume on media uh Anna nobody wants bread and butter for dinner I I just want you to know your your analogy has fallen apart the phrase you're looking for is red meat what you're trying to use is red meat so shame on you Anna you're wrong fail fail and that's what uh Tim Poole and other goons like him provide isn't it amazing that they like goons or Club Club goo the geese they go to Club geese teachers doctors scientists start the average worker saying their wages are too high but they never attack Bankers or corporate CEOs I mean come on are you are you like this dumb like are you like I know The Young Turks audience they're like a bunch of 15 year olds and all that but the title of Tim Poole's show that came out yesterday involves the Disney CEO all these people do is attack woke corporations and all that and the idea that they're talking doctors randomly or anything like that is just not the case they attacked these like gender Specialists or whatever for specific things I mean Tim bull has a bunch of people he's like he has uh Luca Rakowski or radowski I forget the pronunciation I'm sorry Luke you're a great guy um but he's a huge Federal Reserve kind of guy like that's that's who he is like and the fed and all that the bankers are controlling everything they have Alex Jones on Alex Jones is like New World Order Banky cartel and all that so the idea that they don't attack CEOs or or anything like that that's ridiculous the idea that they're like saying that oh the uh the the wages are too high and all that absurd like they're just making stuff up and as for the scientists who they're talking about is fauci and let's be clear fauci has a sketchy track record and a lot of these people were very much against the force vaccinations and all the different lockdown stuff that changed over time and some of it was just enforced even though we knew it was ineffective and all that so that's not an attack on I mean I guess it's technically an attack on scientists because they were Trot out like an idiotic scientist or scientist that toes the party line in order to enforce it but it doesn't mean they hate all scientists or anything like that or but to be fair a bunch of these people are like naturalist you know like you can cure like diseases with diet and like crystals or whatever like there's a lot of weird people on Timberland's compound like are you saying you can't cure cancer diets and don't joke like that I could get I could get banned [Laughter] only only approved medical treatment not not tree roots and crystals by Crystal I mean strippers named Crystal people are flagging it right now I was joking guys it's such a sarcasm surprising at all they work for the bankers yeah wow they work for the bankers they work for the corporations I mean Temple say what you want to say about the man he is independent uh he has some sponsors but he doesn't have a big corporation like the blaze or whatever overhanging him I think Temple is like greatest like investor or greatest like business partner and I'm not even sure if he's in on the tincast thing is uh Bill ottman the guy who founded mines who's actually a great guy I actually like Bill ottman more personally than Tim Poole because like Tim pool is very guarded he's very into his work and he doesn't like talk to a lot of people on a personal level but I got to chat with Bill ottman I really liked him so like I think that's the mo the guy who's like the most invested or whatever and that's like a weird free speech like minds.com by the way you can follow me on mines and all that like you know it's he's not some crazy Banker or anything also look at jenk's Freeze Frame it's Alf look at him look at this I love it yeah it's great he looks like he's about to break out into song and dance like hello my baby [Laughter] oh my God you guys are such populous because you dress like bums wow you're so populous they're making fun of how he dresses look at how satisfied Jake is look at the smile that is creeping up on his face making fun of what Temple is wearing he loves this oh hold on hold on hold on hold on I saw something in the chat let me let me see if I could pull it up uh Tim is very cool but he is as you say guarded no Aiden you put something like it's totally understandable um let me just say that if you're not exactly how I want you to be in every scenario then no no it's not understandable this is what we call simping for Tim pool Aiden Paladin guilty of simping for temple what's behind the Beaty tell us what's under the beanie should want to be my friend a lot to the point where I'm like ew get away from me that's that's how everybody feels but uh yeah so uh just just kidding guys relax but uh I don't even remember what Jake just said oh no he's talking about populism like what like you could tell that this is all like political jargon and whatnot for them like this is this is uh this is like a political battle so he's like you're not populist first of all there is right wing populism and one of the things that right-wing populism actually appeals to is calls to tradition and getting rid of like the degeneracy in society and all that so if Tim Poole were actually this anti-lgbt person he would probably be more populous than he is now because he would be a right-wing populist instead Tim is kind of like in the middle like man here and there okay you're not populist you're all you are is glorified trash fluffers of the powerful and it's like trash lovers oh my God listen Jane can't help himself he's like all this complaining about sexualization or whatever and he immediately goes for the sexual like adjectives that that's who Jank is oh also I'm not I'm not saying anything but you know Jank really does run defense for the Democratic party during election season oh yeah after on them but like the rest of the time in fact Jake is worse because like I backed like Lee zeldin for governor right and I was like I support him I'm like whatever I don't care if I disagree with them on on any of these issues but I think he's right on this issue and then I support him what Jank does is he attacks the Democrats non-stop says you have to put in people like Bernie Sanders and if you don't put up people like Bernie Sanders it's rigged against them and then he waits hoping that the establishment person can lose so then he could say that he was right and he ignores the fact that progressives lose overwhelmingly and repeatedly claiming that that's due to corruption like Nina Turner who he backed him you know both in both Congressional runs with money and giving her a platform and Jank also failed in his own Congressional race and then he highlights the one or two Progressive wins in elections and pretends like that is a representative of the whole country so jenk likes to have it both ways he never stands by his predictions he'll back up the Democrats during the election in season but when they lose he'll be like oh well I was right I told you they weren't popular notice how he did that for Hillary Clinton saying that oh she was unpopular that's why she lost to Trump and then he was saying the same things about Biden and then Biden won and jeng never said I was dead wrong about Joe Biden's prospects for the presidency ironically 10 pools on his knees every single day servicing corporate Executives oh yeah everybody hate the little guy hate the average man I'm such a populist because I hate gay people and black people and brown people right oh yes where did the where did the blacks come from yeah that was weird all of a sudden uh I love how he's like comparing him to like being a prostitute or something like he's surfacing and fluffing and it's like what the hell it's all these like it's all these anti-like gay implications that oh Temple servicing all these collaborations like I said I just told you the one corporation that Tim pool is working with and it's like an alternative social media site and I don't even know the extent of their relationship in terms of Tim cast IRL I just know that he's close and he's done events with Bill ottman from mines James I also have to say the way you have a pause right now looks like he's doing some fun yeah and Jake's doing the fluffing Jank though has taken money from AJ plus which is owned by Al Jazeera which is owned by the state of Qatar Jank has taken a million sponsorships he used to work at MSNBC he used to work at current uh Jank is being funded by investments from the katzenberg group katzenberg is first of all it's a it's a um uh what what do you call it's like a hedge fund that group and katzenberg is the former CEO of Disney so Jank is very corporate friendly he pushes the agenda for censorship he advocates for Banning people which is what a lot of these companies want to do and like it just doesn't fit like for Tim like you could say a lot of things about Tim you could say that Tim if you believe this and this you know you could attack people like this if you want to go after their character you could say that Tim panders overwhelmingly to his audience like if you wanted to say that that would make more sense than saying that he's corporate funded when he barely has any sponsors and he's funded mostly by his audience like whatever you want to say about Tim the man's funded by his audience hi that's true you know and maybe he built up his reputation by like going on Rogan or whatever but Rogan's not a corporation uh somebody says katzenberg is the former Disney animator who co-founded DreamWorks he was not a former CEO of Disney I feel like he was but whatever I feel like before he went to DreamWorks he was at Disney that's a possibility yeah oh yeah but corporate CEOs I love you guys have I done enough no you've never done enough get on yourself and Joe Rogan and Crowder and all of them get on your goddamn knees for corporate Executives Joe Rogan get on his knees for anything corporate what oh my God we're like we're to lump them all together too bro they do all totally different things come on come on come on like what what are we talking about here like why is he going forward this specifically somebody said katzenberg group only gave them 20 million well actually they invested 20 million into their organization but uh we got to play this again because remember this is all about like the homophobia of Tim Poole that was on the Chiron earlier on now it's saying you know give us money join become a member and all that but like Joe Rogan is not a big corporate guy I mean Joe Rogan used to work for uh you know um for uh Fear Factor and all that but like he did the podcast so that he could be independent and then he left YouTube for Spotify because they gave him a contract but it was a favorable contract to him like Joe Rogan doesn't need a major corporation or major corporate backing Temple doesn't need a major corporation or major corporate backing now Crowder has like an affiliation with the Blaze and he's been on Fox and he has like uh he has more of a history of doing that but even Crowder is like doing his own thing foreign somebody just said uh Jake is not homophobic he's saying well uh no he's saying get on their knees and service your corporate CEOs I mean if you're gonna say that that's not a gay implication he even said ironically this is what they do all the time yeah so I mean if you're gonna pretend that like he's not implying that do I think that Jake is actually like homophobic or Jake actually hates the gays no but the thing is is like Tim Poole doesn't hate the gays Tim pool is not homophobic Joe Rogan doesn't hate the gays Joe Rogan's not homophobic I yeah not even a little bit these every single day servicing corporate Executives oh yeah everybody hate the little guy hate the average again servicing corporate Executives look oh my God look at this pause nah that post is great that you've got that one you had before that one was even better you moved it that one looks like he's squeezing out because you dress like bums wow you're so populist okay you're not populists oh my God by the way so he's looking populous because he dressed like bubs that's Crips if you're gonna say I I like the person who typed that this wasn't like uh this doesn't have any sexual connotations to it he's talking about them getting on their knees and servicing corporate CEOs and calling them fluffers like you have to know what you have to not know what words mean and to be fair to Noah the person who put up that chat I'm pretty sure he's just joking around like he's being like a contrarian for fun but yeah like this is clearly like Jank trying to insult them by calling them the gay adjacent which is funny based on what the story is powerful ironically Temple was on his knees every single day servicing corporate Executives oh yeah everybody hate the little guy hate the average man I'm such a populist because I hate gay people and black people and brown people right oh yeah but corporate CEOs I love you guys have I done it off no you've never done enough get on your knees again Tim and Joe Rogan and Crowder and all of you get on your goddamn knees for corporate executives Jesus Christ Jake oh my God what are we gonna do with this man turn on your knees oh my God inappropriate I've never heard anybody talk to anybody like this except for Alf and his girlfriend I I thought that was going to bring elf back that that joke but he might have stepped away that you serve with this goddamn hatred don't look at the real problem in the country all those guys stealing your money through bribing all of our politicians Republicans and Democrats don't look at that just focus on the cultural Wars and drive the hatred honestly like this is this is like brain brought at this point so we're talking about like whether or not oh by the way this is so close to your thumbnail yeah it is very close it's almost there yeah but uh yeah so we were talking about Temple maybe inspiring violence that was like the call for this and now they're talking about the corporate CEOs taking your money yeah people are saying remember when Jang said he would beat Joe Rogan's ass like you'd be yes that was hilarious yeah right I'm a fart nobody said I'm a brawler I'm a bro I'm a fighter I'm way bigger than Joe Rogan I don't know if you know that yeah Jake it's all fat don't look at the real problem he was older than Joe Rogan or something yeah Joe Rogan's like two years older than him or something yeah the country all those guys stealing your money through bribing all of our politicians Republicans and Democrats don't look at that just focus on the culture wars and drive oh my God ow so close if we could move the camera angle we would get it your money through bribing all of our politicians Republicans and Democrats don't look at that just focus on the cultural Wars and drive come on all right look look at this let me hide myself and try to do it side by side that's not gonna work oh nope nope oh there it goes it's close we gotta catch him screaming that's amazing right angry it's so cool it's so close to your chosen thumbnail from a different video yeah oh no he's saying gender in that one I use a totally different topic yeah but I'm saying it's so close to your pose for like which is from a different video the one that's in your thumbnail I have the hatred because Tim's getting paid and so all the other monsters in the right monsters terrible human beings all right uh when we come back from the break uh we've got more oh my God Jesus that was a powerful rant from Jank I mean yeah it's crazy people are like it's the same motion I know but the fact that Jinx like insane like thigh and mouth position and him pointing are almost identical just shows you like how like muscle memory he's gotten in terms of his nouns yeah that's how you know he's really in a meltdown when he starts making that face another finger motion and you're like oh yeah he's he's going he's melting down now I think we might be done with the Meltdown I don't know if there's anything on the other side of the break but I'll check or on the Colorado shooting include what's under the beady boy that's gotta stick around they gotta keep calling him that hmm all the time so tyt.com I gotta say your voice is trembling right now because of how angry you are at the anti-lgbtq hatred uh that we have in this country and I'm sorry on how angry you are right now yeah thanks Ida seems odd right to say that and it's like gonna read some tweets I wanna I wanna see the tweets that she's gonna read she has her phone we do let me read what Beanie boy said on his Twitter today I've I've never seen this part of the video at all I didn't even know it continued by the way Jake looks pissed already went in yeah he does she said he's gonna wait for it or I don't know some statement that you make that's misconstrued by the left were they uh all of a sudden paint you as a right winger who's not in favor of the lgbtq community because that's coming well that always happens it doesn't matter it doesn't matter it doesn't matter what you say everybody has an agenda and they're going to push that agenda with nothing but lies and we've now oh my God they were coming back and they're like did you know that somebody on the left is going to take you out of context in relation to the LGBT community to pretend like you hate the gays mm-hmm that's what they come back to after jinxed all of that does that oh my God Jesus Christ wow just when you thought irony couldn't get any more irony ironically yeah gone through that 200 times come for me bro come for me and I'll deal with it and I'll beat them back right wing left wing Anna's just so rude texting yeah the corporate rule which is the number one problem in America they all come for us and we beat them back with your help all right look now we're trying to help other people I want to tell you about that give us money no it's like some like we want water in like a different part of the country these are like the adverts all right is that it there's got to be another tweet she's gonna read them to piss him off keep hope alive man okay so then they go to the break Community Mourns [Music] hanging out with you guys well we we are learning more about oh okay this this seems like oh what was going on a tick litter throat what was going on between segments huh fluffing the for the corporation possibly cool oh my God denounce and reject who knows oh we're learning more about these all right so I mean I'm not gonna make fun of them talking about oh my God look at this pause that's great in the face she looks stoned actually tube account was created under his name before he changed it okay so yeah I think that's it that was good though Club goo yeah all right so they're talking about his uh his YouTube stuff and all that YouTube channel or the YouTube channel was created under his name by the people who had been bullying him okay so they're talking about the bullying thing I mean that's interesting I'll probably watch that later but that doesn't seem like it's a part of the whole uh thing make a fun of the Meltdown thing somebody said what happened to my gay buddy Mike Harlow he's so he's still doing content and all that and I would have him on streams when he's available I just didn't ask him I asked out because Alf does tyt stuff yeah for sure yeah let's see if Jake gives us any more Rage or if he's gone down and then we'll I'll read the super chats and rapidly stick please was he mentally healthy of course not right like everybody knows that but that's not the only part of the equation whenever the right wing wants you to stop talking about anything hateful that they're doing supporting uh assault weapons all across the streets that are getting everybody in America killed including our kids or they want to attack the gay community call them groomers and pedophiles Etc and then get them killed they'll always go back it's just so it's a mental health mental health by the way they will then turn around and vote against measures that would increase funding for mental health let me just note uh the last okay he's on his like normal rant I think I'm good yeah but uh sounds good yeah but uh that that was that was some fun stuff I'll probably do a video where I break break it down and actually look into the claims that Jake made although they're not very substantive and I figured this would be a nice little treat before Thanksgiving you know for you guys out there uh everybody removed I was gonna say everybody remember to go subscribe to alf's channel he does the most amazing mashups of all time it is linked in the top of the description I got a new one coming up probably today later today very cool very I Disturbed his editing for this yeah yeah actually I was working on the outro right when he told me you know it's like all right let's take a break from that all right all right I'm gonna go through these uh supers let me make this screen bigger so that way you know the like improve the zoom so I could see better all right let's see where are we I'll say words so there's no dead air it's done yeah uh it's so fun to watch these late guys freak out jenk is so predictable too with his freakouts and he says the same things over and over again yeah you know I I I stepped away for a second I came back and you were talking about how he said the den of vipers yeah and the video I'm working on he says from like a video a segment they did last week and it's like they just repeat the same phrases I mean basically like Young Turks videos are on autopilot at this point yeah yeah it's really funny I do you think that they're playing into the outrage because they know it gets them like hate clicks they have I think at some point they do you know they never like strike channels and stuff like that rarely do they like do any you know they they could if it bothered them they really could probably do something about it you know on YouTube but they don't and I think that helps that's part of the that brings attention to us kind of thing right I do think a reputation for a bad copyright because they are like YouTube based originally I think a reputation for copyright like fraud and claims and all that would really hurt them but it is true like I alter the tyt videos like in my edits for fun not to be like the algorithm like John Oliver you know Warner Brothers is notorious for this like I'll alter that so it doesn't get Content ID but tyt doesn't Content ID but in the end as fans of fair use anyway it's always fun to play around with clips and stuff all right so let me read some of these uh mace fell out of the window good name uh says I'm going to give you an honorary black card for being on CPD we determined that is color people time LOL Happy Thanksgiving thank you Mace uh quiet rioter Temple is right wing if Temple is right wing then the Armenian Genocide didn't happen then again Jake this is Jake we're talking about yep uh Derby wormy

arai like face recognitions someone can make one of those uh someday the detail posted on YouTube foreign T is looking for attention they try to get that the attention of Rogan and now pool tyt are a bunch of hypocrite hacks who got sued for racial discrimination and was caught union busting in their own company I did Cover the racial discrimination suit I don't know if I fought that guy let's not forget also why Jake got booted out of Justice Democrats too right yeah for his first old blog post yeah but uh and like there's like a code in there he's like there's like a sea of there's like a sea

person get over it Joe get over it yeah it was getting over he's getting nuts on that one uh Sam Valley for I'm not going to read the the British amount uh five dollars it looks like I don't know why I'm doing this again um so Jank is against it sir Jank is against pedo whatever uh anyone know his stance on bestiality yeah we've all seen those videos it's okay if you pleasure the animal as long as

watched the full thing you probably should make Club goo shirts we need to capitalize on that yeah do the next big hit uh just Giovanni's room I have to wait Johnny Rochelle says they forgot to mention Club Q is actually an Annex of a gay bath house and despite that they hold drag shows every Sunday I'm I I don't know that to be true but that's interesting I guess because like gay places were kind of uh more like underground that maybe they ended up getting a bar after that like you know like I guess I I don't think that just because your business starts out in one way it's inherently that way forever like I would think that with like the the the dating apps like Tinder and the the gay Tinder which is like grinder I would think that um you know you don't have to go to those like Anonymous places right off yeah I don't go to those at all never oh it's kind of I was trying to lure you in and be like well you would know now I just go to orgies and compounds inside he's about not
