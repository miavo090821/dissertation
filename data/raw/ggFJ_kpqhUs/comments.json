They do this, according to Jones, because they believe it gives them access to the knowledge of demons, as in it puts them into a state where they can reach these things in their dreams to contact and learn from them. Again, according to Jones, they believe that this is how they've learned a great deal of what they have about technology, science, medicine, knowledge of the future, etc, and the funny thing is, people have been talking about this stuff since the middle ages, if not earlier. There are all sorts of magical grimoires written with directions not just about how to contact demons, but how to contact specific demons to learn specific things. As soon as I heard Jones explaining this, I thought to myself, 'yeah, I know that exact ritual from the Lesser Key of Solomon.' Jones has said on other peoples' shows, explicitly, that he believes the people who believe this stuff, are crazy.\n\nThat said, he has also said things that are meant to be an explanation for something when he was talking to another person, one of those being \"well, that's because lobsters are psychic.\" Personally, I don't think he was being serious when he said that, and the reason I say that, is because of the context of that specific podcast. Jones had a grin on his face, and the conversation was perfectly normal until he decided to take it into the realm of weird, and the delivery of the line was ideally suited for comedic effect. Can't say for sure though. Maybe he was being serious.\n\nLastly, I'd like to leave you with this. A _lot_ of people believe demon possession is a real thing, even in the developed Western world. That doesn't make them nutjobs, unless you believe anyone who practices a typical religion is crazy. Say Jones' above description of DARPA's activities (that was the group he accused specifically of the DMT thing), if your average Christian saw that, and realized what they were doing, would it really be so crazy for that Christian to conclude something like 'these people are trying to contact demons to gain knowledge from them, this is literal demon possession/worship?' Jones has said before that he is a Christian, so given that, even if he were to believe in the demon possession thing, which again, I don't believe he does based on other things he has said, I don't think it would be that crazy for him to see that and conclude 'demon possession.'",

        "text": "@Eric Nunya Fair warning, this is going to be long, but I think you need to hear this.\n\n\"Well. I was misinformed then, and owe Alex Jones yet another apology.\n\nAt this point, I should just assume everything I've heard Alex Jones say that was crazy was clipped out of context in some way.\"\n\nWell, by his own admission. . . he's kind of retarded. But yes, if you want to understand Alex Jones, or anyone really, it pays to engage with their larger body of work, because even 'in-context' clips can be misconstrued if you don't understand their larger body of work. One my favorite examples of this is Nietzsche's 'God is dead' famous quote. it's hard to blame Christians, for example, for misunderstanding that and vilifying Nietzsche for saying that, when atheists took it and ran with it first, also misunderstanding what he said. Sure, knowing the full quote helps, what was most holy has bled to death under our knives, what sacred games will we have to invent, blah blah blah so on and so forth, but things really come into focus only after reading several of his books and understanding that Nietzsche believed many things that were directly in line with what I would describe as 'source-doctrine' for Christianity, with a primary focus on the notion that \"For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, is working for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory,\" a sentiment which seemed to guide his every thought and argument. Nietzsche believed that all pain and suffering was ultimately not to be shunned, but cherished as precious gifts the same as the 'good' parts of life, and even that full quote takes on new meaning in that light. In other words, Nietzsche didn't believe that the 'problem of evil' went away if you took God out of the equation. It only gave unsatisfied people someone to blame. The real problem, was viewing parts of life as 'evil' to begin with, and that he believed, would destroy the world, made clear when he said, \"The Christian resolution to see the world as ugly and bad is _making_ the world ugly and bad.\" People who are like lightning rods, or as Nietzsche would put it, a lit stick of dynamite, are magnets for that kind of misunderstanding.\n\n\"And, yeah, I consider actually religious people to be... mentally disconnected from reality, let's say.\"\n\nOr mistaken about reality. 'Disconnected' is not the word I would use.\n\n\"Actually believing the metaphysics to be literally true makes you think you're immune to snake bites.\"\n\nNot necessarily. It depends on the particulars of those metaphysics. I'm not saying people like that aren't out there, but a lot of people like that, depend on spurious reasoning even when appealing to their own sources. Since we're using snake handlers as an example, this is a common belief in certain branches of Pentecostal churches, mainly in the Appalachia region of America. They source their argument from a passage in the gospel of Mark, essentially an assurance that should they be put under threat of certain things, they won't be harmed, and probably point to the apostle Paul's experience getting bitten by a snake and not dying, later on the in the New Testament.\n\nNow, I'm going to be honest; I've seen and been a part of things I do not have the capacity to explain given my current knowledge of natural science, so I'm not even going to begin to make claims like 'this is a miracle' or anything like that. I will simply describe something that happened to me once and you can decide for yourself what you think about it. Back when I was much younger, I was in a building with a bunch of other young people, most of whom were ostensibly Christian, and the reason for my use of the qualifier will become clear shortly. We didn't _do_ ecstatic mystic experiences. We were all normal, buttoned-down, anti-holy-roller, 'normal' Christians. On a whim, a lot of us decided we'd stick around after service, just to hang out and talk for a bit, so we went to the top floor of the building to get out of everyone's way. None of us had anything weird to eat or drink, drugs weren't pumped into the air, nobody had any kind of agenda, there wasn't even any church leadership involved in this. Well, out of nowhere, as we were just hanging out, chilling, and talking, we were all struck with the same extreme hallucination at once. The building's top broke open, something like an angelic-looking being descended, and we all heard it speak. Apparently, I only found this out later, there was an earthquake that occurred at that time, which would explain why we all heard the windows rattling like they were getting ready to break.",

        "text": "@Eric Nunya At the time, this was all very new to me, so I randomly cracked open my fresh new bible and went straight to the book of Acts, straight to the story where the apostles, and I quote, \"ascended to the upper room of the building,\" and were filled with tongues of fire and, to use their verbiage, \"received the holy spirit.\" I read that, thought to myself, 'yeah, this sounds like that.' There were many other things that happened after that, most of which I can't reproduce or replicate, but what was most interesting to me, as that most of us had a reaction resembling 'holy shit it's all real.' There were children of the church leadership that were there, and for some strange reason, they did their best to try to flat-out cover that event up. People who talked about it, got aggressively shushed, then shunned, and ultimately driven out. There were only a few people there that were sympathetic, but one thing that was common, one of those things that happened after that, was that any time I talked with the people involved about anything related to the biblical text, none of us needed to reference anything, and we each knew what the other was talking about, even things I hadn't read yet. That probably isn't very clear; I mean we all functionally had perfect recall of the biblical text, no matter how obscure the passage, and whenever one of us was about to make a point about the relevant passage in question, someone else would stop them and make their exact point for them. Anyone who wasn't part of that event, save for a few, found that very, very unnerving and told us so, and it wasn't long before my former friends and I had that experience, started denying it had happened, publicly. In private, they still acknowledged what we all saw, what we all heard, but they started denying that they had had that experience when around anyone who wasn't part of it. I never denied it, but I stopped even mentioning it at all some years ago, until now.\n\nNo, I didn't record it. No, I'm not going to pretend I know how to summon angels or any other weird shit like that. No, I _definitely_ can't replicate it, no I'm not trying to convert you into believing anything (In fact, if by some dark twist of fate I discover that you decided to adopt some kind of weird belief system because you heard this story, I'm going to be extremely unhappy, one reason I don't talk about this hardly ever, please, do not make me responsible for that), no I am not even going to begin to pretend to know why or how that happened. The _entire_ reason I told you all of this, is to make the point that it is _easy_ to fall into thinking, or believing, a certain way because of particular experiences, due to the pattern-recognition mechanisms our psychology has evolved, and that having experienced something does not equate to any real understanding of the thing experienced. Unlike the snake handlers, I experienced the thing, and found an explanation later. I didn't come at this in reverse order, and I sure as shit wasn't trying to replicate something I _thought_ I read about in some old sacred text. Based on what I know, I suspect that experience amounted to more than just a collective delusion, but even given that stance, I'm not reading anything into that experience, I'm just taking it for what it was, and _that_ is where those snake handlers are in error, not exercising even a small amount of epistemological humility in their own reading or understanding of a text that was likely a translation of a translation of a translation, and, if you believe, of something made in spirit that can only ever be, at best, imperfectly brought into material reality because creation is imperfect.\n\n\"Playing along with religious tenants and traditions and the community building has tremendous psychosocial benefits.\"\n\nUntil those religious tenants start prescribing things like snake handling, because those tenants _come_ with the metaphysics. You can't have one without the other, because the metaphysics justify the tenants. Other people, in some parts of the world, literally crucify themselves in imitation of Jesus as some kind of annual event. I'm not going to quibble with you over whether or not that, or snake handling, is biblical (they're definitely not, but that's not the point), because whether or not those things are _biblical_ is irrelevant to what I'm about to ask you; how do you think those various people distinguish between religious traditions? Why do you think Christianity, just Christianity, looks so very different in different parts of the world? Do you think that has anything to do with theology or metaphysics of either the bible or the teaching based on it? If you know anything at all about evolutionary psychology, then your answer should be a resounding 'no.' People don't handle snakes because they're fundamentalists who adopt a literal interpretation of the Christian theology and cosmology, they're snake handlers because they were raised to be snake handlers, by people who were, in turn themselves, raised to be snake handlers, following religious tenants passed down by their community. Where did snake handling start, and why? See my previous point about a lack of epistemological humility. You can believe everything in the bible to be completely literally true and accurate and still not believe that just because you were promised that God would protect you if snakes came after you and tried to kill you, that you can grab an angry copperhead by the midsection and you won't pay for it with your life, because the protection that Paul had in that story, his circumstances looked very, very different from what those people are trying to generate, nor does that necessarily mean that Jesus was talking about _those instances in Appalachia in particular_ when he said his disciples would pick up snakes and not be bitten.\n\nMy personal experience with religious tenants, vs. literal belief in metaphysics, has not been as you describe. It has, in fact, pretty much been the opposite. People who hold to their tenants and not the metaphysics, produce hollow, twisted imitations of what any religious tradition is supposed to be, which winds up leaving people directionless and confused as to why they're even there in the first place. It means when you go out and 'spread the gospel,' people will lie to you to get you to leave them alone (ask me how I know), and then the 'evangelists' will go back and report the liars as 'newly saved,' and call them up a week later trying to harass them into the sanctuary building on Sunday morning, and maybe hand over some money if they're really slick speakers. It produces disgusting, manipulative hypocrites that say things like \"we've gotta get 'em lost before we can get 'em saved,\" in response to people asking why we're cutting bible verses in half to make them say the opposite of what they mean, like in James 2:13a, \"For judgment is without mercy.\" If you've read your bible, you know that the second half of that verse was cut off, and that it actually says, \"For judgment is without mercy to them that show no mercy; mercy triumphs over judgment.\" Pretty sure I remember something else seared into my eyeballs by that hallucination, something about what's supposed to happen to people who cut off chunks of significant meaning of biblical text like that. . . probably just my brain doing weird shit again, right? Genuine belief in the espoused supernatural reality of any given religious tradition, tends to produce people who are a lot more sincere in any of their dealings related to that belief, and thus, a lot less people victimized by lies. I'd rather burn any kind of religion from the whole world than participate again in insincerity like that.",

        "text": "@readilium3432  It's the way they advertise these things and then act like we're the bad people. They try to tell everyone and their mother on the Internet and around the city that they're so proud of these drag events that involve children. Then finally the day comes where they're supposed to have the show and something really nasty and really bad happens and On one hand you had a library advertising a rainbow dildo monkey person and then issuea public apology only because everybody showed up asking why the fuck would you advertise this to children?  The thing is that we didn't threaten that it was going to happen but we said and warned that eventually someone is gonna try to take very serious physical action.  I think advertising drag Queen shows for children is very inappropriate but but I don't think that means that anyone deserves to get killed by a mass shooter.  Unfortunately with every issue you sometimes get a person who overreacts to an insane degree B and luckily we had some free thinkers and gun slinging Americans around.  I will admit 100% that some transgender people are incredibly attractive and you would probably never know that they are a transgender person unless you asked them.  At the same time I think it's absolutely disgusting when I see a TikTok video made by a transgender person saying I don't know if I want to tell that guy that I'm a transgender person and maybe I'll just let him think that I'm a woman. Then they asked the question why do men try to kill or beat up transgender people when they have sex with them and find out that they are transgender individuals who still has a penis?  The answer is that when they met on tinder this person was under the influence of thinking that they might be going on a date with a woman this person was under the influence that they might be having sex with a woman and then yeah whipped out your d*** that was bigger than his.  It is a fact that transgender women have been killed because they didn't reveal that they were transgender until after they revealed their penis right before the moment that sex was about to occur Meaning that the panties came down the d*** came out and that's how this person found out you are a transgender and then try to kill you promptly. Unfortunately these are real horror stories that really do happen which is why it's important to know what you are doing with your life and the decisions that you make with your life and the consequences of those decisions and how you can survive in a world the way it is while making the decisions you make in your life. These people wanted to advertise drug Queen shows to children and they had to face the consequences that an insanely crazy guy decided to shoot up the place because he hated it more than everyone else in the world.",
