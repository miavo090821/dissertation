They changed to a more mainstream ad campaign that was more \"inclusive\" (the Left loves that, don't they?) of a larger demographic and they've rebounded amazingly. Their stock was less than $9 a share IIRC right before the ad campaign dropped, and is now $23 a share. They've also greatly increased their EPS and they now have a positive cash flow.\nIf the Left had purchased their products, they would have continued targeting them with their ads. They just learned that whether or not they kowtow to the Left, the Left isn't buying their stuff, so why should they cry all the way to bankruptcy court?",
