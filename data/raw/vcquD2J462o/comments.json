They finally changed course, not to rage bait, not to offend the Left, but to stay solvent. They catered to the Left and the Left didn't buy their products. They changed to a more mainstream ad campaign that was more \"inclusive\" (the Left loves that, don't they?) of a larger demographic and they've rebounded amazingly. Their stock was less than $9 a share IIRC right before the ad campaign dropped, and is now $23 a share. They've also greatly increased their EPS and they now have a positive cash flow.\nIf the Left had purchased their products, they would have continued targeting them with their ads. They just learned that whether or not they kowtow to the Left, the Left isn't buying their stuff, so why should they cry all the way to bankruptcy court?",

People point to dogs (royal families, and royalty wannabes as you did), which we foolishly bred too close to each other. Then you act as if that is just how it works for the populations of tens of thousands right on up through billions. If that were true, then every species is destined to wipe itself out. That should have happened for humans millions of years ago, when our species was small young and genetically much more similar than it is today.\n\nAdditionally, eugenics is about finding those maladies and preventing individuals with them from breeding especially with people that do not have detrimental maladies. This prevents harmful mutations from continuing to weaken the gene pool.",
